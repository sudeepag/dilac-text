            PREFACE.
            BEFORE the Civil War, I had for several years been a regular contributor to the NEW
               YORK LEDGER. During that great conflict I had almost entirely ceased writing for it.
               But when the war was closed, I was not unwilling to seek rest or relaxation from the
               exhausting excitement of public affairs, by turning my mind into entirely new
               channels of thought and interest.
            In this mood I received Mr. Bonner's proposal to write a story for the LEDGER. Had it
               been a request to carve a statue or build a man-of-war, the task would hardly have
               seemed less likely of accomplishment. A very moderate reader, even, of fictions, I
               had never studied the mystery of their construction. Plot and counterplot, the due
               proportion of parts, the whole machinery of a novel, seemed hopelessly outside of my
               studies. But after-considerations came to my relief. I reflected that any real human
               experience was intrinsically interesting; that the life of a humble family for a
               single day, even if not told as skilfully as Wordsworth sung the humble aspects of
               the natural world, or as minutely faithful as Crabbe depicted English village-life,
               could hardly fail to win some interest. The habit of looking upon men as the children
               of God and heirs of immortality, can hardly fail to clothe the simplest and most
               common elements of daily life with importance, and even with dignity. Nothing is
               trivial in the education of the King's Son!
            By interesting my readers, if I could, in the ordinary experiences of daily life
               among the common people, not so much by dramatic skill as by a subtle sympathy with
               Nature, and by a certain largeness of moral feeling, I hoped to inspire a
               pleasure which, if it did not rise very high, might, on that account, perhaps,
               continue the longer. I had rather know that one returned again and again to parts of
               this most leisurely narrative, than that he devoured it all in a single passionate
               hour, and then turned away from it sated and forgetful.
            I can only wish that all who use the pen might fall into hands as kind, as
               considerate, and as forbearing, as I have. Norwood was mostly written in Peekskill.
               There is not a single unpleasant memory connected with it. It was a summer-child,
               brought up among flowers and trees.
            When the last sheet of the manuscript of Norwood was ready for the press, I sent the
               following letter with it:
            
               "MY DEAR MR. BONNER:—You have herewith the last line of Norwood. I began it
                  reluctantly, as one who treads an unexplored path. But as I went on, I took more
                  kindly to my work, and now that it is ended I shall quite miss my weekly task.
               "My dear old father, after his day of labor had closed, used to fancy that in some
                  way he was so connected with me that he was still at work; and on one occasion
                  after a Sabbath-morning service, some one in a congratulatory way said to the
                  venerable and meek old patriarch:
               "'Well, Doctor, how did you like your son's sermon?'
               "'It was good—god as I could do myself.' And then, with an emphatic pointing of
                  his forefinger, he added, 'If it hadn't been for me, you'd never have
                  had him!'
               "If any body likes Norwood, my dear and venerable Mr. Bonner, you can poke him
                  with your finger and say, 'If it hadn't been for me, you would never
                  have had it.'"
            
            No one can imagine how true is the last paragraph of the letter above. To all the
               other pleasant associations of Norwood, Mr. Bonner has, by his more than fraternal
               kindness, added the highest and most enduring charm of a generous friendship.

               CHAPTER I.
               INTRODUCTION.
               SINCE the introduction of railways, thousands of curious travellers, every summer
                  have thronged New England, have seen its manufacturing villages, and admired its
                  general thrift. But those who know its scenery only by the river-valleys, know
                  little of it; and those who have seen its people only in cities, are little
                  acquainted with New-England character.
               Men speak of Yankee character, as if there was but one type which pervaded New
                  England. It is true, that there are some few marks which New-England men have in
                  common. But the differences are greater than the likenesses. Nowhere else in the
                  nation are men so differentiated. The loose structure of Southern society gave to
                  its citizens an appearance of greater personal freedom; and in the great Western
                  States various causes have produced far more freedom of manners and more frankness
                  and spontaneous geniality. Yet it will be found that neither in the South nor in
                  the West is there no large a proportion of the population which is original,
                  contrasted, and individualized in taste, manners and opinions, as in New England.
                  If we should enjoy a scientific method, and speak of a Western genus, and a
                  Southern genus, and a Middle State genus, then it will be found that none, nor
                  all, are so rich in species as the genus New
                  England.
               The scenery of New England is picturesque rather than grand. Scarcely any other
                  excursion could be planned which would so well fill a summer vacation, as one
                  which, winding leisurely up through the
                  western portions of Connecticut, of Massachusetts, and of Vermont, reached a
                  climax at St. Albans, on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain; a place in the midst
                  of greater variety of scenic beauty than any other that I remember in America. On
                  the east rise the successive masses of the White Mountain, seemingly close at
                  hand; on the west is Lake Champlain, swarming with green islands, and beyond its
                  waters, westward, rise the Adirondacs, not in chains or single peaks, but in vast
                  broods, a promiscuous multitude of forest-clothed mountains. On the north is
                  scooped out in mighty lines the valley of the St. Lawrence; and, in clear days,
                  the eye may spy the faint glimmer of Montreal.
               Such a ride from New Haven to St. Albans, from Long Island Sound to Lake
                  Champlain, can scarcely be matched for the charms of its scenery, the number and
                  beauty of its villages, for the general intelligence and culture of its people,
                  for the universal thrift following universal industry, and for crisp originalities
                  of character.
               The maritime population of New England is very unlike all the rest. The foreign
                  element has greatly modified society. Commerce and manufacturing have worn away
                  many of the primitive New England traits; and the wealth and refinement of the
                  cities have to some extent overlaid the peculiar New England element by a
                  cosmopolitan gliding. The remote neighborhoods and hill-towns yet retain the
                  manners, morals, institutions, customs and religion of the fathers. The interior
                  villages of New England are her broad-combs.
               Our simple story of domestic life will take us to a point intermediate between the
                  rugged simplicity of mountain towns and the easier life of the cities.
               A traveller going north from Springfield, in Massachusetts, soon perceives before
                  him an abrupt barrier, running east and west, which, if compared with the country
                  on either side, might be called mountainous. The two westernmost summits are Mount
                  Tom and Mount Holyoke. By a narrow passage between them comes through the
                  Connecticut River. Passing between these hill-mountains, we enter a great valley
                  or basin, some twelve miles wide and thirty long, which one might easily imagine
                  to have been once a lake; the Pelham hills on the east, Sugar-loaf on the north,
                  and the Holyoke range on the south, forming barriers on three side, while its
                  waters on the west were stayed by the slopes of those hills which, in the middle
                  of western Massachusetts, are all that remain of the famous Green Mountains.
               Look with my eyes, good reader, upon the town of Norwood, that, refusing to go
                  down upon the fat bottom-lands of the Connecticut, daintily perches itself upon
                  the irregular slopes west, and looks over upon that transcendent valley from under
                  its beautiful shade trees, and you will say that no fairer village glistens in the
                  sunlight, or nestles under arching elms! It is a wonder that Norwood was ever
                  allowed to venture so near to the low grounds of the Connecticut; for it was early
                  settled, not far from thirty years after the Pilgrims' landing. How the temptation
                  to build upon the top of the highest hill was resisted, we know not.
               Did the New England settler alight upon hill-tops, like a sentinel, or a hawk upon
                  the topmost bough, to spy danger at its first appearing? Or had he some
                  unconscious sense of the poetic beauty of the scriptural city set upon a hill—some
                  Jerusalem, lifted up, and seen from afar, in all its beauty? Or was he willing to
                  face the sturdy winds of New-England hill-tops, rather than to take the risk of
                  malaria in the softer air of her valleys? Whatever the reason, the chosen spot in
                  early days seems to have been a high and broad-backed hill, where the summer came
                  last, and departed earliest; where, while it lingered, it was purest and sweetest;
                  where winter was most austere, and its winds roared among the trees and shook the
                  framed houses with such awful grandeur, that children needed nothing more to
                  awaken in their imagination the great Coming Judgment, and the final consuming
                  storms, when the earth should be shaken and should pass away!
               Norwood, a town of five thousand inhabitants, like hundreds of other New England
                  towns, had in a general and indistinct way an upper, middle and lower class. A
                  wholesome jealousy of their rights and a suspicion among the poor that wealth and
                  strength always breed danger to the weak, made the upper class—who were ranked so
                  by their wealth, by their superior culture, and by the antiquity of their families
                  in town—politically weaker than any other.
               The middle class comprised the great body of the people, all dependent upon their
                  skill and activity for a living, and all striving to amass property enough to
                  leave their families at their death in independent circumstances.
               
               The lower class of a Now England village is chiefly composed of the
                  hangers-on—those who are ignorant and imbecile, and especially those who, for want
                  of moral health, have sunk, like sediment, to the bottom. Perhaps nowhere in the
                  world can be found more unlovely wickedness—a malignant, bitter, tenacious hatred
                  of good—than in New England. The good are very good, and the bad are very bad. The
                  high moral tone of public sentiment, in many New-England towns, and its
                  penetrating and almost inquisitional character, either powerfully determines men
                  to do good, or chafes and embitters them. This is especially true when, in certain
                  cases, good men are so thoroughly intent upon public morality that the private
                  individual has scarcely any choice left. Under such a pressure some men act in
                  open wickedness out of spite, and some secretly; and the bottom of society wages
                  clandestine war with the top.
               But fortunately for Norwood, the public sentiment, though strong and high in moral
                  tone, had been by peculiar influences so tempered with kindness, that, far less
                  than in surrounding places, was there a class of fierce castaways at the
                  bottom.
               The main street of Norwood was irregular, steadily seeking higher ground to its
                  extreme western limit. It would have had no claims to beauty had it not been rich
                  in the peculiar glory of New England—its Elm-trees! No town can fail of beauty,
                  though its walks were gutters, and its houses hovels, if venerable trees make
                  magnificent colonnades along its streets. Of all trees, no other unites, in the
                  some degree, majesty and beauty, grace and grandeur, as the American Elm! Known
                  from north to south, through a range of twelve hundred miles, and from the
                  Atlantic to the head waters of the rivers which flow into the western side of the
                  Mississippi, yet, in New England, the elm is found in its greatest size and
                  beauty, fully justifying Michaux's commendation of it to European cultivators, as
                  "the most magnificent vegetable of the Temperate Zone." Though a lover of moisture
                  and richness, the elm does not flourish so well upon pure vegetable soils as on
                  intervale lands stronger in mineral ingredients than river meadows.
               Single spots, finer than any in New England, there may be in other lands; but such
                  a series of villages over such a breadth of country, amidst so much beauty of
                  scenery, enriched, though with charming and inexpensive simplicity, with so much
                  beauty of garden, yard, and dwelling, cannot elsewhere be found upon the globe. No
                  man has seen America, who has not become familiar with the villages of New England
                  and the farms of the Northwestern States. Yet every one will confess that a large
                  part of this scenic beauty of New England is contributed by trees,—and
                  particularly by the elm. The Elms of New England! They are as much a part of her
                  beauty as the columns of the Parthenon were the glory of its architecture.
               Their towering trunks, whose massiveness well symbolizes Puritan inflexibility;
                  their over-arching tops, facile, wind-borne and elastic, hint the endless
                  plasticity and adaptableness of this people;—and both united, form a type of all
                  true manhood, broad at the root, firm in the trunk, and yielding at the top, yet
                  returning again, after every impulse, into position and symmetry. What if they
                  were steered away from village and farm house? Who would know the land?
                  Farm-houses that now stop the tourist and the artist, would stand forth bare and
                  homely; and villages that coquette with beauty through green leaves, would shine
                  white and ghastly as sepulchred. Let any one imagine Conway or Lancaster without
                  elms! Or Hadley, Hatfield, Northampton, or Springfield! New Haven without elms
                  would be like Jupiter without a beard, or a lion shaved of his mane!
               And so, reader, as one loves to approach a mansion through an avenue of elms, we
                  have led you through a short discourse of trees to our homely story.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER II.
               ABIAH CATHCART.
               ABIAH CATHCART was an honorable specimen of a New-England farmer. Any one
                  accustomed to judge of men would see at a glance that he did not belong to that
                  class of farmer-drudges, who tease Nature for a living, and make up for lack of
                  skill and knowledge of their business by an insatiable and tormenting industry. He
                  thought out his work, and then worked out his thoughts. He was a man of great
                  bodily strength; of calmness and patience, joined to an inflexible will. His face
                  accurately recorded his nature. It was large-framed, not mobile, but clear and
                  open in expression; it exhibited more of goodness and wisdom, than of feeling or
                  imagination. Had he been clothed in the habiliments, and seated on the beach of a
                  court, every one would have said, "He looks every inch a judge."
               He received from his parents a healthy body, a sound judgment, habits of industry,
                  a common-school education, and besides, nothing;—save their good name and
                  wholesome example. In all his boyhood, and til he was eighteen years old, he had
                  probably never altogether had five dollars of "spending money" from his father. He
                  used to tell his own boys, afterward, with some quiet pride, that he had never
                  spent for mere pleasure a single dollar which he had not himself earned by hard
                  work. He believed it to be almost immoral to spend property which had not been
                  seasoned by one's own toil or skill. He used to say that pleasure was wholesome
                  and indispensable when one had earned a right to it, but that amusement got for
                  nothing relaxed a man and demoralized him.
               When he was eighteen years old, Cathcart bought his time of his father for two
                  hundred dollars. These were considered very liberal terms in those days. A son's
                  services for three years before his majority were no small part of the working
                  capital of a small farm.
               Being master of his time, he considered and made an inventory of his goods and
                  properties. First, there was a good stout body, six feet high and well developed;
                  a face and head that an honest man need not be ashamed to carry through the world.
                  Next, he had a suit of new woollen clothes, and one old suit; six pairs of woollen
                  stockings, which his mother's own hands had knit from wool which grew, under his
                  own eye, on his father's flock; a pair of new thick boots for Sundays, an
                  every-day pair, an axe, a brave heart—honest and steadfast; this was all that he
                  carried out of his father's house. No! He carried likewise his father's
                  blessing,—unspoken, but not the less real; and his mother's prayers, silent and
                  gentle, but which could never miss the road to the throne of all bounty!
               Life was before him. He did not waver an hour as to his plans. He was a farmer's
                  son, he knew how to work, and by work he meant to thrive. His vision of success
                  was not extravagant—a homestead and a family; and property to support and educate
                  his children until they should be old enough to take care of themselves. This was
                  the measure of his dream.
               This ought not to seem difficult. And it would not be, in new regions where land
                  may be had for a nominal price, and where the climate prolongs the summer, while
                  it 
                     straitens
                     straightens
                  , the winter within narrow bounds. But in old New England, in the
                  neighborhood of large towns, where land is expensive, summers short, winters long,
                  and the soil not indulgent, yielding its moderate crops to coercion rather than to
                  coaxing, it is not easy for a man who has only his own hands for a capital to buy
                  a farm, stock it, earn upon it the means of paying for it, and at the same time to
                  support a growing family.
               This did Abiah Cathcart by intelligent industry and sturdy perseverance. Not a
                  thing did he ever get by craft. And who shall blame his honest pride, afterward
                  when he was wealthy that he had created his own fortune? Wealth created without
                  spot or blemish is an honest man's peerage; and to be proud of it is his right. It
                  is not the empty pride of money, but pride of skill, of patience of labor of
                  perseverance, and of honor, which wrought and secured the wealth!
               When he left his father's house he hired out at teaming, twelve dollars a month
                  and found. Cathcart had this sign of a sound nature that he loved a horse. His
                  employer gave him some discretion creation
                  in buying and selling; and soon, by purchase and exchange, Cathcart had made up
                  the best team in the neighborhood. Nothing went over the road that everybody
                  stared at more than his horses. It pleased him to see men pull up, look over the
                  horses, and exclaim:
               "That's a team for you! I say, mister, will you sell those horses?"
               He was pleased almost every day. His horses were moderately large but compact, and
                  the very models of strength. Look at them! The fine ear, the clean and finished
                  look of their heads, and, above all, the large, lively eyes that easily change
                  expression, and you will see that they have nerve as well as muscle. If you doubt,
                  you should see them when a heavy load threatens to stall them; the rousing, the
                  excitement, the prodigious swell of muscles, and, when the load is safely brought
                  up or through, the nervous flash of the eye, and the restless champ upon the bit!
                  He loved their company—loved to feed them—loved to take his book (he was ever and
                  always a reader) at noon, after his frugal meal was done, and sit by his team,
                  while the horses ground their oats, or cracked and crunched their Indian corn. Do
                  you wonder, reader, at such pleasure? Then you know little of some scenes of life.
                  Ask an old Western Wagoner, what have been the happiest hours of his life—and he
                  will tell you—
               "Well, stranger, I've seen some pretty jolly times. But, for solid comfort, I
                  think I've enjoyed the most when I was laying in my wagon near a creek, and the
                  fire was flickering among the trees, and I was jest goin' to sleep—I think I never
                  heard anything quite so pleasant as my horses, at both ends of the wagon, chankin
                  corn!"
               His employer died. It being autumn, Cathcart engaged to clear off a piece of
                  mountain wood, and haul it to town, at so much a cord. Doing well at this the next
                  fall he took a contract for making charcoal, and became almost a hermit in the
                  woods—chopping, piling, and tending the heap; and, until he had completed the job,
                  living in a shanty of his own construction.
               In summer, he worked upon the farm, getting fair wages; and thus, in five years,
                  he found himself rich—for he had earned a thousand dollars and won a royal woman's
                  heart.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               RACHEL LISCOMB.
               RACHEL LISCOMB, daughter of Deacon Liscomb—tall, slender, straight, with black
                  hair and dark eyes, a brunette—looked at him one day as they walked home from
                  meeting, with a look that he never got over. She was one of the few without gifts
                  of speech, whose bearing and looks are a full equivalent for speech. A farmer's
                  daughter—she was well-practised in work. But, a New-England woman, she was of a
                  deep moral nature and reflectively intelligent. One who looked for attractive
                  manners would pass her by unseen. Like a geode, the exterior was homely, the
                  crystals were dark-chambered within.
               Upon her rested the thoughts of Abiah Cathcart. She went but little from home,
                  except on Sunday to church, and to the singing-school. But twice had Cathcart
                  visited her father's house, and yet for a year, when they met, both hid or strove
                  to hide a sensibility of which neither was ashamed, but which each was ashamed to
                  feel without some sign that the other felt it too. Our finer feelings are like the
                  evening primrose, all the sunlight but shuts them closer. And yet, when evening
                  comes and dews are falling, if you will watch, you shall see the twilight with
                  gentle influence unroll them one by one, with visible motion, each blossom
                  throwing forth, as it opens, its offering of delicate odor.
               They were walking silently and gravely home one Sunday afternoon, under the tall
                  elms that lined the street for half a mile. Neither had spoken. There had been
                  some little parish quarrel, and on that afternoon the text was, "A new commandment
                  I write unto you, that ye love one another." But, after the sermon was done, the
                  text was the best part of it. Some one said that Parson Marsh's sermons were like
                  the meeting house—the steeple was the only thing that folks could see after they
                  got home.
               They walked slowly, without a word. Once or twice 'Biah essayed to speak, but was
                  still silent. He plucked a flower from
                  between the pickets of the fence, and unconsciously pulled it to pieces, as, with
                  troubled face, he glanced at Rachel, and then, as fearing she would catch his eye,
                  he looked at the trees, at the clouds at the grass, at everything, and saw
                  nothing—nothing but Rachel. The most solemn hour of human experience is not that
                  of death, but of Life—when the heart is born again, and from a natural heart
                  becomes a heart of Love! What wonder that it is a silent hour and perplexed?
               Is the soul confused? Why not, when the divine spirit, rolling clear across the
                  aerial ocean, breaks upon the heart's shore with all the mystery of heaven? Is it
                  strange that uncertain lights dim the eye, if above the head of him that truly
                  loves hover clouds of saintly spirits? Why should not the tongue stammer and
                  refuse its accustomed offices, when all the world—skies, trees, plains, hills,
                  atmosphere, and the solid earth—spring forth in new colors, with strange meanings,
                  and seem to chant for the soul the glory of that mystic Law with which God has
                  bound to himself his infinite realm—the law of Love! Then, for the first time,
                  when one so loves that love is sacrifice, death to self, resurrection, and glory,
                  is man brought into harmony with the whole universe; and like him who beheld the
                  seventh heaven, hears things unlawful to be uttered!
               The great elm trees sighed as the fitful breeze swept their tops. The soft shadows
                  flitted back and forth beneath the walker's feet, fell upon them in light and
                  dark, ran over the ground, quivered, and shook, until sober Cathcart thought that
                  his heart was throwing its shifting network of hope and fear along the ground
                  before him!
               How strangely his voice sounded to him as, at length, all his emotions could only
                  say, "Rachel—how did you like the sermon?"
               Quietly she answered—
               "I liked the text."
               "'A new commandment I write unto you, that ye love one another.' Rachel, will you
                  help me keep it?"
               At first she looked down and lost a little color; then, raising her face, she
                  turned upon him her large eyes, with a look both clear and tender. It was as if
                  some painful restraint had given way, and her eyes blossomed into full beauty.
               Not another word wad spoken. They walked home hand in hand. He neither smiled nor
                  exulted. He saw neither the trees, nor the long level rays of sunlight that were
                  slanting across the fields. His soul was overshadowed with a cloud as if God were
                  drawing near. He had never felt so solemn. This woman's life had been entrusted to
                  him!
               Long years—the whole length of life—the eternal years beyond, seemed in an
                  indistinct way to rise up in his imagination. All that he could say, as he left
                  her at the door, was:
               "Rachel, this is forever—forever."
               She again said nothing, but turned to him with a clear and open face, in which joy
                  and trust wrought beauty. It seemed to him as if a light fell upon him from her
                  eyes. There was a look that descended and covered him as with an atmosphere; and
                  all the way home he was as one walking in a luminous cloud. He had never felt such
                  personal dignity as now. He that wins such love is crowned, and may call himself
                  king. He did not feel the earth under his feet. As he drew near his lodgings, the
                  sun went down. The children began to pour forth, no longer restrained. Abiah
                  turned to his evening chores. No animal that night but had reason to bless him.
                  The children found him unusually good and tender. And Aunt Keziah said to her
                  sister:
               "Abiah's been goin' to meetin' very regular for some weeks, and I shouldn't
                  wonder, by the way he looks, if he had got a hope. I trust he ain't deceivin'
                  himself."
               He had a hope, and he was not deceived; for in a few months, at the close of the
                  service one Sunday morning, the minister read from the pulpit: "Marriage is
                  intended between Abiah Cathcart and Rachel Liscomb, both of this town and this is
                  the first publishing of the banns." Which notice was duly repeated for two
                  successive Sunday mornings. Then old Uncle Bascom, the town clerk, issued the
                  marriage certificate. Uncle Bascom had been town clerk, the boys used to think,
                  ever since there was a town; so long that that town, without Giles Bascom as
                  clerk, wouldn't be recognized. It was one of the marks, like the meeting-house,
                  the brick store, and Gallup's tavern, by which people knew that this was the town
                  of Dennis.
               One day there appeared in the county paper two lines: "Married: — On
                  —, at the house of the bride's father, Abiah Cathcart and Rachel Liscomb."
               
               What a slender body is that for the world of meaning contained in it!
               From the hour of his engagement, Cathcart was a different man. Every faculty was
                  quickened, but most, his moral nature. He marvelled with himself what it should
                  mean. All his life had he honored industry and integrity in thought and example.
                  But all at once these qualities rose before him in a light of beauty which he had
                  never before imagined. Hundreds of sermons had he heard on virtue and piety. But
                  now, without any apparent reason, manliness seemed the only thing worth living
                  for, and truth and purity seemed to him so noble that he strangely hungered for
                  them. Taught from his childhood to reverence God, he felt suddenly opened in his
                  soul a gate of thanksgiving, and through it came also a multitude of thoughts of
                  worship and praise. The world was recreated before his eyes. Nothing before was
                  ever beautiful, if judged by his present sensibility. These experiences did not
                  clothe themselves in language, nor work out in ideas and images for he was of too
                  practical a nature. But they filled him with tenderness and manliness.
               As the day of his marriage drew near, he felt a thousand reluctances and scruples.
                  He feared that Rachel might not be happy with him—that it was not worthy in him to
                  take her from the plain comforts of her father's house to the toil and limitation
                  of his struggling lot—that she might be deceived in him, and not always find
                  reason for such love as she now manifested. He looked upon her with reverence, and
                  far greater than before he was admitted to such intimate relations. Her every word
                  was simple, every thought was truth, every feeling pure; and word, thought and
                  feeling moved gently upon him in an atmosphere of love. He worshipped God with
                  reverence. He worshipped Rachel with love; he came to her as one comes to an altar
                  or a shrine. He left her as one who has seen a vision of angels.
               Outwardly, and in consonance with the customs of the neighborhood, he was gay and
                  jovial at the wedding; but down deep in his soul he was as solemn, before Rachel,
                  as if God spoke and he listened.
               How wondrous are the early days of wedlock, in young and noble souls! How strange
                  are the ways of two pure souls, wholly finding each other out; between whom for
                  days and months is going on that silent and unconscious intersphering of thought,
                  feeling, taste, and will, by which two natures are clasping and twining and
                  growing into each other!
               Happy are they who know, and well Cathcart knew, how to bring such wisdom with
                  loving, that selfishness, a poisonous weed, shall die out; and love clothed with
                  reverence shall grow and thrive with power and beauty, all one's life! For, if
                  there be one root in which resides the secret of producing immortal flowers, it is
                  Love.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IV.
               STARTING IN LIFE.
               AFTER his marriage, 'Biah Cathcart, (as he was familiarly called by his
                  neighbors,) not without much thought and consultation, determined to buy him a
                  farm. After many searchings, and much deliberation, he chose a place of sixty
                  acres, two miles from the goodly town of Norwood. There were, besides, twenty
                  acres of woodland, lying three miles away, mountain lots, as they were called. On
                  the home farm there was an old-fashioned farm-house, of two stories.
               But instead of one story additions, in the rear, such as are now built, for
                  kitchen, shed, &c., the rear roof ran from the ridge-pole down nearly to the
                  ground, covering the two stories and the single story with one long slant.
               The former occupant had suffered the property to waste. Paint had long since
                  ceased to cover the clapboards on the sides; the roof was patched and numbered
                  with moss, and the water gutters at the eaves had collected so much of dust and
                  decayed leaves, as to form little patches of soil, out of which grew a fringe of
                  mingled vegetation. Both flowers and weeds, whose seeds had been lodged there by
                  birds, or uplifted by the winds, grew lovingly together, and cast their slender
                  shadows down upon the cornice, like a pencil tracery of arabesques.
               It was the day that Dr. Wentworth had been called to see Widow Nance, a mile
                  beyond, that Cathcart took in hand the old house.
               "You see, Doctor, that I've got a job here. Old Templeton's liquor bills were so
                  heavy that he couldn't afford paint or putty."
               "Make a clean job of it, 'Biah. You'll have to lay these chimney-tops over again;
                  filling and pointing won't do. I suppose you will shift your flower garden, too,
                  from the roof to the ground."
               "Flower garden?"
               "Yes, poor things," said the Doctor, going to the back eaves and standing upon an
                  old wash-bench, where he could look upon the low roof.
               "I wish I had this old mossy roof, or one just like it. I am willing to ride a
                  mile out of my way, any time, to see the moss in Peak's ravine, and all along the
                  wood on each side of it. How kind of it to creep over decaying things and cover
                  their homeliness with such a cheerful garment! Did you ever think that in the
                  animal kingdom there is no beauty in death. A crow, a dog or a wounded deer dies,
                  and is soon consumed. They seem to have had their time when alive. But vegetation,
                  with fewer privileges in life, has more comeliness after death. Nobody makes
                  shrouds for trees, and so nature takes care of them and hides them under new
                  life—making beauty do sexton's work, and shroud death with the garments of life. I
                  was over yesterday at the ravine, and found an old tree-trunk half decayed, on and
                  around which was a garden such as no gardener could make. It lay on the edge of
                  the wood; the stream of the brook had kept its mosses, of which I counted many
                  species, in admirable health and color. Ah, it was like a trunk of emerald! Down
                  on the south side, where the leaves had kept them warm all winter were blood-root
                  blossoms white as snow, shooting up in squads, like white troopers mustering for
                  some tournament; and at the upturned roots was a tangle of blackberry vines, as
                  fine inclines as any thing that Raphael ever imitated from the ancients, and a
                  great deal more beautiful. Men's eyes make finer pictures, when they know how to
                  use them, than any body's hands can."
               "And so, Doctor, I am to keep this half-acre of a roof, am I, just out of pity to
                  this moss? And what'll become of us when it rains with this green old sieve
                  letting through enough rain to dampen every room in the house? I see—you want our
                  custom, Doctor! We should soon have moss growing over us as it is over old
                  Templeton—though, by-the-bye, he never suffered when on earth from too much water,
                  I'm thinking! Hiram Beers says he wouldn't touch it when he could get it, and now
                  can't get it when he wants it. Hiram is very hard on old Templeton. He says the
                  old man was so hot, that flowers ought to start early where his grave is."
               "What a pity that thrift and sentiment can't compromise matters a little better!
                  It would make any gardener's reputation if he could plant such a little moss-Eden
                  as this. Well, if you choose to be healthy rather than beautiful, you must have
                  your own way. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Widow Nance, poor thing, is
                     about spent! Save me some of the
                  moss—that great patch yonder, with cherry-stones heaped along its upper edge."
               And with that he carried away his great blue eyes, and white face, wide at the
                  top, but fine and clean out, though large-featured to the very chin.
               "As good sense at the bottom as ever man had," said Cathcart, as the chaise rolled
                  out from under the elm trees, in front of the yard, "and he needs it all too, or
                  his queer notions would run away with him. Rachel says the Doctor's face and
                  presence are better than most doctors' medicine; and they are reviving. I always
                  feel after he's gone as if there was more in every thing about me than I had any
                  notion of before, though I can't exactly tell what it is."
               It was about two o'clock when Dr. Wentworth returned, and, not seeing Cathcart, he
                  walked under a ragged cherry-tree, and stood watching with a kind of sober smile
                  the workmen, inspired with the subtle eagerness which the work of destroying is
                  apt to infuse.
               The shingles came down in showers. The light ones whirled and glimmered in the
                  sunlight, and shied out hither and thither all over the yard. Those covered with
                  moss came headlong and thumped the ground at his feet.
               "Poor thing, do you know me?" raising a moss-loaded shingle thoughtfully, as if it
                  were alive; and he laughed out as if he had been answered by some unexpected
                  cry.
               For a rakeful of shingles had sent a flock of hens in sudden scare toward the
                  barn-yard, while the great golden-speckled rooster drew up with magisterial
                  dignity and called out, "Cuttark-cut, cut, cut?" Receiving no answer, with a
                  low-crooning noise in his throat, he cocked his eye, first at the doctor, then at
                  the house, as much as to say, "Do you know what's going on here?" And then,
                  letting down his right foot which had been drawn up, in suspense, he pompously
                  moved off to lecture his hens, that were already picking and scratching in the
                  straw, upon the mystery of life.
               The doctor drew near the now cast-away gutter, and stooping, plucked two or three
                  of the weeds, and putting them under his hat-band, laid down his hat on the
                  well-stone, while he unrolled the rickety old windlass and sent down the remnants
                  of a bucket for water. It was an old-fashioned well, of mysterious depth. If you
                  looked down its narrow and dark throat, you saw nothing. If you still looked, and
                  dropped a pebble down, a faint light was reflected from the crinkling water far
                  below. For four or five feet at the top, the stones were lined with moss. Up,
                  after long winding, came the bucket, spurting out its contents on every side, and
                  filling the well with a musical splashing sound, reserving hardly enough, at last
                  to serve for a good drink. "Well, 'Biah, I understand the old proverb—truth is at
                  the bottom of the well. If I was to go down after the water, very likely there is
                  foul air enough down there to put me out like a candle; and if I send a bucket
                  down the greatest part leaks out before I can reach it. Much work and little truth
                  do men get in the wells they dig now-a-days."
               "But come in and see the house."
               "I have seen it too often. Wait till you have lived awhile here and changed every
                  association. I shall see the terrible sight that I witnessed when old Templeton
                  had delirium tremens. He yelled and moaned by
                  turns saw men and devils after him and died more horribly than any other creature
                  that I ever saw, and I've seen many. Scour your walls 'Biah."
               Bad as the house was, the grounds were in even worse condition. The barns were
                  utterly dilapidated; the fences were poor; the soil had been fleeced and scarcely
                  anything that was bad in husbandry had been left untried upon this much-enduring
                  farm.
               But this universal deterioration had so depreciated the market value of the place
                  that Cathcart was enabled to buy it—making a payment of a thousand dollars, and
                  borrowing the rest with his own time to pay it off. If he had been industrious and
                  frugal before, he was far more so now. What he lacked in capital he must make up
                  in enterprise.
               For a year or two the struggle was close. His wife was his equal in industry and
                  frugality. Her patience was never even ruffled. At four in summer and at five in
                  winter, the light blazed on the hearth, and there were sounds in the barn. After
                  the cattle were foddered, and until daylight, he worked at "closing" boots and
                  shoes earning thus a small addition to his means. At dark he same labor was
                  resumed. This rigid, methodical industry was cheerfully pursued without
                  intermission for years and at length began to produce its results. One by one each
                  field had been deepened; for Cathcart
                  said: "No farmer owns any deeper than he can plow."
               Little by little the near lots were cleared of stone, which reappeared in stone
                  walls, built with a breadth and accuracy fit for a castle wall, and which at
                  length were carried around the whole farm. The low-lying lots, filled with muck,
                  were drained and reduced to meadows; and acres, which before had been impassable
                  to cattle, except in the driest summer weather, or, when frozen, became solid, and
                  the most productive of all the farm. The number of division fences was greatly
                  reduced, Cathcart believing that far more ground was wasted by fences than any
                  good farmer could afford. The land actually occupied by the fence, the waste each
                  side of it by brambles or weeds, the time consumed in clearing these useless
                  occupants away, if the farmer was neat, Cathcart argued, constituted, in ten
                  years, a heavy tax on industry.
               In such a climate, in such a soil and in such a community, a farm will not pay,
                  unless it be made to move with the accuracy of a machine, and with an economy
                  which reaches to the most minute elements.
               Availing himself of Dr. Wentworth's library, he had read the best works on
                  husbandry, and extracted from them enough to guide his practice to a result far
                  beyond that which was common in the neighborhood. Whoever had, at first,
                  criticized the newfangled farming, no longer doubted its success, when, at length,
                  the farm was clear of debt, and returning no mean revenue.
               Here years rolled on, and Cathcart grew to prosperity and into universal respect.
                  Sons and daughters were born to him; with only two of whom, however, shall we have
                  to do—the youngest two—Barton and Alice, who will in due time take their places in
                  our history.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               THE WENTWORTHS.
               THE night on which Rose Wentworth was born was furnished out with all suitable
                  auguries. It was more nearly morning than night. That was well, to be born as the
                  day was breaking and morning was fresh on all the earth. The dew lay pure on all
                  the ground, and the birds were singing.
               The time was late in April, and the resurrection of the vegetable world was going
                  on. If one feels the influence of the seasons upon his natal hour, it was fit that
                  Dr. Wentworth's first-born should come not with the wan and waning months of
                  autumn, but in the months of newness, when all things feel the touch of recreative
                  power. The day before had been soft and showery. Southern winds filled the air
                  with moisture and that fragrant smell of soil and the slight balsamic odor of
                  opening buds, which to some sensitive persons is strangely exhilarating, and which
                  stirs the mind with subtle suggestion, and, after the long imprisonment of winter,
                  sets the tremulous imagination into wild delight.
               In the afternoon there had been several peals of thunder, which at that early
                  season awakened surprise in all, but which the Doctor accepted as a part of a
                  happy conjunction of natural phenomena significant of his child's life and
                  fate.
               Mother Taft had been waiting at the house for several days. She seemed gently
                  stirred at the sound of thunder. But even thunder could not move her serene nature
                  to more than quiet wonder. Half the children in the village called her Auntie, and
                  grew up with the impression that she was blood kin to them. Her face was young for
                  one of fifty years, white and smooth. Her blue eye never flashed, or glowed, or
                  burned, or pierced, or did any of those violent things to which eyes are addicted.
                  Sad eyes; pitying eyes! For years she had stood a door-keeper for this sad world
                  and all that come in had begun their life with cries and wails as if to prophecy
                  their future. Had pity for those born into sorrow and crying at last strained
                  itself in her very features?
               
               When the thunder broke forth suddenly and rolled away in the distance with
                  softened cadence, Mother Taft moved to the front door. Her walking was of that
                  quiet kind that seems to have no more footsteps in it than has the shadow of a
                  cloud that is gliding along the ground. Dr. Wentworth was coming through the
                  door-yard, noting on every hand the condition of vegetation. The willows had
                  thrown off their silky catkins, and were in leaf; the lilac buds were swollen
                  large; the elm was covered with chocolate-colored blossoms; the pyrus japonica was reddening its clusters of crimson
                  buds; the green-wooded forsythia was pushing
                  yellow flowers; and the soft maple drew bees to its crimson tassels. In the
                  border, peonies were breaking ground; snow-drops and crocuses were in bloom, as
                  also hepaticas. The grass was becoming vividly green, and honeysuckles—especially
                  over the trellis at the front door—were pushing new leaves. Yes, nature was fairly
                  at work! The sap flowed again. Life was once more organizing myriads of curious
                  textures and forms with silent forces infinite and almost omnipotent.
               The Doctor searched not as one who would take but only find. When the thunder
                  sounded he bared his head as if he heard some message. His eye brightened with
                  satisfaction, and, as Mother Taft opened the door he said, softly but
                  solemnly:
               "She will hear God's voice. Flowers live. All things are coming forth. Her time is
                  come. But she must have her crown."
               Calling Pete, a great, black, clumsy-moving fellow, the Doctor said:
               "Pete, I want some trailing arbutus; where does it blossom earliest?"
               "What?" said Pete, looking perplexed.
               "Where can you get the earliest Mayflower?"
               "May-flowers—why, on Howlet's Hill, of course," said Pete, as if surprised that
                  the Doctor did not know so plain a fact as that.
               "Well, Pete, I haven't been here as long as you have, and don't know the ins and
                  outs of the fields yet. But bring up the horses and drive me there. Don't let
                  grass grow under your feet."
               Passing through a pine wood, where no flowers were yet growing, and ascending the
                  hill, through an open wood where hemlock and deciduous trees were mixed, they came
                  near the top to a half cleared space, to the eye brown and barren, except here and
                  there clumps of evergreen kalmias. Pete's eye was seldom at fault.
               "There's some, Doctor, by that stump; and there's some beyond, ever so much."
                  Clearing away the leaves he revealed the sweetest flower that opens to the
                  northern sky. It is content, though lying upon the very ground. It braves the
                  coldest winters. All the summers can not elaborate a perfume so sweet as that
                  which seems to have been born of the very winter. It is like the breath of love.
                  The pure white and pink blossoms, in sweet clusters, lie bidden under leaves, or
                  grass, and often under untimely snows. Blessings on thee! Thou art the fairest,
                  most modest and sweetest-breathed of all our flowers!
               Enough for a wreath were soon gathered, and brought home the fittest emblem
                  wherewith to greet the little damsel.
               Near twilight of the next morning, while the air was soft and balmy, and roots
                  were swelling, and buds opening, and blossoms coming forth, and birds singing
                  love-songs in all the trees, was born ROSE WENTWORTH.
               Dr. Reuben Wentworth was born in the old town of Norwich Connecticut, in one of
                  the old pre-revolutionary houses, under the shade of old elms. What with the early
                  colonial history, and the always romantic legends of the Indians, he found the
                  whole region about his birthplace rich in historic incident.
               His family originally came from the eastern part of Massachusetts, and to this
                  circumstance, probably, it was owing, that he studied at Harvard University. A
                  respectable student in the regular course, he had the reputation of being very
                  busy with studies outside of the course. He early manifested a strong taste for
                  Natural Science, but was never satisfied with that part which the books contain,
                  but, with an instinct as strong as that which leads an infant to its mother's
                  breast for food, he turned from the dry descriptions and classifications to the
                  living things themselves. At first, it was almost wholly an instinct, the
                  sensibility of exquisite taste. But to this was added, by gradual unfolding, a
                  rational element, and then a moral sympathy, until he found himself united to the
                  organized system of nature with every part of his being.
               This task did not detach him from the love of books, nor of society, nor of art
                  and literature. He had warm sympathy for
                  every thing human, and for all the proper works of man—but under and behind it,
                  was a strong and silent sympathy and alliance with nature; silent:—for during all
                  his education, Reuben Wentworth had a vague impression that his tastes, if fully
                  disclosed, would render him liable to the charge of being a dreamer, and a
                  poetical idealist.
               The uncle, whose purse had carried him through college, was an old bachelor of
                  fifty years—spry, lean, and chipper—Ebenezer by name. But people are usually
                  overclothed with names; and as men in summer or at work, throw off their
                  superfluous raiment till their arms are bare, so most folks dispense with a
                  portion of their names; and Ebenezer Wentworth passed everywhere as Uncle Eb. He wrote his name Eb. Wentworth—tying them together with a long
                  flourish, as if afraid they would get separated. He used to laugh at people's
                  names.
               "Folks use their children as if they were garret pegs, to hang old clothes
                  on—first a jacket, then a coat, and then another jacket. You have to take them all
                  down to find either one. Our children go trudging all their lives with their load
                  of names, as if they were old Jews returning with an assortment of clothes. People
                  use their children as registers to preserve the names of aunts and uncles, parents
                  and grandparents, and so inscribe them with the names of the dead, as if
                  tombstones were not enough." And so he would run on for an hour, if any one would
                  listen, and even if they did not; for he was a natural talker—talked nearly all
                  the time when awake—no more if men listened to him no less if they did not. Unlike
                  the race of natural talkers, his conversation contained a great deal of good
                  sense, and of shrewd observation. It was full of whims, too, and ludicrous
                  exaggerations, particularly when any one opposed him. There was no excess and no
                  absurdity which he would not zealously defend, if some sober and literal man
                  sought logically to corner him. He disputed axioms, refused to admit first
                  principles, laughed at premises, and ran down conclusions, dogmatized and madly
                  asserted, with the merriest and absurdest indifference to all consistency; for
                  which there is no parallel, unless it be that of a very lively horse, in a very
                  large pasture, with a very gouty man trying to catch him.
               But this was superficial. At bottom Uncle Eb. was a stern moralist and loyal to
                  the last degree in his conduct to honor and truth.
               If you had a pet theory, or an assumptions argument, or a logical brat rigged up
                  with pretentious authority, Uncle Eb. was the most dangerous of men to entrust it
                  with. He was a sore trouble to theologians and a nuisance to theorists. But if you
                  were dying, he was just the man to entrust your estate with. Punctual, exact,
                  sharp, disinterested, but pragmatical, he neither would cheat nor allow cheating.
                  There was no more vaporing, no more wild caracoles of the horse aforesaid, in open
                  fields, but, like the horse in harness, he settled down to his work with edifying
                  sobriety and regularity.
               "Well, Reuben, you graduate this summer. What next? What are you going to do? You
                  are pretty well stuffed with trash. It will take several years to forget what you
                  ought not to have learned, and to get rid of the evil effects of foolish
                  instruction. But that will come pretty much of itself. College learning is very
                  much like snow, and the more a man has of it the less can the soil produce. It's
                  not till practical life melts it that the ground yields anything. Men get over it
                  quicker in some kinds of business, than in others. The college sticks longest on
                  ministers and schoolmasters: next, to lawyers; not much to doctors; and none at
                  all to merchants and gentlemen. You can't afford to be a gentleman, and so you
                  must choose among other callings."
               "Can't a man, Uncle Eb., be a gentleman in any respectable calling?"
               "Oh, dear, no. My gentleman must take all his time to it, spend his
                  life at it, be jealous of everything else. He is a kind of perfect man, a sort of
                  chronometer, for other men to keep time by. One is enough for a whole town. One is
                  enough—two would be a superfluity, and a class of them simply a nuisance. A
                  gentleman should have feeling—but should hide it. People of much sentiment are
                  like fountains, whose overflow keeps a disagreeable puddle about them. He should
                  have knowledge, but not like your educated men of our day whose knowledge sings
                  and crows and cackles with every achievement. His knowledge should be like apples
                  in autumn hanging silently on the bows—rich, ripe and still. A gentleman should be
                  business-like by instinct. Affairs in his hands come to pass silently and without
                  ado, as Nature compasses her results-the fastest range and round of spring work
                  making less noise than one store or shop. I tell you, Reuben, a gentleman is a rare specimen. He requires so much
                  in the making that few are made."
               "But people consider you a gentleman, Uncle Eb."
               "Tut, tut—no ridicule, young man! I am gentlemanly. That's another thing. I have
                  worked too hard,—showing that I had not enough power. Power works easily. I have
                  fretted too much. Fretting is a perpetual confession of weakness. It says, 'I want
                  to, and can't.' Fretting is like a little dog pawing and whining at a door because
                  he can't get in. No, no. A gentleman is like a fine piece of statuary, and must
                  not be used, like a caryatide, to hold up porticos or cornices. He must be so fine
                  that he accomplishes more while doing nothing than others do with all their
                  bustle. He must be better than other men at the start, or he will grow rough in
                  trying to mend matters, and so be like the best of common men who only succeed in
                  getting ready to live when it is time for them to die."
               "Is not Squire Perkins a gentleman?"
               "Good and polite! But not my gentleman. His grain is not fine. His
                  mother was a sailor's widow, hearty and good-natured, but coarse in substance. All
                  that Judge Perkins can claim is good nature, which is a mere matter of health.
                  Good digestion—you are good-natured; bad digestion—you are morose! One of these
                  days men will call things by their right names. Then they won't say: he's of a
                  good disposition; but, he has a good stomach. Half the grace that's going is
                  nothing but food. Paul said the kingdom was not meat and drink. Very likely not
                  hereafter. But it is here. Good steak and light bread is benevolence. Coffee is
                  inspiration and humor. Good tea is tenderness and sprightliness—facts very
                  humbling of our excellences. But they're facts. Perkins is a good fellow. But if
                  he was old, had the rheumatism and was to have his money stolen, he would be as
                  sour as a crab-apple."
               Young Wentworth was amused at his uncle's crotchets, and loved to oppose him just
                  enough to keep the old gentlemen on the edge of extravagance, without being fairly
                  driven over into absurdity.
               "No Reuben, gentlemen are fore-ordained from all eternity. They can't be hurried
                  up and put together on order, like a box of shoes for the southern market. A
                  gentleman must see everybody without looking, and know everybody without inquiry,
                  and say just the right thing to everybody without trying to; and, above all, be
                  must make everybody in his presence do the best things they know how to do. That's
                  the touchstone. I've seen men come almost up to it. But then they would let people
                  get angry; they would suffer them to say and do disagreeable things. That will
                  never do. The gentleman is a natural king. He has the intuition of people's
                  nature, and can touch just the spot in them that is sweetest, and get out of them
                  what they would never have wrought out of themselves. One or two gentlemen are
                  enough for a town. They are steeples, which we put on churches, not on
                  dwelling-houses."
               "Very well, uncle, I will give up being a gentleman. Such a brilliant exception to
                  good and well-bred men I was not born to be. What next?"
               "You should never make a clergyman of yourself. You are not bad, but then you're
                  not good. A man should be born to the pulpit. A musician is one whose brain
                  naturally secretes musical ideas; a poet thinks in blossoms just as naturally as
                  honeysuckles do; an inventor's head is made to work out mechanical combinations.
                  Men are like trees, each one must put forth the leaf that is created in him.
                  Education is only like good culture—it changes the size but not the sort. The men
                  that ought to preach should be ordained in birth. The laying on of hands can't
                  make an empty head fall, nor a cold heart warm, nor a silent nature vocal. A
                  minister is a genius in moral ideas, as a poet is in beautiful ideas, and an
                  inventor in physical ideas."
               "But are not all men born with moral natures, and may not cultivation develop
                  them?"
               "So, many trees have sweet sap besides the maple, but the maple only is so sweet
                  as to be profitable for sugar. Cornstalks have saccharine matter as well as
                  sugar-cane. But we plant one for grain and the other for sugar, just because it is
                  so easy for one to bear grain, and so hard for it to make sugar; and so easy for
                  the other to yield sugar, and so impossible to give grain. Find out whether a
                  man's head is fertile in moral ideas. It is not enough that he should know what is
                  right when he sees it. He should see it before it exists. Now good, now truth,
                  better justice should suggest itself to him on every side. He is an inventor of better good than men now possess.
                     Your head, Reuben, does not run clear; you think a matter is right
                  if only it is beautiful, with a little touch of wildness in it. Besides, the
                  office of a minister won't agree with your natural carriage. You would run when
                  you were expected to walk. You have no respect for rules. You would scare every
                  body once a month with some naturalistic notions gathered in your rambling in the
                  fields. Theology, like old Isaac, always puts its nose on its children to see if
                  the smell of the fields is upon them. Isaac blessed Jacob because it was; theology
                  blesses Jacob only when it is not! Natural religion is generally considered as
                  poor stuff. Imported is thought more of than home-made—broadcloth proves better
                  than linsey-woolsey. The church thinks that it will not do to make religion too
                  easy; folks might take it up of themselves. You were not born for a pulpit. Few
                  men are. Pulpits are queer places—candlesticks whose candles won't burn—learned
                  men, but can't speak, like deep wells and a pump that won't fetch water."
               "Ah, uncle, you don't like ministers, I am afraid. All that I have ever known were
                  capital fellows—manly and sincere. But, as you say, I don't think I am good
                  enough, and so I promise you upon my honor, that I won't be a clergyman."
               In early life Uncle Eb. had been deeply wounded in a love affair, and saw his
                  treasure borne off by a young minister. He had never married, and he never quite
                  forgave the profession. But it is only just to say, that while he made cynical
                  speeches about ministers in general, he had conceived the warmest attachment to
                  many clergymen in particular.
               "Perhaps you think I'd better be a lawyer?"
               "There's worse things than that. But you would never make your bread at that
                  business. It's a hot and drastic profession. You will see men chiefly on the
                  selfish side. You will be always making a porridge of somebody's dirt. Pretty good
                  fellows lawyers are; but I wonder at it."
               "I declare, uncle, I believe you mean to make a schoolmaster of me."
               "No, sir; a man should never be a schoolmaster. That's a woman's business. Be a
                  professor or nothing! Even then it's a poor business. Who ever heard of a college
                  professor that was not poor? They dry up in pocket like springs after the wood is
                  cut off from the hills. They are apt to get very dry in other ways, too. A man
                  that teaches cannot afford to know too much. A teacher is like a needle. He should
                  be small and sharp. If large, he cannot run easily through the garments to be
                  made. The College President ought to be a great man—a sort of specimen,—something
                  for the boys to remember as a pattern of a man."
               "Well uncle, as I am not a born gentleman, and can't make a good minister, am too
                  good to be a lawyer, and must not be a schoolmaster; as I am too fat to be a
                  professor, and not grand enough for a president,—I am afraid I shall have to go to
                  sea for a living; for I am not fit to work, and should sell myself out of house
                  and home, if I was a merchant."
               "There is just one thing left, and a business proper for you; you should be a
                  doctor! You love nature. You love chemistry and botany. You are fond of all
                  curious insearch and occult functions. A doctor, it is true, is everybody's
                  servant. But you will be left to think and reason, without any master. And the
                  riding, especially in the country, will suit your desultory nature."
               "And, to sum it all up, uncle, you want me to be a doctor, because your father was
                  one, and his father and your brother, and for fear a link should be missing, you
                  want me to study medicine. That you want it, is enough."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VI.
               WANDERING THOUGHTS.
               YOUNG Wentworth, after graduating, took a regular course of medicine in Boston,
                  with an average standing. By his uncle's liberality he spent a year in Vienna, and
                  one in Paris. Longer he was to have remained. But his uncle's sickness brought him
                  home, only in time to spend a few days with him before the eccentric but kind man
                  died. His property was left to young Wentworth, and it proved greater than men had
                  suspected. Some fortunate adventures, and sagacious investments, had put his
                  affairs in such condition that his nephew found himself possessed of an income
                  that removed one motive for exertion, and left him to pursue his profession from
                  taste and kindness rather than from urgent necessity.
               Refusing most flattering overtures for a city practice, Dr. Wentworth sought a
                  sphere in Norwood, where he could be in daily and intimate converse with
                  nature.
               "She is my mother," he used to say, "and all her brood are my
                  kin."
               Dr. Wentworth would have succeeded in any liberal profession. But his nature was
                  peculiarly adapted to the profession which he had chosen. Some men chill you; some
                  cheer and inspire with mirth or humor; some stir in you vague suspicion, doubts,
                  and distrust of men and life. But Dr. Wentworth's presence brought peace and
                  trust. He radiated from his nature a perpetual June. Singularly fortunate in
                  temper and disposition, as well as in judgment and philosophic sense he was still
                  more fortunate in the rare gift of bearing unconsciously about with him an
                  atmosphere which inspired health in body and soul upon those susceptible to subtle
                  influences.
               This was a notable element in his medical practice. His skill consisted in
                  persuading men to get well. Sickness is very largely the want of will. Everything
                  is brain. There is thought and feeling not only, but will: and will includes in it
                  far more than mental philosophers think. It acts universally, now as upon mind,
                  and then just as much upon the body. It is another name for life-force. Men in
                  whom this life or will-power is great, resist disease, and combat it when
                  attacked. To array a man's mind and will against his sickness is the supreme art
                  of medicine. Inspire in men courage and purpose, and the mind-power will cast out
                  disease. He was himself the best medicine, and often cured by his presence those
                  whom drugs would have scarcely helped. These cures through the spirit of the
                  patient he regarded as far the most skilful and philosophical.
               "Nothing ails her. It is only her imagination," said the nurse to him one day.
               "Only the imagination? That is enough. Better suffer in bone and
                  muscle than in the imagination. If the body is sick, the mind can cure it; but if
                  the mind itself is sick, what shall cure that?"
               These elements of character, in time, would have procured for him constant
                  employment even had he been poor, and in need of immediate occupation. But as he
                  had a competence, and abundant occupation in his grounds and books, and pleasant
                  society, to which his tastes strongly inclined him, he found his professional
                  services from the first in great demand; and furnished another instance of the
                  willingness of men to aid those not in need, while those who are likely to starve
                  if not at once befriended are put on a long probation.
               For several years there was much pleasing and amiable speculation upon the social
                  prospects of this promising physician—and surely the benevolence of his fellow-men
                  is to be commended. Well married, a man is winged—ill-matched, he is shackled.
               The good people of Norwood were enterprising, and very busy. They had little time,
                  aside from their own affairs; and yet so kind were they, that scores of them spent
                  much time in thinking for Dr. Wentworth, and in cheerfully devising for him an
                  eligible connection. It is to be hoped that they were abundantly gratified, when
                  he found a wife, without their help. Certainly there was no offence which
                  alienated their sympathy; for, when Dr. Wentworth, returning from a fortnight's
                  absence, appeared, on Sunday morning, in his pew at church, that pew became the
                  centre of the church, and outmastered the choir and the pulpit!
               "Who is this woman that is better than all of us?" looked at least a score of girlish faces—and
                  another score of graver mother faces. Five or six in different parts of the house,
                  in the most grave and decorous manner, spoke or whispered, each to some neighbor,
                  an edifying comment, as follows:
               "How old should you take her to be?"
               "At least twenty-five."
               "Thirty! not a year less."
               "I don't think she cares much about dress; do you? She's rather too plain, if
                  anything."
               "Perhaps she depends on her manner. Do you notice how she rises, and sits
                  down?"
               "She comes up about to the doctor's shoulders, don't she? That's so sweet, always.
                  If ever I marry, I should want his name to be Augustus, and he should have blue
                  eyes, and my head should come just up to his shoulders. I think that would be so
                  dear."
               "Can you see her hands? Has she many rings?"
               "Do you know if the doctor got anything by her? Of course he don't need it. He's
                  got property enough of his own. But then I think it tends to peace in the family,
                  if both bring a little property. Money is of no use without piety. But, when a man
                  has grace in his heart and money in his pocket, then he can have peace both with
                  God and man."
               "I believe she's proud. I've watched her ever since she's come in. And she hasn't
                  looked around once. May be she thinks we aint worth looking at."
               "Well for my part, I don't think so. People don't come here to gape and stare, not
                  if they're Christians. I b'lieve she's pious. We shall know next sacrament-time.
                  If she comes to preparatory lecture and to sacrament, then you may know she's
                  pious."
               The sermon over and the services ended, the minister, the deacons, and a few of
                  the leading members, were introduced to the new comer. They hoped for a better
                  acquaintance. They should be happy to call. They hoped she was pleased with
                  Norwood. How did she like the church? Had she recovered from the fatigue of her
                  journey? Had she ever been in Norwood before? Deacon Trowbridge solemnly hoped she
                  would be strengthened to meet her responsibilities. And only spry and dry Deacon
                  Marble ventured on a compliment.
               "Well, ma'am, Dr. Wentworth allers was fond of flowers, and I knew he'd pick a
                  good one when he came to choose."
               If the people whispered a few covert opinions in church, it was a mere
                  first-fruits of that harvest which waved during the intermission. Except the
                  minister, the doctor was, undoubtedly, the most important man in Norwood.
               "Took us rather by surprise, Judge! Some folks thought the doctor needn't gone out
                  of town for a wife."
               "Perhaps it's of long standing. The doctor has a good deal of romance. But she is
                  of excellent family. I know them very well. Came over in the Mayflower."
               "Did she? Why, she don't look so old?"
               "Bless you, looks are deceiving," said Judge Bacon, his whole face looking amused
                  at Mr. Truman's misconception.
               Many there were that had a conscience about conversing on such themes upon Sunday.
                  Mr. Edwards and his sister walked in a stately and quiet manner, without a word;
                  and, as he carefully latched the gate, Dr. Wentworth and his wife were passing. Of
                  course, he heartily shook hands, but not a word did he speak, nor his sister,
                  after entering their tree-embosomed house. Sabbath reigned in their house and in
                  their hearts.
               The Miss Marshes, two sensible spinsters, found themselves among several
                  neighbors, all in full criticism. Various were the reports and the hungry
                  questions; but not a word could the plain old maids be got to say, good or
                  ill.
               "What do you think, Miss Anna?" said a neighbor to the eldest
                  sister.
               "I don't think anything about it."
               "But you noticed her, didn't you?"
               "No more than I did others. I hope to find her a pleasing person, when I shall
                  know her. Did you not think the sermon unusually instructive to-day?"
               "The sermon? Oh, yes; I'd most forgot about that. What was the text?
                  La me—I've forgot the text. My husband is sick, and I shall have to tell him about
                  the sermon. What was it,—something about—minding our own business, or
                  something—no doctrine—nothing but morality. Do tell me where the text was."
               Hiram Beers, as usual, had gathered about him a knot of young men around the
                  church door, and of those staying during the intermission termission, and quite a number of girls had been
                  drawn to hear what Hiram would say—for Hiram's speeches belonged to the whole
                  town.
               "I think the doctor is a love of a man; and oh, I should like to know about his
                  courtship."
               Hiram overheard the whisper in which a Miss of fifteen had said this to her
                  companion, and, assuming a confident air, he says:
               "Why, Matilda, I know all about it. I drove the doctor over, you know, and he told
                  me all about it!"
               "He did? Oh, do tell us!"
               "That I will—every word. You see the doctor meant to marry Miss Naxon, till he saw
                  Miss Ferris; and he might have decided between them, but then Miss
                  Greanleaf came to town, and then there was three of 'em! On lookin' into the
                  matter the doctor found that he liked them just alike, to a grain, and as the law
                  wouldn't let him marry all of 'em he couldn't take one without leaving two; and
                  that, you see, would have been two griefs to one joy—not a fair bargain. So he was
                  forced to go to Boston."
               "Why, what did he go to Boston for?"
               "Well, that's a pretty question! That's the only place to go to! Why, if a man
                  wants anything he allus goes to Boston. Everything goes there, just as natural as
                  if that city was the moon, and everything else was water, and had to go, like the
                  tides. Don't you know all the railroads go to Boston? and sailors say—you ask
                  Tommy 
                     Tafts
                     Taft
                  —if you start anywhere clear down in Floridy and keep up along the coast,
                  you will fetch up in Boston. They have to keep things tied up around there. They
                  fasten their trees down, and have their fences hitched, or they would all of 'em
                  whirl into Boston. They have watchers set every night, or so many things would
                  come to admire Boston that the city would be covered down like Herculaneum. Of
                  course the doctor went to Boston. Every single one of the first chop folks was
                  married off the week afore he got there, but one; there was just one left. But she
                  was the very best of the lot. The doctor saw her in Old South church. She was a
                  singing', 'Come ye disconsolate.' The minute she set her eyes on the doctor—"
               By this time the boys were snickering, and the girls giggling, and our
                  honest-faced little questioner began to doubt Hiram's authenticity. "Now, Hiram, I
                  don't believe a word you say."
               "Well, if you don't believe me, you just ask the doctor himself."
               "Not a smile was on his face. He looked at his listeners one by one with a
                  quizzical solemnity, for a second, and then, as one who remembered pressing duties
                  elsewhere, he walked away in exact imitation of the minister's gait.
               Deacon Marble expressed to his wife Polly his good impressions of the doctor's
                  wife, as they rode home in their rattling one-horse wagon.
               "I should be glad to see the old mansion looking life-like again, as it did when
                  Saltonstall was alive-fine old house. Mebbe too many trees round. The doctor sets
                  a store on the trees, though. But the old place will spruce up, I guess, with a
                  new wife."
               "That's a pretty speech, Deacon Marble, as if the doctor hadn't lived three years,
                  and had Agate Bissell for housekeeper, and a smarter and better you won't find if
                  you sarch the whole State. Anybody that takes her face has got to stir round. I'm
                  one that don't believe there'll ever be any better housekeeper in that old mansion
                  than Agate Bissell. There wasn't a chimney in town that smoked afore hers did in
                  the morning, and there wasn't one house kept cleaner. After she'd scrubbed a floor
                  you might eat your vitals off it, if it wasn't for the name of't. I don't believe
                  my pans are any cleaner, nor the milk any whiter than her rooms. And then it
                  wasn't any Pharisee-work. She ain't one of those folks that makes the outside
                  clean, and leaves the inside. It would do you good to look in her closets and
                  cupboards, and drawers and boxes. It was as good as a picture. I don't believe
                  there was a spider in the house, from cellar to garret. She was allers cleanin'
                  and lookin', and huntin' and rubbin'."
               "Yes Polly, I guess you're right. I've got a woman down to my house purtey much
                  the same sort. I kinder pity the dirt—it has a hard time in our house!"
               Even Polly was liable to temptation, and her face looked as it had forty years
                  ago, when compliments had brought a smile to it. But she was so thin—all nerve,
                  bone and skin—that smiles slipped off easily, and left the same anxious and
                  earnest face.
               "There's no wastin' where Agate Bissell is. She can make a cent go as far as most
                  folks' shillin'. She's had a hard time of it, too. The doctor's not particular,
                  and he wouldn't let her put his study
                  to-rights. You know it's a great room, running the whole depth of the house, and
                  full of books and stuff, and pictures, and engravings, and stacks of all sorts of
                  things, and the table full of rubbish, and chairs full of portfolios, and he'd
                  never let Agate Bissell touch 'em. It was awful.
               "'Nobody can tell,' she says to me, 'how I long to get in there.' The doctor'll
                  have much to answer for!"
               "Yes, yes, Agate Bissell is distressin' neat. The mice have a hard time in her
                  house—starved 'em out, I'm told—saved the cat's board by it. She is dreadful
                  particular!"
               There was something in the deacon's tone which did not suit his wife, and she
                  sharply edified him:
               "I wish you was half as particular, Deacon Marble, with your tongue as Agate
                  Bissell is with her hands. Then you wouldn't make such foolish speeches as you do.
                  You must needs compliment her, right in church, and afore the minister!"
               "I compliment her?"
               "Oh don't make strange of it. I heerd what you said about flowers. So did she.
                  Such kind of talk ain't thrown away. It sticks like burs, and makes folks think
                  you like 'em more'n you do. Talking roses and poses to the girls is not becomin'
                  in a deacon."
               The deacon gave his horse a cut with his whip, and, being spirited, the animal
                  suddenly sprang with a jerk that seemed likely to snap his wife's head off. If the
                  mischievous man meant to put an end to the discourse, which was likely, from this
                  point to become personal, he succeeded.
               How they ever made a deacon out of Jerry Marble I never could imagine! His was the
                  kindest heart that ever bubbled and ran over. He was elastic, tough, incessantly
                  active and a prodigious worker. He seemed never to tire but after the longest
                  day's toil, he sprang up the moment he had done with work, as if he were a fine
                  steel spring. A few hours' sleep sufficed him and he saw the morning stars the
                  year round. His weakened face was leather color, but forever dimpling and changing
                  to keep some sort of congruity between itself and his eyes, that winked and
                  blinked, and spilt over with merry good nature. He always seemed afflicted when
                  obliged to be sober. He had been known to laugh in meeting on several occasions,
                  although he ran his face behind his handkerchief kerchief and coughed, as if
                     that was the matter, yet nobody believed it. Once, in a hot summer
                  day, he saw Deacon Trowbridge, a sober and fat man of great sobriety, gradually
                  ascending from the bodily state into that spiritual condition called sleep. He was
                  blameless of the act. He had struggled against the temptation with the whole
                  virtue of a deacon. He had eaten two or three heads of fennel in vain and a piece
                  of orange peel. He had stirred himself up, and fixed his eyes on the minister with
                  intense firmness, only to have them grow gradually narrower and milder. If he held
                  his head up firmly, it would with a sudden lapse fall away over backward. If he
                  leaned it a little forward, it would drop suddenly into his bosom. At each nod,
                  recovering himself, he would nod again, with his eyes wide open, to impress upon
                  the boys that he did it on purpose both times.
               In what other painful event of life has a good man so little sympathy as when
                  overcome with sleep in meeting time? Against the insidious seduction he arrays
                  every conceivable resistance. He stands up awhile; he pinches himself, or pricks
                  himself with pins. He looks up helplessly to the pulpit as if some succor might
                  possibly come thence. He crosses his legs uncomfortably, and attempts to recite
                  catechism, or the multiplication table. He seizes a languid fan, which
                  treacherously leaves him in a calm. He tries to reason, to notice the phenomena.
                  Oh, that one could carry his pew to bed with him! What tossing wakefulness there!
                  what fiery chase after somnolency! In his lawful bed a man cannot sleep, and in
                  his pew he cannot keep awake! Happy man who does not sleep in church! Deacon
                  Trowbridge was not that man. Deacon Marble was!
               Deacon Marble witnessed the conflict we have sketched above, and when good Mr.
                  Trowbridge gave his next lurch, recovered himself with a snort and then drew out a
                  red handkerchief and blew his nose with a loud imitation as if to let the boys
                  know that he had not been asleep, poor Deacon Marble was brought to a sore strait.
                  But I have reason to think that he would have weathered the stress if it had not
                  been for a sweet-faced little boy in the front of the gallery. The lad had been
                  innocently watching the same scene, and at its climax laughed out loud, with a
                  frank and musical explosion, and then suddenly disappeared backward into his
                  mother's lap. That laugh was just too much, and Deacon Marble could no more help laughing than could
                  Deacon Trowbridge help sleeping. Nor could he conceal it. Though he coughed, and
                  put up his handkerchief and hemmed—it was a laugh—deacon!—and every
                  boy in the house knew it, and liked you better for it—so inexperienced were
                  they!
               Polly, his wife, was all that the deacon was not. No one had ever known her to
                  laugh. Her utmost indulgence amounted only to a pale and vanishing smile, which
                  looked more like a shadow crossing the face than sunlight upon it. Of a nervous,
                  bilious temperament, she was thin, acute, intense and earnest to the last atom of
                  her existence. There was no gradation or perspective in her conscience. The least
                  wrong was a full-sized sin; and the smallest sin was worse than we can measure.
                  Great sins were a terror for the future life, not for this. Of many edifying
                  instructions which at different times he received, we will select but one, which
                  occurred some years before Wentworth's marriage, but might, from its tenor, just
                  as well be inserted in connection with that event, or at any other period during a
                  score of years, for that matter.
               "Deacon Marble, I wonder what you think will become of you! Such levity in the
                  house of God is awful. I shouldn't wonder a minute if you was to be struck dead.
                  You know that the man was destroyed for pickin' up chips and sticks on Sunday, and
                  laughing is a good deal worse, especially in the house of God. I always said that
                  I couldn't imagine why they ever made you deacon—a man whose eyes and face are
                  always agoin' as if they were makin' fun of the sacred office."
               The image raised by these last words seemed to touch the deacon's sense of the
                  ludicrous, and he fell under the temptation again—though riding home, on Sunday,
                  in full sight of his neighbors.
               "I declare, Deacon Marble, you will bring reproach on religion." And looking at
                  him through her spectacles, whose glasses were about four times the size of the
                  eyes that snapped behind them, she continued—"I think deacon-timber was scarce
                  when they picked you out."
               "Mercy on us, Polly, I didn't make myself a deacon, and I didn't make myself,
                  anyhow. I 'spose I perform pretty much as I was built. But I never saw any harm in
                  laughing. If it's a sin, I can't see what the Lord lets so many funny things
                  happen for. I don't go and make things funny! They come to me. The whole world is
                  full of queer things, and it aint my fault if I see them."
               "That's your vain way. It don't seem to me that you can have any conscience about
                  laughing at improper times and things. I once heard you snicker at a funeral.
                  Besides, it leads to deceit. You know you hadn't any nose-bleed when you went out
                  of church last summer, holding your handkerchief all over your face. I saw what
                  'twas. You was looking at that naughty, wicked boy puttin' a piece of grass in
                  that man's ear, and he givin' himself a box on the ear—which he ought to have laid
                  on the boy's ear."
               Poor Marble went off into another burst, at the remembrance. "Why, Polly, he
                  thought it was a fly, and he raised his big hand so sly and cunning, to give the
                  fly a wipe, and hit his own ear,"—at which point he went off again into a chuckle,
                  producing a churning motion all over his body.
               Now, there was not another deacon in town that did so many good turns to those in
                  trouble; and though his infirmity was known, sick people liked to have the little,
                  spry old deacon Marble come to pray at their bedsides. And when Widow Nance's cow
                  died in calf, it was from Marble's yard, the very next night, that a cow was
                  driven, and put in her yard. All the poor old shacks about town found a friend in
                  Deacon Marble. This, too, was a source of much trouble to his guardian angel at
                  home.
               "I do believe you would rather spend your time with those shiftless reprobates
                  than with the Lord's own saints."
               "There's sartainly a pick among saints Polly; but those poor creeturs don't mean
                  any harm half the time; and nobody seeing to pity them, and everybody's always
                  pickin' at 'em and findin' fault with 'em. Somebody ought to have a kind side to
                  'em."
               "They should behave better, then. There's no excuse for wickedness.
                     'First pure, then peaceable,' deacon. That settles it. I wish you
                  was like Deacon Trowbridge. Did you ever see Pete, and Hiram Beers, and Ephe
                  Barnes, hanging round him? Do you believe he'd spend his money in givin'
                  gingerbread and fire-crackers to all the tatterdemalion boys, on trainin'
                  days?"
               Deacon Marble admitted facts. The very idea of such conduct seemed to raise a
                  picture before him unsuited to sobriety.
               
               "What are you laughing at now? You are as fall of levity as flies
                  are. Would you laugh if you was dying? I really believe you would! To think of it!
                  A deacon, at your time of life, chirpin' as if you was a cricket—and goin' round,
                  as if you was nothin' better'n a bird, singing and hopping', instead of being a
                  deacon, with an immortal soul in him! Sometimes I am afeerd you are in the gall of
                  bitterness yet. You ought to examine your evidences, deacon. Laughing is not one
                  of the signs of grace, I'm sure. It's awful to be deceived; and you've a good many
                  reasons to fear that you are deceiving yourself."
               Don't confound Mrs. Polly Marble with a mere scold. She was a woman of the utmost
                  worth. She was full as severe upon her own doings as upon those of her other self,
                  the deacon. She, too, was an excessive worker. Her vitality, if it were possible,
                  was greater than her husband's. When she had risen at four o'clock, and except at
                  meals and prayers had been on her feet every moment till night, up stairs and
                  down, in the dairy, in the cellar, in the barn, in the wood-house, in chamber and
                  kitchen, performing the multifarious duties of a farmer's wife with the most
                  anxious and conscientious fidelity, she seemed not to have lost a particle of
                  energy, but was still fresh, vital, and intense.
               Nor was Mrs. Polly Marble a mere drudge. She was inquisitive of everything that
                  went on in the world. She read the Missionary Herald every month, and the Boston
                  Recorder every week, without the omission of a line. She remembered whatever
                  passed in church. She rode every week into town for an afternoon female
                  prayer-meeting, and stayed to the night lecture, and yet no one could say that
                  aught was neglected, on these days, at home.
               Her domestic lectures must not, therefore, be confounded with those which spring
                  from irritableness, but must rank with the conscientious labors of anxious
                  natures, who feel conscientiously called to make the world better, and who use
                  their tongue as the most convenient instrument at hand.
               But this will never do! We have quite forgotten Dr. Wentworth and his happy
                  household. But so really happy were they all in that old mansion, that they never
                  seemed more mellow, genial and hospitable, than since this little child came, that
                  they would not have known it if the whole world had neglected them!
               Two years had passed busily and happily away, when the event occurred of which we
                  have spoken, in the fifth chapter, and a girl was given to the household. The
                  mother would call it Rose—for that was a favorite sister's name. The father called
                  it Rose, for that united her to the flowers he so much loved. Others called her
                  Rose because it was so sweet a name for a girl; and therefore she was named Rose
                  Wentworth!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VII.
               A MERRY CHAPTER.
               A WAGON loaded with empty barrels drove up to Tommy Taft's one morning.
               "Mr. Brett wants to know if you can fix those barrels to-day? The heads want
                  resetting, and all of 'em want hoops. These two, he says, want two iron hoops
                  apiece, besides the hickory."
               "Get away with your barrels! Do you think I'm going to work to-day? No, by Josey—I
                  don't as long as, 'I can read my title clear!' It would be just as wicked to work
                  today as if it was a Sabby day."
               "Why, what's the matter, Uncle Tommy?"
               "Matter enough—matter enough! We've got another baby! Old woman's up there now.
                  I'm goin' up to the prospect. Work? Not by a jug-full! Tumble off your barrels!
                  They won't spile afore to-morrow. Where's old Smasher? Come here, old fellow.
                  Let's go up to the doctor's."
               From such an address one would look to see some man appear as Uncle Tommy's
                  companion. But it was to his wooden leg that he addressed the endearing epithet of
                  old Smasher.
               Tommy Taft was about forty-five years old. A big head he had, round, and bald down
                  to the top of his ears, but at that point, for some reason, the hair refused to
                  retreat, and sprang up with such vigor that it looked like an abattis; as if the hair, driven down from the heights, determined to make a
                  stand and fight for its fights. His eyes were small, gray, sunk deeply beneath
                  bold eyebrows, whose hair was wonderfully luxuriant, curling over, and standing
                  out, in immense profusion. A big nose, that hung on his face like an old-fashioned
                  door-knocker, and a wide mouth, completed his portrait, which was framed in by
                  bushy whiskers, carried under his chin, leaving the chin and both lips shorn
                  smooth. His voice was rough and deep, and his manner, of all sorts that ever were
                  found in man, except, always, a refined manner. He had been a sailor all his long
                  life, and brought inland into this quiet village, all the odd and outlandish ways
                  which a sea-faring life, in olden times, was wont to breed.
               Why is it that children take to these great shaggy natures seemingly attracted by
                  those very appearances which would seem likely to repel them? Children act by
                  sympathy. A warm heart attracts them, and when once a child's
                  confidence is gained, these rudenesses of person become agreeable, as something
                  out of the common way. It is that element in manners or person, which the heart
                  inspires, that wins children.
               Who in the village did not like Tommy? Not a child under fifteen, certainly. His
                  poor old shop and house was the fascination of all the young folks of the village
                  and of the country round. The ground floor was a cooper shop and general tinkering
                  establishment; up stairs were two rooms, plain to rudeness, and as rough in
                  furnishing as if they had been hewed out and fitted by a sailor's axe on a
                  desolate island after a shipwreck, and of as ill-assorted materials as a shipwreck
                  would be apt to cast up. Yet, there was an indescribable air of comfort and peace
                  in the two rooms.
               When Uncle Tommy was good nature he seemed always to be comically in sympathy with
                  his wife, in external things. He was always good nature when he was sober. He was
                  sober nearly nine-tenths of his time. When these infrequent moods were on him he
                  was apt to be profane, but never blasphemous or foul. He alternated, during such
                  excesses, between scolding his wife, and religious exercises of various kinds.
               "It's as good as a play," said Hiram, "to hear Uncle Tommy when he gets the steam
                  up."
               But as soon as he recovered from his aberration, Tommy came down from his height
                  of morality and religion, and became gracious and helpful, with a rough
                  disinterestedness which was quite touching. All the children repaired to him, to
                  have their toys mended, for which he could never be persuaded to take a penny.
                  Boys' knives with broken backs or blades or handles, went into hospital with him;
                  their skates and sleds in winter, and their kites, and traps, and gun-locks in
                  summer, were his peculiar charge, and his invariable answer was, "Oh, we mustn't
                  charge children anything." The cheery old fellow was full of quips and pranks, of
                  stories of adventure, drawn from his former sea-faring faring life, or from the full volume of sailors'
                  yarns, which had accumulated in his long years of cruising. While he was willing
                  to take compensation from grown people, he was sure to reject any attempt on the
                  parents' part to require him by overpayment for his services to their
                  children.
               He was known, too, to perform services for those poorer than himself, who were
                  also more helpless. An old black woman who lived by "washing," had fallen sick
                  with rheumatism; Uncle Tommy was heard every evening for a week, sawing away
                  busily at her wood, until he had provided enough for her needs. A gate that had
                  got unhinged, would some morning be found safely tinkered back to its duty.
               If a poor creature's bucket was going to pieces, in some mysterious manner it got
                  to itself a new hoop, and the pail was secured again, by a rivet in the ear. The
                  pump-pin was replaced when lost by a new one. These and such like services he
                  delighted to render freely to those who were comparatively helpless.
               The jolly old fellow had a wink and a word for everybody, and his passage through
                  the street was celebrated by a stirring, merry out-burst, and to everybody
                  according to his kind.
               It was impossible to separate between his humor and earnestness, between
                  conviction and waggery.
               Good Parson Buell sometimes visited his shop in the regular rounds of parochial
                  duty, and attempted to talk faithfully with him. Tommy owned every thing—made no
                  resistance—yea, went before the minister and beyond him, in self-accusations.
               "Do you not feel that you are a sinner?"
               "I know that I am, parson, a sinner—an awful sinner; and without excuse. I live
                  below my privileges; I don't live up to my light and knowledge. To set under such
                  preaching as I do, Parson Buell, and not to be better'n I am, is a great sin; and
                  I'm afeard that I get harder and harder, and that I am putting off the day of
                  repentance, and sinnin' away my opportunities, and wasting' my day of grace. It is
                  a surprisin' thing in me! I don't wonder that you are alarmed at my case, parson.
                  It is a very alarmin' case—I know it is. It has been alarmin' for more'n forty
                  years. I ought to repent, that's sartain! Why shouldn't I? It is well said that it
                  is time for sinners to be surprise in Zion. The rest of the varse too, is very
                  alarmin'. 'Who among us shall dwell with devourin' fire, and who among us shall
                  dwell with everlastin' burnings?' It is sartinly time that I should repent of my
                  evil thoughts, and my drinkin', and of my swearin', and of my manifold evil ways
                  and deeds, and I hope, parson, you will pray for me."
               This and such like speeches were not said with the slightest accent of drollery
                  and still less of scoffing. Dr. Buell himself could not have uttered them in a
                  manner more entirely proper. He never seemed in haste to finish the conversation.
                  He would follow the parson to the gate, still descanting on the sinfulness of sin
                  and admitting every argument, and bringing it home upon himself with such a zeal
                  that Dr. Buell found nothing to do. As the good man left, an indescribable sense
                  of mirth twinkled in Tommy's eyes, and happy was the child that needed his
                  services after a visit from his pastor. He laughed and bubbled over with fun and
                  contrived some new plaything, or rejoiced the urchin with some queer story, and
                  sent him home happy as a king!
               Tommy Taft was always a sailor. Among other notions was that of eating with his
                  sheath-knife, which was an exaggerated jack-knife with a hole bored in the handle
                  and tied to his belt which he wore instead of suspenders, by a long yarn or
                  string. At table he would draw out old Rouser, as he named it, and
                  refuse any other knife.
               Could any contrast be greater than his wife? Gentle, patient happy, with an
                  undertone of sadness, which was a shadow to the high light; refined in expression,
                  delicate in action. She seemed like a morning glory that had run up on the knots
                  and rugged bark of an oak tree. Whatever rough usage she received at his hands,
                  none ever knew of it from her; whatever discrepancy or uncongeniality there might
                  be between them, there was no sign of it.
               Every day, when her home duties were done, Mother Taft slipped forth for an hour
                  to see some person in trouble. She had a remarkable instinct in finding out
                  trouble. Better than a physician or the nurse, she know who was sick. Better than
                  the clergyman, she knew who was in sorrow. Nor is it extravagant to say, that,
                  better than all these, she knew the art of bringing consolation to those who were
                  in sorrow. Whatever the history of her own past life, her victory had made her a
                  leader for others in the dark land.
               When Widow Barnes' only boy was brought home dead, flung from a horse in a drunken
                  race, on a muster-day, the first person
                  who came after his companions had laid him down, was Mother Taft. All that night
                  she was with her—in silence herself—doing everything, listening to the mother's
                  distracted utterances, keeping away intrusive curiosity; and with exquisite
                  instinct, encouraging her grief, that it might spend itself, and be the sooner
                  comforted.
               When Maggie Keech had been turned out of her father's house, it was Mother Taft
                  that went after her, and brought her to her own chambers and nursed her in her
                  sickness, and when she was again strong enough to work, secured for her, in a
                  neighboring town, a place. Happily, the babe had died.
               Go where you would, you would soon meet Mother Taft there, if there was trouble.
                  Like Uncle Tommy, she received wages of the prosperous, but of those in moderate
                  circumstances, nothing would she take. She served others for the reason that birds
                  sing, because she loved to; for the reason that dews fall upon flowers, because
                  such is the nature which the heavens gave it. Born in the air, the dew hides in
                  the daytime, but comes to all things in their night and darkness to deck them in
                  beauty.
               How odd that she should ever have married such a man! But they were so utterly
                  unlike that she could not help it. Her peacefulness felt the attraction of his
                  great, boisterous way. Her silence marvelled at his elemental talk, which rained,
                  and blew, and at times burst out into squalls, as if his mouth were the very cave
                  of the winds. Her trustful simplicity admired his shrewdness and penetration of
                  human nature. Her literal soul that never conceived a jest, nor understood wit or
                  humor, how could it help going to a nature whose every sentence was so balanced
                  that it might be taken either way—earnest or ironical?
               In one of these New England villages, there is nothing so original and racy as a
                  great strong nature that dares to say just what it thinks. Common people are
                  restrained by law, by moral teachings, by public, sentiment by interest by fear.
                  Their real thoughts are smothered, or kept alive in silence. They dare not coin
                  them into words and put them in circulation. They become so used to caution and
                  social conformity, that they cease at length to know how much each man is the echo
                  of the other.
               Then comes along a great-footed man, like an elephant, with nothing to gain or
                  lose by men's opinions, and determined to say what he has a mind to.
               He runs against custom, throws down the fences, plunges across gardens and fields!
                  If, however, he has a human heart, and at bottom is just and kind, men come to
                  admire his audacity, and to enjoy his blunt speeches, especially if he have great
                  faults. Men's infirmities are the strongest bonds of sympathy. No matter how much
                  better a man is than we he shall be forgiven if he is also some things a great
                  deal weaker than we. Uncle Tommy was poor—that was one good fault; he was never
                  "overcome," but sometimes he was "exalted" by strong drink—that was another
                  redeeming fault. Being a sinner, men forgave his liberties!
               "No work, to-day. Tell old Brett, if he don't like it, to cooper his own barrels!
                  We've got a baby, up at the doctors. I'm going to put on Smasher, and go up and
                  see how things are gettin' on."
               Soon he bolted out upon the street, and, on coming up to the corner, Hiram Beers
                  shouted out across the street:
               "Halloo, old Dot-and-Go-One! where are you bound?"
               "Better put a snaffle-bit in your mouth, my old jockey, to hold that tongue of
                  yours. They say you opened singin'-school for the crows, Hiram, and they wouldn't
                  come, 'cos it made their voices rough irritating yours—did ye?"
               Hiram looked up the street, as if listening to something in the road, and then,
                  with a look of feigned surprise, said:
               "Why, I thought I heard a two-hoss wagon runnin' away. Was that your leg, Tommy,
                  making such a rattle? Why don't you ile it? When you go along the street, I should
                  think a hundred cupboard-doors were caught in a gale of wind!"
               Having thus exchanged amiable salutations, Hiram came over. "How are you, old
                  customer, anyhow?"
               "Jolly as a crew just paid off. Goin' down to see my lady. Old woman been down
                  there for a month—child born two days ago—goin' down to see it."
               All the children born under the administration of Mother Taft, Tommy considered as
                  belonging to his family, and always spoke of them as his own. A stranger would
                  bear him recount his children with amazement at the extent of his parentage.
               A little further on one might have heard, loud enough for a deaf man's ears, a new
                  salutation.
               "Good morning, Parson Buell, good morning! You're looking well. Study too much, I
                  expect; but ye stand it well. Good sermons mons ain't drawn up easy as buckets of water! Have to work for 'em. Mighty
                  sermon that, Sunday morning! This old sinner felt it. Says I, 'if there wasn't
                  another soul that knew it, there was two in that audience that knew what a good
                  sermon was, and that was Parson Buell and Tommy Taft!' Am goin' down to
                  Wentworth's. Wouldn't you like to go? I'm not ashamed to be seen walkin' with you!
                  You see, I can get you in. Wouldn't let common folks in so early. But Ma'am Taft,
                  you know, has advantages, and will give us a sight."
               Then, his voice changing and lowering, he added:
               "Parson Buell, it's the unaccountablest thing what the Lord sends children into
                  this world for, considering what sort of a place 'tis, and what a time folks have
                  in gettin' thro' it. Lord! They die off like apple-blossoms, half on 'em, afore
                  they're bigger'n mice. And the rest of 'em have a hard time gittin' grown, and
                  when you've got 'em growled, half the folks are paddling round as if they didn't
                  exactly know what they come on airth for; and nobody can tell 'em, for that
                  matter. I never see babies but I think how we used to have birds come aboard ship,
                  way out to sea—landbirds, and so tired, poor little things, and
                  hungry. You could go up to 'em and take 'em in your hand, and they turned up their
                  bright eyes with such a piteous look at you, as if they had come from ever so far,
                  and lost their way, and didn't know where they were. Wall, that's about what I
                  think of babies. What do they come off to this 'ere world for? Why don't they stay
                  where they're well off?"
               Buell was well used to all Tommy Taft's vagaries, and he had that good sense and
                  tact among men which enabled him to take every one in his own way; so he walked
                  onward with Uncle Tommy to Dr. Wentworth's gate, talking just enough to avoid a
                  conversation.
               Uncle Tommy's expectations were fully realized. Though visitors were not yet
                  expected, yet Mother Taft proved a friend at court. Parson Buell had humored queer
                  Tommy Taft, not expecting that he would succeed. When he found himself invited in,
                  he feign would decline. Tommy would not allow it. "Never'll do in the world,
                  Parson; shouldn't have come so far, if you didn't mean to go further. Can't got
                  away now. Must go in if ye're civil."
               "But, Taft," said the perplexed worthy, "I have another errand. You must excuse
                  me."
               "Parson Buell, you know excuses are dangerous. You shouldn't shirk your duty.
                  Duties never conflict, you said, only Sabby-day morning last. Don't you remember?
                  Hope you don't forget your own sermons Parson. That's other folks' business."
               And so, like a slow ship with a tug pulling away at its side, Buell found himself,
                  half laughing and half vexed, ushered in by Tommy under circumstances slightly
                  inclining to the ludicrous.
               The babe was brought down by Mother Taft, Agate Bissell following. She was now
                  again housekeeper, as she had been prime minister to Mrs. Wentworth ever since her
                  arrival in Norwood. For, in this tall, slender New-England woman, she discerned
                  from the first, an amount of energy, conscientious fidelity, and real affection,
                  which paid a thousand times over for the inconveniences arising from her hard
                  manner her inflexible precision, and her despotic regularity.
               Tommy seized the babe from his wife's arms and fairly danced with delight. He
                  chuckled, and chirruped, and Ho-ho'd, as if his reason had left him. Rough as he
                  was, no nurse ever held a babe more tenderly and dextrously.
               But when he suddenly thrust it upon Parson Buell, who was talking with stately
                  Agate Bissell, the good minister held it in his hands as if it was something which
                  he dared not drop and could not hold.
               "Why, what's the matter?" said Tommy, "is it hot that ye are so awkward about
                  it?"
               Mother Taft came to his relief, and the good minister, leaving messages of
                  kindness was glad to get away from the office of a nurse, and, full as much, from
                  the officious humor of Tommy Taft, who however followed him to the very door.
               "A good baby, parson, but come to a poor world—a sinful world. If it had known
                  what's good for itself, it had better staid away. P'rhaps it wern't asked about
                  it! Very likely. But we must make the best on't now."
               Turning back from the door, Uncle Tommy found Agate Bissell ready to express her
                  mind.
               "Taft, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. You stick to that good man like a burr. You've no more respect for
                  your betters than a bull has for good manners."
               "What now, Miss Bissell?" said Taft, with an innocent and injured look; "would you
                  have me run away from the minister?"
               "No—but you had no need to make a nurse of him, and make him feel ridiculous with
                  this baby in his arms."
               "He did look ridiculous, didn't he?" said Tommy, with a joyous
                  acquiescence.
               "Of course he don't know how to tend babies. If it had been a book he could have
                  handled it, I warrant ye."
               "What a pity," said Uncle Tommy, with a very sober air, "that babies weren't born
                  like books. Then they wouldn't trouble any body—could put 'em up on a shelf, have
                  'em always dry—take 'em down when you want to use 'em—never grow any bigger—no
                  trouble to anybody."
               "What do you know about 'em?" said Agate, with great precision. "Children are from
                  the Lord, and they come on his errands and in such manner as pleases him. And it
                  don't please him to send them by men. Naturally, a baby is a woman's
                  care, and men are always awkward about such things. Everything in its place."
               "But don't you think, Miss Bissell, that if they come on the Lord's warrants, they
                  forget what they come for, afore they get far along? If the Lord's got any
                  warrants, seems to me he ought to send something better'n these little creeturs,
                  that keep two or three folks busy the best part of their time for two or three
                  years, and then die off their hands."
               "It's a pity that a baby didn't die about the time you were small," said Agate
                  Bissell, straightening up, and turning somewhat scornfully away from Tommy to his
                  wife, who, good soul, sat quietly by, as if the conversation was merely a little
                  wind out of the window, whistling through the sweet brier bushes.
               "There'd have been lots of crying and sobbin' if I had died young," said Uncle
                  Tommy with a wink at his antagonist.
               Nothing ever provoked Agate Bissell so much as one of Uncle Tommy's winks. She
                  deigned neither a word nor a look—but walked out of the room, pale and straight as
                  a candle, and as if she thought that with her all the light would go out too.
               Mother Taft mildly expostulated. "Father, what do you love to provoke her for?
                  She's so good."
               "I'd as lief tend flowers with a crowbar as to have one of them old maids about
                  with little babies. I wonder she don't take the little creetur in her work-bag and
                  walk off to prayer meetin' with it! You need to watch her, mother, or she'll bile
                  down a catechism instead of mint or catnip, when the child has wind."
               And with that he insisted on another look at Rose, who lay sleeping as unconscious
                  of all this whir of talk, as a rosebud in March, hidden deep in the bush, is of
                  the tough winds. The old man really looked beautiful as he gazed on the child, and
                  his face seemed to catch something of the purity and brightness of childhood.
               How strangely such a tender spot appears in an old, rude nature like Tommy's.
                  Rough in speech, audacious in manner, a non-conformist to all the customs of
                  society, yet, for children, showing a rich and wonderful love, that cast its light
                  over all his faults, and left something of beauty upon them!
               So an old oak tree—too old for acorns, too old for leaves, almost dead, rugged and
                  vast, yet bears up on its shaggy branches bunches of vivid green mistletoe most
                  beautiful—rejoicing as if decay and death were better to it than life.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VIII.
               A SOBER CHAPTER.
               FOR months little Rose lay sleeping for the greatest part of the time, folded up
                  in the finest wool, waking into good nature for an hour and then gently sinking
                  back into the land of sleep and dreams. The doctor came often to the unconscious
                  little creature as she lay upon Mother Taft's lap, and gazed upon her in silence
                  and deep thought, as if he expected some revelation from her face. He waited for
                  signs of intelligence as one waits for a star to arise.
               "She is a rose indeed, Doctor," said Mother Taft—"is she not?"
               "A moss-rose, if you call these blankets the moss, and its face like the tiny bud
                  in which no color yet begins to appear."
               "Ah, well, children don't come up blossom first like hyacinths, and that great red
                  amaryllis. They are like laylocks and honeysuckles, that grow a year or two before
                  they get a place for blossoms to stand on."
               And with that the good dame brought up the blanket about the baby's face like a
                  hood, kissing the little red lips, which, by the way, she did with every
                  operation, as if kisses were pins, to hold fast each plait and fold and tuck.
               As the child began to dawn into consciousness more and more, the father's spirit
                  seemed to hover about her, waiting, like one before a door, for some one to come
                  forth. As the summer warmed, she was often carried by him upon short rides.
               "I am expecting, my dear," said his wife, "that one of these days you will
                  prescribe that child to some patient, instead of medicine."
               "She is food and medicine to me, at any rate. I have two lives now."
               "Ah, and then you do not count me?"
               "Certainly—you and I count one, and Rose makes two."
               A vast elm grew upon the eastern side of his dwelling, not far from a clear brook,
                  which made its way from the hills down through the Meadows to the Connecticut
                  river. On this rich soil and near a copious supply of water, which the elm so much
                  loves, it had become one of those immense domes of which almost every New-England
                  village has one at least, but in which Norwood was peculiarly rich. The huge trunk
                  rose some fifteen feet before dividing, and then sent off a number of separate
                  stems, each one of which, might if alone constitute a large tree. These, still
                  subdividing, at last spread out into a vast concave, and the pendulous branches,
                  with graceful curves, returning on every side, like a network of cords wound
                  around with green leaves, almost swept the ground. Under this vast cope, whose top
                  was full of sunlight, while cool shadows lay upon the ground, the doctor loved to
                  sit, when days of leisure gave him rest, and especially upon summer Sunday
                  afternoons with Rose lying upon his lap—or both of them upon the ground, she on a
                  blanket and he upon the grass.
               It was there, on a bright Wednesday in July, when Rose was now more than a year
                  old, that Parson Buell found him in the garden watching the child. Birds overhead
                  were flying from branch to branch or conferring in a familiar way about household
                  matters, coquetting or whirling forth in love wrangles, while a vireo in the
                  topmost tuft, quite hidden, sat singing by the half-hour its perpetual melody,
                  whistled in phrases and recurring bits like short sentences in a music lesson.
               They fell into discourse about the child; then about the origin of the soul, the
                  minister affirming that nothing definite could be found in the Bible respecting
                  it, and that learned divines had been exercised in mind and divided in opinions
                  about it. The doctor said that no light had been thrown upon it in the researches
                  of physiologists. For himself, he had a constitutional horror of the notion that
                  the mind was material,. came with the body, as a rose with the bush, and died with
                  the body, as a flower with its stem. In the long gradations of creation matter
                  grew to finer and finer organization and subtler uses but there came a point at
                  which it touched something higher than itself, spiritual existence, not to be
                  known by the senses—which can only act in their own province of matter—but to be
                  discerned by the soul, which could recognize its own existence and had intuition
                  of the spiritual element in creation.
               "It is remarkable, Doctor, that you, a physiologist, should incline to the
                  spiritual faith, while Judge Bacon, of sound education, and not given to the physical sciences, should hold, as
                  I suspect he does the physical theory of mind."
               "Judge Bacon has no ideality. Imagination is the very marrow of
                  faith."
               "But you have often told me that I had no ideality—whatever that may mean. How is
                  it that the deficiency does not work in the same direction in both cases?"
               "It does. You may differ in regard to facts and convictions, but both of you
                  insist upon reducing all truth to some material equivalent before you are subject
                  to conviction. A truth which does not admit of a logical statement, seems to you a
                  phantasy. You believe not upon any evidence in your spirit, but upon the
                  semi-material form which language and philosophies statements give to thought. The
                  further you can bring a truth from its spiritual condition, and the more nearly it
                  is incarnated, the more satisfactory is to you the evidence of its existence. But,
                  with me, I accept facts which appeal to my senses as the lowest possible truth,
                  and as appealing to the lowest avenue of my mind. Nature is more than a vast
                  congeries of physical facts, related to each other as cause and effect and
                  signifying nothing else."
               "What is signified, then, in your theory?"
               "I have no theory. I have an irregular and fitful conviction that there are great
                  truths of the affections seeking an inlet upon men, which flow from God, and which
                  reach men, rightly sensitive, through the doings and appearances of what we call
                  Nature."
               "Pray give me an inkling, Doctor; for if you can get more from nature than I do,
                  perhaps you can teach me how to help myself in the same way."
               "Look at Rose, Dr. Buell, with her hand full of dandelions. Don't you see that a
                  beam of sunlight has struck through the leaves, and is pouring gold on the child's
                  head? See her wink, and puzzle, the darling!"
               "What does that sunlight mean to her?"
               "Nothing, except to her skin; and there it means trouble and annoyance. But to you
                  and to me, it means beauty. It lies speckling all the ground around her. It moves
                  with the leaves as if it had a life of its own. It kindles beauty out of
                  homeliness itself if it but touches it."
               "What then?"
               "There is more meaning in sunlight than a child knows, or can know."
               "More meaning? That is, I suppose, there are effects which the child
                  does not notice, or appreciate."
               "Do you believe that the sunlight can produce any effect not provided for in its
                  original constitution? You believe that God created it. Did he not know and design
                  every element, and every effect?"
               "Surely: surely I believe it."
               "Of course you believe it, in a general and abstract manner. Look through these
                  evergreens! See that clump of hollyhocks, white on yellow, and rose on crimson, so
                  they stand, and the light falls on them alone, through that opening among the
                  trees. They are transfigured. The light seems to palpitate upon them, and on the
                  crimson blossom it fairly trembles! Is that all mere materiality? Is there no
                  moral around them?"
               "You don't mean that a hollyhock is a moral and accountable being? It is an
                  unreasoning and unconscious thing, acted upon, but not acting."
               "Hold! Does it not act? Does it not send sheets of light to my eyes? Does not that
                  raise up a thousand fancies and yearnings? Do I not, in its exquisite effects,
                  almost see through matter, and into the other life? And is not that clump, with
                  its atmosphere of light, the instrument producing such effects? And when God
                  created light and flowers, did he not know what power it was possible that they
                  could exert upon human souls, and design that they should do it? They have a moral
                  function, even if they have no moral nature!"
               "I understand you, doctor. You hold that there are two kinds of moral agents—one
                  conscious and voluntary, and the other unconscious and involuntary. But how many
                  do you suppose in this town, besides yourself, ever saw or thought of such things
                  in a hollyhock bush? It is mere fancy. It is not sober fact."
               "Fancy is itself a fact, just as much as an argument, a leaf or a stone. God made
                  the soul to be played upon by its fellows, by the whole round of visible nature,
                  by invisible things, and more than all, by Himself. If shaking leaves stir up the
                  soul, there was a power in them to do it, as much as in the soul to be agitated. I
                  insist on a living, divine power in physical things. Why should men be so anxious to degrade nature? Is it
                  unsafe to believe that God's eye follows every sparrow, and that his taste unrolls
                  every flower, and that his feelings have an alphabetic expression in all natural
                  forms, harmonies, colors, contrasts and affinities?"
               "But if this were so would there be so few even of educated men who derive any
                  influence from those things?"
               "I will answer you by asking: If the Bible is God's word, declaring his counsel,
                  as we both believe, would there, out of ten hundred million people on the globe,
                  be less probably than a hundred million that derive a single influence from it? In
                  both cases, eyes have they, but they see not."
               For a long time, Dr. Buell sat silent and thoughtful. Had it been a logical
                  statement or the true meaning of a line of Scriptural texts, he would have been
                  full of resources of argument. But, deficient in imagination, and trained to
                  reject it in all investigations as an element of error, he yet could not but
                  perceive that Dr. Wentworth, by its ministration, found in Nature a ground for
                  religious faith which he did not while at the same time he reverently accepted and
                  eminently exemplified the teachings of the New Testament.
               He rose and walked for a few moments along the edges of the shadow, where the gold
                  sunlight and the leaf-shadows played a game of reprisals, back and forth, taking
                  and retaking the ground from each other with noiseless conflict, until he had
                  compassed the circuit of the great elm.
               "Doctor, there may be something in your views. When you state them they strike me
                  as having substance; but when I attempt of myself to think of them, they melt in
                  my hands. When you say that natural objects have moral ends, you do not mean that
                  they constitute a part of the commands, motives, and intelligent duties included
                  in moral government?"
               "I surely believe that they supplement these things. Physical laws are divine
                  commands, and so far they are a part of moral government. Whatever affects a man's
                  soul is, for the time being, moral influence. The advent of Christ may be a more
                  august and immensely more fruitful influence than the breaking forth of a lily
                  from the ground; but when our Saviour said, 'Behold, the lilies! lilies were
                  ordained to act a part in morals."
               "Do you think that a flower, in and of itself, has any moral meaning?"
               "Do you think that words, in and of themselves, have any signification? Words mean
                  whatever they have the power to make us think of when we look on them. Flowers
                  mean what sentiment they have the power to produce in us. The image which a flower
                  casts upon a sensitive plate is simply its own self-form; but, cast upon a more
                  sensitive human soul, it leaves there not mere form, but feeling, excitement,
                  suggestion. God gave it power to do that, or it would not have done it."
               "Is not this mysticism, Doctor, rather than common sense? I confess that I
                  perceive in plants a relation to matter, to my senses, and to practical uses; but
                  when you make them preach or teach, or do duty as moralists, unless you mean it in
                  a metaphorical way, I am puzzled."
               "Yonder is my bed of hyacinths, now out of blossom, and filled up between their
                  rows are my tiger flowers, yellow and red, every day and all summer blossoming, or
                  they would blossom if the moles did not eat up the bulbs at such a
                  fearful rate! These underground radical! you can hardly rid a garden of them, when
                  once they become numerous and neighborly. No matter about that. What I was going
                  to say was, that I consider a mole's opinion of the structures and uses of my
                  hyacinths to be very much like—well excuse me,—like most folks' notions of moral
                  truth! The moles see the bottom and nothing else. Imagine a mole forming a
                  philosophical theory of my bulbs. In mole's language, whatever that is, he would
                  say: 'a hyacinth is a vegetable creation put underground for the benefit of moles.
                  It is round, of a sweetish taste, quite juicy, and wholesome for moles. It has
                  been held by some mole's that a hyacinth has an existence above ground, and
                  speculatists have gone so far as to say that this root is only a kind of starting
                  point, while the best part of the plant is above ground. But there is no evidence
                  of that, and it is doubtless a vagary of the imagination.
               The minister could not help laughing at this fable.
               "I admit so much of this," said he, "that truths may have only their bulbs in this
                  world, and their stems and blossoms higher up: but, even so, how are we to know
                  anything about these fragrant blossoms it they are in another medium
                  and above our reach or investigation?"
               
               The first step toward knowing is to be conscious of not knowing. If truth can be
                  sufficiently learned through our senses, we shall take no further pains, and be
                  content with a little, as if it were the whole."
               "But admit, Doctor, that nature is full of some hidden meanings, as you call them,
                  how will you detect them? How will you distinguish between a mere fancy and a
                  substantial reality?"
               "Is a thought necessarily any truer than an imagination? Is a thought anything but
                  the impression produced upon a faculty by a certain kind of truth? Is not an
                  imagination the impression produced upon another faculty by another kind of truth?
                  Is not sight as much a sensation as hearing? And is not the report of one faculty
                  to be taken for truth, each in its kind, as much as that of another?
               "It takes five senses to report to us all the qualities of matter. It takes twice
                  as many mental faculties to determine all the properties and relations of a truth.
                  Knowledge is (like white light) that condition of mind which is produced at the
                  point where all the faculties on which a truth falls join their reports."
               "And so you would regard the imagination as needful to a scientific
                  investigation?"
               No man without imagination can by any possibility be an acute observer, nor a
                  sound reasoner even upon physical facts, still less upon truths which involve some
                  mental qualities."
               "Do you think then that poets are our best philosophers theologins, legists, and
                     savans?"
               "There is scarcely a great poet who would not have been eminent as philosopher or
                  theologian. There is not one theologian or philosopher in history who had not in
                  him the elements of a poet. And he is indebted for fame to those very elements of
                  poetry. His special dogmas may have perished from out of men's belief. But the
                  great truths of emotion, expressed with poetic feeling, live on. This is the
                  universal and immortal part. No man can express the great truths of
                  human life without employing all his moral and æsthetic nature. No man ever
                  delivers great truths worthily without rising into eloquence and even into
                  poetry."
               "What do you understand to be the difference between prose, eloquence and
                  poetry?"
               "Prose is the work-day dress in which truths do secular duty. Poetry is the robe,
                  the royal apparel, in which truth asserts its divine origin. Prose is truth
                  looking on the ground: eloquence is truth looking up to heaven. Poetry is truth
                  flying upward toward God!"
               "Your version is itself poetic, but not philosophical. You give me a picture, not
                  a discrimination and definition."
               "Well, common prose is the language of the intellectual faculties, acting without
                  fidelity. When you add the fire and figures which the imagination inspires, it is
                  eloquence. If now you give it musical qualities, in time, flow, and rhyme, it is
                  poetry. Or, again, when human truths are spoken as they exist in their physical
                  relations, that is prose, science, or whatever you choose to call it. Add now the
                  element of inspiration, raise the same truths into the light of those faculties
                  which are distinctively spiritual and divine, and you have poetry, and this is the
                  highest form of good sense, or reason in its nobler sphere."
               "Apply this criticism, Doctor, to your notions of flowers and scenery."
               "It scarcely needs it. It is not poetry to say that that part of universal life
                  which belongs to the vegetable kingdom has a moral relation to human beings,
                  proved by the effects which it has shown itself capable of producing on fine
                  natures, and for which, it is strictly philosophical to infer, they were adapted.
                  That so few perceive it, or experience it consciously, is no more a presumption
                  against its nature and proper uses than the indifference of mankind to the
                  movements of the planets is evidence that our seasons do not arise from stellar
                  revolutions."
               "Doctor, I cannot fairly say that I believe your notions or even understand them.
                  They give you great comfort. You are far happier than I am. I do not know as that
                  is, however, any presumption in your favor."
               "I am happy—exceedingly happy. One condition of it is of course,
                  perfect physical health. The body is like a piano, and happiness is like music. It
                  is needful to have the instrument in good order. But that is but a beginning.
                  Something must play upon the instrument. And who performs, and from
                  what musical score, will determine the character of the concert. Chickering's
                  grandest grand piano, with a fool playing jigs on it, is not so good as an old
                  harpsichord with Beethoven at the keys."
               
               "Go on—make your application."
               "Well, to be plain, I do not think that you are happy, because it does not seem to
                  me that you hold converse with those truths which insure happiness. Your God is
                  historic—mine is living. Your God is in a temple—mine every where. You have
                  excogitated and built up, element by element, attribute by attribute, a conception
                  of God, to which by resolute concentration you direct your thoughts, without help
                  in symbol, natural object, or any instrument whatever, but wholly by will-force.
                  Now and then there will arise out of this stretching void some dim image or sense
                  of Divinity. But even at that your conscience, not love, clothes Him. You have
                  little help from your affections; less from fidelity; none from taste and beauty;
                  and, really, you worship an abstract thought—a mere projection of an
                     idea—not a whole Mind, a Living Being! You and I
                  worship the same Being, and agree in the main as to the moral elements which glow
                  in His nature; but we differ practically in our way of reaching Him."
               "I find God in Christ the Saviour. I seek Him in prayer, in meditation, and in His
                  Word."
               "Thus do I also. But not so only. By the light of His Word I seek Him, in a living
                  form, outside of His Word. God is revealed in Christ as a man. Now, whatever in
                  man or child, in their noblest moments, when their fervent affection upon some
                  unselfish inspiration breaks forth into unusual and ethereal forms, seems to me
                  more than a suggestion of divinity. I see flashing from these experiences the very
                  feeling of God. Thus I can interpret Scripture with vivid insight. There is a
                  perpetual commentary upon the New Testament running through human life, and you
                  are afraid to read it!
               "But besides the endless interpretations which the human soul is unfolding, the
                  whole natural world is full of those very truths and meanings of which I was
                  speaking a little while ago. Sounds and silences, color, forms, the life of insect
                  and animal, and the endless play of cause and effect, I accept first, as
                  scientific facts, with certain scientific relations. Or to speak exactly, I accept
                  the report which they make to my perceptive reason. But they create in my breast,
                  besides all that, such heights and depths of sensibility that I know that they
                  have a moral relation to my moral sentiments ments, and that while science, like
                  the mole, knows the root and bulb, faith alone, acting in a spiritual sphere,
                  recognizes the developed stem and blossoms."
               Although Dr. Wentworth's manner was usually quiet, almost producing an impression
                  of indifference and impassiveness, he had, during this conversation, grown very
                  earnest. Every lineament of his large, pale face glowed, and his eyes exchanged
                  their dreamy look for one that almost flashed visible light, as he rose and stood
                  before his minister, straightening up his body to its fall height and said:
               "Dr. Buell, do you believe the Scriptures? Do you believe that those very heavens
                  above your head declare the glory of God; or only that they did, four
                  thousand years ago? 'The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof, the world
                  and they that dwell therein!'—now to-day, here in this field-yonder, over that
                  meadow, just as much as in Palestine. 'Thou crownest the year—Thou visitest the
                  earth—Thou markest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice. The Lord
                  sitteth upon the flood; yea, the Lord sitteth king forevermore!'
               "Do you think that I can believe this universal presence of God—in
                  the sun, in the seasons, in the sea and on the mountains, in tree and herb, in
                  clouds and storm, in summer and harvest, in the city among men and in the
                  wilderness,—and yet suppose that Nature has nothing more for the soul than the
                  catalogue of scientific names and a recitation of the order in which phenomena
                  happen? Is there nothing of God in flowers, in forests, in birds, in insects, in
                  my poor garden, in yonder valley, along the mountain-flank, in those thunder-heads
                  looming up white over the horizon yonder? or is all this only meaningless matter?
                  When my wife speaks to me, is it only sound—wind? or is it a movement of air upon
                  my ear, that conveys to my heart deep meanings? And is Nature mere phenomena? or
                  is it God's phenomena, meant to convey something deeper than the body
                  catches—something for this soul? Why, then, should you, a minister of God, hunt
                  through books for God, and stand in pity of me, who use the Bible as I would a
                  Botany—which does not contain living-plants, but only word-descriptions, of them.
                  If I would see the plant itself, I must go out of the book to nature. And the
                  Bible cannot contain the truth itself, only the word-forms, the
                  lettered symbols of truth. God does not
                  live in a book. Man does not live in a book. Love, Faith, Joy, Hope, do not,
                  cannot live in a book. For the living truth we must go outside of the Bible which
                  is but to religion what a Botany is to gardens, meadows, and all their flowers! I
                  am not ashamed to own that I feel as if some sort of positive relationship existed
                  between me and every living thing. A spice bush, a clump of wild azaleas, a bed of
                  trailing arbutus, a patch of eye-brights, a log covered with green moss,—these all
                  seem to be of my family kin. The spiders, too, the crickets, the field-mice, and
                  all the swarms of birds; the worm—that as a child I was taught to abhor—are of
                  God's family and mine. Since I accepted the New Testament, all the world has
                  become my Bible. My Saviour is everywhere—in the book and out of the book. I see
                  Him in Nature, in human life, in my own experience as well as in the recorded
                  fragments of His own history. I live in a Bible. But it is an unbound book! It is
                  wider than that I can reach its bounds. It is enough for me that I believe when it
                  is said, 'All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that
                  was made.'"
               Dr. Buell walked slowly homeward, as one who saw nothing but his own thoughts. To
                  all who found fault with the rigor of his teachings, and the remorseless logic
                  with which he pushed "the doctrines" that, to him, were the very soul and marrow
                  of life, it might be replied—the children and the poor loved him! What says such a
                  fact? This: That he had a deep and tender heart; that while his head was like the
                  granite rocks that crop out of the sides of the hill, his heart was like the nooks
                  and hollows between, in which soil deep and rich had collected. The figure might
                  be further pressed; for, as berry-bearing vines, growing in the rich mould, climb
                  up over the rock, and cover its grim face with a veil of comeliness, so out of the
                  heart, full often, grow forth affections and sympathies that go far to hide the
                  severe beliefs of the head. In his pulpit, Dr. Buell, a man of earnest conscience,
                  clear logical intellect narrow in his range of thought but intense along those
                  lines,—was jealous of the Faith. He would not accommodate it. He would not make it
                  soft or beautiful. "The truth should be as a drawn sword. Men are in danger every
                  hour and moment! How dare I spend my time in etching pleasing pictures on the
                  blade, when God sends me to swing it over their heads as a flashing threat?"
               But, when he came among the sick and the poor, when consolation was the duty, his
                  soul seemed to seek relief and compensation for the stern fulfilment of his
                  intellectual duties. Children, too, found his smile sweet, and his ways most
                  companionable. To be sure, he thought, they were involved in a common ruin; but
                  the evil, though in the germ, had not yet greatly developed itself. He used to
                  say: "There is no moral virtue in children's innocence and simplicity, but they
                  are pleasing to our natural susceptibilities, and may he enjoyed as we relish
                  food, or odors."
               On this homeward walk, however, the good man was shut up in himself. Cherub—the
                  blackest of all black boys—threw a cartwheel two several times, in his most
                  accomplished manner, without attracting the slightest attention. A little girl,
                  five years old, stood in the crack of Judge Mason's gate, and held out her little
                  hands full of dog-fennel to him, as if it had been a flower of far more attractive
                  fragrance, and wondered at him that he passed without a word or gesture. Not till
                  a curly-haired boy bounced out of the door yard of his own home, glad to get into
                  the street, on the plea of seeing papa, did he wake to external
                  things.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               AGATE BISSELL.
               AGATE BISSELL was the stern child of a severe experience. Her father was poor, and
                  would have been industrious but for an unfortunate habit of drinking. Her mother
                  was a woman of decision, of pride of character, of high moral feeling, but subject
                  from child hood to hard work, with only a little education. She grew up a kind of
                  patient warrior against trouble. She had known trouble from childhood. Poverty
                  before and poverty after her marriage, were but minor evils. She had seven
                  children. The third child, but first-born daughter, was Agate. No where except in
                  New England could she have been called Agate. Her mother was an
                  earnest reader of the Bible. In her continual troubles she resorted to it,
                  literally as to a refuge. Isaiah above all writers had fired her imagination.
                  There was something in the hopefulness of the stern prophet amidst abounding
                  troubles that seemed peculiarly congenial to her. In particular she dwelt upon the
                  fifty-fourth chapter; so often had she read it, so often had she stayed her sorrow
                  on its exultant promises, that it had come to seem like a voice sounding out
                  specially for her, and had her own name appeared in it she would scarcely have
                  been surprised.
               Here had she read, till they mingled with her waking and sleeping thoughts, those
                  words of sublime consolation! Naturally high-minded and sensitive, every
                  aspiration had been almost crushed. Her husband, a good-natured man, could not be
                  redeemed from his cups, and to her proud spirit it seemed as if she were bound to
                  a dead body. Awful thoughts sometimes rose up in her, a horror of temptation,
                  which sent her flying to her chamber for prayer and scripture, like a dove flying
                  from before a swift-pursuing hawk. Then she would read: "For thy Maker is thy
                  husband, the Lord of Hosts is his name. * * * For the Lord hath called thee as a
                  woman forsaken and grieved in spirit. * * * For a small moment I have forsaken
                  thee, but with great mercies will 1 gather thee."
               On some days the clouds came low down, and there was no horizon of hope. Her
                  little children were hungry, her husband drunk, her own strength giving way, and
                  all the future like an on-coming storm. Then she would read, "For the mountains
                  shall depart, and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall not depart from
                  thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed saith the Lord that hath
                  mercy on thee! O, thou afflicted! tossed with tempest and not comforted, behold! I
                  will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires. And
                  I will make thy windows of AGATES, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy
                  borders of pleasant stones. And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord, and
                  great shall be the peace of thy children."
               This touched to the quick. For her husband there remained only the sentiment of
                  duty. But all her garnered and wounded affections were poured forth upon her
                  children. If by a living death she could save them, and gain a firm foothold for
                  each of them in honorable life she would willingly have died deaths daily.
               In her poor little dwelling, it may be supposed, were no luxuries. No picture, no
                  print so big as her baby's hand, hung on the wall. She knew no rest, no amusement.
                  Her whole being was a concentrated purpose to bring up her children so that their
                  life should be happier than hers had been. For that, the sun shone—for that,
                  summer and winter came—for that, the Sabbath inserted a seventh golden link in the
                  iron chain of toil—for that, the whole world existed to her, and time itself drew
                  on its train of days and nights! On her feet, in work, wrestling against
                  poverty;—on her knees, in prayer, wrestling against temptations and despair, she
                  reared her children, hoping in them at last to find an end of sorrow and a
                  beginning of joy.
               When Agate was just born, she looked upon her face with anguish. She seemed to see
                  all her own miseries stored up for this child. She almost felt a pang of guilt for
                  bringing another woman into life to take a place in that long procession of
                  sufferers, of which women have constituted the largest proportion. She hardly
                  wished to look in her face. Long before the minister sprinkled this little
                  newcomer, her mother had baptized her with tears.
               As soon as she could sit up, (and the poor recover from the birth of children
                  sooner than the prosperous!—A rigorous nurse art thou, oh Poverty!—a stern
                  physician, and, though skilful, bitter
                  cruel!) weak, sad, alone, except her little children, her days were darker than
                  any thing but the nights. There was little difference in the twenty-four hours,
                  except that the night was darkness plagued with dreams, and the day was darkness
                  plagued with gloomy thoughts. The first day that she could read, her oldest boy
                  brought her well-worn Bible to her. It opened of itself to her favorite chapter.
                  The leaves there were like a travelled road. Let the book fall open a hundred
                  times, and every time it would open at the same place. Then she read: "I will make thy windows agates." A window is that by which light
                  comes through upon our inward darkness, or by which we look out of darkness into
                  light. If a window of God is made of agate, then, she thought, an agate must be
                  something more clear and beautiful than glass. What agate was she knew not, but it
                  must needs be something glorious and hopeful. "And all thy children
                  shall be taught of the Lord." That was the very anguish—longing of her heart! She
                  seemed to have it borne in upon her that children are the Lord's windows, through
                  which mothers look forth out of pain and darkness into hope and happiness! She
                  seized the happy thought: "I will call her Agate. Perhaps the Lord will make her
                  like a window to my darkness." Thus she was named!
               We smile at names. We weigh them in the scale of the ear for sweetness or
                  smoothness. We cull some, we reject others. We laugh at men's odd and awkward
                  names, and quite justly, too, it may be; since capricious whims and vagrant
                  fancies or mere carelessness so often select them. But sometimes a name is a
                  history. It is like a pictured vase. We see the figures without thinking in what
                  furnace those colors were fastened and by what fire the glazing was fused! Is
                  there in any history a record of the heart more touching and simple than that of
                  old? "And it came to pass as Rachel's soul was departing, for she died that she
                  called his name Ben-oni"—Son of my Sorrow.
               Growing up in such circumstances, it may well be supposed that Agate's life was
                  one which would bring her to more acquaintance with work and vigor of duty, than
                  with those fighter graces which commonly belong to prosperous childhood.
               With as much natural conscience as her mother, she had a less intense pride. She
                  could not sympathize with that shuddering horror at her father's presence, which
                  her mother with all her struggles, could never subdue. Agate stood between them,
                  loving both and was indeed a medium—a window—through which each looked upon the
                  other, colored with the hues of the medium.
               When at thirteen years of age, her father died—unreformed, stupefied—Agate really
                  mourned. Her mother saw the turf placed upon his grave without a tear. Her soul
                  said, God hath avenged me! For years, the mother and children struggled on. Agate,
                  besides daily work, had, as it were, carried away captive a certain amount of
                  education. No one but he who has tried it knows what power of learning there is,
                  in a mind every faculty of which is tensely strained with desire and necessity.
                  She read with eyes that pierced. What she read was as if it had been burned in. At
                  seventeen, she taught the summer school in her neighborhood. Her brothers were her
                  care at home as well. At twenty-two, her mother went to her rest. On the last day
                  of her life her mind wandered back to her brief hours of early joy. She half-spake
                  and half-whispered some fondling words, as if she were a girl in the days of
                  courtship and love. Then after a little the life-long grief seemed again to
                  overshadow her. "Agate—Agate—He's come. Put him to bed. Oh God!" She dozed for an
                  hour. When, after a time, Agate looked upon her mother, her eyes were opened wide,
                  as if she beheld new and strange things. In a low and sweet voice she said: "Yes—I
                  am coming." Before the sun went down, she had departed, and her troubled day was
                  over.
               Agate Bissell was respected by all her neighbors. Her common sense, her energy,
                  her truth—clear as crystal—her strong moral nature, would have made her a
                  remarkable woman anywhere. She was not handsome by regularity of features; but she
                  had what was better—the open and strong face of a sensible and kind-hearted woman.
                  There was that in her face which one would not willingly see kindled. Her power of
                  indignation was terrible, Young Templeton found that out. He had paid attention to
                  Agate. Good-looking, capable of working, his father's dissipation and example had
                  not acted upon his self-indulgent nature as a like sad example had upon the
                  sterner soul of Agate.
               Yet a certain sympathy she had felt for him, from a somewhat similar experience of
                  their lives. Her heart, bound around with cords of restraint, should it once go
                  free, and love, would seek its mate as eagles fly.
               
               It might have been. It never was. One evening he waited upon her to a meeting in
                  Norwood. The way was long,—not too long for them. When they reached the village
                  Agate's step was light. Her face had lost something of its intensity. The light of
                  gentle feelings rested upon it.
               They returned home that night, Tom Templeton and Agate Bissell. Afterward they
                  never again spoke to each other. What the history was neither ever said—he for
                  shame, and she from scorn. For years his name kindled upon her face a look so
                  stern and deep in moral indignation, that one would not willingly look upon it.
                  That was the end of her dream of youth. When at thirty she assumed the care of Dr.
                  Wentworth's house, not a tongue in all Norwood dared even in sport to say that the
                  doctor had a young housekeeper. One had better play with fire than with her name.
                  And yet, under this strong-featured, pale face, who can tell what stores of love
                  were lying, like gold undug, in fields over which the plough runs and vulgar
                  harvests wave, because no one suspects the gold below or knows how to extract the
                  treasure!
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               DR. WENTWORTH'S MANSION.
               WE take shame to ourselves for having never asked our friends into the Doctor's
                  house, but left them, inhospitable, to wander about Norwood as best they might.
                  Not that they are in danger of lacking accommodations; for Norwood is not
                  unaccustomed to company. Hither come hundreds every summer for the pleasure of its
                  wholesome air and the beauty of its charming scenery. There is no lack of
                  hospitable hotels; nor are the landlords unskilled in catering. For all that, our
                  readers had a right to expect an invitation to the Doctor's house; and as the
                  whole family are off to-day on a pic-nic, we will steal in and look over the whole
                  place. This intrusion would be exceedingly rude in actual life; but in books such
                  things are often done, and may be again; and if any complaint arises, I will take
                  the blame.
               Approach the old-fashioned mansion through the front yard. First take notice of
                  the roof. The ancient New-England architects seem to have had a vague idea of a
                     Mansard roof. As the attempt was carried out in the case before
                  us, it resulted very nearly in justifying Hiram Beers' saying that the Doctor's
                  roof looked like an old woman's cap, with spectacles mounted on it; for two
                  windows projected from the steep double-leaved roof in a manner that invariably
                  suggested a pair of great eyes! And as there was an open, ornamental railing
                  carried along the eaves and up the gables of the roof, resembling a stiff ruffle,
                  the notion of an old lady's cap and frill once hinted could not be got out of the
                  mind.
               The front yard was deep. A straight path led to the front door. On either side of
                  it was a border of shrubs, with intermediate spaces, filled with flowers.
               A porch of some architectural pretension bestrid the front door, and was itself at
                  once a protection from rain and a trellis for honeysuckles.
               The windows on either side were small, if compared with modern windows, and filled
                  with glass that seemed even more diminutive.
               
               No mean little entry receives you, as is too often the case in modern houses. The
                  hall of a dwelling gives you the first impressions. Sometimes on entering you fear
                  that by some mistake you have got into a clothes closet; at others, you enter upon
                  a space so small that it is only by a dexterous interchange of civilities between
                  yourself and the door that you can get in or the door be shut. In some halls, so
                  called, a man sees a pair of corkscrew stairs coming right down upon him, and
                  fears lost by some jugglery he be seized and extracted like a cork into some upper
                  space. Often the doors are so arranged that what with the shutting of the outside
                  door, and the opening of inside ones, the timid stranger stands a chance of being
                  impaled on the latch, or flapped front and rear; for, vigorous springs attached to
                  the doors work with such nimbleness that one needs to be expert, or, having opened
                  the door, before he can dash through, it will spring back on him with a
                  "now-I've-got-you" air quite alarming.
               Such houses seldom remit their torments here. There is an exquisite symmetry in
                  all the interior adaptations. You finish your visit and rise to depart, taking the
                  door most likely to let you out, and find yourself walking into a sweet-meat
                  closet!
               A young beau, having acquitted himself well of the last critical sentences and
                  executed a half-backward, and wholly awkward march toward the door, with ineffable
                  satisfaction, opens and steps into the china closet! The little girls giggle; the
                  little boys laugh out; the young ladies are confused, and the beau still more so.
                  But, what if it had been the cellar door? On one occasion, visiting a thrifty
                  friend whose dining-room and sitting-room, were one, came near defending headlong
                  into his cellar, which, for convenience probably, opened into the dining-room. I
                  once saw three like and equal doors in a sitting-room. The one was the true door
                  of departure; the next, the cellar; and the third a bedroom. There was only one
                  chance in three for a stranger.
               Do you not think that a house reveals the architect's disposition? I do. We know
                  much of a writer from his style. The style of a cautious nature will have involved
                  parenthetical sentences, full of qualifications and limitations. An open and
                  imperious disposition is shown in short sentences, direct and energetic. A
                  secretive and proud mind is cold and obscure in style. An affectionate and
                  imaginative nature pours out luxuriantly, and blossoms all over with
                  ornaments.
               The same is true with artists who really deserve the name. They paint what they
                  see and feel, and it is this self-part that gives the style. Some subtle part of
                  every man's own spirit goes with his work, is incarnated in it, and gives to it
                  that undiscoverable something which marks and discriminates one artist from
                  another. And so, every artist dips his brush in his own soul, and paints his own
                  nature into his pictures.
               Why should not the architect, then, transfuse into his work something of
                     his nature, too? Every house has an expression. Every room has a
                  disposition. Some houses are precisionists. They are pinched and crimped, and you
                  almost expect to see a starched ruffle and white apron on them. Others are
                  generous and hospitable. Every time you look at them they seem to say: "Why don't
                  you come in? I am waiting for you." Some dwellings are stately and dignified, and
                  some are cosy and jolly. Every day I see houses that cannot repress their scorn at
                  beggarly houses in their neighborhood! The door has an excluding air. The windows
                  are supercilious, and the very cornice has a curl of well-bred contempt. But it is
                  in the interior of men and houses, that the real disposition must be found. The
                  moment you enter some dwellings, your heart cries out spontaneously, "Peace be
                  within thy walls." There is a charm upon the threshold, a joy in every room. Not a
                  minute of the day do the apartments cease to breathe upon your ear, you are
                  welcome! But, shiver as I do, when you enter as I do, this selfishness in brick
                  and mortar! The architect was a mean and narrow soul, I know! His ceilings are
                  only fifteen feet high. I wonder he did not go on up with them till they were as
                  high as he felt himself to be above common men. What a good ice house this would
                  make! What repulsion is, in these walls! As you stand upon the threshold, the
                  whole hall stares at you and says in white plaster, "Well what do you want
                  here?"
               All such fears are banished as you enter Dr. Wentworth's old-fashioned mansion. A
                  hall twelve feet wide opens its arms to welcome you. On its sides hang large maps.
                  Toward the farther end rises a flight of stairs six feet wide. They say to you,
                  plain as words can speak, "do not weary yourself." The short rise and broad tread
                  suggest ease. And six or eight steps being taken, the stairs seemed to have
                  chanced their mind and concluded to stop there. For, a landing some eight feet
                  wide ran across the whole width of the
                  hall. And the space was still further augmented by a large bow-window, circling
                  out backward, which the Doctor had built and filled with colored glass. Only at
                  the other end of this landing did the stairs consent to start upward again.
                  Perched between the two stories, a grand look-out was thus furnished for
                  summer;—the window on the one side, and the lower hall and upper hall on the
                  other—giving ample command to the eye of all that was going on. In summer it was a
                  favorite resort; and in winter the blaze of colored light always gave a kind of
                  sunrise cheer to the hall.
               Midway in the lower ball a grand, old-fashioned, ebony-cased clock, standing on
                  the floor, reached up to the ceiling. It was not only a time-keeper of hours, but
                  of days and months. Its sable vesture, and the great variety of its duties, gave
                  to this venerable instrument an absent-minded air, a sort of reserve and dignity,
                  which well set off the easy ways of all the rest of the dwelling. That clock and
                  Agate Bissell never lost a minute of time, were never tired, and attended wholly
                  and only to their own business. It was difficult to decide which of the two was
                  the more exact and regular. In any single day the clock might win; but take the
                  year together, Agate Bissell undoubtedly was the best time-keeper. She had the
                  whole care of the clock. Dr. Wentworth used to rally her on her beau. "That clock
                  is an enchanted knight. Agate is waiting for him, some day, to make proposals.
                  Nothing less than such matchless grace as in him do reside will ever tempt
                  her!"
               ROSE—who must be moved forward in our story six years—took up her father's
                  imaginations, and wove about the old clock all manner of fanciful notions. She was
                  a double child. Her outward nature was sensible, practical, worldly; her inward
                  nature was deep in feeling, solemn and mystical, but veined and traced throughout
                  with the richest flow of imagination. None except her father knew this inward
                  life; nor he, nor she herself, except in a dim and twilight way.
               She was just the one to make a hero of this old tall, black clock. To her its
                  strokes, in the deep nights, when summer whip-poor-wills had waked her, were
                  voices proclaiming messages to men. To look upon its face and watch the rise and
                  occultation of pictured stars, and especially of the great plump-faced moon, that,
                  like some men, always seemed scared because it couldn't see anything—was a
                  perpetual, though unspoken pleasure. But we linger. Opening on the left, as you
                  enter, is the Doctor's grand resort—his library. The room ran through the whole
                  depth of the house. The ceiling was only about nine feet high. The centre was
                  crossed by a dressed beam, and the cornice all around the room was formed by the
                  carved frame-beams of the house itself. On either side of the chimney, which stood
                  midway on the west side, were two deep bay-windows; and, on the north end, one
                  large window coming down to, the floor, and of the size of three ordinary windows.
                  The sides of the library were filled with cases, and the whole range of English
                  literature was stored in them. The best authors in the modern languages, too, held
                  their tongues eloquently in this Walhalla. Drawers stuffed with curious pamphlets;
                  lower cases with folios, atlases, etc.; portfolios and volumes of costly
                  engravings—all evinced the Doctor's tastes. Not like the orderly study of Parson
                  Buell was Dr. Wentworth's. No long rows of books stood stiff and stern on the
                  shelves, like soldiers on parade. Some books were out visiting; some, in an
                  affectionate mood, were leaning over on an accommodating neighbor; and some, tired
                  of their heavy contents, had lain down flat and gone to sleep, as if to give their
                  readers, should they have any, the proper cue. Some were splendidly bound and
                  flamed their golden letters from blue, and green and crimson or modest russet.
                  Others stood in cloth; some, in paper. Some shelves were packed and stuffed till
                  they seemed bursting; others stood thinly, like a school half of whose scholars
                  had gone out to play.
               Here was the true peace-society. Old quarrels were hushed here. Heretic and
                  orthodox stood in silent truce. The men that kept the world in a racket, in their
                  time,—Luther and they of the Vatican, Milton and Salmasius, Arminius and the whole
                  Synod of Dort, Jesuits and Jansenists, the ancients, mediæval scholastics, modern
                  reformers—were patient with each other and with the rising fame of modem
                  scientific authors. Books are the true metempsychosis—they are the symbol and
                  presage of immortality. The dead men are scattered, and none shall find them.
                  Behold, they are all here! they do but sleep. At your summons every one shall
                  speak and instruct you in the best experiences of his life!
               Turning from the hall, as you come in at the front door, to the right, you enter the large parlor; and, next to it,
                  the sitting-room; and a door from each room opens into the conservatory, where
                  there was summer all the year round.
               The dining-room and kitchen were included in the wing which ran back from the
                  southeast corner of the house, and which was of such dimensions that, had it stood
                  alone, it would have seemed a house of itself.
               The old mansion was built in a stately style, at a time when stateliness was well
                  understood. Few modern dwellings are more picturesque, more winning to the eye,
                  than the best of the old colonial mansions. They tell their story at once. They
                  proclaim comfort, room, hospitality, and elegant taste. They are passing away.
                  Perhaps we have nothing to regret. Convenience and beauty have their modern
                  architects. Yet, 
                     the the
                     the
                   pictorial art ought, while it can be done, to secure those memorials of
                  an early day, and transmit them as precious parts of our New-England history.
               But stop. Turn back. We have neglected the heart of home, the mother's room! The
                  old temple had no such holy of holies. The mother's room! Here came she a bride.
                  Here only God's angels and her own husband have beard what words the inmost heart
                  of love can coin. Here were the children born. Here in love were they cherished,
                  in piety consecrated, and here Hope, the mother's prophet and painter, has filled
                  golden hours with a wealth of expectations and fancied joys!
               If every child might live the life predestined in a mother's heart, all the way
                  from the cradle to the coffin they would walk upon beam of light, and shine in
                  glory. Alas! some are born like the dandelion-glowing bright, soon changing to a
                  fairy globe, and by the first wind dashed out and gone!
               Paint the man as the mother's thoughts do; then paint him as he really lived! Hang
                  the two portraits side by side, and write, What he was to be! and
                  then, What he was! Life has no sadder contrast.
               Shall I? It is audacious; and yet, for your sake, reader, I would do much. Well,
                  come, I will even venture. This is Agate Bissell's room. No one may go in here
                  without leave. She and her room are so much one, that this intrusion she would
                  resent as a personal liberty. I know that politeness forbids, but your curiosity
                  riosity and my love of accurate description prevail, and, as usual, politeness
                  must give way when it is not convenient. No rocking chair, three common chairs—one
                  lower than the others, for sewing,—a mahogany bureau, with an old-fashioned mirror
                  above it which had been in that very place a hundred years, and had seen—ah! what
                  had it not seen? But most honorable of all friends is the looking-glass, that will
                  not speak—that keeps no secret journal for future treachery—that meets you with
                  the very face that you bring to it—that beholds all your weaknesses without
                  chiding, and never hints advice; into whose placid depths sink, as into a sea, in
                  utter forgetfulness, all the secrets which have figured on its face!
               What if one had the power to recall from this cold and passionless glass all that
                  it has ever seen? What if there should be a resurrection of that which has been
                  buried in looking-glasses? Little children's faces, anxious Mothers, budding girls
                  beginning to suspect their own beauty, vain and giggling looks, grave and sad
                  looks of those who hate to grow old, vexed looks of those who have cut themselves
                  in shaving, timid and anxious looks of those who have been sick, double images of
                  lovers glancing upon the sweet picture of their embrace, prim and prig pedants
                  touching up their gray whiskers and covering their baldness with the few strawy
                  locks yet left, simple and wondering looks of curly and woolly Phillis whose
                  honest, homely face is just as dear to her as if it were Cleopatra's.
               Many would shrink to have their looking-glasses reveal their secrets. Certain it
                  is that Agate Bissell would not be ashamed to have it tell all that ever she
                  committed to its trust. Faithful, pure-thinking, upright Agate! Positive, precise,
                  sprightly to tartness, who more than thou lived wholly for others? Who ever knew
                  thee fail in the day of trial? When didst thou betray a secret? When didst thou
                  ever shrink from giving honest counsel because it was bitter? Let men look upon
                  thee, Agate, and henceforth honor those words, OLD MAID! When all things are
                  hereafter untied and the contents of various bundles disclosed, it is my opinion
                  that as many noble, self-denying virtues will be found tied up with precise
                  bow-knots in some of those vertical rolls called Old Maids as in any other that
                  shall appear.
               Open the upper drawer! Here we have few laces, one or two ornaments seldom worn, and then only as a special
                  honor to some much-honored friend. Be touched, as I am, with a certain
                  tear-breeding feeling, to see how little the poor have to represent their finer
                  tastes! Some jewels however, are laid up for them hereafter.
               The next drawer. This is fine linen. Not much of it! But it is as white as snow.
                  Not a stitch is broken. How finely folded! How orderly! Agate need not be ashamed
                  that it is so little. She makes it enough by wise economy, and what she misses,
                  some poor shivering creature is wearing, for she is silently generous. All the
                  fine linen of the saints, is not that which is made up into ascension robes. Some
                  of it may yet be found in bureau drawers.
               Did you ever see a room with so little in it, that looked so comfortable? Find a
                  speck of dirt! Yet, it is not distressingly neat. It has not that coffin and
                  shroud snugness that you see in some rooms. It is generous and homelike. A true
                  woman lives in it. That furnishes any room, and subdues its very wells, at length,
                  to humane and gentle expression!
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               ROSE-CULTURE.
               HOW happy are proud people! No. Rather how happy are people of pride! That does
                  not hit it exactly.
               How fortunate are people with a sovereign self-esteem! I appeal to every one who
                  ever felt the quality, whether pride or self-esteem. Either of them covers or
                  describes that peculiar faculty which inspires in men the sense of their own
                  being, of personal worth, of eminent selfness—not necessarily selfishness.
               Why are they fortunate? In such persons there is apt to be a central content. They
                  are always consciously right. They always speak aright. Whatever they do is right.
                  Whatever they own is of the best. Whatever submits itself to their protection is
                  right. Righteousness is the very quality of their experience. Why should you
                  reason with them? It is cruel and useless—cruel to disturb such profound
                  self-satisfaction in a world not too much given to happiness; and useless, because
                  it is an instinct, not a conviction—an involuntary feeling, and not a deduction of
                  reason.
               But not all of this tribe of self-esteem are so happy. All the worse for them. If
                  this potent force allies itself with conscience, the possessor may as well make up
                  his mind to be in bondage all his life. Then the sense of ownership and
                  self-appropriation acts chiefly in the sphere of Duty.
               Agate Bissell could not be said to have pride of character so much as Pride of
                  Duty. She saw every thing in the light of duty, and she measured duty by the high
                  requisitions of an intense pride. Every one may see that she had business on hand
                  for the rest of her life. Nothing was good that had not in it some relation to
                  duty. There was no good in the beautiful, unless in some way allied to practical
                  duty. Happiness, springing from duty, was not altogether to be condemned; yet it
                  must be watched, as likely to take the temper out of the cutting edge of duty.
               There was no member of Dr. Wentworth's family that did not feel the pressure of
                  honest Agate's conscience, and respect it, too. It made no difference that her
                  good sense restrained her from meddling
                  with other people's consciences. It is impossible for an energetic nature to move
                  about among men under the power of any great central faculty, and not electrify
                  them. You may carry a torch for yourself, but cannot keep the light out of other
                  people's eyes.
               "Rose, have you put away your night-clothes?"
               "Yes, ma'am."
               "Are you sure you folded them up and laid them in their proper place?"
               A smile came over Rose's fair face, for she recollected that she had laid them on
                  a chair, and not under the pillow.
               "Rose, it is just as easy to do things right as wrong. Go right and place them as
                  they ought to be and then come down to your lesson." For, Rose was already a
                  proficient with the needle, and for an hour in the morning and one in the
                  afternoon, she was under Agate's special instruction in reading and writing. But,
                  on Saturday the lessons were in the Scriptures and the Catechism. Rose, by nature,
                  was one of the fortunate ones who obeyed those in command, and yet always had her
                  own way. To suppress one tendency was only to open another. She was of a nature so
                  full and vital, that her happiness seemed little checked because stopped in this
                  or that direction.
               "The dear child," said Agate, one day, to Mrs. Polly Marble, "is so good that I'm
                  afraid she may not live. If she should die I don't think the Doctor would be good
                  for much."
               "I don't think you need take on 'bout it, Agate," said Mrs. Polly. "Mebbe you'll
                  find enough human natur in her to suit you, afore you get through. I've seen just
                  such children before. There's Hotchkiss—till his boy was ten years old, he was so
                  good that his folks was afeered he wasn't long for this world. Ever since, tho',
                  they have felt easier, for if there ever was a critter that had his full share of
                  total depravity, it is that Paul Hotchkiss. If he's ever converted, tho', he'll be
                  a smart man, especially if he has it thorough."
               "That may be true, Mrs. Marble. In this world it is not safe to trust
                  appearances."
               "That's just what I say to my deacon. You know, Miss Agate, that there never was a
                  kinder creetur nor a better man than he is, if it wasn't for that wicked levity.
                  After all I've done for him, I don't see that he's got over it a mite. I tell him
                  that nobody is sure, as long as he is livin' in this world of temptation. When a
                  man is safely in his coffin, then we may be comfortable—that is, if he had a
                  hope."
               "I sometimes think," said Agate, "that I should like Rose better if she had a
                  little more—well, a little more nature:—some sparks flung off now and then makes
                  you sure there's fire, and that it is not all ashes."
               "Well, I really think I shouldn't trouble myself about that. You can't tell by the
                  way a bean comes up what sort of leaves it's goin' to have afterwards. Some
                  children are like poke weed. When it first comes up it's just as good to bile as
                  'sparagus. But in a few weeks it's so strong it would drive ye out of the house,
                  if you was to put it in the pot. Now, you know that the child is depraved.
                  Everybody is, even ministers have it, tho' I reely don't see but that grace has
                  subdued it in Dr. Buell. Of course Rose is—and I shouldn't worry a bit if I was
                  you. It'll come out in time"
               "Mrs. Marble, if there's any such thing as spoiling her, the Doctor will do it.
                  He's the strangest man that I ever heard of. Sometimes I think his books and his
                  foreign learning have unsettled his religious belief. Would it not be dreadful if
                  he was unsound! I know Dr. Buell don't think so. But you ought to bear him make
                  fun of the Catechism! I have trouble enough with the children anyhow. The other
                  Saturday morning, after I'd got through the questions, Dr. Wentworth called
                  Rose.
               "'Rose, what do the apple-trees principally teach?'
               "Rose understands her father, and her face looked funny all over; but she turned
                  to me as if she didn't want to make fun of the Catechism:
               "'Answer him, Rose,' said I, 'answer your father!'
               "And, do you believe it, she looked at him with her great, full eyes, and
                  said:
               "'They make me think how beautiful God is!'
               "The Doctor didn't ask her any more questions, but went off with her in his arms
                  down into the garden."
               "Well, Agate, you needn't be discouraged. You know you have the promises. Besides,
                  his wife is a precious woman; and that's in your favor."
               
               "It would almost break my trust in God, if Rose shouldn't do well. No—nothing will
                  ever do that, I hope! But then you can't have such a child by you for six or seven
                  years, and not have your heart bound up in her. I can tell you, Mrs. Marble,
                  there's more dangerous idols than those made of wood and stone."
               "A good deal worse! 'Eyes have they but they see not,' saith the prophet. Now,
                  them idols that have pretty eyes, and see out of them too, is a good deal more to
                  be feared. I tell my boys so, of'en."
               "If any thing could spoil Rose, it would be the creatures the Doctor
                  has 'round her. It seems to me as if he contrived to pick out the very worst
                  folks, and let Rose run with them. There is that natural, Pete! I do
                  believe Rose would go from me to him any day. The Doctor lets him carry her about
                  the meadows, and woods and down through the swamp, by half-days together."
               "Well, I'd never consent to that. I'd like to see Pete Sawmill about my house!
                  He'd get a piece of my mind about the quickest! He don't do her any good!"
               "The Doctor thinks Pete is a true child of Nature. He is not more'n half-witted
                  anyhow. But the fellow is curious about knowin' all sorts of things that are going
                  on in the woods especially if there is no use in them."
               "That's what I tell the Deacon. 'Deacon Marble,' says I, 'if you would shove out
                  of ye all your knowing that ain't worth knowin', and then fill up with sober
                  matter, you would be a sight better deacon and a better man.'
               "That's much so with folks in general."
               "Yes; folks' heads is pretty much like their garrets, where all the rubbish and
                  broken things they've no use for down stairs are stored away."
               "As if Pete were not enough, Tommy Taft is round with Rose, and Hiram Beers rides
                  her out every chance he can get. There's about twenty people in this town that
                  seems to think that they own Rose!"
               No other person could be allowed to say these things but herself. Should a
                  neighbor, or one whom she less confided in than Polly Marble, indulge in
                  unfavorable reflections Agate would soon enable them to understand that they were
                  meddling with affairs that did not concern them.
               Now and then, however, but with reserve, she intimated to Mrs. Wentworth her fears
                  for Rose's "bringing up;" for if there was one thing in this whole world which
                  Agate had determined should come to pass, and had staked her life on it, it was
                  that "Rose should grow up good and pious."
               "Do see that child! She'll be stung to death, as sure as she's alive. Rose, Rose,
                  come away from those bees—come here this minute! I do believe that child is in
                  league with all the animal creation. Nothing is afraid of her, and she is afraid
                  of nothing. See her stepping up nearer and nearer to those hives! I should have
                  had as many stings stuck into me by this time as a baked ham has cloves! She comes
                  home with her pockets full of trash, and with vines hanging about her neck, and
                  with her hands full of bugs and worms. I've given up trying to manage her. It's in
                  her and it will come out. If you stop her at one thing she just goes straight off
                  to another. And she's so good-natured and so quiet and sweet, that you never think
                  it's wilfulness. But she's got her father's will in her, if it is covered up. She
                  knows what she's about."
               "Only yesterday I was sitting," said her mother, "in the bow window, just as
                  twilight was coming on, with my sewing in my lap, it was getting too dark to see
                  well, when Rose came marching in:—'Ma, I've got something for you.' 'Bring it
                  here, child,' said I. And she emptied her apron into my lap, in a sober and
                  satisfied way. Of all things in this world; it was a great toad, speckled,
                  fat—ugh! I screamed and flounced it upon the floor. I was startled in good
                  earnest, for if there is any thing disgustful, next to a snake, or a green worm,
                  or a spider, it is a toad."
               "What did she do?"
               "Do? She looked at me with surprise,—then demurely picked up the loathsome
                  creature and walked out with it. I spoke so sharply that I was afraid I had hurt
                  the poor child and so I went out, and she was sitting on the offset laughing all
                  over, as if it was the merriest experience of all her life!"
               Quite unconscious of these remarks, the object of them, a chubby child of six
                  years old, was standing by the very edge of the shelf on which scores of hives
                  were ranged. Bees were flying out with great activity, and coming in, swinging
                  heavily down, with laden thighs. At first a few whirled around Rose as if to warn her off. But seeing at a glance who
                  it was and reporting the news to their companions, their excitement and curiosity
                  and the child was suffered to go as near as she pleased and to do as she liked. If
                  one lit on her hand she suffered it to creep over it undisturbed. Sometimes an
                  in-flying bee would get caught in her hair; she took no pains to help it out; she
                  suffered them to go and come as they would. Sometimes she would gather flowers and
                  bring them toward the hives, and watch the workers as they eagerly sought the
                  honey.
               "That child is the doctor's own self in petticoats," said Agate Bissell. "I
                  believe that the Doctor could stuff his pockets full of bees," said his wife, "and
                  they would be contented. But if I go near the bee shed, the angry things fly at me
                  as Rex does at a beggar. They know I am afraid of them. They dash at me with such
                  a way, that I never wait to see what they mean to do, and so they chase me fairly
                  out of that part of the garden."
               "I wonder the doctor will keep them; at any rate so many. There must be as many as
                  fifty hives, and more coming on."
               "Oh, it's his music. He would not hear a word against his bees. On bright days,
                  that are still and warm, he lies down by the window yonder on purpose to hear them
                  hum and buzz. And, I confess, if I am only safe out of their reach, it is a
                  pleasant sound. Though I do not want them to appropriate him, or make a hive out
                  of his hat. Do you know he looked for it yesterday a half hour, and then found it
                  among the bees? He says Rose carried it thither. I say Rose's father did. But the
                  doctor, you know, likes pleasant sounds, as a kind of mental stimulus. The
                  pleasure of music, he says, consists in the thoughts and feelings which it excites
                  in us. I don't know what bees can make him think of. But, if any thing troubles
                  him he likes to get where he can hear the bees, and then he seems to grow
                  quiet."
               "That is better than to brace up with some things," said Agate.
               "After that dreadful surgical case he came home looking like a dead man. His face
                  was stern and ghastly. He couldn't eat on that day before he operated, and
                  trembled when he left the house like a leaf. But they say as soon as he took the
                  knife his hand was firm and his body like steel, When he reached home I could not
                  get him food quick enough—he almost cried for it, and was sharp and peevish, till
                  he had eaten enough, which I thought he never could do, and then he went out by
                  the window, where he could see the verbenas and the beds of petunia, and the rows
                  of gladiolus, and lay down, and let the bees chant to him. I quite forgave the
                  creatures their spite at me, when I saw how much comfort he took. After a while he
                  fell asleep, and woke up in half an hour as fresh and merry as he always is."
               "I hope Rose will have his knack of being happy. Isn't it queer that she takes so
                  to Pete? She is so peculiar about liking and not liking. I think they are a match.
                  He is as fond of curious notions as she is. But, then, I don't like her going off
                  with him all day, wandering in the woods and poking into the swamps, and following
                  brooks."
               "The doctor will not have you say a word about poor Pete—He thinks him the only
                  Christian on the place."
               "Except when he's in liquor."
               "Yes, he owns that he has one fault. But then he has such outlandish ways, and
                  knows so much about the animal kind, and is so unfit to take care of himself; he's
                  so foolish about every thing that most folks care about and so very knowing about
                  things that are of no sort of use to regular and respectable people, that the
                  doctor thinks he's inspired."
               "I do wonder how so good a man as Dr. Wentworth is should have so many queer
                  notions. Well, we all have our faults."
               It is doubtful whether Mrs. Wentworth thought so. There was not a woman in the
                  town that hovered about her husband with such a stream of opposition as she did.
                  She rallied him and chid him, and laughed at him; she put upon him all manner of
                  humorous and grotesque imaginations, invented speeches and imagined situations in
                  which the doctor figured ludicrously. But there was within it all such an
                  unmistakable fondness, and such playfulness, that no one failed to see that she
                  worshipped as well as loved. All this persiflage was her way of hiding or showing,
                  as the case might be, the strength of her attachment. For all the years they had
                  lived together, not a line was less distinct, not a color was faded, not a form
                  was withdrawn from the picture which love first drew. One word in the morning of
                  earnest love filled the whole day with happiness. With increasing power came also
                  a growing sensibility. Never when he first spoke of affection was it so hard, with
                  open face, to listen, as now after eight years of intimacy. The blush came more deeply than at first,
                  the eye fell more quickly, the nerve trembled more freely. Whatever there was in
                  her nature susceptible of development, was wholly commanded by her husband. She
                  honored his strength. She rejoiced in his growing influence. She sympathized with
                  his tastes so far as their unlike natures would permit. But to have owned these
                  feelings would have been as impossible as to have spoken in the tongue of angels.
                  It would seem as if, while her whole life centered upon his love, she would hide
                  the precious secret by ringing over it vines and flowers, by mirth and raillery,
                  as a bird hides its nest under tufts of grass, and behind leaves and vines, as a
                  fence against prying eyes.
               The garden was the doctor's paradise. Every day, therefore, he heard from his wife
                  some amusing narration of his conduct. Birds and insects were near of kin to him.
                  Of course, birds and insects every day were made to answer for all manner of
                  curious faults. Every day the indictment varied. Now the flowers had beguiled him.
                  Now the bees had infatuated him; now the birds had quite flown away with his wit;
                  now Rose had bewitched him, or he had gone utterly a gadding with Pete
                  Sawmill.
               Mrs. Wentworth talked both with quickness and emphasis. Her voice was ringing, but
                  very sweet. No fibre springing from combativeness was twined into the chord, and
                  so its sounding was never sharp or harsh.
               A single hour's acquaintance would suffice to discriminate and sharply to separate
                  her from shallow, talkative women, whose tongues, like a turnpike, lie open to all
                  the travel that comes along. It was full of kindness even when bantering. It was
                  often witty, and always shrewd. It ran on as a vine grows,—a morning glory, or a
                  cypress vine,—twining round and round whatever it may touch, and throwing out buds
                  and blossoms at every joint.
               "There is Rose, mounted and riding. It is the last we shall see of her till
                  dinner," said Agate Bissell.
               "Longer than that. She goes out to Cathcart's, you remember, for the day. Of
                  course Pete is her carriage."
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               PETE SAWMILL.
               PETE SAWMILL himself deserves a portrait. He was a huge fellow, black as night
                  standing full six feet five in his stockings. "Good for wadin'," he used to say.
                  "That's how I went fishin' fust. I didn' know what they gave me such legs for, if
                  it wasn't to wade brooks with!" He derived his name from his strength, and the
                  fact that he at one time worked in a neighboring sawmill. The boys were telling a
                  story one day of a bear that had in earlier times, while the men were cutting logs
                  in the neighboring woods, wandered into the mill, and seeing the men's dinner on
                  the log, mounted upon it, and with his back to the saw, began pulling open the
                  cloth, and devouring the meat. The saw soon advanced upon his tail, that lay flat
                  behind him, and nipped a hair or two, at which, a growl! then a sharper pull, and
                  an angrier growl! The third slash cut to the bone, and brought the enraged animal
                  around, with a furious hug at the remorseless saw, which soon rolled him off the
                  log, with sad rents in his garments. This story was once told in his presence, and
                  Pete declared that he could hold the saw. And it is said that,
                  getting first a good position, and, wrapping the teeth well, when the water was
                  let on he held the saw so powerfully that it could not get into motion. However
                  that may be, the story was always told of him when his name excited curiosity.
               Pete was one of those peculiar natures that can never be organized into society,
                  but live, as marmots do, by burrowing, in the neighborhood of men, without living
                  among them.
               He had the strength of two ordinary men, but had little regular use for it. Good
                  nature was constitutional—and laughing may be said to have constituted the greater
                  part of his language. He began his sentences with a flourish of te
                  he's, and they mostly deliquesced into guttural chuckles. When, on public days,
                  trainings, and elections and cattle-shows, Pete's discretion in drink had shown
                  itself to be small, he was never known to quarrel. He settled down in some corner,
                  and talked and laughed to himself with very much the same sounds which issue from a black pot of hasty pudding, as it boils
                  and splatters.
               But these periods were not frequent, and Pete was in demand for such work as
                  required strength. For short spells he would put forth extraordinary strength.
                  "I'd rather have Pete to lay stone-walls with than a yoke of oxen," said farmer
                  Jones, "and as for thrashing, he's a perfect machine."
               "I love to see him chop wood," said a neighbor. "I think Pete prides himself on
                  the way he swings an axe."
               "Well, he's a right to. Just take him on a frosty morning, put a good Collins axe
                  in his hand, and then see him lay off his jacket and mount on a big log, and then
                  he lets it on the wood, and the chips fly so fast that it's dangerous to stand in
                  front. When he's down to the heart of the log, the side of his cut is as smooth
                  as, if it had been planed. There's not a man in this town can do up a cord of wood
                  as quick as he can, and as for splitting', he has a natural eye for a log, and
                  sees just where the crack will run. Some folks, you know, strike and strike, and
                  turn the log over, and try it this way and that, afore they find out the
                  splittin'-vein. But Pete sees it the minute he lays his eye on a stick. I saw him
                  one day, when Bose Hadley'd been whalin' away at a big oak log till he was out of
                  breach, take the axe, and turn the log over, and look at both ends, and then
                  square away and let fly, and the axe went through the log so slick that it fell
                  apart like two boards and his axe went a rod out of his hands."
               "Pete don't know much," said another "but what he does know comes to him mighty
                  natural."
               "I don't know about his bein' so ignorant. His head don't run on books; I doubt if
                  he knows his letters. But, if I'm butcherin', I'd rather have him, than old Harvey
                  himself. Then he has a natural turn for horses, specially if nobody else can
                  manage 'em. Pete, somehow, gets in with 'em as if they was related."
               "He's pretty good in a garden, too. Every thing lives that he puts out. I'd rather
                  have him set a tree for me than do it myself. Pete hain't growed away from natur'
                  so far but what he knows what's goin' on in beasts and birds. There aint his equal
                  at fishin' in these parts. The fish just cum, I do believe, and ask him to catch
                  'em."
               "He don't take on airs about it, neither. He aint stingy. He'd just as soon take
                  you to the best brooks and the best places as not. But then that's nothing. Very
                  like you can't catch a fish. The trout knows who's after 'em. They want Pete to
                  catch 'em not Tom, Dick and Harry."
               "You mind that time he caught that trout out of Holcomb's mill-pond, don't
                  you?—No? Well, it had been known that there was an awful big fellow livin' in
                  there. And I know a hundred folks had tried for him. Gentlemen had come up from
                  New Haven and from Bridgeport, and from down to New York, a-fishin', and ever so
                  many of 'em had wound up with tryin' their luck for that big trout, and they had
                  all sorts of riggin'. One, he tried flies, and another worms; sometimes they took
                  the mornin', and sometimes the evenin'. They knew the hole where he lay. Held been
                  seen breaking' the water for one thing and another, but allus when nobody was
                  fishin'. He was a curious trout. I believe he knew Sunday just as well as Deacon
                  Marble did. At any rate the deacon thought the trout meant to aggravate him. The
                  deacon, you know, is a little waggish. He often tells about that trout. Sez he,
                  'One Sunday morning, just as I got along by the willows, I heard an awful splash,
                  and not ten feet from shore I saw the trout, as long as my arm, just curving over
                  like a bow, and going down with something for breakfast. Gracious! says I, and I
                  almost jumped out of the wagon. But my wife Polly, says she, 'What on airth are
                  you thinkin' of deacon? It's Sabbath day, and you're goin' to meetin'! It's a
                  pretty business for a deacon!' That sort o' cooled me off. But I do say that for
                  about a minute I wished I wasn't a deacon. But wouldn't made any difference, for I
                  came down next day to mill on purpose, and I came down once or twice more, and
                  nothin' was to be seen, tho' I tried him with the most temptin' things. Wal, next
                  Sunday I came along agin, and, to save my life, I couldn't keep off worldly and
                  wanderin' thoughts. I tried to be sayin' my catechism, but I couldn't keep my eyes
                  off the pond as we crime up to the willows. I'd got along in the catechism, as
                  smooth as the road, to the Fourth Commandment, and was sayin' it out loud for
                  Polly, and jist as I was sayin': 'What is required in the Fourth
                  Commandment?' I heard a splash, and there was the trout, and, afore I could think,
                  I said: 'Gracious, Polly, I must have that trout.' She almost riz right up, 'I
                  knew You wan't sayin' your catechism hearty. Is this the way you answer swer the question about keepin' the
                  Lord's day? I'm ashamed, deacon Marble says she. 'You'd better change your road,
                  and go to meetin' on the road over the hill. If I was a deacon, I wouldn't let a
                  fish's tail whisk the whole catechism out of my head;'—and I had to go to meetin'
                  on the hill road all the rest of the summer.'
               "Wal, Pete, he worked down to the mill for a week or two—that's as long as he
                  stays anywhere except at Dr. Wentworth's, and he lets him come and go about as he
                  pleases. And so, one day, says he, 'I'm goin' to catch that big trout.' So, after
                  the sun was gone down, and just as the moon riz and lighted up the tops of the
                  bushes, but didn't touch the water—Pete, he took a little mouse he'd caught, and
                  hooked his hook through his skin, on the back, so that it didn't hurt him or
                  hinder his bein' lively, and he threw him in about as far as a mouse could have
                  jumped from the branches that hung over. Of course the mouse he put out lively to
                  swim for his life. Quick as a flash of lightnin', the water opened with a rush,
                  and the mouse went under; but he came up again, and the trout with him, and he
                  weighed between three and four pound."
               Agate Bissell could not be expected to put a very high value on one who had only,
                  or chiefly, such qualities as gave Pete his 
                     repution
                     reputation
                  . He had no purpose in life. He had no trade or calling. He was an idle
                  fellow; and that term expressed the utmost condemnation which she could pronounce
                  upon one not positively guilty of crime or vice.
               "Doctor Wentworth, it seems to me that Rose might find a better companion than
                  that lazy fellow! What can she learn of him that will make her either wiser or
                  better?"
               The doctor smiled and only looked at Agate. This habit of hearing what she said
                  without reply seemed to disturb Agate's equanimity. She felt it to be but a way of
                  saying that she was not worth answering, though that was far from the truth. His
                  mind wandered off and followed out what she said, till he quite forgot the
                  answer.
               "Agate! will you hand me that large folio of engravings?"
               She laid it on the table and opened the volume.
               "Now," said the doctor, "do you think it makes any difference with me
                     who opens this book for me? The contents are there, and do not
                  depend for their value on the person who opens and shows them. So it is with Pete.
                  He opens the book of nature to Rose—that's all. He has no ideas. He can hardly
                  speak intelligibly. He has no place in society. But he is strangely alive to the
                  facts of nature, and he will show Rose more things in natural history than any
                  person in this town."
               "Of course you can do as you please; Rose is your daughter. If she was mine, I
                  don't think I should send her to Pete to learn about this world, or that to
                  come!"
               "Courage, Agate! Between Pete and you, I hope to make a good girl of Rose!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIII.
               ROSE AND ALICE.
               IT was a mid-June day, the very balmiest day of the sweetest month of the
                  New-England summer. All that foreign poets say of Man in our northern land must be
                  applied to June. The boisterous winds that rage in March, the cold nights that
                  undo all that warm April days have done the chilling rain blown from the east upon
                  anguish May, are all past. All the scars of winter are healed, and the conflicts
                  of the spring have issued in a perfect victory, for whose celebration the leaves
                  shake out their ample folds, and the flowers lift up their banners in every field,
                  and through the forests. Their enemy is destroyed. Frosts are dead, and flowers
                  are jubilant.
               It would seem that this day of Rose's visit to Alice Cathcart, was, above all
                  other June days, transcendent in mild glory. Never were the blue heavens deeper
                  and bluer. Never were clouds softer, or sailing in white islands with more
                  tranquil errands. They did not troop with that stern and brilliant march that they
                  seem to have in October days, as if they mustered, far away, to some call unheard
                  of men, for battle or for vengeance of storms; but they moved gently, as if they
                  carried in their plushy depths sleeping infants and serenely swaying them, rocked
                  their slumbers into sleep, in a peace high above earthly sounds, and higher even
                  than dreams can fly.
               But what foolish creatures birds are! They saw nothing of all this beauty, or else
                  they would not have filled the air with such a racket. Blue-birds whispered their
                  brief syllable of music; the meadow lark, who wears a black heart upon its yellow
                  breast, as if all the year it had a sorrow incurable wailed out its wild sweet
                  dirge. Robins, plump and familiar, called and sung, in sober jollity, from every
                  orchard, from gardens and fields, from skirts of bushes, and the edges of the
                  forest—our most familiar and sweetest singing summer birds.
               I wrong the sparrow, which begins earlier, sings more constantly, and holds out
                  longer than the thrush—singing its exquisite strain, faulty only in that it is too
                  short, till summer is almost over, till the sun burns the grass, till flocks are
                  silent till the locusts and the crickets come. No wonder Rose caught her breath,
                  as a song-sparrow broke out in its tenderest strain right above her head, while
                  they were passing a garden edged with trees, and then slipped her little hands, as
                  if asking for more. Who has not done the like, or felt like doing it?
               But Pete, on whose shoulders Rose sat with about as much tax upon his strength as
                  an epaulette imposes upon a soldier's shoulder, strided on, to get clear of town
                  and the outskirts, and reach the brook, where he left the road and sought, if not
                  a nearer, yet a pleasanter way, across lots, to 'Biah Cathcart's.
               Pete was entirely happy. He had Rose on his shoulder, who sat perked up there with
                  all a queen's joy, and none of her cares. Without knowing why, she felt the
                  influences of the day; and feelings which, later in life, would assume definite
                  form, and submit themselves to reason and analysis, now sent up within her vague
                  and gentle influences, which might he likened to the air about her, filled with
                  sweet exhalations from the ground, and odors from the woods, and sounds of every
                  kind.
               But Pete, himself only an overgrown child, was, if possible, happier yet. Blindly
                  along his nerves crept something of the atmospheric influences, stirring, it is
                  probable, no such nascent poetic influences as thrilled the charming little
                  nosegay of a child on his shoulder, but which, in him, were developed in ways of
                  which Rose was quite unconscious. The venatorial instinct seems in undeveloped men
                  to be the rude germ of that which, in civilized men, grows into scientific wisdom.
                  Persons of fine organization, but without education, are often far more quick to
                  discern, and far more in sympathy with, the instincts and babies of animals than
                  wiser men are. There is a political economy of the woods and fields, as well as of
                  cities and towns—an animal economy as well as a civic economy. Men utterly devoid
                  of the knowledge of property, production, wages, rents or values of any kind, have
                  a clear insight of squirrels, foxes, marmots, fish and birds, in all their
                  varieties.
               Pete seemed to know before experience, what every wild creature would do, and had
                  also apparently, a fascination over them. To what else could be referred the
                  almost utter tameness to him of creatures
                  shy and wild to all others? The quail would not rise, but ran before him as it is
                  known to do before the horse. A partridge would not fly from its nest, and seemed
                  sure that Pete would respect its domesticity. Squirrels ran down the trees, jumped
                  and pranced along the ground, barking and jerking their tails, as if saying among
                  themselves, "Oh, it is nobody but Pete," and went on with their frolics in
                  conscious security. There was a league of peace between him and all creatures.
                  This did not exclude his rights of snaring and fishing; for how could he claim a
                  place in the human family, if he had no right to destroy life? But it is probable
                  that Pete was regarded by the animal kingdom as a kind of fate, or Providence, and
                  that when he saw fit to take birds or fishes it was eminently proper that birds
                  and fishes should be resigned to depart without questioning his wisdom or
                  kindness.
               Rex, a Newfoundland dog, that seemed to be another Pete running on all fours,
                  seemed this day to be in ecstatic state. He got out of town with only a few
                  capers. But, his sobriety was all a pretence; scarcely had he reached the open
                  country before he was scouring the pastures, and rousing up the old cows to great
                  excitement in defence of their calves, while two or three brood mares with pokes
                  on, their colts footing it fleetly in advance of them, disappeared over the
                  hill.
               "Come back Rex! you nigger you! Come here, you liar you! Ye said you would behave
                  if I'd let you come."
               Rex, with his red tongue out, came at once to his senses and trotted behind Pete,
                  as if he had never dreamed of an irregularity. But a little further on, over a bit
                  of round hill, fed a few dozen sheep, and he could no more help going off into
                  them, than a gun can when a spark lights on the powder. In one half minute there
                  was not a sheep to be seen. If they had been blown away by the wind, as leaves
                  are, they could hardly have made such expedition as when Rex suddenly appeared
                  among them.
               "Hup! Hup! Rex, you villain! Come down! Come down, you rogue!"
               Almost before the sentence was finished, Rex, with a look of the most undisturbed
                  good nature, came over the wall like a grasshopper, leaping first and looking
                  afterwards; and, as the wall stood upon the crest of a bank, no sooner had he
                  cleared it than he performed a summersault, and rolled down in a manner of which
                  any dignified dog should have been ashamed, but at which Rose laughed till she
                  almost fell off her roost.
               Rex seemed really penitent, and might have finished the journey with credit if
                  Widow Hubbard had not kept geese. The moment he ran up the little hill which
                  overlooks the brook, he saw them. Slipping through the bushes and over the fence,
                  in a twinkling the whole flock were in a whirl. Some rushed for the water, some
                  tumbled over, all were screaming and trumpeting, and several having got wing, flew
                  squawking for a hundred rods, and came down from sheer inability to keep up. But
                  long before they alighted, Rex had let all alone, and stretched away up the brook
                  to take a smell and a scratch at a woodchuck's hole which never failed to throw
                  him into a paroxysm of excitement since the day that he ran a marmot into it.
               The great, succulent leaves of the skunk's cabbage were fully expanded. In places
                  where the brook, spread out into a kind of marsh, cowslips were blazing in clumps
                  of yellow, and as they came near the open edge of the woods, spring flowers in
                  great variety, bloomed in endless profusion.
               By the time that Rose had reached the same point, Rex, his ardor abated, sat on
                  his haunches, panting, his red tongue hanging out, and the utmost propriety
                  stamped on every feature. How little are dogs to be trusted! This decorum is not
                  skin deep. You would think him a judge. His thoughts run upon duty, moderation,
                  propriety! If you believe it, just let a red squirrel, or a chipmunk, put its nose
                  out of the wall and see!
               Rose would dismount for a few flowers which she espied. Then she must needs be put
                  on the top of the stone wall, next the bar post, where she could look along the
                  brook valley on the other side. Here the little queen took on airs, and sent her
                  Ethiop to get her some moss, or for a sprig from yonder bush, or for some white
                  pebbles out of the brook, for a few rushes out of the bog, for some
                  partridge-berry vines from the edge of the wood. Around her straw gipsy bonnet she
                  had arranged a coronet of leaves and vines and flowers, with a skill that showed
                  how well already she had learned of her father the secret things which flowers
                  tell to all who have their senses exercised to understand the secret lore of
                  Nature!
               From her lap full of various treasure, Rose looked along the winding brook, along the narrow, level meadow,
                  which stretched far inland, along the jutting edges of the forest, to the far off
                  blue bills. She forgot where she was. The scene grew shadowy and fantastic.
                  Already, before she knew the words by which men express it, Nature was teaching
                  her something of the Infinite. The visible was leading her to the invisible, and
                  she saw dimly, or felt, the power of the world to come!
               Of old, God spoke, in watches of the night, to young Samuel sleeping in the
                  Tabernacle. And still God speaks to the young in the greater Tabernacle of Nature,
                  calling them, with voices or influences which, if understood, would reveal strange
                  and deep things, well worthy to be known.
               Pete was sprawled upon the ground, watching a petty ant-hill and its little fiery
                  swarm, and was coaxing the ants to crawl on his black hand, when Rose summoned
                  him, to resume the journey.
               They came to the pine woods in which winds always seemed to Rose to be moaning and
                  sighing, where melancholy birds cried: "Cree-ah, cree-ah," with so sad a tone,
                  that Rose could have cried for them. Through this strip of pine, smelling fragrant
                  of resin, upon the cast off and dead leaves that never more rustle, but cover the
                  ground with soundless carpet, Pete stride, stopping only to point up to a crow's
                  nest. Then they came to a hardwood grove, full of wild azaleas and kalmias.
                  Partridges nested in the part that ran round the side of the hill, and Pete knew
                  where, but had no time now, for it was already between nine and ten. But he must
                  needs show Rose a hole where flying squirrels lived, and stopped in one little
                  open glade to let her see the red squirrels run, and to listen if they might hear
                  the wood-thrush sing. They might have heard it; for they had hardly cleared the
                  grove before it filled the woods with its solitary ecstasy. Rex knew the ground,
                  and though there were endless temptations in the swamp yonder, and quails on the
                  edge of the wood, and partridges among the thick underbrush under the ledge, and
                  infinite delight all round, yet his tender heart knew that he was drawing near to
                  Spark, a black and tan terrier, now only separated from him by the width of a
                  field.
               As Rex came over the wall into the door yard, Spark let forth such a stream of
                  barking and yelling that it seemed as if the heat of his rage had melted the
                  separate notes into a molten solution of bark, which terminated as suddenly as it
                  began, when Rex came trotting up, proud as a lion, carry his ridged tail straight
                  up in the air like a banner. They ran round each other with most familiar
                  smellings and finally broke away together in a rush down the yard, rolling over
                  and wrestling and racing, until suddenly Spark remembered that he had something
                  hid under the barn—a rat, or perhaps a weasel, or who knows, it may leave been
                  a—whatever that is which a dog is thinking of when he rushes off to poke his nose
                  through each chink, and peep in at every hole, and smell around the whole
                  circumference of the barn and its sheds!
               The appearance of Rex vaulting over the wall was the signal that Rose was near.
                  Alice had been waiting impatiently, and good Rachel Cathcart, who filled the whole
                  house with her presence, and yet seldom spoke, and then not above a melodious
                  whisper, had she said what she felt, would have owned that the day was a little
                  brighter for Rose's coming; and so when Rex's black muzzle came over the wall, and
                  set off Spark, every body ran to the door, and Alice, with her black hair shining
                  in the sun and banging down her shoulders, shaded her eyes with her hand, and
                  watched on tip-toe. First came a little bit of color, which sunk again, but at a
                  step nearer showed a face in it, and a second after a great, good-natured black
                  visage was rising over the wall and Pete sailed up to the door, giggling and
                  gurgling, as was his manner of salutation. Pete gave Rose a toss, and she, light
                  as a bird and springy as a squirrel, alit by Alice's side, and each of them
                  disappeared in the other's arms, in a sort of general mixture of kissing and
                  caressing.
               Aunt Rachel—Rose always called her aunt—stood looking at them as if, for a moment,
                  all the world looked bright, and children, at least, had a right to be happy.
               And now, what were the girls to do? Do?—the morning was not long enough for their
                  pressing necessities! First, they ran to Alice's room, and, with much confidential
                  and low talk, inspected some, I know not what, treasure—may be a new cap,—perhaps
                  a doll,—possibly a baby's bed or bureau,—and it may be a whole suit of doll's
                  apparel! There was a session up garret, which was general play-room, and where all
                  sorts of stowaways and good-for-some-things—crippled chairs, dilapidated bureaus,
                  old fire-fenders, and boxes of various patterns, give endless room for rummaging.
                  If they find any thing, well and good; if they do not, they make it all up, saying: "Oh, Rose, what if we should open
                  that drawer, and then you should see a gold bird, and he should jump out and fly
                  up on that clothes-line, and begin to sing!" etc.
               But Rose, to-day, was to see more substantial things; for it was the cheese-day,
                  and Aunt Rachel's cheeses, like every thing from her hands, admitted of no
                  rivalry. Already the curd was formed; but Rose was called to see it broken up,
                  salted, drained, and pressed. With wonder she inspected the cheese-room, where
                  some two score cheeses of various ages lay ranged upon the successive shelves.
               "These are old," said Alice, pointing to the topmost row; "these are going to
                  market; and these are not cured yet; we have to turn and rub them every day."
               Which operation Rose gravely essayed to perform under Aunt Rachel's direction.
               Nothing could long detain the children from the only city of a child's desire—a
                  huge, old-fashioned barn! There is something in its homely simplicity, in its
                  negligence, that puts them at ease. No carpets hold them in caution; no furniture
                  lords it over the freedom of their motions. No valetudinarians or nervous people
                  are incommoded by their noise. It is a very castle of liberty to them! They are
                  unwatched and untutored. They are their own masters. Mice squeak and quarrel in
                  the bins and barrels. The old cat is roused by the symptoms, and lies alert,
                  crouched, or glides eagerly in and out searching for her prey. Swallows fly in and
                  twitter up and down about their nests plastered under the ridge-pole. Flocks of
                  hens come to the door, look in first and with one eye, and then with the
                  other,—each one calling "Cut-cut-cutarkut!" or else suppressing in her throat some
                  remark not prudent to utter!
               To-day, both doors, wide and high, stood wide open, leaving the floor clear
                  through to the sunshine and fresh air. One mow was empty, waiting for the new crop
                  of hay soon to be cut. The other side yet held many tons, and furnished a spot for
                  jumping and frolicking. With a wild outcry a hen flies off her nest. One would
                  think she had been threatened, attacked, and every right rudely invaded! Instead
                  of that she has only laid an egg! Many of her superiors make all the noise without
                  an egg. The children run for it,—they search for others,—and, oh! joy of
                  excitements, find a new nest, with ten eggs in it! They bear their treasure and
                  triumph of discovery to the house with exultation. They race back again for their
                  sport. Their bonnets are gone, their cheeks are flushed,—every thing is
                  mirthful,—they laugh at the gate, and laugh at the hens, and laugh at Spark, who
                  is just now seized with the conviction that there is a rat somewhere, and who is
                  running wildly, all a-tremble with excitement and fairly screaming with fury at
                  the dastardly rat, who has not the rat-hood to come forth and show himself openly,
                  but meanly takes advantage of his hole!
               They peer into the root-cellar, and look timid,—it is so very dark, and a foul,
                  damp air and smell of old roots send them away. The grain-room is more attractive.
                  They measure oats, and climb up on the slippery ears of unshelled corn, which
                  slide them down as fast as they scramble up. They get into the buggy, and lay the
                  whip upon imaginary horses, and jounce up and down upon the springy seats, as if
                  the road was very rough or the speed very great. The well, too, calls them. It is
                  an old-fashioned well, dug so many years ago that every body has forgotten when.
                  It is very deep—they peer over, and look down, and can see nothing; and that is
                  always very terrible when one is looking into darkness; and both run away, and
                  then laugh because they run.
               It is noon. Ah, how clear the sky! How sweet the air! How full of clover
                  smell—great red clover, which spreads out just below, whole acres, and has drawn
                  either bees from every direction, and made them greedy with delight! And now the
                  horn blows. It is dinner time—twelve o'clock. "There is father!" cries Alice and
                  runs for him, and Rose hard after, and both get kissed for their pains, and one is
                  mounted on one shoulder and one on the other—while Barton Cathcart in tow
                  pantaloons, barefoot, tanned, all but his eyes and hair, which are black as night,
                  walks briskly, to let the girls see that ten years old can keep step with
                  full-grown men. And Papa Cathcart must wash his great head and tan-colored neck
                  and short hair all over—and Barton Cathcart must wash his soiled hands and tanned
                  face—and Rose and Alice must wash their red faces and white hands!
               The dinner was in the great kitchen to-day. Not that there was not a dining-room,
                  which served also for the sitting-room. But now was the busy time, and the old
                  kitchen was so large and pleasant, and it was so much easier for Mrs. Cathcart to
                  do the work, there being only a girl to help her. The doors stood wide open, and the windows stood wide open,
                  and before long mouths were open too. The potatoes could not contain themselves,
                  but in the goodness of their hearts had split open with benevolence, and lay in
                  the dish like sacks of meal ripped open and spilling. The meat smelled so
                  good!—even the dogs could not wait. Rex, with the most beseeching eagerness,
                  licked his chops, and Spark whined and trembled, and half-barked, as much as to
                  say, "I can't stand it much longer."
               They all ate—the two hired men ate, and the man that hired them ate, and the boys
                  ate and the girls, and even the dogs ate, snipping the morsels and scraps from
                  time to time flung to them, and swallowing them so suddenly, that it was as if
                  they had been flung down a well.
               Where was Pete? Gone back to town to tell the Doctor and Mrs. Wentworth that Rose
                  would stay all night, and that Pete was to come back with some fish-spears, and
                  that a party would be formed to go out to Broad Brook that night to spear suckers.
                  Pete mounted the colt,—a horse ten years old, but which was still called the colt.
                  The "young horse" was nearly fifteen. Indeed, the team horses were only seven and
                  eight years old, and the "colt" and "young horse" were the veterans. On his bare
                  back Pete sat astraddle, his long legs nearly sweeping the ground, and both horse
                  and rider being of one mind, the journey was not long, nor was the return so
                  delayed but that Pete arrived in ample time to secure his dinner.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               THE NIGHT FISHING.
               LONG had Alice been promised that she should see some night fishing. What it
                  should be, filled Rose with mysterious imaginations. Hardy and tough Barton, who
                  that afternoon had vacation in honor of Miss Rose, being three years her senior,
                  felt the importance of his superior age, and taught and dictated in the most
                  edifying manner.
               The spears were sharpened, and Pete and Barton made torches, tying a rude tin cup
                  to a short stick and filling it with turpentine and oil. A loose wick was
                  provided, which was capable of giving a broad glare of light.
               At length the supper was over; the two-horse wagon came round; the girls were
                  charged with extra shawls for use when returning. The light along the West was yet
                  a day light, but was rapidly fading. Great clouds lay banked up far away in the
                  south-west, and flashes of light shooting through them told of distant
                  thunder-storms. But all the sky hitherward was clear and serene, and within an
                  hour the moon would be up.
               A drive of a mile brought the party to Broad Brook. It was one of those rocky and
                  gravelly streams found in mountain regions which emigrants settled upon the flat
                  alluvial lands of the west long for, when in fevers they lie half asleep and half
                  awake, and dream that they are back again at home, and see the water clear as
                  crystal rushing over the pebbles, or widening into sheets, and, longing for its
                  coolness, awake, and in their weariness shed tears for very homesickness!
               Broad Brook was of mountain origin. Into it came Glover's Brook from the ravine,
                  famous for its wildness and its trout, and Twist's River, and ever so many more
                  mountain-fed little streams: so that by the time it had come down to Morsels
                  Bridge it had become a stream of some dignity and power. Had its waters been
                  compressed into narrow bounds, it would have been formidable for any one who
                  should seek to ford it. But it preferred to spread itself, and to brawl over a
                  wide bottom, and to wind along the edges
                  of the hills, with meadows on one side and rocks on the other, now and then
                  circuiting off far into the grass-lands, running deep, with many a pool. Above the
                  bridge, for the most part, it hugged the bills, and was broad and shallow, better
                  fitted for wading.
               The party was soon upon its banks. The western light had grown dim. A steep bank
                  on the far side of the river, clothed with trees, and especially held by the
                  solemn black hemlock, served to shut out the little remaining twilight. The roar
                  of the brook, its wild and threatening look, at first daunted Rose and Alice, and
                  brought them close to each other, to Barton's great edification. That was because
                  they were girls! He would show them! and without more ado he jumped into the
                  water, not quite knee deep, and walked across and back, and let the water bubble
                  up around his legs. The torches were soon lit, and Pete and Barton took each a
                  spear, and, girding a bag about them to hold the fish, began to move up the
                  stream. From the banks, under 'Biah Carthcart's care, the girls watched the
                  strange and wild scene. The smoky torches threw a red glare on the water, whose
                  wrinkled face gave back the light in broken flashes. The bank obscurely loomed out
                  from the other side, jutting forward, seemingly, as the light hazily revealed its
                  rocks, and drawing back again when a clump of hemlocks or mountain laurels opened
                  dark recesses through the foliage. Moving slowly against the rushing stream,
                  passing the light along its surface, and surveying its bottom, Pete and Barton for
                  a time seemed to find nothing. But as they neared a point where the water,
                  swinging around, deepened a little, Barton plunged down his spear, and, with some
                  commotion and tussle, held it there. His torch had almost fallen. But regaining
                  his foothold, he soon lifted a large sucker above the water, the first prize of
                  the evening. Scarcely was his trophy secured before Pete, who had been bending and
                  searching the bottom, was seen aiming his spear, and with sudden stroke, retracted
                  as soon, lifted a fish large enough to make the ashen spear-handle bend.
               Growing bolder as they advanced, Rose and Alice imagined themselves in a fairy
                  story. Pete and Barton, now in gloom and now shining out in the red light of the
                  torches, seemed like gnomes. The trees, as the torches were carried under them,
                  were lit up with an atmosphere such as no unenchanted trees ever knew. The water
                  seemed to be some living thing, and scowled or laughed, winked and blinked, as if
                  it knew something wild and dreadful. Now the stream left the hill, and moved
                  between two rows of stiff alders, and the fishers were lost to the sight, only a
                  faint red smoke flickering above the bushes, revealing their progress. Then
                  winding back again, the stream brawled against the rocks, and ran for a long way
                  under the projecting branches of hard wood trees.
               And now the girls, growing somewhat bolder and more familiar, wanted to go into
                  the brook. Of course they could not. But couldn't somebody let them ride? How
                  could 'Biah Cathcart carry two girls, seven years old, when the river bottom was
                  so uneven? What if his foot should slip, or he should step down into a hole—where
                  would the girls be?
               But couldn't Pete take one, and the father take the other? Rose could ask for
                  nothing which Pete would not do. He would have laid down in the river or in a
                  mud-hole or climbed the steepest rock, or jumped the most dangerous chasm if Rose
                  told him to. And when, as they rounded a clump of bushes, Pete came near the bank,
                  Rose said to him, "Pete, mayn't I get on your shoulder?" the controversy was
                  ended, and in a twinkling he was at the bank and Rose was mounted; and Alice, not
                  a minute after was on her father's shoulder close behind and all were in the
                  foaming stream. And, now I defy you, O painters, to render me in true form and
                  color that scene—the wrinkle-faced river, ruddy and changeful—the overhanging
                  boughs, up into whose obscure depths shoots a smoky, tremulous light—and the
                  strange forms of men moving slowly along the water, bearing two maidens as sweet
                  as ever dazzled the eyes of deluded mortals! Was it strange that Rose seemed to
                  herself translated from the real world into one of dreams? The dizzy gravel at the
                  bottom appeared to her to be running and racing; the water seemed like so many
                  serpents red and black, wreathing together and winding in and out of coils that
                  were endless in length and strange in their convolutions. Never had she seen such
                  leaves as those there above her head, weird with light shot up upon them from
                  beneath, and over all, the solemn black of the night sky!
               They had well nigh reached the upper road when the moon rose, and poured its light
                  full upon the bridge that now appeared not far ahead, and upon a party that sat in
                  an open carriage gazing down upon this strange procession.
               
               "Mercy—look down into that river! What is it, Hiram?"
               "Wal, as near as I can see, it's a nigger sprouting and blossoming into a white
                  folk. If 'Biah Cathcart wasn't a sober man, I should say that hindermost one was
                  he, and his darter on his back. And if that one ahead ain't Pete and the Doctor's
                  Rose, I'll never kiss my wife agin. Scissors and pumpkins! if that ain't a spree!
                  and here it is after nine o'clock at night! Hullo there! where's Aunt Rachel? and
                  where's the rest of the family? Ain't there any more comin'? You might jest as
                  well have finished out the frolic and brought along every thing you've got, as to
                  have them children out this time o' night!"
               But Hiram's banter had no effect upon the party. All of them were keyed up too
                  high with the sport. Pete gurgled and giggled; 'Biah said nothing, but smiled
                  contentedly; and Barton alone had voice to shout, till the woods rung.
               "You'd better take them children home, unless you want a bigger river on the top
                  of 'em than you've got under 'em!" said Hiram as he touched his ponies and started
                  away.
               Sure enough! The sky was gathering clouds. Low and distant thunder was heard. They
                  must hasten back. Blinded and bewildered by the unnatural light and the swirling
                  water, 'Biah and Barton would have followed down the bank but for Pete, whose head
                  seemed as unaffected by the scene as a compass is by the commotion of waters. The
                  winding of the river had given them a course of two miles, but scarcely half a
                  mile need be traversed in a straight line, to bring them to the wagon. Following
                  Pete, they soon were safely seated, and the horses, impatient and restive, as if
                  by instinct aware that a storm impeded, no sooner had their heads turned homeward,
                  than they dashed off with full course. The sparks flew from under their feet. They
                  grow more eager with each turn of the road, and 'Biah soothed and restrained them
                  with both voice and rein. It seemed to the girls that the whole ride was like an
                  arrow's rush. Bushes darkly loomed and disappeared, a faint glimmer of a house was
                  extinguished in a second by their rapid passing. The wind was swaying the trees
                  and rolling up the damp dust of the road, and the thunder shook the very ground as
                  it fell nearer and nearer. They were not afraid. They secretly gladdened with the
                  growing turmoil.
               Aunt Rachel had been uneasy ever since the children left. Rex had been kept in the
                  house lest his freaks should disturb the fishing. At every sound he lifted his
                  muzzle. Often he went to the door, and smelt and whined. But now the storm was
                  coming on. Aunt Rachel's fears grew painful. Every thunder-roll increased her
                  alarm. The big drops were beginning to smite the panes of glass, when Rex bounced
                  up with excitement, and gave a roaring bark which could mean nothing but their
                  arrival. In good time! for, just as the party tumbled out, and the girls were
                  borne in, the torrent descended; and when the light from the open door struck out
                  into the air, sheets of water seemed literally to fulfil Hiram's hyperbole, that
                  rivers of water would fill the heavens.
               "Oh, father," said Rachel Cathcart, "it is wild of you to have these children out
                  on such a night! Come in, my darlings."
               But Rose and Alice were evidently too much excited and happy to need pity.
               "Why, Rachel, do you suppose people catch cold when they are excited like these
                  children?"
               "But what would Doctor Wentworth say?"
               "Say? Why he would say that such an experience was better than a dozen volumes of
                  books—that it would give life to the imagination, that it would give the children
                  impressions which would enlarge their whole after life—that's what he would say!
                  and if he had been along himself, he would have enjoyed it better than any of us.
                  Don't you think so, Rose?"
               Rose sagely assented.
               "Why, father, you seem as much excited as the children!"
               "Why not? I hope never to get over being young. I look back on this night as if I
                  had been walking in a cave full of crystals. I shall never forget it, and I'll
                  warrant the children never will. Such things clean off the drudgery and sameness
                  of life and reach toward a deeper meaning. At an rate that's what the doctor'll
                  say, to-morrow. You see if he don't."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XV.
               LIGHTS AND SHADOWS.
               AFTER a day of so much excitement the two girls would scarcely be held from sleep
                  by the violence of the storm. Only at one or two tremendous peals of thunder did
                  they start from their slumber and listen to the sweeping wind, which rattled every
                  window, roared in the chimneys, and shook the whole house. Then suddenly the
                  tumult would cease. Not a drop of rain would fall. Not a leaf seemed to move, nor
                  a puff of wind to blow. Just as suddenly would the rain again pour in torrents,
                  only abruptly to cease, as if a valve had been shut, and the supply instantly cut
                  off.
               Nor did the light that fell upon their faces, as Aunt Rachel came for her last
                  care before retiring, disturb an eyelid. The darkness and the light are alike to
                  those whom God translates into the mysterious world of sleep. Strange world! in
                  which we dwell in unconsciousness a quarter part of all our lives! Is four score
                  years then so long, that from it must be subtracted a full fourth part?
               To one of Rachel's peculiar habits of mind the spectacle of sleep is always solemn
                  and mysterious. Where do their spirits wander? Voyaging along the dark continent,
                  through what influences do they glide? What guardian spirits convoy them? Or what
                  spiteful sprites would annoy them? If they were dead, would they not lie just as
                  now they do? Rachel shuddered as she tucked them up and put back a raven lock of
                  hair that had escaped from Alice's cap.
               Think it not strange that a farmer's wife should deeply ponder questions which
                  have tasked the deepest thinkers. Careful thinking may demand careful culture. But
                  it is nature that gives the power to think, and it is conferred on many who never
                  train their faculties with the help of schools. Now and then, and in New England
                  often, are to be found plain and uncultured persons, whose unconscious thoughts
                  deal habitually with the profoundest questions which man can ponder. The very
                  intensity of religious conviction—at once the cause of so much that is good, and
                  the occasion of so much ill repute—tends, at length, to breed among the common
                  people an aptitude for deep moral problems.
               But Rachel never sought such subjects. They came to her, and came largely, through
                  her feelings and her imagination. She was scarcely conscious of her own agency in
                  producing the thoughts—half-sad impressions of the infinite—which seemed to
                  overshadow her. She was scared at the impressions which seemed to fall upon
                  her,—just as birds, singing in a thicket, if the shadow of a hawk sailing in the
                  air pass by, hush their notes and nestle close. Many have marvelled at the mystery
                  of human life, its irregularities, its inequalities, its incompleteness, its
                  contradictory elements its inequitableness. These were not Rachel's peculiar
                  thoughts. Life seemed every day like a voyage along the edge of a great spirit
                  world, out of which, it seemed to her, presently would come some infinite truth,
                  some revelation. These were not thoughts, but vague feelings.
               Nor are such tendencies uncommon among common people, There are many fine natures
                  hidden under coarse forms. Powerful impressions are produced on many who cannot
                  resolve them into ideas, and still less fashion them to words. Along the furrow,
                  by the workbench in the chamber or in the kitchen have been thousands silently
                  plying the unknown with as solemn an earnestness as that of those who write books
                  to prove how little man can know of the Unknowable.
               Of all that have cast line or net into that sea, whose line has straightened? and
                  whose net has been broken with its draught of fishes?
               But this evening, as if stirred up by the excitement of the night and the storm,
                  Rachel seemed to gaze upon Alice as one who sends a child afar off. What is before
                  her? Is her life already rolled up within her, as leaves and blossoms are in buds?
                  Do men come into life mere messengers to fulfil decrees? Is this child like a
                  dyer's thread, whose colors, differently measured and laid in, shall in weaving
                  form a prearranged figure? And what is the pattern? Who knows? And what will be
                  the weaving? Who can tell? Can anyone hinder it? or help it? Must it
                  be?—is it decreed?—will my darling's life unfold as inevitably as a rose pit into
                  a rose bush? an apple seed into an apple tree? Must I let her go, as one would cut, loose a skiff, and
                  let it drift out into the wide ocean? It may founder or strand upon a desolate
                  island, or monsters may seize it, or rough men, seeing it helpless on the sea,
                  snatch up its little voyager into some ship of foreign tongue, on rude and
                  dangerous voyages! Already Rachel felt that Alice was gone out of her arms, and
                  that dull aching which came from the soul's deep sense of pilgrimage—from the
                  habit of solitary thought, from its pining after truths beyond the boundary
                  fines—was a premonition of sorrow.
               Rachel left the children and went down stairs. The storm was sobbing itself to
                  rest. The thunder grew more distant, and the rain settled down to a steady work of
                  fine and constant drops. Into the great kitchen she went, and closing the doors,
                  ere long she was bowed in prayer. No words escaped her. Yet tears were there many,
                  and many sighs. But, as the storm had spent itself out of doors, so it would seem
                  as if this pleading face to face with God had scattered her clouds, and if she did
                  not arise radiant, she at least wore a face solemn with the peace of resignation.
                  If one shall ask, was there need of such trouble? Not to him that asketh. But to
                  him that is born to sing, singing is a necessity: and to him that is born to sigh,
                  sighing is a necessity. Some smile easily, and some are just as easily sad. Some
                  think. Some feel. Each has his mood.
               A conscience that is idealized, that clothes the minutest shades of life with
                  transcendent importance, and sees refinements in duty far beyond common eyes
                  cannot help stamping the character with a peculiar experience.
               The broad common sense of her husband was only just enough touched with the
                  imagination to give richness, and plain and practical refinements. But he was not
                  wont to spend thought either upon his own states of mind, or upon the subtle
                  questions, which dazzle, or darken, natures of a mystical tendency. He knew all
                  the doctrines of religion as she did. He read the same books, listened to the same
                  sermons; but the result in each was utterly unlike. There was not simply
                  definiteness, but uniformity of conception in his mind. Once having explored a
                  doubt and mastered it, it never rose again. Once having traced the proofs of any
                  proposition to an intellectual conviction, that truth stood forever clear and
                  firm.
               Rachel lacked that philosophical grip which holds a truth to its place, and
                  compels it to a decent and conventional behavior, Truths came and went above her
                  head, as summer clouds do casting down their shifting shadows in endless variety
                  and never twice alike. A fear which was mastered yesterday was as fresh to-day as
                  the new wind of March which blows no less to-day because it was spent and hushed
                  yesterday evening.
               If in her childhood truth had risen upon her mind in its wider aspects and the
                  infiniteness of divine tenderness had fired the imagination and toned the
                  conscience, it is not easy to see what measure of difference there would have been
                  between the result and that which actually had taken place, by an early and
                  continued presentation to her mind of sterner views of divine justice and of the
                  requisitions of divine purity.
               Winged with imagination and colored with fear and exquisite sensibility of
                  conscience her thoughts ranged those vast fields of truth so familiar to
                  New-England pulpits; not as if affrighted with some near and impending terror, but
                  as sad with long-familiar truth whose glory and beauty cast down shadows and
                  twilight upon our mortal state, and stained all human life.
               That this was a feeling rather than a conviction made it the more unmanageable.
                  That it dissolved and fled away often, when sharply pierced with a clear truth,
                  was of little use so long as "the clouds returned again after the rain."
               It should not be thought that these inward experiences produced a moping,
                  tear-shedding woman, who carried her shadow over all the household. Rachel had a
                  peculiar charm of personal presence. Her sympathy was so quick, her goodness so
                  deep, her intuitions so fine, that she took hold upon all who came near her, and
                  evinced a singular power of producing happiness in them. Nothing of her own moods
                  appeared to ordinary observers except a fine sadness which passed among her
                  friends not apt to distinguish closely between shades of feeling, simply as
                  tenderness. It is not uncommon for such natures to guard their inward life with a
                  jealous shame, as if it would, if known, lower them in men's approbation. And
                  sometimes, too, the rebound from these airy and endless musings into practical
                  kindness brings grateful relief. At any rate, Rachel was known neither by her
                  children nor her friends as one of an unhappy experience, but as one of the few that were far more than they seemed;
                  whose reserve was that of inward occupation and depth, rather than of timidity or
                  of pride.
               The morning came to the happy children. Alice was to return with Rose, and spend
                  the day in town, and Rose was to show and share a wealth of things indoors and
                  out, which seemed to Alice—whose more simple and retired life seldom met with
                  superfluities—a fairy world.
               Is there in life a fairer sight than two maidens, just emerging from childhood,
                  twined together in love, gentle, strong, sincere, and full of fancies? who see
                  real things as if they were visions, and imaginary things as if they were real?
                  whose days and nights flow musical as a meadow brook, between green banks, and
                  over a bottom rough, just enough to give flash and ripple to the surface? All the
                  simplicity of childhood is yet theirs, while dawning duties and social proprieties
                  begin to jut out like the buds in early spring! How beautiful the contrast between
                  Alice, sensitive, reserved, and full of innate dignity—whose cheek changed color
                  to her feelings, shifting almost as the colors flash from a hummingbird's back as
                  he quivers among flowers,—and Rose, fair skinned, of a brown hair that might be
                  called suppressed auburn,—free, frank, strong and loving,—who seemed conscious of
                  the life and meaning of every living thing except herself. She had that perfect
                  health which produces unconsciousness of self. Alice accepted mirth but never
                  created it. Rose sparkled with it. Her thoughts moved in a brilliant atmosphere.
                  In certain of her moods events, people, and even soulless objects, sparkled with
                  gayety and humor. The two girls might be called, in the language of art, Light and
                  Shadow.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               STORIES FOR CHILDREN.
               IF a day in a country farm-house is joyous to town-people, not less exhilarating
                  to country friends is a day in a town-mansion. Alice, in her silent and gentle
                  way, seemed to absorb happiness from the very air. That sensitive timidity, which
                  was like an outer-garment to her really courageous and resolute nature, suffered
                  no embarrassment in Dr. Wentworth's family. Agate Bissell's plain speech and
                  direct manner never left an unfavorable impression. There was a flow of honesty
                  and undisguised kindness which children instinctively recognized. Her whole
                  conduct was indulgent, though her language seemed monitorial and even
                  magisterial.
               Mrs. Wentworth was one whose soul shone through her face, and gave it an almost
                  transparent look. She lived under the influence of her best faculties,—therefore
                  her manner and influence seemed to excite the best faculties of those who met her.
                  Very clear-headed was she, very cheerful, and very kind. Your first glance upon
                  her face would lead you to say, Penetration is her ruling trait. Your second
                  glance would convince you that Sympathy was more strongly indicated. If she spoke,
                  you would conclude that no one feeling ruled, but many,—and all of them good. At
                  first, you would think—this woman sees through all films, and cannot be deceived;
                  next, you would feel—there is no need of hiding any thing from her—she is to be
                  trusted.
               As for Dr. Wentworth—nobody saw through him, and every body trusted him. There was
                  no dormant faculty in him—he was alive all around his soul. There were no Arctic
                  and Antarctic zones. The whole globe of his nature was tropical, and yet
                  temperate.
               His moods ran through the whole scale of faculties. He was various as the separate
                  days. He carried the germs of every thing which bore fruit in other men's
                  characters and so could put himself into sympathy with every kind of man. A great
                  talker at times, yet even when most frank, he was more silent than talkative, and left the impression of one who had
                  only blown the foam off from unfathomable thoughts.
               What a place was his house for children! An old mansion, quaint and voluminous,
                  stored full of curious knick-knacks, more curious books, and most curious
                  engravings; yet the interior of the house was even less attractive to children
                  than the grounds about it. Such dainty nooks there were, such pet mazes among the
                  evergreens, such sweeps of flowers and tangles of blossoming vines, such rows of
                  fruit-laden trees, such discoveries to be made, here and there, of new garden
                  plats, of before unseen beds of flowers, such wildernesses of morning-glories, and
                  tangles of honey-suckles running over rocks, or matted in the grass, that once
                  out, the children never wanted to go in, and once in, they could hardly persuade
                  themselves to go out.
               When the afternoon was turning in the West, and the sunlight began to shoot golden
                  beams under the branches of the trees, and the shadows stretched themselves every
                  moment larger and larger along the ground, as if the time were near for them to
                  fall asleep, Dr. Wentworth came in from his patients and joined the children. Then
                  there was racing and frolicking! Then you might have seen three children
                  indeed!
               But, after a time, Rose begin to persuade her father to tell some stories.
                  Story-hunger in children is even more urgent than bread-hunger. And so, at length,
                  he suffered himself to be led captive to his favorite tree, where scores of times
                  he had been wont to weave fables and parables for Rose;—fictions that under every
                  form whatsoever, still tended, in his child's imagination, to bring Nature home to
                  her as God's wonderful revelation, vital with sentiment and divine truth. Sitting
                  upon the ground, with one child on either side leaning upon his knees and looking
                  up into his face he began:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           THE ANXIOUS LEAF.
                           "Once upon a time a little leaf was heard to sigh and cry, as leaves
                              often do when a gentle wind is about. And the twig said, 'What is the
                              matter, little leaf?' And the leaf said, 'The wind just told me that
                              one day it would pull me off and throw me down to die on the ground!'
                              The twig told it to the branch on which it grew, and the branch told
                              it to the tree. And when the tree heard it, it rustled all over, and
                              sent back word to the leaf, 'Do not be afraid; hold on tightly, and
                              you shall not go till you want to.' And so the leaf stopped sighing,
                              but went on nestling and singing. Every time the tree shook itself and
                              stirred up all its leaves, the branches shook themselves, and the
                              little twig shook itself, and the little leaf danced up and down
                              merrily, as if nothing could ever pull it off. And so it grew all
                              summer long till October. And when the bright days of autumn came, the
                              little leaf saw all the leaves around becoming very beautiful. Some
                              were yellow, and some scarlet, and some striped with both colors. Then
                              it asked the tree what it meant? And the tree said, 'All these leaves
                              are getting ready to fly away, and they have put on these beautiful
                              colors, because of joy.' Then the little leaf began to want to go, and
                              grew very beautiful in thinking of it, and when it was very gay in
                              color, it saw that the branches of the tree had no color in them, and
                              so the leaf said, 'Oh, branches! why are you lead color and we
                              golden?' 'We must keep on our work clothes, for our life is not done;
                              but your clothes are for holiday, because your tasks are over.' Just
                              then a little puff of wind came, and the leaf let go without thinking
                              of it, and the wind took it up, and turned it over and over, and
                              whirled it like a spark of fire in the air and then it fell gently
                              down under the edge of the fence among hundreds of leaves, and fell
                              into a dream and never waked up to tell what it dreamed about!"
                        
                     
                  
               
               How charming it is to narrate fables to children! How daintily do they carry on
                  the conscious dramatic deception! They know that if the question were once got in
                  upon them, "Are these things true?" the bubble would burst, and all
                  its fine colors would disappear. Children are unconscious philosophers. They
                  refuse to pull to pieces their enjoyments to see what they are made of! Rose knew
                  as well as her father that leaves never talked. Yet, Rose never saw a leaf without
                  feeling that there was life and meaning in it. Flowers had stories in them. The
                  natural world stole in upon her with mute messages, and the feelings which woke in
                  her bosom she attributed to nature, and the thoughts which started she deemed a
                  revelation and an interpretation of truths that lay hidden in creation waiting for
                  her!
               What is one story? A mere provocation of another.
               "Do tell us another, father. That was so short."
               
               "Yes Doctor—do tell us some more," said Alice and then coloring a little, she
                  said—"Rose can have them every day, but I cannot,—only once in a great while."
               "Alice, you must make your father tell you stories."
               "He does, sometimes, but they are always out of books, and almost always Bible
                  stories and I know them by heart already."
               After Dr. Wentworth had regaled himself enough with the children's charming arts
                  of coaxing, he began another story:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           THE FAIRY FLOWER.
                           "Once there was a little girl whose name was Clara. She had a very
                              kind heart, but she was an only child and had been petted so much that
                              she was like to become very selfish. Too late her mother lamented that
                              she had indulged her so much, and strove to repair the mischief, and
                              to make Clara think of other people's happiness, and not solely of her
                              own. On some days nothing could be more charming than Clara's ways.
                              She was gentle and obliging, and sang all day long, and made every one
                              who came near her happy by her agreeable manners. Then every body
                              admired her and her mother and aunt were sure that she was cured of
                              her pettish dispositions. But, the very next day, all her charming
                              ways were exchanged. She carried a moody face. She was no longer
                              courteous, and every one who came near her felt the chill of her
                              manner as if an east wind were blowing with her breath. One summer
                              night, after such a miserable day, Clara went to her room. The moon
                              was at its full, and poured through the window in such floods that she
                              needed no other light. Clara sat down by the window very unhappy. She
                              thought over the day, and wondered at herself, and tried to imagine
                              why it was that on some days she was so happy and on others so
                              wretched. As she mused she laid her head back on the easy chair. No
                              sooner had she shut her eyes, than a strange thing happened. An old
                              man, very feeble, came in, and in his basket, which be seemed hardly
                              able to bear, was a handful of flowers and two great stones. He came
                              to Clara and said, 'My daughter, will you help me, for I am too old to
                              carry this load; please make it lighter?' Then Clara looked at him
                              with pouting, and said, 'Go away!' Then he said, 'I am poor and
                              suffering. Will you not lighten my load?' Then Clara condescended
                              descended to take the flowers out of his basket. They were very
                              beautiful, and she laid them in her lap.
                           "The old man said:
                           "'My daughter, you have not lightened my basket—you have only taken
                              the pleasant things out of it, and left the heavy, heavy stones. Oh,
                              please lift one of them out of the basket!'
                           "Then Clara was angry, and said:
                           "'No, get you gone—I will not touch those dirty stones.'
                           "No sooner had she said this, than the old man began to change before
                              her, and became so bright and white, that he looked like a column of
                              crystal. Then he took one of the stones and cast it out of the window
                              and it flew and flew and flew, and fell down on the eastern side of a
                              grove, where the son shone first every morning—and close by it ran a
                              brook that laughed and loitered and sported all day and all night, and
                              played with every thing that would come to it.
                           "And then the crystal old man took the flowers out of her lap, and
                              they were wet with moisture, and he shook them over her head, and
                              said:
                           "'Change to a flower! Go and stand by the stone, till your shadow
                              shall be marked upon the rock.'
                           "In a second, Clara was growing by the side of a wide flat stones and
                              the moon cast the shadow of a beautiful flower, with long and slender
                              stem, upon the rock. She was very wretched, and the dew came and
                              comforted her, and in the morning she could not help looking at
                              herself in the brook, that came close up to the stone, and she saw how
                              beautiful she was. All day her shadow fell on the rock, and when the
                              sun went away the shadow went away too. All night she threw a pale
                              shadow on the rock, and in the morning, when, the moon went away, the
                              shadow went away too. And the rock lay still, all day and all night,
                              and did not care for the flower, nor feel its shadow. And she longed,
                              and longed, and longed; but what could a tender flower do with a hard
                              rock? And the flower asked the brook, 'Can you help me?' And the brook
                              laughed out louder than it was laughing before, and said, 'Ask the
                              birds.' And so she asked a Bobolink, and he came frisking to her, with
                              a wonderful speech, in Latin, Greek and Syriac, with some words from
                              the great language that was before all other languages. And he alit
                              upon the flower, and teetered up and down, till she thought her back would break; but
                              nothing could she learn how to make her shadow stay upon the rock.
                           "Then she asked a spider; and he spun a web from her bright blossoms
                              and fastened it to the rock and bent her over, and tied her up, till
                              she feared she should never get loose. But all his nice films did her
                              no good, and her shadow would not stay upon the rock.
                           "Then she asked the wind to help her, and the wind blew away the
                              spider's web, and blew so hard that the flower lay its whole length
                              upon the rock, but when the wind left her and she rose up, there was
                              no shadow there!
                           "And she said—'What is beauty worth, if it grows by the side of a
                              stone that does not feel it, nor care for it?'
                           Then she asked the dew to help her. And the dew said, 'How can I help
                              you? I live contentedly in darkness. I put on my beauty only to please
                              other things. I let the sun come through my drops, though I know it
                              will consume me.'
                           The flower said, 'I wish I were dew. I would do some good. Now my
                              beauty does me no good, and I am wasting it every day upon a rock.'
                              When the flower breathed this benevolent wish, there were flutters and
                              whispers all around, but the flower thought it was only the brook.
                           "The next day came that way a beautiful girl. She was gathering ferns,
                              and mosses, and flowers. Whenever she saw a tuft of moss she said,
                              'Please, dear moss, may I take you?' And when she saw a beautiful
                              branch with scarlet leaves, she said, 'Dear bush, may I take these
                              leaves?' And then she saw a beautiful Columbine growing by the edge of
                              a rock, and she said, 'Oh, sweet Columbine, may I pluck you?' And the
                              flower said, 'Please, I must not go till my shadow is fastened on the
                              rock.' Then the young lady took from her case a pencil and in a moment
                              traced the shadow of the Columbine upon the rock, and when she had
                              done she reached her hand and took the stem low down and broke it off.
                              Then Clara sprang up from her chair by the window, and there stood her
                              mother, saying:
                           "My dear daughter, you should not fall asleep by an open window, not
                              even in summer, my child. How damp you are! Come, hasten to bed.'
                           "It was many days before Clara could persuade herself that she had
                              only dreamed. It was many months before she told the dream to her
                              mother. And when she did, her mother said:
                           "'Ah, Clara, would that all girls might dream, if only it made them as
                              good as your dream has made you.'"
                        
                     
                  
               
               The doctor seemed quite interested in his own story, and sat silent for a moment,
                  that the good impression might settle in the girls' minds. He was awakened to
                  attention by some little flutter, and saw Rose nodding in a gravely humorous way
                  to Alice, as if she meant to say:
               "I hope, Alice, that you will take this lesson to heart, and never be naughty
                  again!"
               "Ah, rogue Rose!" said the doctor. "Is that the way you pay me for my trouble? You
                  shall—"
               Rose, without waiting for the whole sentence, darted off, and in an instant the
                  doctor was in full chase, while Alice, hesitant, followed in the distance, half
                  laughing, and quite uneasy lest some harm should come to Rose. Harm did come. She
                  was, after nimble turns and skilful evasions, so amused at her father's mishap in
                  rushing upon a sweet-brier, when he thought to have seized her, that her strength
                  dissolved in laughter. She was caught, and her hands tied with honeysuckle vines,
                  and her neck was bound with flowers, and so she was carried away captive,
                  smothered with sweets, to be punished under the great tree. There her father
                  pronounced the sentence, that for irreverence and rebellion, she should be doomed
                  to hear another story, which he called
               
                  
                     
                        
                           COMING AND GOING.
                           "Once came to our fields a pair of birds that had never built a nest
                              nor seen a winter. Oh, how beautiful was every thing! The fields were
                              full of flowers, and the grass was growing tall, and the bees were
                              humming everywhere. Then one of the birds fell to singing, and the
                              other bird said: 'Who told you to sing?' and he answered: 'The flowers
                              told me, and the bees told me, and the winds and leaves told me, and
                              the blue sky told me, and you told me to sing.' Then his mate
                              answered: 'When did I tell you to sing?' And he said: 'Every time you
                              brought in tender grass for the nest, and every time your soft wings
                              fluttered off again for hair and feathers to line the nest.' Then his
                              mate said: 'What are you singing about?' And he answered: 'I am singing about every
                              thing and nothing. It is because I am so happy that I sing.'
                           "By-and-by five little speckled eggs were in the nest, and his mate
                              said: "Is there any thing in all the world as pretty as my eggs?" Then
                              they both looked down on some people that were passing by, and pitied
                              them because they were not birds, and had no nests with eggs in them!
                              Then the father-bird sung a melancholy song because he pitied folks
                              that had no nests, but had to live in houses.
                           "In a week or two, one day, when the father-bird came home, the
                              mother-bird said: 'Oh, what do you think has happened?' 'What?' 'One
                              of my eggs has been peeping and moving!' Pretty soon another egg moved
                              under her feathers, and then another, and another, till five little
                              birds were born!
                           "Now the father-bird sung longer and louder than ever. The mother-bird
                              too wanted to sing, but she had no time and so she turned her song
                              into work. So hungry were these little birds, that it kept both
                              parents busy feeding them. Away each one flew. The moment the little
                              birds heard their wings fluttering again among the leaves, five yellow
                              mouths flew open so wide, that nothing could be seen but five yellow
                              mouths!
                           "'Can any body be happier?' said the father-bird to the mother-bird.
                              'We will live in this tree always, for there is no sorrow here. It is
                              a tree that always bears joy.'
                           "The very next day one of the birds dropped out of the nest, and a cat
                              ate it up in a minute, and only four remained; and the parent-birds
                              were very sad, and there was no song all that day nor the next. Soon
                              the little birds were big enough to fly, and great was their parents'
                              joy to see them leave the nest and sit crumpled up upon the branches.
                              There was then a great time! One would have thought the two old birds
                              were two French dancing-masters,—talking and chattering, and scolding
                              the little birds, to make them go alone. The first bird that tried
                              flew from one branch to another, and the parents praised him, and the
                              other little birds wondered how he did it! And he was so vain of it
                              that he tried again, and flew and flew, and couldn't stop flying, till
                              he fell plump down by the house-door; and then a little boy caught him
                              and carried him into the house,—and only three birds were left. Then
                              the old birds thought that the sun was not bright as it used to be,
                              and they did not sing as often.
                           "In a little time the other birds had learned to use their wings, and
                              they flew away and away, and found their own food and made their own
                              beds, and their parents never saw them any more!
                           "Then the old birds sat silent, and looked at each other a long
                              while.
                           "At last, the wife-bird said:
                           "'Why don't you sing?'
                           "And he answered:
                           "'I can't sing—I can only think and think!'
                           "'What are you thinking of?'
                           "'I am thinking how every thing changes,—the leaves are falling down
                              from off this tree, and soon there will be no roof over our heads; the
                              flowers are all gone, or going; last night there was a frost: almost
                              all the birds are flown away, and I am very uneasy. Something calls
                              me, and I feel restless as if I would fly far away."
                           "Let us fly away together'
                           Then they rose silently, and, lifting themselves far up in the air,
                              they looked to the north,—far away they saw the snow coming. They
                              looked to the south,—there they saw green leaves! All day they flew,
                              and all night they flew and flew, till they found a land where there
                              was no winter—where there was summer all the time; where flowers
                              always blossom, and birds always sing.
                           "But the birds that stayed behind found the days shorter, the nights
                              longer, and the weather colder. Many of them died of cold; others
                              crept into crevices and holes, and lay torpid. Then it was plain that
                              it was better to go than to stay!"
                        
                     
                  
               
               Rose was going on seven years old. Never did girl give less cause of anxiety.
                  Never did girl excite more anxiety in a mother's heart than did Rose in Agate
                  Bissell's. Why should it be? Was not Rose healthy? Was she not of fine
                  disposition? Of good parentage, with careful training, with every advantage that
                  wealth could procure, what possible reason had Agate for her seriousness and
                  anxieties?
               There are many people who seem to regard anxiety as a religious duty. They seem to
                  think that no state of mind is substantial which is not ballasted with cares.
               
               If Agate Bissell expected to pass her life in Dr. Wentworth's family, to be Mrs.
                  Wentworth's confidential companion, and to divide with her the care of the
                  household, and to bestow every faculty of mind, soul and body on the children,—for
                  Rose was not a solitary flower, but only the first bud that blossomed,—why should
                  she not be anxious and inflict upon herself all that unnecessary pain
                  that is usually deemed proper by painstaking people? Why should she not imagine
                  evils that never will happen, and reflect with self-reproach upon things done that
                  might have been better done? Why not be discouraged, and imagine that the doctor
                  would certainly spoil the children? or that some nameless and unknown evil would
                  yet spring up and devour them? What do angels do with unnecessary
                  anxieties? What clouds of needless prayers are daily floated upward which never
                  distil in rain!
               But it is not just to imagine that Agate had no other reason for seriousness of
                  mind than this vague anxiety. She was a Christian not only in disposition, but she
                  firmly believed the Christian teachings of Dr. Buell. Until Rose was converted
                  there were no right affections in her. She had been taught that natural
                  excellences, amiable dispositions, in unregenerate people, have no moral
                  excellence, and do not diminish that perpetual danger which overhangs every child
                  of Adam until he becomes a Christian. Many hold these, views, but few
                     believe them. Agate was among the few that believed. What to her
                  was the body, its health and hastiness, compared with the soul? What was it to her
                  that Rose was lovely, docile, and obedient, if in her heart, concealed yet, but
                  sure to be disclosed, there was that fatal taint, left on all the first parents'
                  posterity?—that latent enmity which one day would flame out against her Maker?
               This it was that made Rose a perpetual burden to Agate Bissell and that had often
                  wet her pillow with tears and drawn out prayers without number.
               "Rose, my dear child, what good can it do you to love all the world that God has
                  made, its clouds and seasons, its forests and fields, if you do not love God who
                  made them all?"
               Rose looked Agate full in the face, but sat silently.
               "You know, my child," said Agate, "that to make much of the world, and nothing of
                  God who made it, is idolatry. Your soul cannot be saved, Rose, by the clouds, or
                  by the mountains. If you could find your Saviour in nature—"
               Agate paused, for Rose walked to her side, and placing her arms around her neck,
                  said:
               "Agate, I do love the Saviour. I think of him every day, and ask him to love me.
                  Father says that there is nothing made that Jesus did not make."
               A new anxiety now took possession of Agate. Might it not be true that this child
                  had been blessed? If so, then she was guilty of that offending one of those little
                  ones, against which such solemn words were pronounced. On the other hand, might
                  not this young creature, so beautiful, so engaging, be snared and deceived? Was
                  she not, by her father's influence, liable to substitute a diluted sentimentalism
                  for the sober realities of a true religious experience?
               Agate had often talked with Mrs. Wentworth on this subject; but she was so much in
                  sympathy with her husband's opinions, that Agate doubted whether her judgment was
                  clear and unbiassed.
               It is not strange, then, that Agate in a manner sounded Mrs. Polly Marble on this
                  general subject.
               "Mrs. Marble, do you think that people can be converted without knowing the
                  time?"
               "Well, Agate, when the Lord delivered my soul it was just as if I had been sitting
                  in a dark room and somebody had opened the door right against the sun. Not know
                  the time? I shall never forget it, I guess! I know there's some folks think
                  different. Them Episcopal folks say that children git good gradually. But I say
                  that if a man don't know the times and seasons of his own heart, he likely wasn't
                  had much religion anyhow."
               "But do you suppose a work of grace can exist in the soul, and the person not know
                  that it is grace?"
               "I tell you what, Agate, if it's the Lord that converts men, I guess they'll know
                  it, and other folks will be apt to know it too! Men are naturally like bags full
                  of weed-seeds. The Lord first shakes 'em empty, and then fills 'em up with
                  precious wheat. Now it stands to reason that if the Lord is shakin' a man inside
                  out he'll know it."
               "But, Mrs. Marble, may not the Lord in his Sovereignty deal gently with young people? Is not that the meaning
                  of the Scripture, 'He shall carry the young in His arms?'"
               "Agate, I always say that it's best to be on the sure side. It never does harm to
                  find fault with your evidences, 'cause if they are real you won't hurt 'em, and if
                  they are deceivin' you, you will be apt to find it out. People now-a-days git
                  religion too easy. I was under conviction nigh about two months. I was awfully
                  striven with afore I give up. Young people now seem to git along too easy, I say.
                  They don't bear any yoke, nor carry much of a cross. I have seen folks have
                  measles light, and scarlet-fever so easy they didn't hardly know it. But I shall
                  never be made to believe that any body took religion so easy that they didn't know
                  they had it."
               "Don't you sometimes doubt the promises," said Agate, " when you see how children
                  turn out that's well brought up? Some folks neglect their children, let them do
                  pretty much as they please, and yet they grow straight up, are converted, come
                  into the church, and do well all their lives; then again, others are taught and
                  governed, and restrained, and watched in every particular, and yet the moment they
                  get free they go out into the world and grow as wicked as if nothing had been done
                  for them. I don't know—it's a mystery to me!"
               "A mystery!" said Aunt Polly Marble, pushing her spectacles a little closer to her
                  eyes, and looking through them with a doubly earnest look, there is no mystery
                  about it. It's all election. That does it!"
               Agate seemed troubled in countenance, and said:
               "I wish I knew more about that doctrine. If one only knew who was elected, we
                  could feel easy. And if a man was not elected, there would be no need of spending
                  much time on him. Working for men that are not among the elect is like sewing
                  without any thread in your needle; a good deal of work, and nothing to show for
                  it."
               "It's a precious doctrine though, even if you don't understand it.
                     You may not know, but the Lord does, and it doesn't become us to
                  be too pryin'."
               "Yet I think a mother might be excused for being anxious about her own children.
                  If any body ever did offer a child up to God, I have that child! If she was my own
                  flesh and blood, I could not do more for Rose!"
               "Don't you think her father might do a little more to help out? He may be pious—I
                  wouldn't judge. But he seems to me to walk in a pretty broad path, and to find a
                  good many notions not likely to grow in the narrow way."
               "He has his own views, and thinks he's right. He reads the Bible a good deal, and
                  wants Rose to. But he's got so many things in his head that you can't find in the
                  Bible, that I don't know what'll become of Rose. I'm afraid her soul will be
                  snared with worldly knowledge."
               "Why don't you talk with Dr. Buell? He is safe and a sound man and likely be could
                  tell you something about bringing up children."
               "Dr. Buell is better at sermons than children," said Agate, with some decision.
                  "That boy of his is a perfect limb. I don't know why it is, but some good folks
                  are unlucky with their children. They take a deal of pains with them, and learn
                  them every thing that's good, and the minute the children get a chance, they learn
                  themselves every thing that's bad!"
               This conversation did not bring to faithful Agate's heart much comfort.
               Meanwhile, Rose, the subject of so much anxiety, lived in unbroken joyfulness.
                  Hers was one of those fortunate natures that receive benefit from all, and injury
                  from none. She lived loving and happy among the various persons who surrounded
                  her. She loved the exact and faithful Agate; she loved the mild and gentle Mother
                  Taft; she loved the boisterous ways of shrewd Tommy Taft; she loved and somewhat
                  feared the simple but stately manners of Dr. Buell; she loved her mother dearly,
                  but her father above all. Yet this seemed to her scarcely like loving another. So
                  perfectly were father and daughter in sympathy, that it hardly needed words to
                  interpret between them. They seemed like one soul in two bodies.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVII.
               A NEW-ENGLAND SUNDAY.
               TIME waits for no man, and least of all for story writers. Our readers must move
                  six years forward at a step, and rest for one Sunday in Norwood, where travelling
                  on Sunday is yet against the law.
               It is worth all the inconveniences arising from the occasional over-action of
                  New-England Sabbath observance to obtain the full flavor of a New-England Sunday.
                  But for this, one should have been born there; should have found Sunday already
                  waiting for him and accepted it with implicit and absolute conviction as if it
                  were a law of nature, in the same way that night and day, summer and winter, are
                  parts of nature. He should have been brought up by parents who had done the same
                  thing; as they were by parents even more strict if that were
                  possible; until, not religious persons peculiarly, but every body,—not churches
                  alone but society itself, and all its population, those who broke it as much as
                  those who kept it—were stained through with the color of Sunday. Nay, until Nature
                  had adopted it, and laid its commands on all birds and beasts, on the sun and
                  winds, and upon the whole atmosphere, so that, without much imagination, one might
                  imagine, in a genuine New-England Sunday of the Connecticut river valley stamp,
                  that God was still on that day resting from all the work which he had created and
                  made, and that all his work rested with him!
               Over all the town rested the Lord's peace! The saw was ripping away yesterday in
                  the carpenter's shop, and the hammer was noisy enough. To-day there is not a sign
                  of life there. The anvil makes no music today. Tommy Taft's buckets and barrels
                  give forth no hollow, thumping sound. The mill is silent—only the brook continues
                  noisy. Listen! In yonder pine woods what a cawing of crows! Like an echo in a wood
                  still more remote, other crows are answering. But even a crow's throat to-day is
                  musical. Do they think because they have black coats on, that they are parsons,
                  and have a right to play pulpit with all the pine trees? Nay. The birds will not
                  have any such monopoly,—they are all singing, and singing all together, and no one
                  cares whether his song rushes across another's or not. Larks and robins,
                  blackbirds and orioles, sparrows and bluebirds, mocking cat-birds and wrens, were
                  furrowing the air with such mixtures as no other day but Sunday, when all
                  artificial and human sounds cease, could ever hear. Every now and then a bobolink
                  seemed impressed with the duty of bringing these jangling birds into more
                  regularity; and like a country singing-master, he flew down the ranks, singing all
                  the parts himself in snatches, as if to stimulate and help the laggards. In vain!
                  Sunday is the birds' day, and they will have their own democratic worship!
               There was no sound in the village street. Look either way—not a vehicle, not a
                  human being! The smoke rose up soberly and quietly, as if it said—It is Sunday!
                  The leaves on the great elms hung motionless, glittering in dew, as if they too,
                  like the people who dwelt under their shadow, were waiting for the bell to ring
                  for meeting. Bees sung and flew as usual, but honey-bees have a Sunday way with
                  them all the week, and could scarcely change for the better on the seventh
                  day!
               But oh, the Sun! It had sent before and cleared every stain out of the sky. The
                  blue heaven was not dim and low, as on secular days, but curved and deep, as if on
                  Sunday it shook off all encumbrance which during the week had lowered and
                  flattened it, and sprang back to the arch and symmetry of a dome. All ordinary
                  sounds caught the spirit of the day. The shutting of a door sounded twice as far
                  as usual. The rattle of a bucket in a neighbor's yard, no longer mixed with
                  heterogeneous noises, seemed a new sound. The hens went silently about and
                  roosters crowed in psalm-tunes. And when the first bell rung, Nature seemed
                  over-joyed to find something that it might do without breaking Sunday, and rolled
                  the sound over and over, and pushed it through the air, and raced with it over
                  field and hill, twice as far as on week days. There were no less than seven
                  steeples in sight from the belfry, and the sexton said: "On still Sundays I've
                  heard the bell, at one time and another, when the day was fair, and the air moving
                  in the right way, from every one of them steeples, and I guess likely they've all
                  heard our'n."
               "Come, Rose!" said Agate Bissell, at an even earlier hour than when Rose usually
                  awakened—"Come, Rose, it is the Sabbath. We must not be late Sunday morning of all days in the week. It is the Lord's
                  day."
               There was little preparation required for the day. Saturday night, in some parts
                  of New-England, was considered almost as sacred as Sunday itself. After sundown on
                  Saturday night no play, and no work, except such as is immediately preparatory to
                  the Sabbath, were deemed becoming in good Christians. The clothes had been laid
                  out the night before. Nothing was forgotten. The best frock was ready; the hose
                  and shoes were waiting. Every article of linen, every ruffle and ribbon, were
                  selected on Saturday night. Every one in the house walked mildly. Every one spoke
                  in a low tone. Yet all were cheerful. The mother had on her kindest face and
                  nobody laughed, but every body made it up in smiling. The nurse smiled, and the
                  children held on to keep down a giggle within the lawful bounds of a smile; and
                  the doctor looked rounder and calmer than ever; and the dog flapped his tail on
                  the floor with a softened sound as if he had fresh wrapped it in hair for that
                  very day. Aunt Toodie, the cook, (so the children had changed Mrs. Sarah Good's
                  name,) was blacker than ever and shinier than ever and the coffee better and the
                  cream richer, and the broiled chickens juicier and more tender, and the biscuit
                  whiter and the corn-bread more brittle and sweet.
               When the good doctor read the Scriptures at family prayer, the infection of
                  silence had subdued everything except the clock. Out of the wide hall could be
                  heard in the stillness the old clock, that now lifted up its voice with unwanted
                  emphasis, as if, unnoticed through the bustling week, Sunday was its vantage
                  ground, to proclaim to mortals the swift flight of time! And if the old pedant
                  performed the task with something of an ostentatious precision, it was because in
                  that house nothing else put on official airs, and the clock felt the
                  responsibility of doing it for the whole mansion!
               And now came mother and catechism; for Mrs. Wentworth followed the old custom, and
                  declared that no child of hers should grow up without catechism. Secretly, the
                  doctor was quite willing, though openly he played off upon the practice a world of
                  good-natured discouragement, and declared that there should be an opposition set
                  up—a catechism of Nature with natural laws for decrees, and seasons for
                  Providence, and flowers for graces! The younger children were taught in simple
                  catechism. But Rose, having reached the mature age of twelve, was now manifesting
                  her power over the Westminster Shorter Catechism, and as it was simply an
                  achievement of memory and not of the understanding, she had the book at great
                  advantage, and soon subdued every question and answer in it. As much as possible,
                  the doctor was kept aloof on such occasions. His grave questions were not to
                  edification and often they caused Rose to stumble, and brought down sorely the
                  exultation with which she rolled forth "they that are effectually called do in
                  this life partake of justification, adoption, sanctification and the several
                  benefits which in this life do either accompany or flow from them."
               "What do those words mean, Rose?"
               "Which words, pa?"
               "Adoption sanctification and justification?"
               Rose hesitated and looked at her mother for rescue.
               "Doctor, why do you trouble the child? Of course, she don't know yet all the
                  meaning. But that will come to her when she grows older."
               "You make a nest of her memory, then and put words there, like eggs, for future
                  hatching?"
               "Yes, that is it exactly; birds do not hatch their eggs the minute they lay them.
                  They wait."
               "Laying eggs at twelve to be hatched at twenty is subjecting them to some risk is
                  it not?"
               "It might be so with eggs, but not with catechism. That will keep without spoiling
                  a hundred years!"
               "Because it is so dry?"
               "Because it is so good. But do, dear husband, go away, and not put notions in the
                  children's heads. It's hard enough already to get them through their tasks. Here's
                  poor Arthur, who has been two Sundays on one question, and has not got it
                  yet."
               Arthur, aforesaid, was sharp and bright in any thing addressed to his reason, but
                  he had no verbal memory, and he was therefore wading painfully through the
                  catechism like a man in a deep, muddy road, with this difference, that the man
                  carries too much clay with him, while nothing stuck to poor Arthur. Great was the
                  lad's pride and exultation on a former occasion when his mother advanced him from
                  the smaller Catechism to the dignity of the Westminster Catechism. He could hardly
                  wait for Sunday to begin his conquests.
                  He was never known after the first Sunday to show any further impatience. He had
                  been four weeks in reaching the fourth question, and two weeks already had he lain
                  before that luminous answer, beating on it, like a ship too deeply laden, and
                  unable to cross the bar.
               "What is God, Arthur?" said his mother.
               "God is—is a—God is—and God—God is a—"
               Having got safely so far, the mother suggests "spirit," at which he gasps eagerly,
                  "God is a Spirit."
               "Infinite," says the mother.
               "Infinite," says Arthur.
               And then blushing and twisting in his chair, he seemed unable to extract any thing
                  more.
               "Eternal," says the mother.
               "Eternal," says the boy.
               "Well, go on; God is a spirit, infinite, eternal;—what else?"
               "God is a spirit, eternal, infinite,—what else?"
               "Nonsense," says the startled mother.
               "Nonsense," goes on the boy, supposing it to be a part of the regular answer.
               "Arthur, stop! what work you are making!"
               To stop was the very exercise in Catechism at which he was most proficient; and he
                  stopped so fully and firmly that nothing more could be got out of him or into him
                  during the exercise. But his sorrow soon fled, for the second bell had rung, and
                  it was just time to walk, and "every body was going," the servant reported. The
                  doctor had been called away, and his wife and the children moved down the
                  yard,—Rose with demure propriety, and Arthur and his eight-year-old brother,
                  Charles, with less piety manifest in deportment, but, on the whole, with decent
                  demeanor. The beauty of the day, the genial season of the year, brought forth
                  every one—old men and their feebler old wives, young and hearty men and their
                  plump and ruddy companions,—young men and girls and children, thick as punctuation
                  points in Hebrew text, filled the street. In a low voice, they spoke to each other
                  in single sentences.
               "A fine day! There'll be a good congregation out to-day."
               "Yes; we may expect a house full. How is Widow Cheney—have you heard?"
               "Well, not much better; can't hold out many days. It will be a great loss to the
                  children."
               "Yes; but we must all die—nobody can skip his turn. Does she still talk about them
                  that's gone?"
               "They say not. I believe she's sunk into a quiet way; and it looks as if she would
                  go off easy."
               "Sunday is a good day for dying—it's about the only journey that speeds well on
                  this day!"
               There was something striking in the outflow of people into the street that, till
                  now, had seemed utterly deserted. There was no fevered hurry; no negligent or
                  poorly dressed people. Every family came in groups—old folks and young children;
                  and every member blossomed forth in his best apparel, like a rose-bush in June. Do
                  you know that man in a silk hat and new black coat? Probably it is some stranger.
                  No; it is the carpenter, Mr. Baggs, who was racing about yesterday with his
                  sleeves rolled up, and a dust-and-business look in his face! I knew you would not
                  know him. Adams Gardner, the blacksmith,—does he not look every inch a judge, now
                  that he is clean-washed, shaved, and dressed? His eyes are as bright as the sparks
                  that fly from his anvil!
               Are not the folks proud of their children? See what groups of them! How ruddy and
                  plump are most! Some are roguish, and cut clandestine capers at every chance.
                  Others seem like wax figures, so perfectly proper are they. Little hands go slyly
                  through the pickets to pluck a tempting flower. Other hands carry hymn-books or
                  Bibles. But, carry what they may, dressed as each parent can afford, is there any
                  thing the sun shines upon more beautiful than these troops of Sunday children?
               The old bell had it all its own way up in the steeple. It was the licensed noise
                  of the day. In a long shed behind the church stood a score and half-score of
                  wagons and chaises and carryalls,—the horses already beginning the forenoon's work
                  of stamping and whisking the flies. More were coming. Hiram Beers had "hitched
                  up," and brought two loads with his new hack, and now, having secured the team, he
                  stood with a few admiring young fellows about him, remarking on the people as they
                  came up.
               "There's Trowbridge—he'll git asleep afore the first prayer's over. I don't
                  b'lieve he's heerd a sermon in ten years. I've seen him sleep standin' up in
                  singin'.
               
               "Here comes Deacon Marble,—smart old feller, ain't he? wouldn't think it, jest to
                  look at him! Face looks like an ear of last summer's sweet corn all dried up; but
                  I tell ye he's got the juice in him yit. Aunt Polly's gittin' old, aint she? They
                  say she can't walk half the time—lost the use of her limbs; but it's all gone to
                  her tongue. That's as good as a razor, and a sight better'n mine, for it never
                  needs sharpenin'.
               "Stand away, boys, there's 'Biah Cathcart. Good horses—not fast but mighty strong,
                  just like the owner."
               And with that Hiram touched his new Sunday hat to Mrs. Cathcart and Alice; and as
                  he took the horses by the bits, he dropped his head and gave the Cathcart boys a
                  look of such awful solemnity, all except one eye, that they lost their sobriety.
                  Barton alone remain sober as a judge.
               "Here comes 'Dot-and-Go One' and his wife. They're my kind o' Christians. She is a
                  saint, at any rate."
               "How is it with you, Tommy Taft?"
               "Fair to middlin', thank'e. Such weather would make a handspike blossom,
                  Hiram?"
               "Don't you think that's a leetle strong, Tommy, for Sunday? P'raps you mean afore
                  it's cut?"
               "Sartin; that's what I mean. But you mustn't stop me Hiram. Parson Buell'll be
                  lookin' for me. He never begins till I git there."
               "You mean you always git there 'fore he begins?"
               Next, Hiram's prying eyes saw Mr. Turfmould, the sexton and undertaker, who seemed
                  to be in a pensive meditation upon all the dead that he had ever buried. He looked
                  upon men in a mild and pitying manner, as if he forgave them for being in good
                  health. You could not help feeling that he gazed upon you with a professional eye,
                  and saw just how you would look in the condition which was to him the most
                  interesting period of a man's earthly state. He walked with a soft tread, as if he
                  was always at a funeral; and, when he shook your hand, his left hand half-followed
                  his right, as if he were about beginning to lay you out. He was one of the few men
                  absorbed by his business, and who unconsciously measured all things from its
                  stand-point.
               "Good-morning, Mr. Turfmould! How's your health? How's business with you?"
               "Good—the Lord be praised! I've no reason to complain."
               And he glided silently and smoothly into the church.
               "There comes Judge Bacon, white and ugly," said the critical Hiram. "I wonder what
                  he comes to meetin' for. Lord knows he needs it, sly, slippery old sinner! Face's
                  as white as a lily; his heart's as black as a chimney flue afore it's cleaned.
                  He'll get his flue burned out if he don't repent, that's certain. He don't believe
                  the Bible. They say he don't believe in God. Wal, I guess it's pretty even between
                  'em. Shouldn't wonder if God didn't believe in him neither."
               Hiram's prejudices were perhaps a little too severe. The judge was very selfish,
                  but not otherwise bad. He would not do a positively bad deed if he could help it;
                  but he neglected to do a great many good ones which other men with warm hearts
                  would have done. But he made up in manner whatever he lacked in feeling. Dressed
                  with unexceptionable propriety, his whole bearing was dignified and kind. No man
                  in the village spoke more musically and gently; no one met you with a greater
                  cordiality. His expressions of kind wishes, and his anxiety to serve you, needed
                  only a single instance of hearty fulfilment, to make Judge Bacon seem sincerely
                  and unusually kind. But those who had most to do with him found that he was cold
                  and selfish at heart inflexible and unfeeling when seeking his rights or
                  interests; and his selfishness was the more ghastly as it clothed itself in the
                  language and manners of gentle goodwill.
               "He talks to you," said Hiram "just as Black Sam lathers you; a kind of smooth
                  rubbing goes on, and you feel soft and satisfied with yourself, and sort o' lean
                  to him, when he takes you by the nose and shaves, and shaves, and shaves, and it's
                  so smooth that you don't feel the razor. But I tell you, when you git away your
                  skin smarts. You've been shaved.
               "Here come the Bages, and the Weekses, and a whole raft from Hardscrabble," said
                  Hiram as five or six one-horse wagons drove up. At a glance one could see that
                  these were farmers who lived to work. They were spare in figure, brown in
                  complexion—every thing worn off but bone and muscle—like ships with iron masts and
                  wire rigging. They drove little nubbins of horses, tough and rough, that had never
                  felt a blanket in winter or known a leisure day in summer.
               
               "Them fellers," said Hiram, "is just like stones. I don't believe there's any
                  blood or innards in 'em more'n in a crowbar. They work early, and work all day,
                  and in the night, and keep workin', and never seem to get tired except Sunday,
                  when they've nothin' to do. You know when Fat Porter was buried, they couldn't git
                  him into the hearse, and had to carry him with poles and Weeks was one of the
                  bearers, and they had a pretty heavy time of it, nigh about three hours, what with
                  liftin' and fixin' him, at the house, and fetchin' him to the church door, and
                  then carryin' him to the graveyard, and Weeks said he hadn't enjoyed a Sunday so
                  much he couldn't tell when.
               "'Hiram,' sez he, 'I should like Sunday as well as week days if I could work on
                  it; but I git awful tired doin' nothin'.'
               "They say," said Hiram, "that they never do exactly die up in Hardscrabble. They
                  work up and up, and grow thinner and thinner like a knife-blade, till they git so
                  small that some day they accidentally git misplaced or dropped, and nobody misses
                  'em. So that they die off in a general way, like pins, without any one of em
                  making a particular fuss about it. But I guess that ain't so," added Hiram, with a
                  grave air, as if fearing that he might mislead the young folks about him. Then,
                  with demure authority, he said: "Boys, go in; the bell's done tollin', and
                  meeting's goin' to begin. Go in, and don't make a noise, and see you tell me where
                  the text is. I've got to look after these horses, or they'll get mixed up."
               This remark was called forth by a squeal and a rattle and backing of wagons, which
                  showed that mischief was already brewing.
               Having got the people all safely into church, Hiram bestowed his attention on the
                  horses. The whole green was lined with horses. Every hitching-post and the railing
                  along the sidewalk and at the fronts of the stores, were closely occupied.
               Seeing Pete leaning on Dr. Wentworth's gate Hiram beckoned him over, and employed
                  him in his general tour of inspection. as a bishop might employ his chaplain. Here
                  the reins had been pulled under a horse's feet, next a horse had got his bridle
                  off; another had backed and filled till the wagon wheels were cramped; and at each
                  position, Hiram issued orders to Pete, who good-naturedly, and as a matter
                  indisputable, did as he was ordered. If Hiram had told Pete to shoulder one of the
                  horses, he would have made the attempt.
               "Look here, Pete, if that ain't a shame, then there ain't no truth in the ten
                  commandments! A man that'll drive a horse with a sore shoulder like that is a
                  brute. Just feel how hot it is,—Pete, you get a bucket of water, and put a little
                  warm in it to take off the chill, and wash that off, and take him out of harness,
                  I swow!—and I don't know but I ought to say I swear! for it's Sunday work. Anyhow,
                  if Blakesley don't know any better than that he ought not to own a horse. There he
                  is in church a hearing the Gospel, and feelin' all over as comfortable as a
                  cruller, and he's left his horse out here to the flies and the sun, with a
                  shoulder that's a disgrace to Christianity. But that's the way with us pretty much
                  all 'round. If we are good here, we are bad there. Folks's good and bad is like a
                  board-teeter,—if one end goes up, t'other is sure to go down."
               It was curious to see Pete's superiority to Hiram in the matter of dogs. In
                  several wagons lay the master's dog, and Hiram was not permitted to approach
                  without dispute; but there was not a dog, big or little, cross or affectionate,
                  that did not own the mysterious power that Pete had over animals. Even dogs in
                  whom a sound conscience was bottomed on an ugly temper, practiced a surly
                  submission to Pete's familiarity.
               It was nearly twelve o'clock, when Dr. Wentworth, returning from his round of
                  visits, found Hiram sitting on the fence, his labors over, and waiting for Dr.
                  Buell to finish.
               "Not in church, Hiram? I'm afraid you've not been a good boy."
               "Don't know. Somebody must take care of the outside as well as inside of church.
                  Dr. Buell rubs down the folks and I rub the horses; he sees that their tacklin' is
                  all right in there, and I do the same out here. Folks and animals are pretty much
                  of a muchness and they'll bear a sight of takin' care of."
               "Whose nag is that one, Hiram,—the roan?"
               "That's Deacon Marble's."
               "Why he seems to sweat, standing still."
               Hiram's eye twinkled.
               "You needn't say nothin', Doctor,—but I thought it a pity so many horses shouldn't
                  be doin' any thing! Of course, they don't know any thing about Sunday,—it aint like workin' a creatur' that reads the
                  Bible, so I just slipped over to Skiddy's widder—she ain't been out doors this two
                  months, and I knew she ought to have the air—and I gave her about a mile! She was
                  afraid 'twould be breakin' Sunday.—'Not a bit,' says I; 'didn't the Lord go out
                  Sunday, and set folks off with their beds on their backs; and didn't He pull oxen
                  and sheep out of ditches, and do all that sort of thing?' If she'd knew that I
                  took the Deacon's team, she'd been worse afraid. But I knew the Deacon would like
                  it; and if Polly didn't, so much the better. I like to spite those folks that's
                  too particular!—There, Doctor, there's the last hymn."
               It rose upon the air, softened by distance and the enclosure of the building,—rose
                  and fell in regular movement. Even Hiram's tongue ceased. The vireo, in the tops
                  of the elm hushed its shrill snatches. Again the hymn rose, and this time fuller
                  and louder, as if the whole congregation had caught the spirit. Men's and women's
                  voices, and little children's, were in it. Hiram said, without any of his usual
                  pertness:
               "Doctor, there's somethin' in folks singin' when you are outside the church that
                  makes you feel as though you ought to be inside. Mebbe a fellow will be left
                  outside, up there, when they're singin'—if he don't look out."
               When the last verse had ended, a pause and silence ensued. Then came a gentle
                  bustle, a sound of pattering feet. Out shot a boy, and then two or three, and
                  close upon them a bunch of men. The doors were wide open and thronged. The whole
                  green was covered with people, and the sidewalks were crowded.
               Tommy Taft met the minister at the door, and put out his great rough hand to
                  shake.
               "Thankee, Doctor—thankee; very well done. Couldn't do it better myself. It'll do
                  good-know it I Feel better myself; I need just such preachin'—mouldy old
                  sinner—need a scourin' about once a week. Drefful wicked to hev such doctrine, and
                  not be no better—ain't it, Doctor?"
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               THE SUBJECT CONTINUED.
               WE are not to suppose in a New England town, that the measure of a sermon's effect
                  is to be judged by the impression immediately produced upon the audience. There
                  are usually in every large church in a New England town several families of great
                  refinement and trained to scholarly thought. But, aside from these, there are
                  scores of plain men who have from their very infancy been trained to read think
                  and discuss moral problems often the most remote from ordinary life. Many of these
                  homely and awkward bodies carry in them fine machinery. A sermon, therefore, falls
                  upon such an audience as the waters do upon mill-wheels. However much it may
                  sparkle and rush upon the great external wheel, that is but a small part of the
                  effect produced. The whole interior is set in motion—spindles twirl, looms clank,
                  and the whole building is filled with buzzing activity.
               When the congregation breaks up they carry out the subject with them. It probes
                  them, excites them sharpens them; and in scores of homes for the day and week,
                  around the table, young and old controvert, defend, or variously follow out the
                  Sunday. sermon. In this way the community is seasoned with religious thought. Even
                  if sometimes a too exclusively doctrinal discourse draws upon itself the charge of
                  being practical, it can seldom be charged with emptiness or mere sentimentalism.
                  There is apt to be food in it for men. Let us listen to some of the comments.
               Judge Bacon walks with Mr. Gallup—and knowing that Mr. Gallup would repeat
                  whatever he said, and that it would speedily reach the minister's ears, he
                  remarks:
               "An excellent performance. The grounds were well taken, the proofs judiciously
                  arranged, and the application timely. It was a very clever performance. As a
                  specimen of special pleading, I think it would have ranked high in any court."
               "Father," said his daughter, "do you believe in the doctrine?"
               "Well, my daughter, in things so mysterious and profound as the conditions of
                  Final Perseverance, it may be presumptuous to say that we believe—at any rate, further than we
                  understand—but one may fitly say that were such a doctrine conceived as being
                  true, Dr. Buell has undoubtedly presented it to-day in its most admirable
                  manner."
               Squire Yates, who never put his foot in a church from year's end to year's end,
                  was waiting at Judge Bacon's door for a moment's interview:
               "Well, Judge, been to church, eh? Believe every word? What was it—election,
                  dependence, or sovereignty?"
               "Tut, tut," said Judge Bacon, smiling knowingly, "it was on the perseverance of
                  saints. I have concluded to persevere. You should have heard it—it was likewise
                  profitable for sinners.—What did you hear of our matters in New York? Is the
                  failure bad? Shall we secure much for our clients?"
               "Oh, Aunt, I wish our minister didn't preach such long sermons," said a blooming
                  girl of twelve to a sensible but rigid and conscientious aunt, Miss Eccleston, who
                  was not only determined to be good, but fiercely determined; and just as
                  determined that every body that she had any thing to do with should be good, too.
                  She was angular and something stern outwardly, but true as steel within;
                  straightforward truthful and as unbounded in kindness as she was energetic in
                  duty.
               "My dear," said she, emphatically, "you don't go to church to be easy. That isn't
                  what religion is for. It is to stir us up. We are naturally lazy. I don't believe
                  in plush cushions in the pew nor plush sermons in the pulpit. Feathers! feathers!
                  is the ruin of many souls. The rod is what folks need."
               "But, Aunt, don't you think a sermon that interests you does more good than one
                  that don't?"
               "My dear, you ought to be interested. Dr. Buell didn't make the
                  truth—God made it. The minister's business is to give it to the people as he finds
                  it, and it's their business to be interested."
               An older niece modestly asked:
               "Well, Aunt, if the minister has only to give us the truth as he finds it, why,
                  then, does he not read the Bible, and stop?"
               "Why, what's got into you, children? I don't think it is an improving spirit for
                  people to criticise what they hear, and find fault with the sermon. There's enough
                  in every one of 'em, if we were in a right state of mind to do us good. It is bad
                  manners to find fault with your food at table and a good deal worse at
                  church."
               The Cathcarts went to the Wentworths'. On a plain table stood some crackers and
                  cheese some plain gingerbread, and a plate of butter, while fragrant tea drew all
                  eyes toward the head of the table.
               Cathcart, in a very clear and concise manner stated to the doctor the substance of
                  the sermon. He applauded it as an intellectual effort, but inclined to doubt if it
                  was strictly scriptural.
               "I am inclined to think that the Arminian and Calvinist, when not under
                  controversial fire, hold the facts substantially alike. The issue is not
                  necessary, is forced, is abstract, which divides them on this point. I am inclined
                  to think high doctrinal preaching is less often useful than some suppose."
               "There are two sides to that, Cathcart," said Wentworth; "New England metaphysics
                  have been a powerful agent against materialism. It maybe that at any given time, a
                  high doctrinal sermon is not so edifying as a simple practical one would be. But a
                  community brought up, through a hundred years, to task their thought upon themes
                  remote, difficult, and infinite will be far nobler than if they had been fed upon
                  easy thought. Something is always to be considered in such discussions, not only
                  as to the effect of preaching on the immediate conduct, but also as to a slower,
                  though even more important effect, upon that whole moral constitution and mental
                  habit which is the grand fountain and source of conduct."
               "But do you not see churches worn out and wasted with such dry discussion?"
               "The fault is not in the idea, but in the execution. Either extreme becomes
                  unfruitful. High philosophic thought may, and should, lead to broad practical
                  applications."
               "I see what you mean. True doctrinal preaching, though it lies high, should, like
                  clouds, before it gets through, come down to the ground in rain."
               "Exactly. Look at the history of New England mind in a large way. I think we owe
                  every thing to her theologians, and most to the most doctrinal. They were shut out
                  from the world—in danger of becoming provincial and narrow. The outlet was
                  found—not in cosmopolitan social customs, nor in art or literature—but in
                     theology ology. Such men as Edwards,
                  Hopkins, Smalley, West, Bellamy, Backus, Burton, Emmons lifted up the New England
                  mind into a range of speculation and conviction that ennobled and strengthened it
                  as art never could have done."
               "You are right; but I don't see what you can do with your consistency, for I've
                  heard you trim Dr. Buell to his face for his metaphysical sermons."
               "Only for word-sermons; thought-sermons cannot be too high. But a
                  tangle of reasoning made up mostly of nice distinctions of words is an imposition
                  on philosophy. Buell does not often get into this vicious style. But I could show
                  you good specimens of what I call vernacular sermons—a mere snarl of words
                  crawling over and over each other, all through the nest."
               "But what if a minister preaches real thoughts, but leaves them without
                  application?"
               "He is like a man who draws a bucket of water from a deep deep well,—like yours,
                  for instance, sixty feet deep,—good water, clear, cold, wholesome; and, just as he
                  brings the bucket up within a few feet of the curb, he fastens it there, where you
                  can't reach it, and leaves you thirsty. A cup of water that you cannot reach is as
                  far off from you two feet below the face of the well as if it were at the bottom
                  again!"
               Farmers, having looked at their horses, and given them a wisp of hay, or a few
                  oats, were sitting about in groups, talking of various things, but every one of
                  them, first or last, had something to say of the sermon. Many a quaint originality
                  was dropped unnoticed. Many a homely illustration was suggested fall of real
                  poetry without its form. Some of better information and babies of reading, led off
                  into criticisms on the one side or defenses on the other which showed that,
                  however dry to some, the doctor had reached the minds of others, and set them in
                  earnest activity.
               Hiram had gone his rounds and now joined the group; and having learned the subject
                  of the sermon, he expressed himself promptly:
               "Them pesky Methodists is gittin' in this town, and preachin' up fallin' from
                  grace, and ridiculing election. Now them Calvin doctrines belongs to this town.
                  They've always growled here. You might as well cut down these old elm trees, and
                  put up some of your newfangled spindlin' trees that look like brooms bottom
                  upward, as to set out these Methodist notions here."
               "Well, Hiram, don't you believe a man can fall from grace?"
               "He's no business to; he ought to keep right along—that's my notion."
               "But that ain't to the pint. Can't a Christian man fall from
                  grace?"
               "It's my notion that if a man is once converted, he'll stay convarted. If he's got
                  grace, he'll keep it."
               "You mean it will keep him."
               "If a man falls, and it don't hurt him much, it shows that there wan't no grace
                  about it; 'twas something else he fell from, that wan't very high up neither. A
                  fellow's apt to be smashed up, if he falls from grace, I tell ye! It's like
                  fallin' off the south side of Mount Holyoke."
               The more thoughtful men refused to discuss the cases in real life that some
                  instanced. It was a mere question of Scripture. If the Bible said so it was so,
                  and we must submit our reason to God's Word.
               It was allowed that there were some passages that looked liked
                  falling from grace. But they were speedily captured by others; and as there was no
                  one present who cared to be thought Arminian, the discussion soon wanted, and was
                  finally closed by Hiram, who laid it down with emphasis:
               "They haven't no Scripture on their side. They just do it, and then think they've
                  proved it; but that ain't worth shucks for argument."
               As soon as the afternoon service was over every horse on the green knew that it
                  was time for him to go home. Some grew restless and whinnied for their masters.
                  Nimble hands soon put them into the shafts, or repaired any irregularity of
                  harness. Then came such a scramble of vehicles to the church door, for the older
                  persons; while young women and children, venturing further out upon the green,
                  were taken up hastily, that the impatient horses might, soon as possible, turn
                  their heads homeward. Clouds of dust began to arise along every outward-going
                  road. In less than ten minutes not a wagon or chaise was seen upon the village
                  green. They were whirling homeward at the very best pace that the horses could
                  raise. Stiff old steeds vainly essayed a nimbler gait, but gave it up in a few
                  rods, and fell back to the steady jog. Young horses, tired of long standing, and
                  with a strong yearning for evening
                  oats, shot along the level ground, rushed up the little hills, or down upon the
                  other side, in the most un-Sunday-like haste. The scene was not altogether unlike
                  the return from a military funeral, to which men march with sad music
                  and slow, but from which they return nimbly marching to the most
                  brilliant quick-step.
               In half an hour Norwood was quiet again. The dinner, on Sunday, when for the sale
                  of the outlying population the two services are brought near together in the
                  middle of the day, was usually deferred till the ordinary supper hour. It was
                  evident that the tone of the day was changed. Children were not so strictly held
                  in. There was no loud talking, nor was laughing allowed, but a general feeling
                  sprung up around the table that the severer tasks of the day were ended.
               Devout and age-sobered people sat in a kind of golden twilight of meditation. The
                  minister, in his well-ordered house, tired with a double service mingled thoughts
                  both glad and sad. His tasks were ended. He was conscious that he had manfully
                  done his best. But that best doing, as he reflected upon it, seemed so poor, so
                  unworthy of the nobleness of the theme, and so relatively powerless upon the
                  stubborn stuff of which his people's dispositions were made, that there remained a
                  vague, unquiet sense of blame upon his conscience.
               It was Dr. Wentworth's habit to walk with his family in the garden, early in the
                  morning and late in the afternoon. If early, Rose was usually his company; in the
                  afternoon the whole family, Agate Bissell always excepted. She had in full measure
                  that peculiar New England feeling that Sunday is to be kept by staying in the
                  house, except such times as is spent at church. And, though she never, impliedly
                  even, rebuked the doctor's resort to his garden, it was plain that deep down in
                  her heart she thought it an improper way of spending Sunday; and in that view she
                  had the secret sympathy of almost all the noteworthy villagers. Had any one, upon
                  that day, made Agate a visit, unless for some plain end of necessity or mercy, she
                  would have deemed it a personal affront.
               Sunday was the Lord's day. Agate acted as if any use of it for her own pleasure
                  would be literal and downright stealing.
               "We have six days for our own work. We ought not to begrudge the Lord one whole
                  day."
               Two circumstances distressed honest Agate's conscience. The one was that the
                  incursion of summer visitors from the city was tending manifestly to relax the
                  Sabbath, especially after the church services. The other was that Dr. Wentworth
                  would, occasionally, allow Judge Bacon to call in and discuss with him topics
                  suggested by the sermons. She once expressed herself in this wise:
               "Either Sunday is worth keeping or it is not. If you do keep it it ought to be
                  strictly done. But lately Sunday is ravelling out at the end. We take it on like a
                  summer dress which in the morning is clean and sweet, but at night it is soiled at
                  the bottom and much rumpled all over."
               Dr. Wentworth sat with Rose on one side and her mother on the other, in the
                  honeysuckle corner, where the west could be seen, great trees lying athwart the
                  horizon, and chequering the golden light with their dark masses. Judge Bacon had
                  turned the conversation upon this very topic.
               "I think our Sundays in New England are Puritan and Jewish, more than Christian.
                  They are days of restriction rather than of joyousness. They are fast days, not
                  feast days."
               "Do you say that as a mere matter of historical criticism, or do you think that
                  they could be improved practically?"
               "Both. It is susceptible of proof that the early Christian Sunday was a day of
                  triumph and of much social joy. It would be well if we could follow primitive
                  example."
               "Judge, I am hardly of your opinion. I should be unwilling to see our New England
                  Sunday changed, except, perhaps, by a larger social liberty in each
                  family. Much might be done to make it attractive to children, and relieve older
                  persons from ennui. But, after all, we must
                  judge things by their fruits. If you bring me good apples, it is in vain to abuse
                  the tree as craggy, rude, or homely. The fruit redeems the tree."
               "A very comely figure, Doctor, but not very good reasoning. New England has had
                  something, at work upon her beside her Sunday. What you call the 'fruit' grew, a
                  good deal of it, at any rate, on other trees than Sunday trees."
               "You are only partly right. New England character and history are the result of a
                  wide-spread system of influences of which the Sabbath day was the type—and not
                  only so, but the grand motive power.
                  Almost every cause which has worked benignly among us has received its inspiration
                  and impulse largely from this One Solitary Day of the week.
               "It is true that all the vegetable growths that we see about us here depend upon a
                  great variety of causes; but there is one cause that is the condition of power in
                  every other, and that is the Sun! And so, many as have been the influences working
                  at New England character, Sunday has been a generic and multiplex force, inspiring
                  and directing all others. It is, indeed, the Sun's day.
               "It is a little singular that, borrowing the name from the heathen calendar, it
                  should have tallied so well with the Scripture name, the Lord's day—that Lord who
                  was the Morning Star in early day, and at length the Sun of Righteousness!"
               "The Jews called it the Sabbath—a day of rest. Modern Christians call it the
                     Sun's day, or the day of light, warmth and growth. If this seems
                  fanciful so, far as the names of the day are concerned, it is strikingly
                  characteristic of the real spirit of the two days, in the ancient and modern
                  dispensation. I doubt if the old Jews ever kept a Sabbath religiously, as we
                  understand that term. Indeed, I suspect there was not yet a religious strength in
                  that national character that could hold up religious feeling without the help of
                  social and even physical adjuvants. Their religious days were either fasts or like
                  our Thanksgiving days. But the higher and richer moral nature which has been
                  developed by Christianity enables communities to sustain one day in seven upon a
                  high spiritual plane, with the need of but very little social help, and without
                  the feasting element at all."
               "That may be very well for a few saints like you and me, Doctor, but it is too
                  high for the majority of men. Common people find the strict Sundays a great
                  annoyance, and clandestinely set them aside."
               "I doubt it. There are a few in every, society that live by their sensuous nature.
                  Sunday must be a dead day to them. A dark room. No wonder they break through. But
                  it is not so with the sturdy unsophisticated laboring class in New England. If it
                  came to a vote, you would find that the farmers of New England would be the
                  defenders of the day, even if screwed up to the old strictness. Their instinct is
                  right. It is an observance that has always worked its best effects upon the common
                  people, and if I were to change the name, I should call Sunday THE POOR MAN'S
                  DAY.
               "Men do not yet perceive that the base of the brain is full of despotism, and the
                  coronal brain is radiant with liberty. I mean that the laws and relations which
                  grow out of men's relations in physical things are the sternest and hardest, and
                  at every step in the ascent toward reason and spirituality, the relations grow
                  more kindly and free.
               "Now it is natural for men to prefer an animal life. By-and-by they will learn
                  that such a life necessitates force, absolutism. It is natural for unreflecting
                  men to complain when custom or institutions hold them up to some higher degree.
                  But that higher degree has in it an element of emancipation from the necessary
                  despotisms of physical life. If it were possible to bring the whole community up
                  to a plane of spirituality, it would be found that there and there only could be
                  the highest measure of liberty. And this is my answer to those who grumble at the
                  restriction of Sunday liberty. It is only the liberty of the senses that suffers.
                  A higher and nobler civil liberty, moral liberty, social liberty, will work out of
                  it. Sunday is the common people's Magna Charta."
               "Well done, Doctor! I give up. Hereafter you shall see me radiant on Sunday. I
                  must not get my hay in, if storms do threaten to spoil it, but I shall give my
                  conscience a hitch up, and take it out in that. I must not ride out. But, then, I
                  shall regard every virtuous self-denial as a moral investment with good dividends
                  coming in by-and-by. I can't let the children frolic in the front door yard; but,
                  then, while they sit waiting for the sun to go down, and your Sun-day
                  to be over, I shall console myself that they are one notch nearer an angelic
                  condition every week. But good-night, good-night, Mrs. Wentworth. I hope you may
                  not become so spiritual as quite to disdain the body. I really think, for this
                  world, the body has some respectable uses yet. Good-night, Rose. The angels take
                  care of you, if there is one of them good enough."
               And so the judge left.
               They sat silently looking at the sun, now but just above the horizon. A few scarfs
                  of cloud, brilliant with flame-color, and every moment changing forms, seemed like
                  winged spirits, half revealed, that hovered round the retiring orb.
               
               Mrs. Wentworth at length broke the silence.
               "I always thought, Doctor, that you believed Sunday over-strictly kept, and that
                  you were in favor of relaxation."
               "I am. Just as fast as you can make it a day of real religious enjoyment, it will
                  relax itself. True and deep spiritual feeling is the freest of all experiences.
                  And it reconciles in itself the most perfect consciousness of liberty with the
                  most thorough observance of outward rules and proprieties. Liberty is not an
                  outward condition. It is an inward attribute or rather a name for the quality of
                  life produced by the highest moral attributes. When communities come to that
                  condition, we shall see fewer laws and higher morality.
               "The one great poem of New England is her Sunday! Through that she has escaped
                  materialism. That has been a crystal dome over head, through which Imagination has
                  been kept alive. New England's imagination is to be found—not in art, or
                  literature—but in her inventions, her social organism, and, above all, in her
                  religious life. The Sabbath has been the nurse of that. When she ceases to have a
                  Sunday, she will be as this landscape is—now growing dark, all its lines blurred,
                  its distances and gradations fast merging into sheeted darkness and night.
               "Come, let us go in!"
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               GOING TO COLLEGE.
               BARTON CATHCART was brought up on a farm, by a farmer, with no other thought than
                  that he would, like his father, live by steady and hard work. Early he manifested
                  ambition, but it developed in the line of his duties. Thoroughly above his years,
                  industry and fidelity marked him from childhood. His tenacity of purpose was
                  remarkable and had it not been controlled by judgment, in later years it would
                  have become obstinacy.
               He was ambitious of doing men's work, and, at ten years of age in labor that
                  required tact and quickness rather than strength, he was fully as serviceable as a
                  man. He was eager to prove himself tough, refused in the coldest winter to wear an
                  overcoat, rejoiced to brave storms, and regarded the reputation of being a good
                  farmer as praise enough.
               His winters were given to schooling, and his father's example at home bred in him
                  a love of reading. When he was about fourteen, there began to rise in his mind dim
                  questioning whether he should after all follow husbandry. The books which he had
                  read furnished so many heroes that he found his allegiance to hard work somewhat
                  shaken. Sometimes he dreamed that he would be a merchant, and that after a
                  successful life, he would return and build in his native village.
               Then he pondered within himself whether he might not by study become a lawyer. His
                  mind had been inflamed with admiration by some trials that had gone on in Norwood,
                  and he caught the contagion of the common people, who look upon a smart lawyer as
                  one of the most enviable of men.
               But all these dreams were as nothing to the influence of a single question which
                  Rose put to him one Sunday evening at her father's.
               "Barton, don't you mean to go to college?"
               "No; I never really thought of it. What makes you ask me?"
               "I should like to go myself. I should like to know every thing. But women don't go to college. If I were a man I
                  should certainly go."
               "What would you do then, Rose?"
               "I don't know. I could tell better afterwards. Don't you think that you would like
                  to be a minister, Barton?"
               There are some impressions that come upon us with the force of prophecies. Barton
                  had never before once thought of a college, except as a vague picture, a place of
                  wonderful men who knew all manner of wonderful things. Like a true New England
                  boy, he looked with admiration upon any young man that "had been to college."
                  Intelligence and morality are the household ideals of New England. The Amherst
                  College building he had seen as they glimmered far across the Connecticut river
                  valley, and had often vaguely striven in imagination to picture the contents of
                  those buildings, very much as old crusaders may be imagined to have wondered at
                  Jerusalem afar off.
               These few words of Rose had struck a chord which never ceased vibrating. He
                  thought of it all the way home. Every day he found the subject intruding upon him.
                  Finally it had so possessed his feelings that his farm work no longer seemed his
                  chief ambition, and he found himself following his tasks with less spring and
                  pleasure than hitherto; and dangerous signs, even of weariness and impatience,
                  appeared.
               At length he determined to break his thoughts to his mother—confident that, though
                  she might repress his new desires, she would yet sympathize with his ambition to
                  rise in the world. Great then was his surprise, when, one evening, he made a full
                  disclosure of his thoughts, to find that Rachel was neither astonished nor
                  averse.
               It was an evening when his father was away in town and the house was still. Barton
                  said to his mother:
               "Mother, do you think I ought to go to college?"
               She paused, and looked fixedly and kindly upon her son; she there went on with her
                  work in silence for many minutes—so many minutes that Barton thought it an hour,
                  though it was not a quarter of it. He sat with the book which he had been reading
                  on his knee and his forefinger in it for a mark, looking into the fire.
               What other picture-book has such color, such infinite novelty of design, such
                  suggestiveness as the farmer's picture-book on the andirons? There were flames
                  shooting up like spires of churches in the colors of sunset. On the front log was
                  a mimic hunting-scene. Along the surface ran a faint line of blue gas, issuing at
                  little intervals from cracks; and this seemed like rabbits or foxes. Then from the
                  end of the log a flame like a hound; it leaped over and caught the gas, and raced
                  across the whole front and disappeared, as if around a corner. Barton's uneasy
                  thoughts were well nigh as fitful and fiery as the flames before him. He glanced
                  at his mother. She was excited too. Her eye was bright, a color was on her cheek,
                  her hand was more nervously quick.
               Rachel came, at length, and sat down by him.
               "Barton, your words seem to me like an opening door. On one side is the home and
                  purity and security; on the other the great and wide world, full of all manner of
                  life and danger. You have always seemed to me as one that would remain here. But
                  already your thoughts have gone; and by and by you will follow. I am willing. Yet
                  the day you leave us will be a day of pangs more than when you were born."
               "Mother, I will not go if you wish me to stay. I can give it up."
               "When God stirs in us deep thoughts for things that are right, they are
                  prophecies, and we must heed them. Should I keep you back and hide you from God's
                  decrees could I prevail? If we follow duty willingly, we are treated kindly; but
                  if we resist, Duty hunts us down and drags us to answer to our conscience."
               Then both were silent. Barton was looking at the coals under the fore-log. There
                  was one spot that seemed making signs to him. The dull yellow red of the coal
                  suddenly glowed with white light as if a stream of air had fanned it, then sunk
                  back to its ruddy hue; it glanced out white and radiant again, and lost the glow
                  once more as if it kept sympathy with Barton's thoughts, that rose and sunk by
                  turns.
               "Oh, my son, I know not why God has shaded life to my eyes. His will be done! Life
                  seems so deep, so awful in meaning, and infinite—infinite in its results. It is
                  like an ocean with great storms travelling over it always, and many enemies. Yet
                  every one must venture. If I were sure that you had made your peace with God—"
               She paused.
               The fore-stick broke in two, and showers of sparks rushed up the fireplace, and great meaty coals rolled down
                  upon the hearth, while the whole fire seemed to ease itself, and settled down into
                  new positions, as if a restraint had been removed.
               It was a relief to both of them, and Barton put a new forestick in place, laid
                  back the brands, and with the tongs raked the great bed of coals right and left
                  under the logs, as if to clear out its throat and give the fire
                  breathing-room.
               "But, my son, have you thought whether you will be able to succeed?"
               "Mother, I have not spoken a word to father about it."
               "I did not mean that. Should your father consent? You are not yet fifteen. You
                  have learned only the common branches of an English education. It is two miles to
                  the Academy. You will have to study at least two years before you can enter
                  college. If your father should give you your time and help you besides, he would
                  expect you to help yourself. You know his mind. If he had ever so much money, he
                  would not give it to you. He thinks that the earning is a moral preservation. It
                  will require patience and courage to get an education."
               "I have patience and courage," said Barton, quietly. "Did you ever know me give up
                  any thing that I had undertaken? Did not father say that he didn't believe anybody
                  else would ever have got down that wood on the mountain-lot, in the deep snow,
                  that I did? But he never knew half that I went through. Didn't I finish that piece
                  of wall that father said nobody could do in two days? But you didn't know nor he
                  either, that I went out after you were abed, and worked all night, by the moon. It
                  was four o'clock in the morning when I quit. There's something in me that won't
                  let go when I take hold in earnest. I can't help it!"
               "But an education is only a beginning, what do you mean to do afterwards?"
               "I don't know. If a man is well educated, I guess he can do pretty much as he
                  pleases. May be I'll be a lawyer or a minister."
               "Or a doctor, Barton?"
               He was silent. The fire had lost much of its zeal, and lay like a rich community,
                  with great banks of hot coals; while, here and there, a brand that had fallen the
                  wrong way, like a disappointed man in society, lay smoking,—white on the outside
                  with ashes, and black with charcoal within.
               The conversation was interrupted by the sounds in the yard. Barton started up for
                  the lantern, and sprang out to relieve his father of the horse, which he always
                  put up of himself, unless relieved by some such proffered service of his
                  children.
               It was some days before the subject was resumed in the family; and then 'Biah
                  Cathcart introduced it.
               "Barton, your mother says you want to go to college. I have no objection, if you
                  think you are smart enough. You cannot enter college without examination. My farm
                  is as honorable in its way as a college. I shan't let any one brought up here
                  leave it without standing an examination. If you choose to learn surveying and
                  will give me a plot of my farm and a map of this district, I'll give you your
                  time. It won't do for a farmer's boy to go to college, and not to know more about
                  land than if he came from a city."
               His father said nothing to him of books and nothing of a teacher. Barton was too
                  proud to ask any help—at any rate at home. He knew his father's notions, and he
                  knew that he was expected to find out his own way, and to master the art and
                  mystery of surveying by his own wit and in entity.
               He said to himself:
               "Where shall I begin? Well—I must find that out myself. How shall I find it out?
                  What book will tell me? I suppose I've got that to find out too. If
                  there is no book then I must get somebody to tell me, and I will too
                  or I'll know the reason why."
               Barton's first step was to explore his father's library. Among the several hundred
                  volumes he remembered vaguely to have seen a book with land surveying in it. But
                  whether the art of surveying was large and difficult, or simple and easy, he could
                  not tell. Accordingly he examined every book in his father's book-cases. Here were
                  Scott's and Henry's Commentaries on the Scriptures. Here were a few law books.
                  There were histories, ancient and modern, sacred and profane. A very good
                  selection of English classics, and a few translations of the ancients. There was a
                  good row of voyages travels and biographies. The largest number of looks was in
                  the department of Natural History and in the art and science of farming, on which
                  his father's reading had been extensive. There was also Rees' Cyclopædia, and a
                  few of Scott's and Cooper's novels; but no book on surveying.
               
               "Was there not one? Had it been removed purposely? Was it loaned? I
                  don't care—there are books somewhere and I'll find out where."
               Old 'Biah knew what was going on, but never spoke a word. "We are apt to put too
                  many blades in our knives now-a-days," said he. I had rather give the boy a
                  handle, and let him put in his own blade. There is nothing like working out a
                  thing yourself. Lead is as good as steel when the knife is in your pocket. Put it
                  to hard work and see which keeps its edge-that tells the difference between good
                  temper and none at all."
               When they were working in the field, if his boys asked him a question that came
                  within their own powers of investigation, he would say—"A man should be ashamed to
                  ask questions of others that he can answer himself. What was your head given for
                  but to use?" In this way his children were early inclined to observe and study for
                  themselves.
               But once, when Barton had been to Springfield, and returned by different route,
                  having to visit several outlying neighbors on business, he lost his way, and was
                  detained a night. His father would not take the excuse.
               "If a man has got a tongue in his head there is no need of missing his way in a
                  populous country. Ask questions!"
               A spirit of independence could scarcely fail to grow up under such influences and
                  when through inexperience, it tended to extremes, old Cathcart would say: "He is
                  independent who troubles people the least, and helps them the most. Never let
                  anybody carry you or your burdens if you can help it. But always be ready to carry
                  other people's, if they need it."
               After a vain search Barton seemed baffled. At last, a happy thought struck
                  him.
               "I'll ask Tommy Taft; he's an old sailor and has studied navigation; maybe
                  surveying and navigation are enough alike for him to help me."
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               CONSULTATIONS.
               THE next night, not long after dark, a knock was heard at Tommy Taft's shop-door.
                  Tommy was sitting in his rough old chair, that seemed to have been once a part of
                  a pork-barrel. The front had been sawed away half-way down, leaving the rest of
                  the staves for a back; and a seat was laid across the open part; and the whole was
                  covered with some cheap stuff, so that it answered the purpose of luxury far
                  better than do most of the chairs which seem designed to make visitors so
                  uncomfortable that their calls shall be short.
               "Who's there?—come in!" roared out Tommy, laying down his pipe.
               But several reasons precluded obedience to the vociferous command which he
                  repeated. In the first place the door below was fastened; and, in the next place,
                  had Barton made good his entrance, his way among barrels and benches, shavings and
                  timber, was not like to be smooth or easy.
               Mother Taft lit a candle, saying, with a woman's and a nurse's apprehension:
               "I am afraid Ma'am Whipple's child is worse. They were to send if they needed
                  me."
               The stairs came down into the corner of the shop. Loosening the rude wooden bolt,
                  she opened the door.
               "Why, Barton Cathcart, of all things in the world! What is the matter? Is your
                  mother sick? Is any thing the matter at home?"
               "Nothing, Mother Taft," said he, hastening to relieve her honest anxiety. "I only
                  came down to see Tommy about some business."
               By this time Tommy's wooden leg was busy up stairs, pounding and slapping, at each
                  step, as he made toward the head of the stairs. Each step shook every board in the
                  floor, as if a flail or rather trip-hammer, were at work on a wager.
               As Barton came in sight, Tommy seemed enraptured.
               
               "Why, boy,—why, lad, come up here! Let me get my hands on you—that's all! Come up
                  here, my chap, if you dare,—just come up here!"
               And no sooner was the act done than Tommy seized him in his arms, as if he had
                  been a pet dog; and shook him, and laughed at him, and toddled him off towards the
                  fire, rubbing his shoulders, as if he were rolling out a piece of pie-crust.
               "Why, where did you come from? What's the matter? What do you want, my hearty? Any
                  mischief up, eh? Any thing broke? Any thing smashed? What is it, I say; what's the
                  matter?" And without waiting for an answer, he plumped Barton into his own barrel
                  seat, with an emphasis which threatened to carry them both over upon the floor,
                  and quite overthrew Uncle Tommy's familiar, in the shape of a huge, yellow,
                  crop-ear cat, that sat dozing by the fire. "Clap on some more stuff, woman. Let's
                  have more fire. Nights are nights, now, d'ye know! Skates broke, eh?—No?—Gun out
                  of order? Traps gone?—No?—Well, what is it? Didn't come front Parson Buell, did
                  ye? Had my dose last week. Good man. Looks after the old sinner. He needs it. Have
                  to keep tryin' the pumps. Some day, afore you know it, he'll founder. No hope. Bad
                  business. Wicked old sinner. But what have you come for I tell you?"
               "Why," said Barton, laughing, "if you'll keep still long enough for me to speak,
                  Tommy, I'll tell you."
               "Sartin, sartin. I don't want to talk—go on. Somethin's the matter, I know. Come
                  down to-night. No, no—not for nothin'. I know. Come, jest tell us what it is; and
                  don't keep an old fellow with his anchor neither up or down. But boys will be
                  boys," said Tommy, giving Barton an affectionate slap on his knee.
               "Well," said Barton, striking in resolutely, as one who means to make his way in a
                  crowd, "I want to find out something, and don't know who to go to, Tommy; and I
                  thought perhaps you would know."
               "Of course I know. What's an old sailor good for but to know all the odds and
                  ends, and crinkum-crankums for young folks? The only jolly folks in this world are
                  young folks that ain't good for nothin' yet, and old folks that's past doin' much.
                  All the rest of the world are livin' in a pucker and a fume all the time. I tell
                  you, Barton, I'm the only sensible man in this town. Did ye ever see such a
                  stewin' and brewin' as goes on for nothin' among these folks that are rubbin' and
                  grindin' round to make money, and then usin' it to make more money, and that to
                  make more and haven't time to stop and enjoy it a little!"
               There is no telling to what lengths of discourse Tommy would have gone, for he
                  seemed in peculiarly good spirits to-night, at Barton's visit. Barton was one of
                  Tommy's prime favorites.
               But the old fellow was a good deal puzzled when the errand came out.
               "Tommy, I want to learn something about surveying. I'm going to college."
               "Thunder and lightnin'! Goin' to college? Make a map to find your way from here to
                  Amherst, eh?"
               "Father is so 'fraid that his children will depend on somebody for something, that
                  he never acts as other folks do. He wants me to show that I am in earnest and he
                  in a sort puts me on a stent; and so I've got to learn something
                  about surveying, to let him see that I've got spunk enough to study; and I won't
                  ask father any thing about it," said Barton laughing, "not if I have to invent
                  surveying all over again. Now I thought that as you knew about navigation, you
                  could perhaps tell me enough about surveying to give me a start. But don't tell
                  father."
               "Well, if that ain't the beat all! I never 'spected to be a schoolmaster, and have
                  folks cum to me for larnin'. Why, Barton, I don't know nothin' about it.
                  Navigation, boy, I guess is a sort of a surveyin' bottom side up. I mean that it
                  is studyin' out the stars and findin' out where you are. But, Lord bless you, that
                  won't help you on dry land, and if it would, I couldn't help you. Why don't you
                  just go over to Edwards? They say he's big on mathematics."
               "That's a good idea," said Barton. "I wonder I never thought of that. Now I come
                  to think of it, I know that he has surveyed a good deal. He was out a while when
                  they were running the lines for the railroad."
               Tommy had been pulling away at a bag in a closet, and now brought out some hickory
                  nuts, and was proceeding to fill a tin pan with them when Barton cut short his
                  hospitable intent. Go he must. His errand must be speedily performed. The night
                  was wearing, and it would not do to be late.
               
               "But why on airth don't you ask your father, Barton? I guess he could tell you as
                  well as any body."
               "You know my father, Tommy. He's queer about some things. He's always stirring us
                  up to find out things. He seems set not to tell us any thing that we can dig out
                  ourselves."
               "That's the old man all over. But good for you—good for you—make you smart—wake
                  you up—keep you sharp."
               "He wouldn't tell me the name of a flower, but made me hunt it down in a Botany.
                  He wouldn't tell me why the moss grew on one side of a tree more than on the
                  other, but set me to find out. If I were to ask him about surveying he would
                  say,—What have you done yourself to find out? As soon as he sees that I am in
                  earnest, and have tried to help myself, he'll help me."
               "And is he as strict with Alice?" asked Mother Taft, who had listened silently to
                  the conversation.
               "Yes—but rather softer. But she has to hunt the dictionary for her words and he
                  won't let her read a sentence that contains a place or river, or custom, that he
                  don't question her; and if she don't know, he expects her to find out, and to find
                  out, too, how to find out."
               "And how does Alice like it?"
               "Oh, she's smart to father's heart's content. She has got so keen that you can't
                  catch her very easy. You see that's a habit that grows on one. And after a while
                  it is just as easy, and a little easier, to find out your own things as to be
                  depending on other people to find them out for you. But I must be off. Much
                  obliged for your nuts. I'll put some in my pocket. What big ones!—splendid! You
                  always know where the best trees are, Tommy."
               "No, that's Pete's work. Pete knows every nut, and every squirrel, and every berry
                  that grows in these parts. You see, my leg does very well to walk with; a little
                  noisy, perhaps, especially when you are late to meeting and walk up the aisle in
                  prayer time; but it's no use on a chestnut tree. A wooden leg is a good thing
                  though, Barton; never have to cut my toe-nails on that leg," said Tommy, with a
                  chuckle. "Not much paid out for shoes neither. Go to a blacksmith for my shoes—ho!
                  ho! ho! Never have rheumatism in that leg neither. Don't catch cold when I git it
                  wet. Toes never cold on that leg—he! he! he! No corns. Nobody steps on my toes.
                  Don't cost much for blackin'. It's a real convenience. Sometimes I think legs were
                  a mistake; ain't worth as much as it costs to keep 'em up."
               "I suppose, then, you regret having one well leg, Tommy?"
               "Of course I do. Often think of havin' it taken off. Very odd, you see, to have
                  one flesh leg and one wooden leg. Feller don't like to be odd, ye know," said
                  Tommy, winking at Barton, as if to save him from taking the speech literally. "So
                  queer, you know, to wake up in the night and turn over just one leg! Then my old
                  smasher makes such a noise that every body looks at that one, and I do believe my
                  real leg gits jealous of the attention that's paid to the wooden one. The fact is,
                  that wooden teller hasn't got much manners. Never could keep him still, and it's
                  the worst leg to have treadin' on your toes that ever you saw."
               As Tommy Taft thus ran on, his eye seemed to linger fondly upon Barton, and his
                  rough voice grew less turbulent. All at once, turning to him, in a manner entirely
                  changed, and full of rude tenderness, he said, in a simple way:
               "And so, Barton, you really are going to college. Well, I didn't think it. You're
                  going to college, and I shan't see you much more my boy."
               His manner was so new and there was such a sort of helplessness in his way, that
                  Barton was affected by it, and said:
               "Why, Tommy, I shan't go this two years, and I shall be home every vacation, you
                  know. It is only a few miles to Amherst, any how."
               "It's all right. If a boy's got any thing particular in him, it'll certainly git
                  out, somehow, and it ain't much use to try to stop it. If you do, it'll only twist
                  it and twirl it, like a seed with a board on it, that will come up and creep out
                  sideways, and gits up in spite of hindrance, only with a cruel crooked stem. I
                  might 'a made a smart man once, but they meddled with me, and I was fierce—well,
                  no matter. Old Tommy missed it. But you won't. You'll be all right, Barton, boy!
                  On the hull, I'm glad of it. Folks that stay to hum are like coasters—sloops and
                  schooners like, that run along shore and do a peddlin' business in shoal water.
                  Folks that go to college are square rigged. They can make long voyages, carry big
                  freights, go round the world if they're mind to."
               
               Tommy seemed likely to spend the night in talking, and Barton abruptly bid Mother
                  Taft good-night, and climbed down stairs, while Tommy from the top was still
                  adding some further remarks.
               Mr. Edwards received Barton with a calm and dignified welcome, and expressed no
                  surprise. He acted as one must who for forty years had been used to having boys
                  come to him for every thing. He had been a schoolmaster all his life. Under his
                  care the academy had earned a high position. The young men who fitted for college
                  there were uniformly remarked for their thorough scholarship and industrious
                  habits.
               Mr. Edwards was tall, thin, with a large gray eye, which was mild and gentle in
                  repose, but kindled like an eagle's under excitement; his face was white; his hair
                  remained thick only around the sides of his head, while upon the top it was very
                  thin, and every where gray. His habitual sobriety was underlaid with a genuine
                  relish of humor, which seldom brought out a laugh, sometimes a smile, but usually
                  only a lighting up of his whole face, and a look of good nature even kinder than
                  usual. His long teaching had earned him a small property, which enabled him now to
                  live in the inexpensive way which best pleased him. He had been once married, but
                  early lost his wife, and never again thought of marrying. His whole life was her
                  monument. And his love, never spoken, but never, after years and years, less
                  tender, and fresh, and romantic, than in the days of his youth, burned like a lamp
                  in some obscure chapel, fed by pious hands, unseen by day to the passers by, but
                  in darkness and secrecy forever shining before the shrine of Love!
               A widowed sister was the only companion of his house. Her hands performed the
                  whole labor of the household. Like her brother, she was intelligent; but, like
                  him, she was not fond of talking. He conversed freely when solicited, but never
                  offered conversation. And, when he did speak, there was something slightly
                  formal,—it was not pedantic but measured, as if he were translating the sentences
                  from another language into his mother tongue. Brother and sister were deeply
                  attached to each other, but would no more think of expressing it than two roses,
                  on the same stem, would make love in any way except by glowing in the same light,
                  carrying the same dew, and shaking to the same wind.
               Every night, when the tea things were removed, the curtain dropped, the fire
                  trimmed (and he was especially fond of a fire of hickory wood, the almost only
                  luxury that he would have, regardless of expense), he took his book and she her
                  work, and he would read aloud. Sometimes, when exciting events were abroad, it
                  would be a newspaper; at other times the magazine. But, whatever he read she
                  heard; and thus they kept along together, in the same house, with the same
                  pleasures, and in the silent enjoyment of the same ideas. Sometimes he would pause
                  in reading, and for a moment comment, or criticise, or unfold his knowledge—which
                  was ample—upon some obscure point. But, usually, little was said, even in long
                  pauses, both reflecting in silence.
               There is something very wonderful in the fruitfulness of silence! Congenial
                  natures may learn almost to forego speech, and yet maintain intimate sympathy and
                  knowledge of each other. There grow up, insensibly, an instinct and an intuition
                  in the eye, in the ear, and in every sense, which finely divide up and distribute
                  the usual functions of a noisy tongue.
               In the morning she knocked at his door and said, "Dwight, breakfast waits." They
                  sat silent during the meal. After morning prayers he made his record of the
                  weather, of which he was a well-instructed scribe, performed some light task in
                  his study—for he still kept up a student's habit—and read his classic authors, pen
                  in hand, making in his journal such criticisms as occurred; or pursued
                  mathematical studies, of which he had always been even more fond than of the
                  languages. The dinner came every day at the good old hour of twelve, and passed
                  silently. The afternoon was given to his garden and yard in summer, and to various
                  quiet exercises, walks, and errands, in winter. The evening was for home and
                  reading. There was no Sunday there. Every day was Sunday.
               Except a slight difference on washing and ironing days, you might call every day
                  of the week a Sabbath, so alike were they—all silent meditative and tranquil.
                  Twice as much was going on up in the great elm trees which overshadowed the
                  dwelling as within the house. Twice as much noise and racket did birds and
                  crickets make in the garden, in summer, as ever was heard within the mansion.
                  Their lives were as nearly spiritual as can be conceived. It is true that both of
                  them had bodies, but they were subordinated to the mind's uses so utterly that
                  they seemed to dry up and turn white as
                  if they despaired of their rights as fleshly bodies and were getting ready to take
                  on a spiritual state in sheer despair.
               "Come in, Barton! sit down. What brings you to town so late? No ill news, I
                  trust?"
               "Nothing, but some business with you, is the matter. I wanted to talk with
                  you—about surveying—and about going to college."
               "Why, Barton, are you going to leave the farm? I thought you were to be the great
                  farmer of this neighborhood? What will your father say?"
               "He is willing—at any rate, he has given consent."
               "What put it into your head! The last time I talked with you, you were bent upon
                  husbandry. It was to be a stock-farm,—grass, grain, cattle,—the finest grass the
                  plumpest grain,—the choicest stock,—mountain pastures,—great barns! All these are
                  fled? Some new ambition?"
               Barton did not acknowledge to himself the germ and spring of all these plans. He,
                  perhaps, would have honestly denied their origin. So subtle are the influences
                  that begin afar off to act upon us, that the condition and direction of our
                  feelings are changed before we notice that we are acted upon. Only the last stages
                  of mental processes, and especially emotive changes, become obvious. Many men see
                  the growth of trees only when leaves are unfolded; but some notice the swelling of
                  the bud. Yet more sensitive observers, before a bud swells, know by the purpling
                  of the twigs and branches that a change has begun. But long before the ruddy color
                  came, there was a stir within, and the march from winter to summer had begun.
                  Barton knew that his plains of life were Changed; but he did not go back to the
                  real beginning to notice the silent impression made by Rose; nor did he even admit
                  himself that Rose had any important influence upon his life or thoughts. That she
                  was his sister Alice's very twin sister, as it Were he knew, and he called her
                     his sister too.
               Sister! sister!—that is a sweet word, but exceedingly mischievous, too, in the
                  realm of love! It is a word for devout enthusiasm, for unselfish love, for
                  unblushing friendship, for faithfulness and honest intimacy, for friendship
                  without passion, for love without sultry ardors. Brother and sister! That is the
                  most simple and beautiful confluence of the sexes!
               But that word sister is the covered way of love! It is the mask which
                  bashfulness wears before it gains boldness enough to say love. It is a gentle
                  hypocrisy, under which souls consent to remain and dream in hope by-and-by of a
                  rapturous waking! It is the half-way house between friendship and ardent
                  affection. It is a neutral ground, on which men and women agree to commit no
                  offensive action, and where both parties make haste to break the agreement. Under
                  the names brother and sister how fast intimacies grow! What bold words are spoken!
                  What deep glances are exchanged! Love is war. The friendship of a brother and
                  sister, unrelated, is a truce, in which both parties are secretly preparing for
                  the onset and victory.
               First comes acquaintance—that is May; then friendship—that is June; then brother
                  and sisterhood—that is July; and then love, which is August; but July and August
                  are so much alike that no one can tell when one stops and the other begins!
               Barton unfolded to Mr. Edwards, briefly, his ambition to surprise his father, and
                  received from him suitable information, the loan of necessary books, the
                  invitation to come once or twice a week for recitation and the promise that as
                  soon as the season opened, Mr. Edwards would go out with him and give him
                  practical lessons in the field.
               The next Sunday found Barton, during the intermission of service, at Dr.
                  Wentworth's. Nothing of his week's work did he speak. He had a natural delicacy of
                  pride, and seldom spoke of himself—never of his inward feelings, save to his
                  mother.
               Rose did not question him. She walked with him into the greenhouse and stood among
                  the plants, speaking of common things.
               She instinctively knew that something had happened to Barton. His way was
                  different. His carriage was different. She merely noticed it and did not inquire
                  or even reflect upon it. Yet Barton knew that she knew something ailed him, for
                  she unconsciously looked at him with that gaze of her father's, as if she saw
                  something opening up before her in his own heart. It was her rare sensitiveness to
                  truth, which was peculiarly displayed toward Nature, but was as real though less
                  manifested, toward society, that gave to Rose an almost unerring insight of
                  peoples' dispositions.
               
               By her original constitution Rose was exquisitely susceptible of impressions, and
                  her father's training had educated this tendency, so that she saw infinitely more,
                  in looking upon the same things, than others did; heard and discriminated far more
                  of the memorable sounds which fill the day, than did her companions. This world is
                  not the same world to any two persons in it. But between the lowest human
                  organization and the highest, the difference is so wide, that the world which each
                  sees would not be recognized by the other. The thermometer and barometer are the
                  perpetual witness of men's coarse and sensitive natures. They say to us every
                  hour, "See what world-affecting changes are going on, which you are not fine
                  enough to notice, but which we feel and indicate."
               But the sphere of effects not perceived in human life, is even greater than in the
                  natural world. Every feeling which rises in the soul has its own signal in the
                  body. If our eyes were fine enough, if our minds were sensitive enough, we should
                  see the face and carriage of men going through endless variations, as the soul
                  moves through all its affluent moods. Now we see only the extreme manifestations.
                  Fear, rage, hate, love, mirth, are discernible at their full tides. Finer natures
                  perceive their remote conditions, their subtle influences; but it is a feeling, a
                  mere blind consciousness of change, or difference, rather than a defined
                  perception.
               Rose had to a singular degree this fine and ineffable sympathy with matter and
                  with mind. She had it without being conscious of it. She was not aware that she
                  lived far deeper into life than others did. Of all things that lived about her,
                  herself was almost the only one which she did not take cognizance of.
               She judged that Barton had something to say to her, and so she had naturally gone
                  to the greenhouse. He said nothing to her, except of the plants, of the decline of
                  the season, and so she felt that it was something not to be told. To know that one
                  has a secret is to know half the secret itself.
               When the afternoon service was done, Mr. Edwards walked on with Rose and her
                  father and mother, on the way to his own house beyond.
               "And so 'Biah Cathcart is going to send his son to college."
               "Ah," said the Doctor, "that is something new. When did you hear it?"
               "Barton came to see me last week. He is to come to the academy the next term, and
                  thinks that in two years he can enter Amherst."
               "Well, well, these boys run away with their father's plans, as kittens do with a
                  knitter's ball of yarn—roll it all over the room and snarl it terribly!"
               And so Rose now perceived what was the thing which she had felt—Barton was to go
                  to college. She was glad. He would be a scholar, for he always did conscientiously
                  and well whatever he did. And he would be distinguished. Would he be a lawyer?
                  Would he ever rise to public honors? Would he preach? Would he choose the fields
                  of science? The dim and misty future lay before her as a horizon on which
                  shapeless clouds took and lost form at the same moment. Of one feeling she was
                  sure—she was glad for Barton. Her soul prophesied for him a noble life, and she
                  was happy.
               From the hour of his decision, Barton was consciously changed. A new life had
                  opened. All things stood out in new relations. He was even more industrious and
                  thorough in his daily work on the farm.
               "I should not wonder, Rachel," said his father "if Barton was sorry for his
                  choice; now that he comes to think of leaving it, he likes the farm better than he
                  knew. He clings to his work as if he was sorry that he must leave it."
               Rachel's sympathy interpreted Barton more accurately. She knew how a highly
                  conscientious nature would fear the not doing well that which it was no longer
                  doing for the love of it; and that the fear of slighting work which one was
                  consciously falling from, would redouble caution and endeavor.
               "I don't think Barton is tired of work or that he would be sorry to stay; but I
                  think he is glad to go. And since he is going to leave, he naturally is anxious
                  lest he should slight any thing. Folks always take the most pains about the things
                  that they are in danger of neglecting."
               "That may be so of honest people, but not of the shiftless and lazy."
               But there was something more which neither recognized. Barton was proud as well as
                  faithful. There was a reason in himself which he felt, but never analyzed or
                  understood, why he did faithfully what
                  he did at all. There is a peculiar effect in self-esteem to impart a sense of
                  one's own personality to whatever one touches, owns, or does. Barton's planning
                  was for the time a part of his own self. His work was himself. Self-respect
                  included not his mind and person alone, but whatever his person concerned itself
                  about. And to slight his work was to slight himself.
               And we should likewise add, what so many know, that he who has once learned to
                  work with thoughtful interest and genuine ambition on a farm will never lose the
                  enthusiasm. Every year men high in professional places—artists, judges, clergymen,
                  senators, teachers—go back in vacation to the old homestead, and feel the old
                  inspiration of Work. They swing the flail, they follow the plough, they swing the
                  scythe, or axe, with enthusiasm, and often with secret wishes that they had never
                  forsaken them; at any rate, with a half purpose of retiring from crowded ways and
                  feverish pursuits to the calm and wholesome joys of husbandry.
               All hail, Work! Man lost Paradise by the temptations that beset indolence. He will
                  regain it again by those wholesome qualities which are the fruit of intelligent
                  work! The curse, "thou shalt earn thy bread in the sweat of thy brow," was not a
                  curse on work but on drudgery. It is time that the curse on the
                  ground should be worked out. There has been sweat enough to wash it clean. There
                  have tears enough fallen down to make the earth sweet. Work shall beautify it.
                  Work shall drive out Drudgery and bring in Leisure, and then men shall eat their
                  bread under cool shadows with unseated brows!
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               MENTAL PHILOSOPHY.—(TO BE READ OR SKIPPED.)
               LONG before the Amazon reaches the ocean, it has grown so wide that from the
                  channel no shore can be seen on either side. It is still a river, but with all the
                  signs and symptoms of becoming an ocean. There is a period beginning not far from
                  fourteen, in young lives where childhood is widened suddenly, and carries its
                  banks so far out that manhood seems begun, though as yet it is far off. The stream
                  is ocean deep. Upon this estuary of youth the currents are shifting—the eddies are
                  many. Here are united the strength of the sea and the hindrances of the land.
               The important organic changes which in our zone take place at the second full
                  seven of years, produce important results even in the coldest temperaments and in
                  the slenderest natures. But in persons of vigor of body and strength of feeling,
                  there is frequently an uprising like a city in insurrection. The young nature,
                  swelling to the new influences with a sense of immeasurable strength-sometimes
                  turbulent with passions, but always throbbing with excited feelings, led on and
                  fed by tantalizing fancies,—seems transformed from its previous self, and becomes
                  a new nature.
               The mere access of impetuous feeling is not by any means the most striking change
                  that occurs. There is frequently the appearance of new forces in the mind, the
                  displacement of old ones, and an entire change of proportion and balance in the
                  moral and intellectual faculties. A mild and docile boy springs up before his
                  astonished parents defiant and unreachable. A conscientious and painstaking nature
                  is seized with wilful impulses, and seems by an insane attraction drawn to
                  bewildering courses.
               On the other hand lads of a soft and yielding nature sometimes stiffen and show an
                  unexpected strength. Children who had early and chiefly acted from motives of
                  approbation begin to feel the sterner and more wholesome law of pride. Faults fall
                  off at once, against which nurse, mother, and teacher had labored assiduously and
                  in vain.
               New moral forces are developed into activity. Aspirations begin to quicken the soul. Ambitions grow nobler. A
                  scorn of all authority which does not conform to reason or to generous views of
                  duty is frequently seen, and just as frequently misunderstood. The exultation of
                  hope and the deepest sadness of despondency alternate in the same bosom. There is
                  also in some natures, in strange union, an intense sensibility to pleasure, with a
                  wayward rejection of it as unsatisfying and unworthy.
               The human soul, in this its real waking, is like the dawning of spring in the
                  forest. All things good and bad are quickened alike. The dove comes, and the hawk
                  also; the singing thrush, and the cawing crow; harmless insects and stinging ones;
                  innocent worms and noxious reptiles! The spice-bush and the nettle; the fragrant
                  blossoms, and ill-scented, poisonous weeds, all move together and break forth into
                  life. But as every day the returning sun, moving higher, brings on the summer, the
                  things comely and useful gain ascendancy, and the forest and the field nourish
                  treasures for the joy of man and beast. Here and there is a noisome morass which
                  summer only makes pestilential. At remote intervals rare spots may be overgrown
                  with poisonous plants or waste weeds; but these things are exceptional; and summer
                  brings, in vast excess over incidental evil, the richest stores of inestimable
                  benefit.
               All natures come to their manhood through some experience of fermentation! With
                  some it is a ferment of passions; with some, of the affections; and with richly
                  endowed natures it is the ferment of thought and of the moral nature.
               Wholesome labor is for this, as for a thousand other critical experiences of life,
                  an antidote or a remedy. But what shall save one from that passage of the
                  thoughts, that struggle of the moral nature, which lies between so many noble
                  youth and their full manhood? Nothing! It may be adjourned, but sooner or Liter it
                  comes. It may be masked, tempered, but a full and vital nature is weaned from
                  boyhood with as many tears and sorrows as first he was weaned from his mother's
                  breast.
               Barton Cathcart escaped the constitutional disturbance of the passions partly by
                  his inherent nature, partly by the influences of home and its education, and
                  perhaps full as much by the wholesome moral influence of physical labor. But there
                  slumbered elements in his soul which would yet awake though the time was not
                  come.
               From his father Barton inherited strong common sense, sobriety of judgment, and a
                  rarer gift, an instinctive sense of what is true, which may coexist
                  with an argumentative faculty and with logical power, but which is separable from
                  both of them, and is superior to both. From his mother came imagination, and that
                  subtle sympathy with invisible things which produces interiorness and depth of
                  character.
               Except with his mother he had till now spoken of his inward life and feeling to no
                  one; and even with her the intercourse was One of sympathy more than of
                  conversation. A common understanding seemed to spring up between them without
                  words.
               For a year he pursued his studies with a stubborn persistence. The elements of
                  language, and the grown forms of learning, furnished wearisome and prosaic tasks.
                  But gradually he began to learn the pleasure of intellectual victories. His pride,
                  which at times had almost fiercely repelled discouragement, began to experience
                  satisfaction in the consciousness of power.
               Although Barton had maintained that intimacy with Dr. Wentworth's family in which
                  he had been reared, it was not until his second year at the academy that his
                  companionship with Rose Wentworth began to include an interchange of thoughts, and
                  reasoning, and even discussions.
               Accustomed to her father's society, and familiar from her childhood with his
                  discussions of questions in a spirit far deeper than usually prevails, it is not
                  surprising that Rose, some years younger, was fully Barton's equal, and, perhaps,
                  in many ranges of life his superior. Certainly, in taste, in the discrimination of
                  the subtler forms of nature, and in the depth and variety of the enjoyments which
                  spontaneously sprung up in her soul, she was Barton's superior.
               What impression Rose Wentworth produced upon others shall be left for them to say,
                  at their own time, and in their own manner. But it is for us to show the
                  groundwork of her nature, from which all these impressions arose.
               Perfect physical health produced an even flow of spirits, and an exhilaration of
                  manner, such as leads lambs to skip, and kittens to frolic; and this in Rose,
                  prevented any of that little-girl saintship of manner which many are fond of
                  depicting. She was buoyant, joyous, free-moving, and artless. Every side of her
                  mind was developed. Deep and rich in
                  moral feeling, strong and fine in the, affections, quick and fruitful in
                  intellect, she had, under home influence, been educated to an outward and inward
                  life of singular fullness and beauty.
               In estimating the causes of character men ascribe much to circumstances, much to
                  training, and much to the fullness and force of one's original endowments. But
                  there are other elements more subtle, but of profound value, in the structure of
                  that most wonderful of all architectures—the character—built up of invisible
                  materials, without sound or force permanent in its nature, yet in form flexible,
                  and prolific in change. Chief among these are to be reckoned sympathy between faculties, and unity of action.
               Some people's heads are mere lodging houses of faculties; each lodger minds his
                  own business, and meddles as little as possible with others. After a whole life,
                  it cannot be perceived that the social affections have derived the least influence
                  from the moral sentiments by whose side they have lived scores of years. And the
                  reverse, also, is witnessed, when the affections have neither softened nor warmed
                  the moral sentiments, nor seemed to have had any intercourse with them. Many men's
                  passions act without curb or influence from the reason, and are limited and
                  restrained only by their own selfish interests.
               This non-intercourse may be the result of education, or of the want of it. But
                  there is an original aptitude in this matter. Congruity and inter-sympathy tend,
                  in some natures, to entire harmony and unity in the mind's life; while, in others,
                  there is a stratification, as it were, of faculty. Nothing acts out of its own
                  plane. Certain elements of mind act in their own class, but never out of it, and
                  the faculties, like disintegrated musicians in a mutinous orchestra, play by
                  single ones, or by twos and threes, but never in solid unity and harmony.
               It is thus that some natures squander life-force in intermittent efforts. Their
                  endowments are ample, but they are frittered away uselessly. But where the happy
                  temperament unites in an original and spontaneous harmony all the parts of one's
                  natures the augmentation of force is but a small part of the good fortune. There
                  is a breadth, a variety, a depth, a fertility of experience, which yields to
                  single lives more of joy than is possessed by scores of ordinary men.
               Education is popularly supposed to be the unfolding of mental forces. Far more
                  important in education is the inspiration of facile intercourse between all parts
                  of the mind, the opening up of free trade and active commerce between all its
                  faculties.
               Rose was gifted, to the last decree in her constitutional endowments. Every part
                  of her nature was in sympathetic relation to every other part. There were no
                  expulsions or discrepancies between her mental powers. They were in exquisite
                  sympathy; they were in singular symmetry; they were in perfect harmony.
               Barton had a strong and large nature, but not reconciled within itself. There were
                  great conflicts yet to be endured; the more painful because unintelligible. They
                  might have wrecked his peace, had it not been for help coming from outside of
                  himself. But that help did not come till late and then was followed soon by other
                  experiences, by the exaltation, heat and fusion of a great struggle.
               The transition from girlhood to womanhood is marked by the development of
                  sentiment rather than by conflicts of passion. That balance and harmony of nature,
                  with which Rose was endowed, had its fortunate parallel in her external condition.
                  Every circumstance about her conspired to give to her mind a natural development.
                  A mother's love, strong and rich, was seasoned with a genial religious element,
                  which gave to it the color of something more than an earthly affection. Agate
                  Bissell furnished the sterner elements, the sense of conscience in daily duties,
                  and she clothed the qualities of regularity, method, and exactitude with a
                  semi-moral nature. Her father's nature tended to enlarge the sphere of her
                  understanding, and of her spiritual nature. She was borne upon his nature, as a
                  soft, white cloud is borne up and wafted by the whole atmosphere. The cloud fades
                  out and reappears, is absorbed and comes again, is white, or crimson, or golden,
                  according to the pulses of color which beat in the air. Yet Rose, though by
                  charming sympathy thus easily melted into her father's moods, never lost her own
                  individuality, but had a spring and force of selfless which held her to the centre
                  of her own proper and distinct nature.
               Her father's influence had given a full development to that all-sided sympathy,
                  both with society and with nature which never exists without forming a rich and
                  deep life. The result in Rose was, that
                  she derived enjoyment from every side without effort, and almost without
                  consciousness. She sat happily while the shrewish wrens sang, and listened to
                  Agate, to Mother Taft, to Mrs. Polly Marble. She sat under the trees in the edges
                  of the forest, where the shy wood-thrush sang, and with her father talked of
                  questions as unlike familiar life as is that bird's song unlike the sound of
                  familiar field notes. She looked up to Dr. Buell with affectionate awe. His moral
                  philosophy seemed no more discrepant with her father's, because it was different,
                  than one species of flower or tree seemed at variance with others, from which they
                  only differed. But love is the acting force of a woman's life, and love is the
                  organizing center. In some this element is mild, easily susceptible and as strong
                  at the very first as ever afterward. In others it lies deep, inaccessible, capable
                  of transcendent power; but, unreached by ordinary influences, it goes sometimes
                  all through life undeveloped, reserved for a better life.
               Rose was regarded as of an affectionate nature; but in reality, the wealth of her
                  nature lay far below the influence of daily life, and unreached. Great as
                  therefore were the expectations which her nature excited in those fitted to
                  appreciate her gifts, there was a power beneath, should it ever develop, that
                  would surprise even an ardent expectation.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXII.
               TWILIGHT DAWN.
               THE time had come for Barton Cathcart to enter college. He had finished his
                  preparatory studies in a manner peculiarly like himself. His application, without
                  any external flurry or pretence, had been intense. To a real intellectual appetite
                  he added a pride which intensified his endeavors. A difficulty in his studies
                  seemed to him almost like a personal insult. It roused inwardly a fire that could
                  be laid only by victory over it. He put his life against every obstacle. His form
                  had attained its full proportions. He was tall, athletic, nimble as a deer, strong
                  and enduring. Though intense application took something of color from his cheek,
                  the necessity of much out-door exercise had maintained his essential vigor. No one
                  in his class ranked him in any study. No one in the village approached him on the
                  ball ground, or in races. His sedate kindness his honorable spirit, joined to his
                  scholastic ability, made him the pride of the young men, and the whole town hoped,
                  when young Cathcart entered Amherst College, that he might "take the
                  Valedictory."
               It was mid-summer. He had been to Amherst for examination and matriculation, and
                  was now at home, awaiting the opening term. The atmosphere on the day of whose
                  evening we shall speak had been very pure, the sky of a deep and even solemn blue.
                  A peculiar quality of air gave to all objects the utmost clarity. These days are
                  formed by distant storm. Somewhere there had been thunder and mighty rains, but so
                  far away that no other sign of it was perceived but this rare and opaline day.
                  There was in the atmosphere a sadness and tenderness that seemed born of storms
                  overcome. At least so Rachel felt, and so Barton thought, as the sun went down
                  below a horizon without a line or hand's width of cloud-and the moon shone from
                  the opposite quarter.
               The day's work was done. That charm of tender melancholy which comes so often with
                  twilight had stolen over mother and son as they sat in the door, enjoying this
                  silent communion the more because so near the last of such scenes. Rachel
                     remembered how he looked when as a
                  babe he first lay in her arms, as if it were but yesterday. There he sat, a young
                  man! She remembered the eras of his boyhood; single scenes of joy and trouble
                  stood out as if undimmed by days and distance. Her heart swelled with pride and
                  love as she looked upon her son's face, that never looked nobler to her than in
                  this flush of rosy twilight upon the growing moonlight. One whole period of life
                  was closed, sealed, and put away. At her very feet opened another path, along
                  which his manhood was to develop. Her heart prophesied success. He would return to
                  her one day, so wise, and strong, and good, that she should look up to him, and
                  lean her declining strength upon his.
               Alice sat in the parlor, where no lamp was burning, playing melancholy Scotch airs
                  and singing ballads in a low and soft voice. Out in the wheat-field came a
                  whippoorwill, and sat upon a flat rock there, which was yet warm with the day's
                  heat. So near was it that the shrill wail was painful. Barton drove it away. His
                  mother half shuddered. She was not superstitious but yet to drive away a singing
                  bird was almost like driving away joy from her own door. It was but a flitting
                  thought. The bird flew, and in a field more remote tuned again its softer, sadder
                  note.
               "In a few days, Barton, you will go. The place will miss you. You have been a good
                  son, and faithful at work. The blessing pronounced upon obedient children will
                  surely rest upon you."
               "Mother, I shall not be far away. It will not seem like a journey or a
                  voyage."
               "Ah, my son, in separations, though great distances may be more, short ones are
                  never less painful. Absence is the main thing. Every child that goes away leaves
                  one channel less for the heart to flow through, and throws our thoughts back into
                  ourselves."
               "I have a strange feeling, mother. I am glad and sorry both. But now that I am to
                  go, I am impatient to be gone and to be at my work."
               "It is best. Your father's blessing and your mother's heart go with you."
               They sat near the door, holding each other's hands. The evening scene, the song of
                  the whippoorwill, the approaching separation ration, a vague shudder, as there
                  arose for a flitting moment an impression of the great out-rolling future of life
                  an undefined and painful thought of Rose, and now his mother's words, wrought in
                  Barton such an intensity of feeling, that, when Rachel laid her hand upon his
                  raven-black hair, he could no longer contain himself, but leaning his head upon
                  his mother's lap, he wept as if the floods were broken loose. Her tears fell with
                  his. Some words more were spoken of mutual love and need, but they are not for us
                  to record. Not to every angel, even, is it given to know the full meaning and
                  sacredness of a mother's and a son's innermost communion in a love utterly without
                  passion, without color of selfishness, deep as life, and stronger than death!
               The next day came Dr. Wentworth, Rose and her mother, to spend the afternoon and
                  evening. Whatever Barton felt, no one could see by his eye or his manner that
                  Rose's presence was more to him than that of a sister-friend.
               If Barton was susceptible to the contagion of love, this was a dangerous day! Rose
                  was in great spirits. Her love for Alice had never shown itself before in ways so
                  beautiful. She was in sympathy with every one, and with each upon his own plane.
                  Her words were not forced; they changed as gently as do pictures in a
                  looking-glass, when in quick succession one and another passes before it.
               She was more than cordial with Barton. She frankly preferred him, and without a
                  guise or pretence followed him with her eye and foot, just as she would have done
                  her own brother, if he were leaving home in the full expectation of literary
                  honors. Barton, too, felt only pleasure in Rose's company. Could he have said that
                  Rose was to him only like a sister? Yes, he could have said it
                  sincerely. But is every sincere saying of course true? Do we know all that we
                  think we do? Are there not, below what we do know, great depths of
                  truth not yet made plain to us? In things of the heart our knowledge is as a
                  little child lying in a skiff upon the ocean, seeing only the sides of the petty
                  boat but nothing of the great underlying sea that heaves it! Rose believed herself
                  to be only Barton's friend and sister—Rose was right when she thought so. Barton
                  thought himself only Rose's friend and brother. Why, then, were there moments of
                  sharp pain?—flashes of love-pride, that seemed for a second, to lay bare the secret places of his soul, as a long
                  flash of lightning, at night, sharply reveals the whole landscape in unnatural
                  light?
               Rose and Barton stood alone, talking, under the great elms that shaded Cathcart's
                  yard.
               "I am sorry that you leave us, Barton. Norwood will hardly be natural without you.
                  But you will come home often, and I shall make father drive us over to Amherst;
                  for you know that we are all proud of you, Barton."
               Such tribute was peculiarly grateful to pride, and much pride had Barton; and yet,
                  he waited as if Rose had not yet said what he wanted.
               In a low tone as if meditating, and speaking unconsciously, he said:
               "You feel pride, and Alice feels love, for me."
               "Alice does not love you any better than I do," said Rose laying her hand upon
                  Barton's arm in the most frank and familiar manner. "We both of us love you, and
                  every body is proud of you. I wish I felt as sure of my own brothers as I do of
                  you. You will be good and noble, and I think that is being great."
               Her words did not confer pleasure; something was wanting.
               Just then came that same whippoorwill and lit upon the flat stone in the
                  wheat-field, and began his love song, so loud and so near, that besides the clear
                  whistle which alone is heard at a distance, all the undertone of throat music—the
                  sucking of the breath, and a reedy tenor tone—were distinctly audible. Rose stood
                  like one at first surprised, but whose thoughts were being carried away, afar and
                  afar off! Barton's whole soul thrilled. Was it a bird, or a
                  bird-enclosed spirit that came to him last night with his mother, and that came
                  again to-night with Rose? Was there some omen in this coupling with its wild,
                  melancholy song his mother and Rose, as of the two most intimately concerned in
                  his destiny? The song was becoming painful. The stridor of its notes wrought too
                  keenly on his nerves. And when the night-singer ceased, flew away, and began again
                  at a distance, he felt a grateful sense of relief.
               "Rose, that bird has a strange effect upon me. It came last night and sang. It
                  seemed unearthly. What does it seem to you?"
               "It affects me painfully too. It seems to stir the imagination toward the spirit
                  world. It makes familiar things seem strange. Somehow I feel bewildered, as if I
                  was neither in the body nor out. Barton, do you ever feel both happy and unhappy
                  at the same time? Do you ever feel as if you were alone in the world? as if your
                  thoughts took you into regions where no one could go with you and revealed to you
                  things which you could not utter? I often feel so. That bird has started me off
                  tonight. I wish that I were a penetrating spirit, free from the body, and could go
                  everywhere, and find out all things, and move freely as the air does, and as
                  widely as the light! I feel as if something were always hovering near that I never
                  catch. When I look on flowers it seems to me I see every thing but just that
                  secret something which makes them what they are! And when I hear some kinds of
                  music I listen again, certain that under all the sound other sounds more exquisite
                  are surely coming; but they do not come. When I sit in the pine woods voices
                  almost make themselves plain, and I am just going to hear some mystic message;
                  but—it never comes. I believe it is because I am a woman. If I were a man, and
                  could lay hold on the world, and have a business of my own, I am sure I should
                  feel differently, I could find out things; couldn't I, Barton? I am very happy,
                  but I always seem to be waiting for something."
               Poor child! There is an army of waiters in this world. The tears were running down
                  her cheeks, and yet Rose was laughing and looking up to Barton with the most
                  artless simplicity, as if he, like her own father, had the power of solving her
                  problems or changing her moods.
               Barton thought he had never before looked upon any thing so beautiful! He never
                  had.
               The moonlight fell through the openings of the elm upon her face. The slightest
                  breath of wind moving the pliant boughs shifted the light, which now left her head
                  then streamed back upon it; now again left it in twilight, and then suddenly
                  glowed upon it with dazzling beauty.
               Barton seemed inspired with a new spirit. He could never say again that he felt
                  only a brother's love. His hour had come, and every thought and feeling of his
                  nature rose up to tell him that, of all human kind, Rose Wentworth was best
                  beloved! He could never call her sister again. The intensity of his feeling showed
                  everything in a white light. In the exaltation of this sudden transport he learned that the mind may carry on
                  many processes at once. He did not for a moment deceive himself in supposing that
                  Rose had for him any such emotions as now filled his heart. Not for a moment did
                  he purpose to secure her deeper interest in him, by the pleadings of his own
                  feelings. Rose stood before him as something holy, to be won, not by surprise or
                  importunity, but by the free movements of her own nature, or not at all.
               "Can I ever be that which shall draw her to me of her own choice? Till then, for
                  my own sake, and for her sake, I will not speak."
               "Barton," said Rose with the most bewitching simplicity, "what are you thinking
                  of? I know that I should love to hear what you are thinking. Do tell me?"
               "Oh, Rose!—"
               His voice was strained and unnatural. It was like a cry of pain. Rose trembled and
                  drew near a step, and looked upon him almost as if she feared to see some
                  revelation. But in an instant Barton, with an inward effort, said in a more
                  natural tone:
               "Rose, great things have been shown me to-night. Whether I tell you or not, I
                  leave with God, as I leave myself, and my mother, and Alice, and you, Rose, with
                  God! Come, it is dangerous for us to remain here, the air grows damp—let us go
                  in!"
               Dimly and painfully Rose began to perceive the change in Barton and its meaning.
                  The thought that arose in her mind was quick, clear, brief, and then it sank down,
                  down, down below all other thoughts, below all common feelings;—down below her
                  communing with her father,—below her very yearnings;—down where the soul's germs
                  are formed,—as far down as the bottom of the sea, where pearls lie undisturbed by
                  storms, is from the top,—there fell her secret thought, and there it rested.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               A CONFESSION.
               IT was plain to young Cathcart from that hour that his life had found the point on
                  which it would turn. Had he never before suspected the secret? In all his years of
                  familiar intercourse had he never plainly raised the question of the precise
                  nature of his feelings towards Rose? Had there never been moods or happy moments
                  of meeting or of parting at which the secret bore witness of the true state of
                  things?
               Many men are timid of others, and shy of revealing their secret thoughts to
                  another. But there is a form of sensibility springing from a manly pride, which
                  works shyness of one's own self. Men refuse to think on the results of thinking.
                  They dimly perceive what is coming and veil it. Natures capable of suffering from
                  subtle influences guide their thoughts with as much care and skill to shield them
                  and spare them, as they do their bodies in walking through a rocky pass, or a
                  forest filled with thorns and briers.
               But, in young Cathcart's case there was another fact, that his feelings had really
                  not grown to a ripeness for disclosure. Where love is a mere passion, or where it
                  is largely an imaginative sentiment, it is susceptible of sudden development. But
                  when love is a leaven that silently works through the whole economy of mind and
                  soul, and gradually pervades every part of the nature, it cannot be sudden. It
                  cannot even be known, in its incipiency, nor discriminated from common good will,
                  from confidence founded upon respect, from genial sympathy, from mere likeness and
                  unison of feeling. Love is seldom seen in its full and perfect form. For that, it
                  requires a greatness of nature that does not come often; and two natures, both
                  large and various, yet unlike, though not discordant, are still rarer. In ordinary
                  life the affection of love is a mere melody, the music of a single affection. But
                  in its higher form love is many melodies wrought into a harmony. It is a point at
                  which every power and faculty of one's
                  nature comes to a Unity, and the whole being becomes symmetrical and harmonious.
                  An experience so simple in its final form, but so complex in all the elements
                  which lead to it, is not the growth of an hour. If in some natures it springs up
                  in youth, it must yet, like summer flowers, have gone through a development from
                  the seed or root to the blossom of the fruit.
               Barton Cathcart had not reached the fruit, nor even the blossom. He had found out
                  what was the name of that fragrant vine which was twining around his being. But of
                  its unfolding, and of all the clustered experiences that yet lay undisclosed
                  within it, he knew nothing.
               When Rose was going, with her family, to return home, Barton seemed calm and
                  self-possessed outwardly, but within his feelings flowed like fast-rushing waters
                  in moonlight, flashing the soft light from their unquiet surfaces with such
                  abruptness that the moon would hardly know its own light so wild and disordered
                  did it seem! If, in the going to and fro, he was alone with Rose, he avoided her
                  as if her presence brought pain; but, when they came again among the families,
                  Barton clung to her side and sported and frolicked as if they were brother and
                  sister indeed. It was a double instinct. He would not renew with Rose that
                  perilous conversation, and he would not disclose by any change of manner to others
                  that there was in his heart any other feeling toward Rose than that which had
                  always existed between the members of their warmly-attached families.
               And so had begun in pain and struggle, that experience whose real and final nature
                  it is to bring peace. And, in some natures, Love is born of Peace, nourished in
                  tranquillity, and from the first brings forth joy and peace. It knows no struggle,
                  but only gradual development. But in other natures, Love has a controlling work to
                  perform before it may rule in peace. Like a stream born in the mountains, it hides
                  itself among rocks, it is driven over them in foam and fury, it is shut up in dark
                  pools, and steals away through ravines and cliffs, still gathering power but
                  finding no quiet until, far away from its sources, it has fulfilled its course;
                  and then at length, its pure waters, flowing through flower-breeding meadows, rest
                  in deep lakes, where all its agitations are forgotten in deep tranquillity. Not
                  one star that shone upon it all the way down the mountain could it reflect again
                  except in torn and scattered tered beans of light. Now every star of heavier is at
                  home in its bosom.
               When Rose was gone, Barton felt a joy of relief. He was calm. This is the nature
                  of intense excitement which brings the mind to unity. Barton went to his chamber
                  as if nothing had happened. He calmly wondered in his own mind whether he had been
                  greatly stirred-up during the evening; he looked out of the window upon the yard
                  and the near fields which lay white with moonlight, and he marvelled at his own
                  calmness. What had become of his heart? Where were his feelings?
               One cricket, the first that he had beard this summer, was chirping with a shrill
                     cherk—a stridulous monotone, which, in certain moods compares well
                  with our feelings; while in others it grates sharply against the nerve. Was there
                  ever storm in such a hemisphere as this? Were ever these tranquil heavens black
                  with rolling clouds? Were these trees that loom up between light and dark, as if
                  they were spirits, ever twisted and strained by groaning winds? Was his own soul
                  that lay within him as if asleep for very peace, sharply torn, whirled with
                  revolution, agitated by fear of disclosure, but an hour ago?
               He sat leaning his head upon his palm by the window. A bird in the near tree sang
                  in its sleep, and awaked by its own sweet half-strain, suddenly stopped, and left
                  the air still. Then, afar off he heard a dog barking. That started off another,
                  and a peal of answering dogs rolled through the neighborhood. One by one they
                  dropped off, and let the stillness alone. Two men walked past, talking in low
                  tones. It was stiller than ever when they had gone. A sigh of air moved among the
                  trees. It was as if the night had taken a long breath. The leaves quivered, shook
                  off some drops of dew and fell asleep again.
               There is no such lonesomeness as that which the young feel before they have
                  applied their powers in life, and vindicated their place in society. It is
                  dreariness. That feeling began to steal over Barton. For a moment a sentiment of
                  pity for himself began to rise but was suppressed by a sharp reaction of pride.
                  The slight conflict aroused him, and be rose to retire to his bed. Behold! his
                  mother stood by his side! So silently had she entered, and so absorbed had been
                  his thoughts, that he had not heard her footstep. How long she had watched him he
                  knew not. There was at first a quick
                  feeling of discovery. It seemed as if his own thoughts and fancies had been
                  walking forth in visible form, and that his mother must have seen them.
               But Rachel was a prophet. She did not need outward actions or the sound of words,
                  at least to interpret her children's thoughts. She had inward sight. To Barton's
                  sudden interjection, or interrogatory:
               "Mother!"—she made no other answer than to draw him down to his seat. The moon
                  gave light enough to make looks and forms more emphatic than if the light had been
                  clearer. Rachel asked no question, nor made explanation, but spoke as if
                  announcing a result of long conversation in her thoughts.
               "Barton! you are in danger of losing your mother."
               He started, and looked keenly at her as if to see if signs of sickness were on her
                  cheek.
               "I am not going to leave you. But you are leaving me."
               "But, mother, how can I go to college and not leave you? I thought you were
                  glad—-"
               "It is not separation that I fear, but separation of life. A change has come to
                  you. You live in things which you do not speak about. Your life is entering into
                  new paths, where you will need help, and will find none. There is no friend like a
                  mother. Barton, come back to me, and don't leave me!" There was something solemn
                  and inexpressible tender in his mother's tone and manner. It seemed as if all
                  motherhood lay at the door of his heart, begging to come in!
               There is in every royal nature a holy of holies; a shrine within the shrine; a
                  place of silence; the very place of germs, where thought, emotion, and being
                  itself, begin. Into that comes not the most intimate. If any one has seen it, if
                  any foot has trod it, we have banished ourselves and cannot return. There we meet
                  God. There we meet ourselves. There we hide from love itself. But there a mother
                  may come! And the soul is yet its own, though mother and God have looked upon its
                  secrets!
               Barton would have spoken, but his mother stopped him by laying her hand upon his
                  head; and looking full upon his face with an ineffable tenderness, she said:
               "Barton, tell me nothing! Only say that whenever there shall be a great fear,
                  or—or other feeling, when you need to speak, whether it be of good or evil, of
                  victory or trouble, that you will sorely come to the place where you were born;
                  where your head lay in infancy, where you have lived and loved freely until now! I
                  do not need to know your thoughts, nor your purposes. But you may need to tell
                  them. You need your mother. Promise me, that whenever your heart must disburden
                  itself you will come back to me."
               Inexpressibly affected by a manner not usual to his mother, a certain loftiness of
                  authority, and an exquisite tenderness, Barton, like a brook pent up and at length
                  breaking through, poured out his whole heart to his mother, so freely, so fully,
                  so easily that it seemed more as if he were thinking it to himself than disclosing
                  it to another.
               "And as I stood by her, mother, a light seemed to shine out from her, and
                  something not of myself seemed to come upon me with an assurance that I might
                  speak—"
               "I know—I understand it all."
               —"And yet, before I could speak a pain pierced me, a darkness rose inside of me—a
                  horror of fear that I was seeking to sacrifice Rose to my own selfish life—that I
                  had not been called by her—that she stood in one place and I in another, and that
                  we could never change."
               "All these things are plain to me, Barton. God has given you, in part, your
                  mother's nature. I have an insight of melancholy; but you have your father's
                  judgment, and will control it. But now things were like to have been born out of
                  due time. You had almost followed the inspiration of your own heart, and not the
                  openings of Providence. Your business is not this. Neither is her time come. You
                  must bury and hide this love, as seeds are hidden till their spring time comes.
                  Oh, my son, it is a sacred thing to love! Be not ashamed. It is for your life. But
                  let it be as a light burning in a secret place. When God ordains he will bring it
                  forth. Shall he command the dayspring from on high for this poor, sinful world,
                  and not ordain your hours and seasons? Beware of seeking more than you earn. With
                  what will you buy her heart? Rose is many in one. Of till that I ever knew of
                  womankind she is alone. She comes slowly to womanhood because she brings with her
                  so much. How have you gained a right to her? Will you not, like the patriarch,
                  serve your term of years? Will you not,
                  by study and true piety, bring to her by and by a nature that shall command, not
                  supplicate?"
               The candle had burned low. It flamed up and threw an unwanted light upon the
                  chamber. It sunk again and went out. Neither its presence nor its absence was
                  noticed.
               But after midnight a deep sleep was burying Barton's early troubles deeper than
                  the bottom of the sea.
               His mother saw the morning star arise. She had come forth before it.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               THE FAREWELLS.
               THE earlier stages of cerebral excitement quicken the external
                  senses. Objects become more clear, sounds more significant, and,
                  according to the nature of our own feelings, the exterior world is sad or gay. But
                  a higher degree of excitement works toward reason and sentiment and the mind is
                  absorbed in its own creations. Nature grows dim, and passing events seem like the
                  silent passage of dreams.
               For all the next day Barton saw sunlight as if it were moonlight. He was busy in a
                  hundred little things in town and at home, preparatory to his departure. It seemed
                  to him as if he were putting a gulf between himself and his home. It is not alone
                  distance, but the change of relations and of occupations that works a sense of
                  wide separation. It was not a score of miles to Amherst, but it seemed to Barton
                  like putting the Atlantic Ocean between himself and the farm on which he had been
                  reared. The air seemed full of sad farewells. The well whose windlass was so
                  familiar to his hand, the tools with which he had labored, the cattle and their
                  stalls, the old threshing-floor from which his flail had sent mellow sounds
                  through all the neighborhood, particular trees in the orchard, gates and lanes
                  through which he had gone so many hundred times, all of them on the eve of his
                  going away seemed to be parts of his life, and dimly brought back his own
                  history.
               The great elm tree by the gate, where he and Rose had stood, was, and forever
                  after would be, like a consecrated temple. Its choir was all day long singing in
                  its tops, and at half hours Barton found himself under it dreaming and wondering,
                  looking like one who had lost something, or found something, he could not exactly
                  tell which.
               The old farmer neighbors, who respected 'Biah Cathcart, passing on their errands
                  to and from town stopped to make inquiries or to express their interest in the
                  young man.
               Old Cyrus Mills was driving past, on his way to town, and seeing Barton in the front door, pulled up. His
                  horse was always in favor of stopping.
               "Mornin'! So you're goin' to college?"
               "Yes, sir."
               "When?"
               "In a day or two."
               "Take stage?"
               "No, sir—father's wagon."
               The old man was about sixty years old, with small bones and no flesh on them, and
                  for looks, like a weather-stained rye-straw crooked into a sickle or half a
                  hoop.
               "My boy said so. Cost a sight o' money, won't it? S'pose you mean to preach, don't
                  you? Most of 'em do, over to Amherst. My boy's talkin' 'bout eddication too.
                  Shouldn't wonder if Nicholas fetched it one of these days."
               "Nicholas is a smart fellow," said Barton. "He ought to make a good scholar."
               "Middlin'. But not so good, I expect, as his brother would a bin—him that's gone.
                  I've never felt exactly right that I wouldn't let him go to college. He wanted to
                  go awfully, and worried about it a good deal. Mebbe if I'd let him go he wouldn't
                  a strained himself and got into a decline." A juicier man would evidently have
                  shed a tear, but old Cyrus Mills had not a drop of moisture in his body to spare,
                  and so instead he winked nervously half a dozen times and then shut his eyes
                  tight.
               With that he commenced a series of jerks at his horse's mouth, like one ringing a
                  doorbell. Evidently the bell was far down in the animal, for it was only after six
                  or seven pulls, increasing in length and emphasis, that his horse awoke to the
                  consciousness that he was called for, and began to amble along the dust road.
               Barton sat, after dinner, a half hour by the tree, a clump of lilacs hiding him
                  from passers-by. A wagon with two men, going toward town, came to a walk in front
                  of the house, and Barton had the benefit of the men's opinion.
               "Old 'Biah Cathcart's got a snug place—owe any thing?"
               "Not's I knows. 'Taint like him. Likely got money out 'tinerest: 'll need it afore
                  his boy gets through college."
               "Oh, Barton? Yes; I've heerd. Is he one of 'em?"
               "Can't tell what a boy is when he's tied to his mother's apron-strings strings.
                  Barton's good fellow enough, but a proud cuss. It takes these proper fellows to
                  raise the devil when they get their liberty. He'll cut a figure among the
                  gals!"
               "They say he's mighty sweet on—"
               The nag struck into a trot and the last of the sentence was lost. Barton's cheek
                  was scarlet. He felt like springing over the fence, and dealing summary
                  chastisement to such impertinence. That kind of trifling with his name he was not
                  used to, and would not tolerate. Sit down my young friend! If you undertake to
                  call men's thoughts and tongues to account for idle and gossiping talk, you will
                  be like a swallow that undertakes to clear the evening air of all the summer
                  insects that fly in it.
               Toward evening, on his way home from town, Elishe Townsend—familiarly called
                  "Uncle 'Lishe"—stopped for a moment. He drove a big-bellied mare whose colt gave
                  her a world of trouble—wouldn't keep right in her sight—would lag behind—wouldn't
                  answer when she whinnied—would follow horses that it didn't belong to—wouldn't
                  keep the right road, but raced into by-ways and lanes—would canter off like mad at
                  every little whiffet of a dog that chose to run out after it. The poor mare seemed
                  anxious and nervous till the naughty boy of a colt cuddled under her very neck
                  saying, by her manner as plainly as words could have done.
               "Oh, dear, I never shall make any thing out of such a colt as this! It is a
                  dreadful world for colts. Nobody can tell how a mare feels!"
               Uncle 'Lishe himself was simple, sensible, good and merry. But, as every thing has
                  its contrasts, so he carried on the seat by his side a little terrier dog, that
                  didn't laugh, was not merry nor fat, but whose muzzle bristled with a
                  pepper-and-salt-colored beard, sticking straight out every way. Shining down among
                  the hairs were two eyes that looked like two hazel flames. He carried this speck
                  of a dog evidently to punctuate his sentences; for he was the most restless little
                  imp that ever jumped down into the wagon-bottom only for the sake of jumping up
                  again upon the seat. He would start up and put his paws on the back of the seat,
                  to see if any body was behind. Perhaps they were before!—he whirled round to see.
                  If Uncle 'Lishe jerked the reins, he would bark. If the old man saluted any one,
                  every hair on his face seemed to open up to let out the exceedingly sharp bark
                  that he felt it his duty to issue. And
                  when his master stopped to talk for a moment, he always laid one hand on
                  "Dove"—that was his name!—as if he were a pistol, and liable to do
                  damage unless he kept hold of the lock!
               "And so you're goin' to College Barton?" at which Uncle 'Lishe shook his sides
                  with laughing. "Don't, Dove!—there's a good dog. Well, I allers thought so; told
                  your mother them black eyes wouldn't allers hunt squirrels and wood-chucks." At
                  which quaint conceit he shook again, not boisterously, but as a large jar of jelly
                  shakes, when turned out. Dove gave a dive into the wagon, ran between his master's
                  legs, and, looking out fiercely, he sought to balance his master's levity by the
                  fierceness of his hair and eyes and ears all of which in their several ways were
                  working with emphasis.
               "Wal, folks'll miss you, Barton. Old farm'll miss you, guess. Do you s'pose
                  there's room for one o' my boys over there? He's taken to larnin'. His mother
                  thinks we ought to have a minister." Which idea sent trembles of silent laughter
                  all over him, while he looked full at Barton, as if to see whether he really did
                  take in the whole thing that he was saying.
               "You mean Robert, I suppose," said Barton relaxing a little to the mood of the
                  owner of the mare and the dog.
               "Yes, you've guessed it. P'rhaps somebody told you? No great secret though. Been
                  to school for a year steady. Payin' bills all time, and he airnin' nothing. Be
                  still, Dove,—'tain't nothin',—do be still! Raise a boy—expense all the way—larn
                  him how to work—begin to git somethin' out of him—hush, Dove!—then he ups and
                  tells you he wants to go to college. There 'tis! Mother coaxes—what ails you,
                  Dove?—bills agin—all winter—all summer—boy's off—that's the last of him!" Which
                  tragical issue of raising children seemed to Elisha Townsend a perfect comedy.
               "Wal somebody must go to college, you know. May as well be our folks
                  as any body else's. Who knows?" And the jelly vibrated again with tremulous mirth.
                  "Mebbe he'll preach, if he gits converted. Then his mother and I, mebbe, 'll ride
                  over to his parish—see him in the pulpit—folks a lookin' up at him—and he goin' it
                  just like Buell. Won't it pay? Guess 'twill! Anyhow 'll let him try it."
               The nearest approach to a line drawn between the common people and an aristocratic
                  class in New England is that which education furnishes. And there is almost a
                  superstitious reverence for a "college education." If a man has been
                  to college, he has a title. He may be of slender abilities, he may not succeed in
                  his business, but at least he has one claim to respect—he has been to college. It
                  is like a title in a decayed family. It saves the pride and ministers pleasure to
                  the vanity, long after it has in every other respect become utterly useless.
               We suspect that an examination would show that a majority of the graduates of New
                  England colleges were farmers' and mechanics' sons. Sometimes it is the youngest
                  son. But, not unfrequently, it is the first-born; and, in such cases, the reflex
                  influence upon the family itself is striking. A family that has a son in college
                  stands higher in the neighborhood from that hour. Every child in the family feels
                  the influence. The girls must have more schooling; the other boys catch the
                  ambition. We recall an instance where out of seven sons but one escaped the
                  college course and he after preparing for college was stopped by sickness.
               Barton aside from his own striking character found himself looked upon with
                  respect, on all sides, as a young man of promise—the heir of college honors. Every
                  body looked at him in church. Dr. Buell shook bands with him after service, and
                  asked when he would leave, and hoped to hear the best things of him, His father's
                  old friends manifested their interest in him, in their several ways. The boys who
                  had played ball with him on the green, or who had hunted and fished with him, were
                  a little proud that their Barton was going to college!
               Tommy Taft, who was every year more crumpled up with rheumatism—except the wooden
                  leg, in which he declared he never remembered to have had a single twinge of the
                  rheumatics—was particularly triumphant over Barton, and evidently regarded the
                  boy's success as in some manner due to his influence.
               "I knew, boy—I allus know'd how would be. You'll be a spanker yet. If they've got
                  any scholars over there that can run faster than you I should like to see 'em,
                  that's all! Lord, what a ball player! Excuse the swearin' Barton. You ain't a
                  church member, you know. I never swear afore members unless I'm mad, or—or
                     so so. I don't believe there's a man over there that can throw and ketch like you; and as
                  for battin' I never see a ball rise so like a bird and sail off through the air as
                  yourn do. Of course you'll take the honors. You pitch quoits to a p'int, and you
                  can wrestle, side-holt, back-hug, arm's-length, any way, I don't care which; and
                  as for a long pull at a race, I guess your breath wouldn't give out sooner than a
                  blacksmith's belluses. Of course you'll be at the head of 'em all—the hull of 'em.
                  I don't b'lieve there's a chap there that can climb as you can, or straddle a
                  horse, as well, or hold out as heavy a sledge hammer at arm's length, or throw it
                  half as far, for that matter, as you can!"
               Barton could not but smile at Tommy's notions of a student's qualifications. But
                  if old Taft was ignorant of books and college, he was shrewd enough about human
                  nature. He had the art of touching the very marrow of people's thoughts. He would
                  roll up conversation, apparently as a blind, and rattle away, half in humor and
                  half in sheer impudence, with the minister, or the lawyer, or the schoolmaster
                  with any church member of some pretension but before he had done he would contrive
                  to get in a word that went to the quick and lanced some secret tendency, or
                  exposed some weakness which good manners usually salves over, but which Tommy Taft
                  delighted to expose. Toward those whom he adopted into his confidence Tommy was
                  not less acute, but he was careful of wounding.
               "And so, Barton, I'm to be left alone," he began again—"I and the Wentworths," he
                  said, with a sharp glance at Barton, quickly withdrawn. "Well, we'll take care of
                  one another. I'll look after the doctor, and let you know," said Tommy, lifting
                  his great beetling eyebrows with a comical expression. "The fact is—four years,
                  you say? Well, four years is a good while. Great many changes. Folks grow a good
                  deal eh? See new faces. So you may as well hurry along. What you goin' to do then?
                  Not preach, are ye? Should hate to see you stiffen up so, Barton. Good thing—very
                  good thing, when a man's made for it, solid and sober. But it's hard makin' a
                  man-o'-war out of a clipper ship. But I'm no wise consarned. It'll all steer along
                  right. Of course, it may be necessary. I've noticed that a smart young minister is
                  apt to have his pick and choice for marrying. I'd advise you to go to Congress,
                  Barton, or be Governor, or something. But then, if it's necessary for all your
                  purposes to preach, I hadn't no objection."
               And with the last sentence he gave Barton another sharp look that, in spite of
                  himself, brought a little color into his cheek.
               Dr. Wentworth, to whom Barton was much endeared, went aside from his usual habit
                  and gave him some advice.
               "Barton, I am sure of your courses. I shall lose faith in human nature if you do
                  not hold an honorable career. You are more likely to break down in health. You are
                  too fierce in pursuit, desperate in tenacity; and you have about knowledge the
                  same avariciousness which one sees in men in matters of money—an insatiable greed
                  of more, to which money is only like fuel to fire. Remember, that much of
                  knowledge is growth, not accumulation. The life that one is living in, is the book
                  that men more need to know than any other. Never outrun health. A broken-down
                  scholar is like a razor without a handle. The finest edge on the best steel is
                  beholden to the services of homely horn for ability to be useful. Keep an account
                  with your brain. Sleep, food, air, and exercise, are your best friends. Don't
                  cheat them, or cut their company. Don't fall into the vulgar idea that the mind is
                  a warehouse and education a process of stuffing it full of goods. Don't think your
                  mind to be a pick-axe, either, with which a student delves like an Irishman
                  digging for ore. If you must have a figure, call it a sensitive plate, on which
                  nature forms pictures. The more fine the surface and sensitive the quality, the
                  truer and better will be the knowledge. Do not study for ideas alone, but train
                  for condition. Get and keep a healthy brain. Keep it fine. Train it to sharp and
                  accurate impressions. Give it lunge and vigor. Make it like a mirror, before
                  nature, or a daguerrean plate! Barton, don't mope. Be a boy as long as you live.
                  Laugh a good deal. Frolic every day. Keep up high spirits. A low tone of mind is
                  unhealthy. There's food and medicine in nerve. Quantity and quality of nerve mark
                  the distinctions between animals and between men, from the bottom of creation to
                  the top. Now Barton, if you come home with your cheeks sunken, and your eyes
                  staring out of a hollow pit, I will disown you. Good-bye, my dear fellow. God
                  bless you," said the doctor, at the same time taking Barton's hand in both of his
                  and giving him a cordial adieu, which Barton felt with grateful warmth at his
                  heart for weeks after.
               Rose was never more friendly, never more open and sister-like, than when Barton
                  came to say farewell. It was a matter of much anxiety with him. He was not altogether sure
                  whether he had kept his secret from Rose at her visit to his father's house. He
                  thought—he hoped that he had. Rose was so honest and frank that if she had read
                  his heart she surely would in some way have manifested it. If she should be
                  sensitive and uneasy, then he should infer that she had learned the secret of his
                  heart. If she should be restrained and formal, that would indicate an effort to
                  hide her knowledge. If she were excessively gay, and whirled along in conversation
                  with unusual profusion, he should augur ill of that sign.
               But Rose gave him no occasion for anxiety. She saw him at the front gate, and ran
                  out to meet him, as she had always done, throwing back from her face the
                  clustering golden brown curls, and looking into his face at once with frankness
                  and sympathy. Nor did she leave him to begin the conversation.
               "Come, Sir Collegian, you have saved your reputation. I've been thinking about you
                  all day. The first thing when I waked this morning I said to myself, 'I wonder if
                  that ridiculous Barton will think that our visit the other night was good-bye
                  enough? If he does not come and spend a whole evening here he shall not be
                  forgiven.'"
               "And pray, my blooming Rose, what was the penalty that my college sense has so
                  happily enabled me to escape?"
               "Oh Sir Book! I had conjured every influence in nature. I had commanded the birds
                  not to sing to you, the fish not to mind your hook, and all the flowers to flout
                  you. When you would pull a honeysuckle then a bee should have stung you, and when
                  you wanted a rose then a thorn should have pierced you. But all these dire things
                  are happily avoided. Why didn't you bring Alice with you? She is your very
                  blossom, Barton! Aaron's rod without a blossom was but a stick. But with its
                  blossom it was a rod of power and beauty both."
               "Really, my complimentary friend, you must be content tonight with only me, for
                  Alice is doing the last things before the eventful to-morrow, when her knight and
                  champion departs, and she shall sit solitary, an Alice without a Barton! I am sure
                  a blossom without a stem is as badly off as a stick without a blossom! You would
                  think that I was a prince if you saw how daintily I am treated at home! Only
                  father keeps to his old way. He goes on just as regular as ever; treats me as if I
                  were twelve years old; gives me sound sentences and good judgments; holds me up
                  sharply to every thing I say, and asks my reasons. A good professor was lost when
                  our farm got a good farmer I'm thinking."
               Rose was already an accomplished musician, and it had always been Barton's delight
                  to listen to her rendering of music, especially Beethoven's. There are in this
                  incomparable master, the Shakespeare of music, those elements which are sure to
                  win all who have a gone love of nature. As there is hardly a scene in human life
                  for which you shall not find some fit passage in Shakespeare, so there is scarcely
                  a scene or sound in nature for which you may not select a strain in Beethoven
                  which suggests or interprets it.
               Rose played Barton's favorite pieces, and ended with the sweetest and noblest of
                  them all—a portion of Beethoven's fifth symphony, of which, without exaggeration,
                  it may be said were all other music destroyed the germs of all might be found in
                  that, and the kingdom of sound be re-created.
               Then they recalled the many scenes of their childhood; they discoursed in merry
                  mood of the future. Rose was within a year to be gone from home, for one or two
                  years at school. Then, if the Doctor could arrange his business, he proposed to
                  travel with Rose and her mother in Europe, though this might prove a mere
                  day-dream; and by the time that Barton should have completed his college course,
                  Rose would return, a woman full of accomplishments, and wise with a world of
                  foreign sights.
               When Barton had said good-bye and turned his steps homeward, he was sure of two
                  things, the one, that Rose was unconscious of his heart's secret; and the other,
                  that Rose was the star of his life. And, alas! he bitterly felt that she was
                  lifted up so far above him,—was so noble and rich in nature,—so sure to command
                  those far more worthy of her love than he could ever expect to be, that one might
                  almost as well follow a star in hopes of clasping it, as follow Rose through the
                  coming years in expectation of winning her!
               "What then?" said Barton to himself. "It is Rose or no one! Should God please, I
                  shall have a completed life. Should He otherwise ordain, I shall not be the first
                  man who limped through life striving to do his duty. I will be true to my duty whatever comes. I will be a man and
                  accomplish something, so help me God!"
               After Barton had left, Rose repaired to her room. She sat in her window looking
                  upon the checkered ground, where the leaves and the moonlight played at lights and
                  shadows with the daintiest dalliance. Rose was not a sentimental girl, in the
                  ordinary meaning of that phrase. She was not accustomed to weave fancy scenes
                  around her own self and form a centre to imaginary pictures. Her life was so full
                  and active, her whole nature was so rounded and healthy that she found
                  satisfaction in the active use of her faculties day by day.
               While ideality gave to every one of her faculties the quality of aspiration, this
                  tendency was never followed by discontent. Her ideal life was not an escape from
                  an uncomfortable reality. Her real life was full and joyous, and ideality was
                  employed only to deepen and refine it.
               Young, ardent, enthusiastic, sensitive, and sympathetic, it may seem impossible
                  that she should distinctly know that Barton had passed beyond the period of simple
                  friendship without experiencing a profound impression from it.
               Yet so it was. She felt for Barton an undisguised affection. She never remembered
                  the time when she did not. She believed that he was firmly attached to her.
               It would be difficult to analyze the impression made by the revelation of the
                  night of the Elm Tree. A gentle wonder possessed her, a solemn curiosity to know
                  what his feeling was. She had not been wont to dream of love, nor to think of it,
                  in its romantic unfolding. Every day she revelled in the joys and duties of that
                  day. Her heart slumbered—slumbered without dreams. Nothing had yet overshadowed
                  her spirit and spoken from above, in tones which rouse the sleeping soul like a
                  resurrection trumpet. Her time had not come. And so, though she loved Barton, it
                  was not with that commanding love which fuses all the feelings, harmonizes all the
                  faculties, and brings the whole soul under the dominion of one supreme
                  emotion!
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               FRANK ESEL.
               LIKE the sea, which never seems fuller by any amount of rain, nor emptier by any
                  continuance of drought, so a city seems always full, even in summer, and only full
                  in winter. The people whom you know may be gone; and the city may seem socially
                  empty and void but never numerically. The crowd is always there, surging along the
                  streets, coming and going with endless industries. And, yet, if one follows the
                  great line of summer travel he will think that the great cities must have emptied
                  their contents into cars, steamboats, sea-side hotels, mountain-houses, inland
                  mammoth caravansaries at fashionable springs, and even into the very
                  wilderness.
               In general this migrating column is guided by one of two instincts. The one part
                  is seeking a crowd and the other part is seeking to get rid of a crowd. The first
                  seem to have the majority. But it is only in appearance. At a few places, and in
                  great numbers, they attract attention, while the far greater number, dispersed
                  over wide territories, hidden in farm-houses, or secluded country towns, or
                  re-visiting homes, are not easily estimated.
               Commend me to their example who seek out places where daily papers are unknown;
                  where the mail comes but twice a week; where it is so still every day that people
                  have to make a noise on Sunday to distinguish it from week-days; where, if a wagon
                  drives through the town, people come to the door and wonder what has happened.
               Commend me to the wisdom of those notable and excellent People who cool the fever
                  of city life under the great elms that spread their patriarchal arms about
                  solitary farm-houses; who exchange the street for mountain streams, make bargains
                  with the brooks, and cast their cheats for trout rather than for men!
               Yea, let me abide with the artist in fine scenery, or stroll with some learned
                  professor who shall put uncouth names on familiar flowers, and let me know what
                  bug it was that bit me and what bird sung to me. But, above all, let me have the
                  best of all company pany for a
                  thoughtful man—good health within and solitude without. Yet solitude is apt to
                  become exceedingly solitary and lonesome, therefore it should not be long
                  continued. Let rare and ripe friends dwell within reach; for it is solitude that
                  gives zest to society, and goodly company it is that prepares you for the joys of
                  solitude. Alone-ness is to social life what rests are in music. Sounds following
                  silence are always sweetest.
               The other day I got me to a solitary corner, where pine-trees, maples and spruces
                  had league against the sun, and quite expelled him. There, upon a root swelling
                  out above the ground, I sat me down, and, leaning against the trunk, I determined
                  to spy out what things are done in such places. So still was I that insects
                  thought me a tree, and made a highway of my limbs. A robin, whose near nest showed
                  young heads, for a time nervously hopped from branch to branch near me, shrilly
                  questioning my errand. But my placed silence soon smoothed down the feathers on
                  its black head and won its confidence. Then all birds chattered in those short
                  notes which are employed for domestic purposes, and are no more to be confounded
                  with their songs than are men's anthems to be deemed their common conversation.
                  Birds both talk and sing. Nearly an hour I waited, and then came what I waited
                  for—a wood-thrush—and perched his speckled breast right over against me in a near
                  tree. He did not look in one place more than another, and so I knew that he
                  believed himself alone.
               At once he began dressing his feathers. He ran his bill down through his
                  ash-speckled breast, he probed the wings, and combed out the long coverts. He
                  ruffled up his whole plumage and shook it robustly. Then, his solitary toilet
                  completed, he flew into a tree nearer the road where he could look out but not be
                  seen and began his song. It was neither warble nor continuous song but a dainty
                  phrasing, in single syllables, of such sweet and loving thoughts as solitude doth
                  breed in pure and tender natures. And all this have I rehearsed, that I might say
                  that none in life sing so sweetly as they who, like the wood-thrush, sit on the
                  twilight edge of solitude and sing to the men who pass by in the sunlight
                  outside.
               It was this union of seclusion and publicity that made Norwood a place of favorite
                  resort, through the summer, of artists, of languid scholars, and of persons of
                  quiet tastes. There was company pany for all that shunned solitude, and solitude
                  for all that were weary of company. Each house was secluded from its neighbor.
                  Yards and gardens full of trees and shrubbery, the streets lined with venerable
                  trees, gave the town at a little distance the appearance, of having been built in
                  an orchard or a forest-park. A few steps and you could be alone—a few steps too
                  would bring you among crowds. Where else could one watch the gentle conflict
                  between sounds and silence with such dreamy joy?—or make idleness seem so nearly
                  like meditation?—or more nimbly chase the dreams of night with even brighter
                  day-dreams, wondering every day what has become of the day before, and each week
                  where the week has gone and in autumn what has become of the summer, that trod so
                  noiselessly that none knew how swift were its footsteps! The town filled by July,
                  and was not empty again till late October.
               There are but two perfect months in our year—June and October. People from the
                  city usually arrange to miss both. June is the mouth of gorgeous greens; October,
                  the month of all colors. June has the fall beauty of youth; October has the
                  splendor of ripeness. Both of them are out-of-door months. If the year has any
                  thing to tell you, listen now! If these months teach the heart nothing, one may
                  well shut up the book of the year.
               Three years had Barton Cathcart been gone, and had ceased to be missed. Neither
                  the sea or society will keep open its gaps. Waters and men fill every opening. His
                  vacations, year by year, returned him to his friends the same, to the town more
                  and more another man. The brain gives expression to the body. Barton's face had
                  become more thoughtful. His features were more definite. Rose had been gone for
                  the most part during the three years.
               Norwood had never been more cheering than during this third year of Barton's
                  absence. It was overflowing with visitors. They were nested in farm-houses, in
                  boarding-houses, in hotels. Some came for a few days—lounged, fished, and
                  departed. Some came for the season. Children were as plenty as flowers. Picnics
                  were in vogue. Rides and excursions occupied much time. The sober Yankee people
                  looked with a doubting eye upon the waste of so much precious time. But, as the
                  money spent went into their hands, they
                  every year grew more inclined to accept the swarm of idlers as a Providential
                  gift.
               This year came Frank Esel, a young artist. One of his Boston cronies described him
                  thus: "Frank is a pint of brown-stout, with a rich, creamy foam on it; if you will
                  blow off the foam, you will find some drink." This figure must not prejudice Frank
                  Esel's temperance reputation. He was not a bon
                     vivant, and his only intoxication was that of his own excessive good
                  spirits. Of a florid complexion, befitting a sanguine temperament, with brown hair
                  which curled all over his head, blue eyes which were a perpetual invitation to
                  laugh, Frank was the best company possible. Nothing disturbed him. His good
                  spirits foamed and sparkled over checks and obstacles that annoyed other men, as a
                  merry brook turns every impediment into an occasion of bubble and music. His
                  resource of health and hilarity seemed inexhaustible. He was, without a particle
                  of coquetry, a dazzling ladies' man; and, what is more remarkable, Frank, a
                  universal favorite, received with marked partiality and encouraged by generous
                  favor, was not spoiled nor corrupted into puppy conceit. He retained his
                  honest-heartedness and all his disinterestedness and frolic with as little harm
                  from admiration as if he had been a bed of flowers, and did not understand the
                  admiration lavished on him. He played passably well upon the piano, and could sing
                  a serenading song to the guitar that, if the night was bewitching and the
                  listeners romantic, was accounted very well done.
               If one looks out upon New-York harbor, after an eastern storm, he will see it
                  covered with craft, that brood upon its surface in flocks like wild fowl; nor can
                  the eye, at a distance, tell why they hold their places, swinging but a little way
                  with the change tide, facing the wind obstinately and refusing to be blown away.
                  Every one is rooted. The anchor is its root.
               If men are found in life much tempted and yet firm in principle, there is an
                  anchor somewhere. It may be a sweetheart, or a sister or a mother, or a wife, or a
                  father, or some old stanch teacher. Men anchor each other. Frank's anchor was his
                  mother. She was his ideal of all excellence, the sea into which his heart emptied.
                  On the way toward her, his heart like a copious river, might cherish islands, or
                  branch and shoot out into bayous; these were but delays of that stream which set
                  steadily forward to his mother. She was not only his most intimate companion, but
                  he seemed to gather up in his heart all those affections which are usually
                  distributed under the several heads of son, lover, husband. His father had been
                  dead for several years. He was her only child. The first word on entering home was
                  Frank's call, "Mother!" and, like a bird to its mate's call, a gentle rustling, as
                  of a bird flying through leaves, answered. His face was a glow of fond admiration.
                  He praised her, and laughed over her, and flattered her, and danced about her,
                  with an exhilaration of joy that seemed never able to tire itself. His mother was
                  slender, pale, and beautiful. Frank was strong and elastic. He would catch his
                  mother in his arms, and rush with her nimbly, as if she were but a blossoming
                  spray, into the garden to show her some new beauty. Once, a friend, coming on
                  invitation to tea, and to spend the evening, was surprised at seeing Frank dash
                  through the door with his mother in his arms, chiding him all the way with fond
                  protest and proud acquiescence, and set her down at his feet, blushing and a
                  little dishevelled, with the introduction, "Horatio, this is my mother." She, with
                  native grace, extended her hand to her surprised and amused guest, saying: "Excuse
                  my spoilt child, and pardon me—I must have been very delinquent to have brought up
                  such a turbulent fellow;" looking upon him all the while with eyes beaming with
                  love. It was fortunate that her property abundantly sufficed for the wants of
                  both. He had a world of capacities; a talent for music, a talent for poetry, a
                  talent for painting, a talent for landscape-gardening, and for architecture. But
                  like a flower-bed too thickly planted, his talents seemed to smother each other.
                  None of them could get ahead. One talent he lacked, that of making money. But this
                  was compensated by a rare facility of spending it. To be sure he had no bad
                  habits. His tastes were not expensive. He never threw away money. It only
                  disappeared! It oozed out like wine through a wormy stave, drop by drop. It melted
                  in his palm like a snow crystal, which dissolves while you look at it. It rose and
                  departed as the drops of dew in the morning do from grass and leaf. It evaporated
                  as delicate perfumes do, and left no trace behind.
               "What has become of my money? I am sure my pockets have been picked!
                  I have not put my hands in my pocket to-day, mother. Somebody must have done it
                  for me!"
               
               "Really, Frank," would answer his mother, in the most genial and humorous manner,
                  "I think you blame yourself needlessly. I must have forgotten to give you any this
                  morning. I am getting old. I see it by the failure of my memory in such
                  matters."
               "Mother, how wicked you are! You know that I had twenty-five dollars only
                  yesterday, and that I have had no expenses, and that there is not a penny left,
                  and that I am a bankrupt and spendthrift, and that it is never safe to give me
                  money."
               Sure there never was such gentle quarreling before! It was an encounter like two
                  butterflies, that go gracefully whirling round each other in the air. On the
                  whole, Frank's mother seemed so proud of her gay and beautiful boy, that one would
                  be inclined to think that, on the whole, she was glad that he could not keep his
                  funds. When before did the son have all the conscience and heap on himself a
                  wealth of blame and chiding? and the parent defend him and palliate the faults,
                  and justify every infirmity?
               How many young heirs will pray for such a mother, as soon as they have read this!
                  But then they must be such sons!
               It was not money alone that Frank found it difficult to trace. He could as little
                  tell what had become of his time and various labors. Returning home from his
                  studies he would exclaim:
               "Really, it does not seem as if I had accomplished a thing this whole week!"
               And it is but just to him to say that he was usually right in his judgment.
               And yet every body liked Frank. Every body respected him. He was true and sound at
                  heart. He had excellent judgment and fine taste. But that subtle art of continuity
                  and combination was lacking. Bring a case to him, and his counsel would be
                  excellent; but conduct a series of cases from day to day, especially, his own, he
                  could not. He studied life much as butterflies study botany—a little here, a
                  little there, daintily, beautifully, superficially. But his pure fresh
                  enthusiastic love for his mother was the one exception. That never varied nor
                  changed. That was the one constant force of his life, and held him grandly in the
                  orbit of virtuous manhood.
               Well, artists must go into the country in summer, and Frank was an artist. He
                  painted, and therefore must sketch. His mother could not be persuaded to leave
                  home. She was a flower that would not bear transplanting, and must be left to grow
                  where it sprouted. But him she resolutely sent away. His letters should cheer her
                  in his absence.
               "I shall comfort myself in thinking, Frank, how much you are seeing and learning.
                  It will not do for a young fellow to be tied up at home. You must push out into
                  the world some time and you may as well begin now."
               And so it was that he came to Norwood. Some extracts from his letters will give
                  his view of the place and its society.
               "One disadvantage of this place I find to be, that it is too generally beautiful.
                  It serves the purpose of pleasure rather than of study. It seems absurd to come
                  all the way to the Connecticut river to study a clump of grass or to draw an elm
                  tree. The scenery of the valley is charming to the eye, but diffuse and impossible
                  of representation by the pencil. However, I am not confining myself to landscape.
                  I am studying figures. I have several studies of cattle which good judges admire.
                  I have also a capital barn-yard scene—hens, ducks, &c. I have found some most
                  comical people, and have taken lively sketches of them, which I know you will
                  like.
               "Last week I did my drawing with a pole. I drew fish—out of the brook. This I
                  learned from some New York artists. I begin to understand metropolitan art. A
                  brandy-flask, a fishing-rod and a fast nag are the proper furniture! Study? I
                  begin to have new light upon the joys of summer studies! I divide the lists that
                     do study into two classes—those on whom nature works, and those
                  that work on nature. Of the former no doubt there are many, but I have not yet met
                  them. Of the latter we have some precious specimens. There is one big fellow here
                  whom I found sitting before a most charming view, busily at work painting a board
                  fence, with a pig-weed, growing by it, and talking about consciences and painting
                  only "what he sees.' He has been working a week, and several knot-holes are yet to
                  be painted in his fence. I looked over his sketches last night. He has one toad, a
                  clump of plantain leaves, a pile of wood, and a heap of stones. I asked him why he
                  selected such subjects. He said 'that there could be no true success without
                  humility. An artist must paint what he sees. Nothing in nature is to be despised.
                  He should begin at the bottom and work
                  his way up. It is man's arrogance and egotism that lead him to disdain these lower
                  forms of existence. A conscientious artist, if humble, would not select only the
                  garish things of nature, but stoop to her lowliest creatures.'
               "I replied—'Art is not, like science, to investigate and register all natural
                  objects and phenomena. It attempts to work out its end solely by the use of the
                  beautiful, and the artist is to select only such things as are beautiful.' But he
                  would not listen. And so I recommended him to try an ant-hill, next, and if he
                  succeeded to advance to a potato field. I wish I had his patience and self-denial,
                  however. He is very poor, but refuses to paint any thing that will sell, for fear
                  he will sacrifice his art. By and by hunger will drive him to some other
                  work."
               
               "My dearest mother, I am a hero! All the town says so. It is fearful how I am
                  admired and praised! My head is turned with compliments and my heart is gone
                  entirely! Let me tell you: Day before yesterday I was sauntering along the street,
                  when I heard an outcry, Looking down the road I saw a horse dashing wildly toward
                  me, and a young woman, who had entirely lost control of him, sitting in the buggy.
                  She looked like marble for paleness land for perfect stillness. Every one seemed
                  horror-struck. The horse was coming toward me at a fearful rate. To head him off
                  was impossible. To catch him a desperate undertaking. I did not stop to think. My
                  head was like a globe of light. My whole body was a brain. I made toward the horse
                  in such a way that I could grasp at his bridle from the side as he passed. To do
                  this firmly and without mistake was as necessary for my safety as for the lady's.
                  I hardly can tell how I succeeded in doing it. I only know that every step I took
                  I was more and more determined to succeed—I had no sense of danger. I grasped the
                  reins close by the bit, and was at first swung from my feet. But my weight checked
                  a little his speed, and with a desperate effort I flung my left arm about his
                  neck, and with my right arm I blinded his eyes, hanging with my whole weight upon
                  his head. The horse seemed staggered and bewildered. Some one dashed past me and
                  cried, 'Hold on to him a minute!' I could not see what he did, but learned
                  afterward that a man named Hiram Beers had snatched the woman out of the wagon.
                  The horse began to plunge. I heard voices crying out, 'Let him go—let him go!' My
                  strength began to fail me. But just as I felt like giving way, a black fellow came
                  to my rescue, and soon seemed to subdue the horse in a wonderful manner.
               "But a great crowd had gathered about the young woman. Just as I came near she
                  came through the opening people toward me, as beautiful a creature as ever I
                  looked upon—fine full features, golden chestnut hair (you see the artist will
                  stick out). She came straight to me, and said with infinite sweetness and
                  wonderful solemnity—'I thank you, sir, for my life—and my father—' and in uttering
                  that name her heart seemed to give way and she wept like a child.
               "Everybody cried. 'Rose, step right in here, and rest you a minute,' cried one.
                  'Rose, let me help you home,' said another. Everybody knew her but me. Just then
                  came the parish minister, a fine, elderly man, who almost took her up in his arms,
                  and leaning on him, with some little help from me, she reached home. She would not
                  let me go. I was struck with her self-command. Any other girl that I ever saw
                  would have fainted. She seemed solemn, as one just come out of great danger: but
                  neither flurried nor discomposed. Her rather is the chief physician in this
                  region, and universally beloved and looked up to. He has a grand head. I should
                  like to paint it, as I saw it, when he came in. There was a hundred years of love,
                  and gladness, and fear, united in that one look. Every line on his face flashed
                  magnificently. Her mother—a fine woman, too—folded the child in her arms, without
                  a word, and both seemed as if rapt in prayer. The doctor took me with both his
                  hands. 'Hiram has told me of your noble courage. I am your debtor for my whole
                  life. Excuse us all now, but I shall see you to-night, and we must know more of
                  you.' I need not say that I was much touched, and scarcely less when Dr. Buell, as
                  I learned his name to be, in the most tender and earnest manner, laid his hands
                  upon my head, and said, with tears in his eyes, 'The blessings of this whole town,
                  young man, are yours! and may the blessing of the Lord forever abide upon you.' If
                  any body thinks that Yankee people have no hearts, I wish he could have gone back
                  with me to the hotel. At every door-yard stood the people—the women with tears in
                  their eyes—and all of them stepped out to thank me, and shake hands. A white-faced
                     man, scholarly-looking, rather
                  precise and genteel—Judge Bacon they called him—stepped out to me, with a good
                  deal of excitement. 'It was very well done of you, young man; a remarkable thing;
                  very remarkable. It will be a credit to your whole life.'
               "When I got back to the hotel, Hiram Beers was lecturing about me and as soon as
                  he saw me he stepped up:
               "'I want to shake hands with you, young man. I've seen a good deal about hosses in
                  my day, but that was about the darndest thing yet. A hair more or less, and you'd
                  got all you wanted yourself. I giv you up when I saw you puttin' at his head. Says
                  I to myself, there's a curly head gone. But, when you struck him sideways and then
                  quirled your arm over his neck, I saw that you knew what you's about. I never saw
                  any thing cuter. You've done enough for one day, I guess, and you had better go in
                  and git your supper. But when you want a horse to ride, young man, jest call on
                  Hiram Beers.'
               "My darling mother, I wish that you were here. I am never happy but I wish for
                  you. And now, I am sure, you would be very happy. I shall write you every
                  day."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               ROSE WENTWORTH'S ART SCHOOL.
               
                  
                     "NORWOOD, October 10, 1857.
                  
                  "A DISCOVERY, my darling mother!—a discovery! We are related! I don't mean that
                     you and I are. You already have a suspicion of that. But Miss Rose
                     and her mother are our relations! But let me tell it in the order of
                     history.
                  "The next morning after the runaway in which Miss Rose and I figured, I made my
                     call to inquire for her health; and when I left I became very anxious about my
                     own—that is, the health of my heart! The Wentworths live in a grand old
                     mansion, surrounded with grander old trees. I'm going to send you some studies
                     of them. The front yard is ample, and from the gate to the house it is some
                     sixty paces. As I was walking up, looking on one side and the other at the fine
                     flower-border, and up into the tops of the high hanging elms, and half thinking
                     on the proper things to say, Miss Rose herself appeared at the door, and
                     advanced to meet me, with a cordiality as warm as if she had known me as long
                     as you have, and with a fervor of manner which I know not how to describe. I
                     forgot to say that Dr. Wentworth called upon me last night, and spent an hour
                     with me, and learned all about my family connections, so that Miss Rose was
                     spared the awkwardness of inquiring who I was. You used to tell me, mother
                     mine, that boys could not understand how mothers felt. Now, O mother dear!
                     allow me to assure you that mothers cannot imagine how boys feel. For instance,
                     how I felt when a noble woman of perfect self-possession, with a countenance
                     beaming with sympathy, looked me fall in the face with an unwavering look of
                     real gratitude! You know I thought myself rather an accomplished ladies' man;
                     but, upon my word, it seemed to me for about five minutes that I was the girl
                     and she the man. She was perfectly self-possessed and I was confused. Her
                     manner was not that of a school-ma'am, either, nor of a strong-minded woman. It
                     was exquisitely gentle. It was what we call large, in a picture. I
                     don't know—she seemed to me like a candle, in which her body was only a wick, and her spirit,
                     surrounding it, was like the flame;—or like a flower, which is a centre,
                     surrounded by an atmosphere of fragrance. Do you begin to see, mother? If not
                     her, do you see me?—that I am intoxicated,—an idol-worshipper?—altogether given
                     up and gone in love? Don't be alarmed or jealous. I am, as usual, in a trance
                     of admiration, and when the enthusiasm abates a little, I will let you know
                     what my real state is.
                  "It seems that Miss Wentworth is a bold and skilful driver of horses—that she
                     had gone on an errand of charity to a near manufacturing neighborhood, and was
                     returning with this young and high-spirited horse. Just as she entered the
                     village a peddler's cart, full of tin ware and all manner of trumpery, had
                     wandered off and taken its bareboned horse along with it. The animal was
                     feeding, without regard to the convenience of the wagon, and working its way
                     more and more up a very steep bank. Just as Rose came past, the upper wheel
                     mounting a stone, the cart came over bodily, and down toward her came the
                     shining stream of cups, pans, strainers, cullenders, graters, and the whole
                     catalogue of Yankee notions. Her horse was thoroughly scared. Neither her voice
                     nor the reins could manage him. And, as is usual with horses, his fright grew
                     with the very speed at which he fled from danger. She laughed heartily, as she
                     told it—'Never was such an onset made upon flesh and blood before! If my horse
                     had not done it for both of us, I do believe that I should have run away myself
                     from such a clatter and the sight of such a motley mess of kitchen
                     utensils!'
                  "Mrs. Wentworth, you should know, came from Boston, and as we were talking of
                     Cambridge and of you, and your maiden name, she said that she had cousins of
                     the name of Landor, and so we fell to the pursuit of relationship; and at
                     length it turned out that she was your third cousin. I arose and made Miss Rose
                     a low bow, and begged her to accept as a relation her fourth cousin—Frank
                     Esel!
                  "It seems, too, on further talk, that we have many common acquaintances in and
                     around Boston. She spent three years there, partly at Prof. Agassiz' school and
                     partly in the study of music and art. I am charmingly at home, already, in
                     Norwood. I have really a kind of home, for Dr. and Mrs. Wentworth invited me,
                     with the manner of command, to make myself at home with them. And never was the
                     virtue of obedience more comely in my eyes. Blessings forever on the
                     tin-peddler, on runaway horses, and on the heroines that preside over such
                     occasions!"
               
               
               
                  
                     "October 20th.
                  
                  "I am going to school! I have found a real academy of art! Dr. Wentworth knows
                     every thing. He is like the coast of Maine where I stretched last summer—it
                     makes no difference where you come down to the shore, it is deep water at once.
                     You know that I am not very conceited, just as little as will do,
                     and yet be an artist. But it is not in human nature not to put on some slight
                     appearance of knowledge; and, wishing to inspire respect in Miss Rose for my
                     abilities, I thought I could surely venture in my own department!
                  "I don't know how she did it, but in an hour I felt as though I were a born
                     fool. Miss Rose has the kindest heart and the most truthful tongue that I ever
                     met! She is tender of every body's feelings; yet no one can be long with her
                     and not see every thing in clearer light, in higher relations, with a more
                     minute accuracy; and this advancement in one's own perceptions works in him the
                     sense of his own inferiority. When I am alone, Nature seems to me a vast
                     congeries of wonderful things. But when I am with Miss Rose, Nature rises
                     before me in new aspects—it has a unity, a meaning, a fruitfulness of sentiment
                     that I never dreamed of. Does she sharpen my wits? Or is it that she suggests
                     new ideas? I don't know; probably both. She knows every plant that grows in
                     this region in the same easy and natural way that she knows all her neighbors.
                     She can tell me the floral calendar of every month. She knows the structure of
                     plants,—vegetable physiology, of course; but, in her way of conceiving things,
                     plants have a domestic life,—and I find myself, insensibly, under her
                     influence, regarding these groups of plants as having a sort of semi-human
                     life. Miss Rose speaks of the dispositions of various plants and of their
                     private habits very much in the same way that one would of one's neighbors. I
                     believe that she is as familiar with birds, insects, and animals as she is with
                     the vegetable kingdom.
                  She made a remark, yesterday, that struck me.
                  "'What it was worth while for God to create, and what He thinks of importance enough to continue from
                     generation to generation, ought to seem to intelligent persons of sufficient
                     importance for them to study.'
                  "At another time she said:
                  "'I hear people call this natural world "God's Book of Nature"—which means I
                     suppose, the Bible of Nature; and yet they leave the greatest part of it
                     unread. What would be thought of a Christian who should leave four-fifths of
                     the other book of God unread, unlocked at?'
                  I have ridden on horseback twice with Miss Rose and a party of several others;
                     have been at two picnics, one fishing excursion, and at one sailing party—if
                     that can be so called where we rowed all the way and never lifted a sail. She
                     was the life of the party. No one can be dull where she is. She has much humor
                     and an exuberance of spirits, without the slightest turbulence or frivolity.
                     Her lightest words and merriest have depth in them. They are like the wrinkles
                     of wind and flashes of light that run along the surface of deep water; and yet
                     she seems to enjoy in others the utmost gayety and even that frivolity which
                     high spirits are apt to produce. By the way, Miss Rose rode the very horse
                     whose running away brought me to so much happiness. Good courage, that!"
               
               
               
                  
                     "October 21st.
                  
                  "Your letter of the 19th is now in my hand. Is it not a real mother's letter?
                     Is it not my mother's letter, such as nobody else in the world could write!
                     But, sober mother, I have misled you in my whirling enthusiasm for Miss
                     Wentworth. When will you learn that your boy is an enthusiast—foams first and
                     settles afterwards? The first week after I met the goddess I was like a great
                     stream rushing through a narrow passage, and so, as you may imagine, I was
                     thoroughly tumbled. But I am spread out in the meadows now, and am running very
                     tranquil.
                  "Why, O loving inquisitor! Rose Wentworth is no more for me than is the Queen
                     of England! I should as soon try to buy the Koh-i-noor, to wear in my bosom. I
                     have not taken leave of my senses. I admire her more than any human being that
                     ever threw light on my path; but love is another thing.
                  "By the way, I had a comical time a few nights ago. An odd creature, Tommy Taft
                     by name, was standing at the doctor's yard-gate as I came out. He has a
                     striking face, and very singular manner; both jolly and rude, and yet not
                     altogether unpleasing.
                  "'Good evening, sir. Is Miss Rose at home?'
                  "'She is,' I replied.
                  "'Do you know whether she's going to Boston soon?'
                  "'I do not. I am not apprised of Miss Rose's future intentions.'
                  "'P'raps the young cap'n's a relative of the family?'
                  "I was a little vexed with his manner even more than with his direct questions,
                     which fact he saw before I could speak.
                  "'Massy on us, how quick young folks take fire now-a-days! Hope an old fellow
                     that's known the family ever since there was a baby in it, can ask a civil
                     question about it. P'raps you don't want questions asked? Well, shouldn't
                     wonder!'
                  "'Who are you,' said I, peevishly, 'that you stop me here—' My sentence was cut
                     short by the arrival of Dr. Wentworth, who familiarly addressed this queer
                     jumble of wood and flesh. 'Why, Tommy, you're better of your rheumatism? Glad
                     to see you getting about—but you must take care of this night air. Come in.
                     Rose has something for Mother Taft. She was going over presently with it.'
                  "'That's jest the reason I shan't go in, doctor! And if you think it'll fetch
                     her over, you may tell her that Mother Taft is poorly, and that she can't bring
                     nothin' into that house that'll do her half so much good as her own face. Have
                     ye heerd any thing from Barton Cathcart lately, doctor? How's he gittin' along?
                     They tell me he beats the bull class, and is the fust man there. Only one year
                     more, and then he'll be home; and, to tell the truth, Doctor, I'd give more to
                     see him in Norwood once more than all the scrumptious city folks in the
                     land!"
                  "The doctor laughed, bid Tommy go home, and passed in. 'Who is
                     this Cathcart, I wonder?' I said to myself. The next afternoon Miss Rose was
                     sitting in the morning-glory nook, as it is called, or rather she was setting
                     before it, and working upon a picture of it. She has in her portfolio the
                     sketches of all the favorite points about home,—Honey-suckle Bower; The
                     Green-house in Winter; The Elm Tree; Evergreen Twilight, and a dozen others. For though the doctor's grounds and
                     garden seem, in a general view, much like any other gentleman's highly kept
                     grounds, yet I have learned from Miss Rose that each part has something
                     distinctive in it. The doctor fancies that there are certain analogies between
                     plants and thoughts or sentiments, and his whole ground is arranged upon some
                     basis of mental philosophy, which Miss Rose promises that her father shall
                     unfold to me.
                  "I am sure I never saw such a collection of Ipomeas and Convolvoluses before,
                     and though this evening they were shut up, all except the Bona nox, which opens at evening, and closes in the
                     morning, she found enough to do with her pencil upon the leaves and vines. 'In
                     the morning the blossoms, and at evening the foliage,' said she. 'Of all
                     flowers, this is, perhaps, the most remarkable in sentiment—of all that grow in
                     our climate, at any rate.'
                  "'What sentiment do you suppose a flower to have, 'Miss Rose?' said I, more to
                     hear what she would say than to criticise her remark.
                  "The sentiment which it naturally inspires in him that looks on it. What do you
                     think of when you look upon a trellis of morning-glories in full blossom?' 'Why
                     I should think they were glorious!' 'Is that all? and you an artist?' 'Why
                     should an artist see any more than any body else that has good eyes?'
                  "Then why is he an artist at all? No man has any call to an artist life unless
                     God has enabled him to see in nature what it is not given to common eyes to
                     see.'
                  "'But a man cannot see what is not to be seen.'
                  "'That's a blind man's reason for not being a guide to others.'
                  "'But what do you see, Miss Rose, that I do not?'
                  "'Perhaps nothing. I am not an artist. You are. Many think they are artists
                     because they have facility in copying what they see. But this is as if a man
                     should copy a Spanish poem in beautiful handwriting, without understanding a
                     word of the language, and then call himself a poet!'
                  "I felt the color come in my face. A man does not like to be held up between
                     the finger and thumb, as if he were a butterfly, not even if the operator is a
                     beautiful girl, and her face full of quiet roguery, and her manner ever so
                     gentle.
                  "I certainly did not intend rudeness in my reply, though I committed it. It
                     seemed for the moment as if Miss Rose had pointed her remarks to me personally
                     and disparagingly, though a moment's reflection might have satisfied me that,
                     having never seen any thing of mine beyond the merest sketch, she could not
                     have intended a criticism. But, for the instant, I drew back from the subject,
                     and just then my last night's scene with Tommy Taft occurring to me, I inquired
                     somewhat abruptly—'Miss Rose, who is Barton Cathcart?'
                  "The moment I had said it I felt that it looked like a hidden question designed
                     to surprise her confidence. If it had been, it would have failed of its aim.
                     She certainly looked surprised, but neither angry nor annoyed. I hastened to
                     relate the scene of the night before with Tommy Taft, which amused her not a
                     little. I added:
                  "'He watched me, very much as a dog hangs round a suspicious character,
                     determined to know what he has come for.'
                  "Miss Rose was even more amused at Tommy Taft's supposed vigilance. She went on
                     painting; a touch here, a laugh, another touch, another laugh. Then I thought a
                     certain sadness fell upon her face. It was but a transient shadow. She turned
                     to me, frankly, and said:
                  "'I could wish that you knew Barton Cathcart, and if you will return next
                     summer, you shall, for he will have graduated then, and will be at home, I
                     presume. You could not but like him. He has been my familiar friend from
                     childhood—a brother, almost as much as my own brothers—till he left for
                     college. He has grown much since then, in every way, though I have seen him but
                     a little. He is one of those deep natures that it is worth your while to have
                     for a friend,—a deep well, that never dries.'
                  "'Is he good looking?'
                  "'Every body is handsome whom you love and respect. But Barton does not need
                     any such gloss. His figure is fine and his countenance noble.'
                  "'Does he talk well?'
                  "'Father says that the best talkers are those who know how to be silent. Barton
                     listens more than he speaks, but when he does speak, one is never tired of
                     hearing him.'
                  "'Your description is relishful. Pray tell him that I am coming again next
                     summer and on purpose to make his acquaintance.'
                  "'He is a true husbandman. His friendship does not reap alone. It sows as well. You are always the
                     richer for his company.'
                  "'I rather dread these "improving" people—these good folks that go round
                     building every body up. I have an aunt Shillingby, one of the kindest hearts
                     alive, but wherever she goes she is bent upon "doing good," and she moralizes
                     and talks and advises and questions, and incessantly races with her tongue,
                     till I feel as if I had been travelling on a dusty road. I want a brush and
                     towel to get down to my own flesh again.'
                  "'Expect no lectures from Barton Cathcart. But he has a vital nature,
                     peculiarly stimulating, but in no wise demonstrative or noisy. The sun is no
                     mechanic because it builds up all the world's growths. The winds are not
                     engineers because they urge ships and mills. A man may stimulate your whole
                     nature without officious or garrulous habits.'
                  After a moment's pause Miss Rose turned to me and said:
                  "'Cousin Frank'—she had never called me so before—'you must excuse my
                     enthusiasm about Barton. We grew up like brother and sister, although very
                     differently situated in life. He came by his noble nature both from his father
                     and his mother. Barton is a world too sensitive for his own good, capable of
                     being a hero, and quite as capable of becoming a fanatic.'
                  "'A fanatic, Miss Rose? And is a nature that has the fanatical element in it
                     capable of heroism?'
                  "'He has the heroic element because he is strong, patient, capable of suffering
                     without complaint, and because on occasion he would give everything in the
                     world, his life itself, for that which he loved or for whatever he considered
                     just and right. As to fanaticism, father says that it is the fermentation of
                     strong natures, who, not having outlet for their feelings, grow inwardly, until
                     they mistake their own feelings and thoughts for outward realities. I can
                     easily imagine circumstances in which Barton would see the whole world in the
                     dolor of his own heart.'
                  "I do not know why I should dislike what Miss Rose said of Cathcart—I do not.
                     Yet, for some reason, I did not take a fancy to him. Perhaps I shall when I see
                     him.
                  "I returned to the subject of Art:
                  "'Miss Rose, you were speaking a little while ago of that which gave a man the
                     right to call himself an artist.'
                  "'I suppose being an artist gives the right to the name. My
                     father, you must understand, is my instructor in all my philosophy. My opinions
                     are a pale reflection of his. He divides men of your calling into two
                     classes—decorators and artists; and artists again into those that please and
                     those that teach. The former paint for the senses and not for the soul. They
                     are copyists of nature in her more material aspects. They have no soul behind
                     their eyes. They see only matter, not mind, in nature. An artist ought to see
                     grace, beauty, tenderness, and subtle fancies in nature which common eyes fail
                     to see; and when he reproduces an object it should seem more attractive to
                     common eyes than the original is, because the artist has expressed in color
                     something more than others would have seen. Father says that it is the amount
                     of one's self in a picture that determines whether it is made by an artist or
                     an artisan.'
                  "'Bravo bravo! You shall give lectures to convince ninety-nine in every hundred
                     artists that they have no vocation! With such views as these before my mind, I
                     shall never try my pencil again. What! Frank Esel going about to express in his
                     picture what Nature did not express! Never shall a young gentleman so humble as
                     I am be so presumptuous! I shall burn my brushes!'
                  "'It may be all well for you to burn your brushes, but not for such reasons. I
                     do not say that Nature does not express all and more than Art will ever
                     represent; but one part of her truth Nature expresses to the senses, find
                     another and far higher, through the senses she expresses to the soul. It is
                     this second and higher kind of beauty and truth that an artist should bring
                     forth and throw visibly upon his work. But I think your raillery is right. Pray
                     excuse me for my lecture; but, if it had been my father, Mr. Artist, you would
                     have gathered more ideas.'
                  "'And less pleasure.'
                  "'Though he would not have let you off in so short a time.'
                  "'Its brevity is the only fault of your discourse.'
                  "'But there come the girls! No, you must not go. We three young ladies have no
                     beau to-night but you, and you must not deny your services. Miss Laura Bacon
                     and Alice Cathcart come with their parents to an informal tea; and, as every
                     well-arranged table is twice set—for the eyes as well as for the palate,—we
                     shall draw upon your skill for help, Sir Artist!'
                  
                  "I could not but admire the grace of her carriage. You know how much I
                     criticize the careless and slovenly way in which young ladies are permitted to
                     carry themselves. If one had to choose between a fine and graceful carriage of
                     one's person, and beauty of face, I think ladies would consult their interest
                     by choosing the former. Miss Rose is a splendid walker. Her body moves as if it
                     were floated in the air rather than propelled from the ground. Yet you feel
                     that there is an elastic tread and a firm hold upon the ground. I have never
                     seen her move nervously or indeed, in any haste. She expresses deliberation,
                     but suggests nimbleness.
                  "We went to the house. The tea-table was already spread. I was sent to collect
                     leaves, with special instructions,—both green leaves and colored ones,
                     oak-leaves, chestnut-leaves, hickory, and liquidamber—the most star-like of all
                     leaves. Of colored leaves—maple, yellow and scarlet, the crimson of the
                        Nyssa, and that glowing and brilliant
                     thing—the sumach-leaf.
                  "While I was gone, came Judge Bacon and his slightly stately wife; 'Biah
                     Cathcart and his dark-eyed wife; Dr. Buell and his feeble wife; old Mr. Edwards
                     and his sister. Every one seemed at home; all went where they pleased, did as
                     they pleased. But artist I was learning of Miss Rose how to adorn a table with
                     materials so common as to be within every one's reach, and which, in the end,
                     were so effective that I am sure I never saw table more charming in my
                     life.
                  "Green leaves were first pinned together by their own stems into a plat, and
                     then made into circular mats—the points of the leaves
                     well-advanced; and upon each one of these green mats rested a pure white china
                     plate. Thus oak-leaves, hickory-leaves, maple and liquidamber alternating,
                     seemed sprouting from beneath every dish. A bowl had been arranged with
                     selected grasses, and the butter-dish set in it in such a manner that the
                     golden butter was fringed with the grasses from which it came. For the honey,
                     which was snow-white and taken from the doctor's own hives, Miss Rose had
                     herself collected white clover-blossoms, and arranged them upon a green base of
                     red-clover leaves, so that the dainty comb seemed to rise up out of the very
                     flowers which had yielded it.
                  "The large silver waiter which contained the tea-things rested upon a broad
                     ruffle of colored leaves—yellow and scarlet maple-leaves leaves, golden-colored
                     hickory-leaves, deep purplish leaves of the sweet-gum; and they were so
                     arranged that the highest point of color was at each end, and a gradation of
                     color tending all the way back to green, terminated, in the front, in a real
                     summer-green tuft of leaves. I was never more struck with the effects which can
                     be produced by a skilful use of mere foliage without flowers and I never before
                     felt how coarse are the heaps and stacks of flowers which are piled upon
                     decorated tables in comparison with this delicate and almost flowerless use of
                     leaves. It was inexpensive beauty, requiring but a few moments to prepare it,
                     and tending to connect social enjoyment with natural objects in a manner that
                     is characteristic of this whole household.
                  "While I was busy with the young ladies,—Miss Rose I have described,—Miss Alice
                     Cathcart, a dark-haired beauty, something shy and silent,—Miss Mary Bacon, a
                     blonde, tall, slender, glittering, but sharp, positive and selfish,—the latter
                     quality, however carried like a sword, in a scabbard of politeness;—while, I
                     say, I was tearing myself away from the gentlemen and devoting myself
                     disinterestedly to these three young ladies, the gentlemen were sitting under
                     the great elm conversing. This is a wonderful tree. It is the doctor's temple.
                     Probably no tree in the State has heard as much discourse as this one. It was a
                     glorious sunset. The air was calm. The whole atmosphere was suffused with a
                     vaporous golden right. It was a translucent flood, and its waves rolled upward
                     to the very zenith. A strange glow fell upon all the village. Trees and houses
                     seemed glorified, and were transfigured. At its height, so marked had this
                     become, that people were calling to each other to come out and see the sunset.
                     We all went forth. Miss Rose shaded her eyes and looked with a solemn rapture
                     full at the sun, now tempered in the peculiar atmosphere to a mildness
                     tolerable to the eye. Miss Alice sat as if she were fallen into a trance. Miss
                     Bacon treated nature in an obliging way, as if she felt it proper to recognize
                     the very polite and agreeable manner in which the sun was taking leave.
                  "I am strangely affected by Miss Rose, as by no other person in the world! I am
                     drawn to her irresistibly. She is good, she is true, she is simple, she is
                     beautiful, and yet this fascination is not love! She sobers me. I do not feel
                     the exhilaration in her presence that I do with others. Life seems deeper;
                     nature more solemn. She has power to
                     stir my soul even if she does not influence my heart!
                  "As twilight came on the gentlemen were summoned to tea. This old mansion seems
                     made for hospitality. The very air in it seems to whisper to every one, Be
                     happy. Except my own darling mother, never was so motherly a woman as Mrs.
                     Wentworth. She is always genial, often gay and sometimes brilliant. But in
                     every mood a serene kindness beams from her face. Mother, the expression of
                     kindness in a rich nature is even more beautiful than any expression of
                     intellect! I have put in my note-book: 'Beauty is of the disposition. Love is
                     the type of perfect beauty.'
                  "Every one did what pleased him. No one was pursued with teasing politeness. I
                     wish I could repeat the half of what was said during the evening; but it could
                     not be done. But I have jotted down in my note-book many things that an artist
                     should remember and investigate.
                  "The autumn is growing more gorgeous. Every day is perfect, and yet the next
                     seems better! And every day has a secret joy, to me more dear than all the
                     colors of the trees express, that my pleasant vacation will so soon end in a
                     yet more pleasant coming home! But I can never measure the unexpected benefit
                     of this visit. I am sobered. A new thought of life is born in me. Should I
                     persevere in the pursuit of art, it will be with a better insight of its
                     meanings; and if I abandon it, it will be from despair of reaching what I can
                     perceive to be a true artist's aim. My heart beats quicker to think how soon I
                     shall see you. And yet,—well, good-bye, and scarcely expect to hear from me
                     till you take it from my very lips!"
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               A TALK ABOUT ENJOYING MONEY.
               WHILE Frank Esel and the young ladies were pleasantly preparing for tea, there
                  were sitting, or lying on the ground, under the great elm, Parson Buell, Judge
                  Bacon, Mr. Edwards, and an eccentric merchant and manufacturer, Mr. Brett by name,
                  whose whole life was pragmatically benevolent, and whose conscience was always
                  flying at him and teasing him for not being more. benevolent.
               Judge Bacon opened upon Mr. Brett.
               "Brett, have you noticed Dr. Wentworth's conservatory? I wonder you do not add one
                  to your house. I am sure you spend too much money on benevolence. You owe a little
                  now and then to selfishness. Why, my dear fellow, you live as if you thought it to
                  be your first duty not to enjoy the wealth which a kind Providence has sent
                  you."
               Mr. Brett was a nervous man and talked all over when he became interested.
               "Why, Judge, I should think it was Mrs. Brett talking if I did not see your face.
                  She troubles me day by day. But, really, I am not conscience free in the matter.
                  I—I—do not dare spend on myself while there is so much to be done with money,—so
                  many poor; so many ignorant; so many tenements to be built and families to be
                  regarded, and factory children to be educated; and, besides so much to be done for
                  the world abroad!"
               "Mark the perfect man! Hear him talk! Why, sir, if you send missionaries to South
                  Africa, it is only, fair that you should receive the Cape-bulbs in return; if you
                  send Bibles to South America, why not receive orchids in exchange? We have more
                  Bibles than we can use, and they have more plants. A fair and legitimate commerce.
                  Thus we export missionaries and import roses, and both parties exchange
                  superfluities for objects of value."
               "Come, come Judge Bacon," said Parson Buell with a grave smile, for Brett was
                  looking woefully puzzled at the judge's way of putting duty, "I wish we had more men that were
                  unjust to selfishness, as you say brother Brett is."
               "But, then, Reverend Sir," said Bacon in a comical, mocking tone, "do you not
                  think that he sought to have a conscience in the matter of making benevolence
                  appear pinching and frugal to unloveliness? One reason why I don't become rich is
                  the fear that I shall live as austerely as brother Brett does. One might just as
                  well be poor, as to be rich and spend all his money in giving it away. Do you
                  really think, Brett, that you would cheat a single heathen out of a fair chance,
                  if you were to put up a green-house, hire a gardener, and live in a little more
                  luxurious way?"
               "You have touched the very point," said Brett—"luxury. I'm sure that
                  it is my duty to provide my family with the necessaries of life; but luxuries I am
                  not so clear about. I never feel happy when I am persuaded to obtain them. I have
                  my scruples whether a Christian may, in the present state of the world, indulge in
                  luxuries."
               "Is that so?" replied the teasing judge, affecting a manner of great concern. "Is
                  that so my dear Ascetic? You must give me leave to say that I think you, sir,
                  already on the side of self-indulgence. Calf-skin boots, upon my word! A beaver
                  hat! when a felt one would equally well, shield your head, at but a quarter the
                  expense! And that glaring violation of economy, a broadcloth coat, instead of
                  linsey-woolsey! Why, Sir, I think there must be a year's schooling on your person
                  for some poor vagabond, and yet you are talking about your conscience!"
               "For all that," said Mr. Brett who smiled rather faintly, as if he was not
                  altogether sure but that it might be his duty to retrench his personal
                  expenses,—"for all that, I am in doubt of going any further. Have I a right to put
                  so much money into a greenhouse, and to be at the annual expense required for a
                  gardener, when down at the factories there is so much to be done among the
                  workmen, for schools, and clothing, and libraries?"
               "That's a fair question," said Buell, "and I should like to hear your opinion,
                  gentlemen. I confess that I am puzzled more by the practical application of it
                  than by the principle itself. I I have no doubt of a Christian man's liberty to
                  use his wealth for his own household, but how far, by what rule, to limit it I do
                  not clearly see."
               Judge Bacon, who had the art of being elegant in negligence, was lying upon his
                  side on the ground, with his head resting on his left hand, while with the other
                  he was playing nature, as he styled it, to a worm. Laying down a stick in its way,
                  the worm mounted it.
               "Now," said he, "here is my man, this stick is natural law; if I turn it so he
                  creeps north; if so, east; if so, south; so that while he thinks that he is
                  creeping in the line of the stick, he is veering to the four points of the
                  compass."
               "No matter about your worm, learned judge, solve the minister's practical
                  problem," said Cathcart.
               "Oh, gentlemen, that I might be troubled, as Brett is, by wealth that I don't know
                  how to use! Brett, exchange with me! Give me your factories, stores, and sinful
                  bonds and deposits, and do you take my library and penurious clients, and it will
                  refresh you much to solve new questions of finance, with which I am already
                  familiar."
               The ex-schoolmaster brought back the question, saying that he thought no matter
                  more important than to furnish some clue by which a Christian man might determine
                  where Rights ended and Duty began, in the use of wealth.
               "Not a lawful distinction," said the judge; "all his rights are duties, and all
                  his duties are rights."
               "Well, what are both put together? How much may a man use for his own household
                  and self; now largely may he lay out his estate, and convert it to mere beauty
                  instead of use? How largely may he store his dwelling with art-treasures, and
                  spread a sumptuous table; and yet, say, 'None of us liveth unto him self?'"
               Dr. Wentworth, who had listened as if he heard not, now began to stir, as if he
                  were about to emerge from his abstractions.
               "My dear Doctor," said the judge, "don't start off with your speech yet. You see,
                  gentlemen, he has been firing up for some time, and there will be no more chance
                  for us if he once begins! What the world of letters lost, Wentworth, when you
                  chose medicine! We have lost a Burke and got only Dr. Wentworth! Let me deal with
                  Brett, whose conscience is like a spider on the window, always spinning webs to
                  keep out the light. I think a man has at least the natural rights of the animal
                  kingdom. If an eagle has a right to all
                  the feathers that can fairly grow on his body, and a sheep to all the wool that
                  can grow on his skin, and a butterfly to all the colors on his wings, and a bird
                  to all the music he can make, a man has a right to what property he honestly
                  accumulates."
               "Tut, tut," said Mr. Edwards, "you don't half know your lesson. Eagles shed their
                  feathers, and keep young by moulting. Sheep are sheared for their own comfort and
                  every body's convenience; and birds sing for all the town, as well as for
                  themselves; while the butterfly, that piece of painted uselessness, comes late and
                  goes early, as if Nature had no use for things that did not contribute to others'
                  good. So, Judge, you must go to the foot of your class."
               "I am dumb, Mr. Schoolmaster. Now let the doctor speak. I am sure it is not safe
                  for him or us to restrain him longer."
               Notwithstanding Judge Bacon's banter, the doctor seemed in no hurry to express his
                  mind, being apparently absorbed with a favorite little dog, whose vivacity and
                  vitality seemed inexhaustible.
               "Why should the doctor leave his companion for our poor society?" said Bacon.
               "That petty shag of a dog which he amiably teases is not to be left unblessed and
                  solitary! Benevolence will still find ways of conferring happiness! That dog runs
                  like an eight-day clock—does he ever need winding-up, Doctor?"
               "I think, gentlemen, the matter in hand is far less difficult," said Wentworth,
                  "than it is made to seem."
               "The subject that is in your hand, doctor?" said the teasing
                  judge.
               "No mistake can be greater than for one to speak of his, family," said Dr.
                  Wentworth, "as of something separate from the community in which he lives. A
                  family bears to the community the relation which limbs and organs do to the human
                  body. What if a man should have serious scruples whether he should bestow food
                  upon the stomach instead of the whole body! The family is the digesting organ of
                  the body politic. The very way to feed the community is to feed the family. This
                  is the point of contact for each man with the society in which he lives. Through
                  the family, chiefly, we are to act upon society. Money contributed there is
                  contributed to the whole. To be sure, this is not to exclude other benefactions;
                  but, when you have built churches, schools and libraries, established public
                  charities, all of which are very noble and necessary, it remains true that the
                  best gift which one can offer to the state is the living gift of virtuous,
                  intelligent and enterprising children!
               "Nothing is more remote from selfishness than generous expenditure in building up
                  a home, and enriching it with all that shall make it beautiful without and lovely
                  within. A man who builds a noble house does it for the whole neighborhood, not for
                  himself alone. He who surrounds his children with books, refines their thoughts by
                  early familiarity with art, is training them for the State. In no other way could
                  he spend so much money so usefully for the State. He that actually rears good
                  citizens presents to the State better properties, far nobler, than ample funds or
                  costly buildings.
               "A man may, of course, be selfish in family expenditure, but all such outlay
                  corrupts the family. No expense can be had which really benefits the family, that,
                  through them, does not even more benefit the whole community.
               "Why, gentlemen, I settled that question with this elm-tree long ago. I had heard
                  it sighing for some days, and in the night it lay awake creaking and groaning; and
                  so one day, as I sat under it it stooped one of its long branches near my ear and
                  made me its confidant and confessor. It seems the tree had fallen into a moral
                  difficulty. 'Here am I, with my huge bulk, occupying space that might serve for
                  scores of trees; and, when the sun shines, I take its whole glory on my head, and
                  nothing below can get a fair share, and my roots are drinking out of the ground an
                  enormous supply of food and moisture, and I am under condemnation for this great
                  selfishness of my life.' I comforted the arborescent penitent the best way I
                  could. 'Every thing, my great heart,' said I, 'that makes you large and healthy,
                  makes this village happy. Hundreds sit down in your shadow; this house, of which
                  you are a dendral guardian-angel, is blessed in your prosperity; weary laborers
                  stop and rest under you; all the village is proud of your beauty; sick people look
                  at you out of their windows and are comforted. Besides, how many myriads of
                  insects and how many thousands of birds are kept by you, and, in turn, disport
                     themselves for our happiness! It is
                  true that it takes a great deal to keep you, but you pay it all back a
                  hundred-fold in use and beauty.'"
               "Well done, poet," said Bacon, clapping his hands, in which all joined.
               "Jotham could not have mended your parable," said the minister.
               Edwards archly remarked that the tree was even more personally useful than one
                  could imagine, who had not been a schoolmaster, and needed switches for lazy
                  boys.
               "Astonishing what one gets by good company," said Judge Bacon. "I have lived all
                  my life without looking at trees in the light of discipline! And what deception! I
                  have seen Edwards often walking and looking up in a devout way. I attributed it to
                  pious thoughts; but no, he was reflecting on switches. A schoolmaster naturally,
                  then, divides trees into flagellant and non-flagellant trees. Are elm switches the
                  best, Edwards?"
               "Slightly too pliant," replied he with grave humor. "A perfect switch should be
                  stiff in your hand, slender, long, and at the end both elastic and tough. I have
                  never obtained the best results from apple-trees. They are brittle; and it is
                  disappointing to reasonable expectations to have a whip break in your hand. The
                  fault of most trees is, that they fail to produce long, slender, and tough
                  branches."
               "Pray, what do you consider the schoolmaster's best friend among trees? The
                  hickory?"
               "By no means. Only artificial rods are formed from its seasoned timbers. The
                  quince is, above all, the proper shade tree for school-houses. The fruit is acerb,
                  but the wood full of sweetness to those who need it. Indeed, it might be called
                  the boy's austere friend."
               "I thought the birch was the tree of trees for schoolmasters. All literature
                  celebrates its virtues. Indeed, its name has been appropriated to the idea of
                  discipline."
               "In country school-houses the birch may be accessible, but not in town. Even were
                  it at hand, it must yield to the quince in those searching subtle virtues which
                  are so wholesome to youths in distress."
               "Pray, Dr. Wentworth," said Buell, "go on with your remarks. Your discourse needs
                  an application."
               "Whatever expenditure refines the family and lifts it into a larger sphere of
                  living, is really spent upon the whole community as well. If no man lives better
                  than the poorest man, there will be no leader in material things. A community
                  needs examples to excite its ambition. A noble dwelling is, in part, the property
                  of all who dwell near it. Fine grounds not only confer pleasure directly on all
                  who visit or pass by, but they excite every man of any spirit to improve his own
                  grounds. A family of children upon whom wealth has been employed judiciously, if
                  they are at all worthy, represent in the community a higher type of life than can
                  be found in poverty. Fine dress may be looked upon either as a matter of display
                  or of worthy example. In the latter aspect, it is a duty as well as a pleasure.
                  You teach us, Dr. Buell, that every thing which makes the church noble and
                  beautiful is an honor to God. The same principle applies to the domestic
                  household. Every element that adds to the pleasure and refinement of the family
                  puts honor and dignity upon the family state. Whoever makes home seem to the young
                  dearer and more happy, is a public benefactor. Not all dissipated young men, of
                  course, are children brought up in meagre economy. But it is very certain that
                  children whose homes are not interesting to them by affection, or by attractive
                  objects, are more easily tempted into places and company fraught with danger."
               "These are weighty views," said Parson Buell; "and though I have never hitherto
                  regarded the subject in this light, nor indeed attempted to practise upon it, I
                  confess that I am struck with your views, and am inclined to believe them
                  correct."
               "Dear dear me!" said Bacon, "must I begin, at my time of life, to adorn and—what
                  is it?—dignify—yes, that was the phrase—'honor and dignity.' Well, I shall at once
                  make out a bill of honeysuckles, roses, roots and bulbs, and other such elements
                  of virtue; for it would ill become me, a judge, to practise the immorality of a
                  frigid house—a barren yard and a flowerless garden?"
               "Alas! alas!" said Edwards, with affected sorrow.
               "Why, what is the matter?" said Bacon.
               "I only sighed for those with whom you next do business! Generosity usually
                  avenges itself on somebody!"
               "Has it occurred to you, my dear Doctor," said Buell, "that New England families
                  have been brought up upon stern pattern, and upon a principle different from that which you
                  advocate? Boys and girls in former times have had very little time or opportunity
                  for the cultivation of taste."
               "Since the founding of the Colonies," replied Dr. Wentworth, "there have been
                  throughout New England what we called leading and influential families that
                  possessed wealth, that built fine mansions like this of mine, and lived in some
                  considerable style. That some of these wealthy families have set bad examples, is
                  true; but, as a whole, the class have gone before the times, powerly affected the
                  ideas of the whole community, given them larger notions of family life, and, if it
                  could only be traced, I think you would find that the young man who launched out
                  into the world and became wealthy had received, perhaps unconsciously, powerful
                  influence from their example.
               "But, Dr. Buell, it is not necessary that one should be rich. All that I say is,
                  that he who, according to his means spends his money in beautifying and refining
                  his house, is working for the whole community as much, and sometimes even more
                  than for his own family, and need not charge himself with selfishness."
               "It is certainly not selfish," said Dr. Buell "to spend money on one's self, if
                  thereby a higher influence is secured for society. It is upon that principle that
                  one is justified in liberal expenditure for education, and even for travel, as an
                  eminent means of liberal education."
               "Well, well," said Bacon, "I am getting very tired. Is not tea nearly ready? These
                  views are fearful! They will revolutionize New England. What a spending Of money!
                  What ravages under the name of taste! Well, I wash my bands of such doctrines! On
                  you, Dr. Buell, and you, Wentworth, and you, gentlemen, if you do not protest,
                  must rest the guilt! Positively shocking! New England farmers spending money for
                  beauty! Whew!"
               "I beg your pardon, Judge," said Dr. Wentworth, smiling quietly, "New England has
                  practiced on these very views, to a degree probably not equalled in any other part
                  of the globe. I do not believe that so large a proportion of men's revenue was
                  ever spent upon the Family as in New England. The idea of the family, of comfort
                  at home, of respectable appearance, of education for all the children, of neatness
                  and some sort of beauty, has nowhere else ever been so high among the whole body
                  of the common people. This is one reason why the Yankee is stigmatized as stingy.
                  His idea of respectability is expensive. Only sterling industry and stern economy
                  will enable him to carry along so much as enters in New England into the society
                  idea of the family! There may be no difference in the external appearance of
                  economy and parsimony, but their interiors are as different as honor and meanness.
                  The New England people are, beyond all question, the most generous and the most
                  liberal, according to their means, in the world. More money can be raised there
                  for any great purpose of public weal than anywhere else. Nor is New England ever
                  tired of giving. Schools in thousands over the West and South, academies in every
                  State where her sons have emigrated, churches, colleges, and all institutions of
                  religion, from end to end of this continent, are the witnesses of what men are
                  pleased to call the narrow spirit of New England."
               "Oh, Wentworth," said Judge Bacon, with a polite yawn, "I had no idea of starting
                  you off at such a rate when I cleared my skirts of your heresy. Rather than have
                  you go on at this rate, I will recant—yes, I accept your views. Let me see:
                  spending money on one's self is virtue; on one's family, public benefaction!
                  Indeed I am already, I perceive, an excellent man. What services I have rendered
                  to society in bringing up that girl of mine! It is a delightful surprise to find
                  that my selfishness has all been virtue! Dr. Buell, do you never exchange?"
               "Certainly, often; why do you ask?"
               "I thought, perhaps, you might sometimes like to ask Wentworth here to preach. He
                  has, I think, a manner that would eminently become the pulpit."
               "But, to return to the starting-point, will you tell me of what practical use is a
                  conservatory?" said Brett.
               "A very means of grace," replied Judge Bacon. "It will cost you smartly to build
                  it; yet more to stock it and to keep it up. It will never be large enough, for you
                  will be always wanting more things than it can hold; it will be always too large,
                  for you cannot get what things you already have half taken care of. You will fight
                  with red spiders one week and with aphides the next and with the white scale all
                  the time. Your water-pipes will get out of order once a month; your gardener will
                  be out of order every day. He won't let you touch your own things—will always know more than you do, and have a good
                  excuse for not having flowers; and, above all, on the coldest night of the year he
                  will get drunk, let the fire down, and freeze up your whole precious stock of
                  tender things. My dear Brett, if you stand in need of patience—if you would
                  cultivate long suffering—if you would grow in grace far faster than your flowers
                  will in health—by all means get a greenhouse. To-day you shall be tormented with
                  fumigations of tobacco; to-morrow you shall be half suffocated with fumes of
                  sulphur, and every now and then, by way of variety, you will be drenched by
                  whale-oil soap-suds!"
               All laughed at the comical distress predicted.
               "But," said Brett, "I suppose there are faithful men and gardeners,
                  and that it is with a greenhouse as with a store or factory—if a man selects poor
                  agents, he must expect shiftless work. If worse comes to worst, I can perhaps coax
                  Jacquin to move his shop up here, and work in my greenhouse."
               "Who is Jacquin, Brett? One of your factory-village men?"
               "Yes, a shoemaker with a taste for every thing. Every day he has a new invention.
                  He has exhausted the subject of warming and ventilating, and he works them out for
                  his own mere pleasure. Being very fond of flowers, he has built himself a little
                  greenhouse, thirty feet long, and taken off ten feet for his shop; and he has
                  contrived a tea-kettle of a stove, that, while it heats water for circulation
                  through his pet greenhouse, furnishes him heat for the shop. He has got together a
                  very tolerable collection of plants, and any gardener might be proud to have his
                  stock in as high health as his."
               "But, gentlemen," said Wentworth, "it would be wrong to let our scoffing judge
                  corrupt your ideas of the comforts of a greenhouse. Let me tell my experience: In
                  the first place, I did not try to make it too large. I rejected all mere
                  curiosities, far-fetched and difficult of treatment, and contented myself with
                  common things that, for reasonable care, would return a generous supply of
                  flowers. I like common flowers best—new flowers are like strangers, that put you
                  upon your good manners every moment; common flowers are like old friends, between
                  whom and you there are a hundred associations and memories of pleasure.
               "Then, as to the enjoyment. On a weary winter day, with a storm going on out of
                  doors and show blinding the air, and winds howling through the trees, open the
                  door into your conservatory, and behold summer is all around you! Besides, what
                  picture of landscape was ever so charming, as to sit across the room. and look
                  through the door upon such green and blossoming vegetation? One hour pays for a
                  year's care. Then, too, a sprig of flowers on the table in February, or March is a
                  blessing.
               "However, I think every man that ever loved flowers knows that the chief delight
                  consists in giving them away. Much as I enjoy my garden, I confess I
                  am more delighted with other people's pleasure in it than with my own. And so that
                  it is well given, a flower given away is far more enjoyed than a flower kept. In
                  my profession, I have had much occasion to notice this matter. In long and
                  wearisome sicknesses, no medicine is more beneficial than some innocent
                  exhilaration to the patient's mind. It is the nerve-power that cures after all.
                  Whatever rouses up the brain pleasantly is apt to do the patient good. And I carry
                  about as many flowers, in many places, as I do pills."
               "Without doubt," said Bacon, "with equal safety to the patient."
               "At any rate a gentleman will find an argument of benevolence for making a
                  greenhouse, which will fully neutralize any fear of selfishness."
               "There goes the tea bell," said the judge, affecting a joyful alacrity, "and here
                  comes the fairest of all messengers. Miss Rose, good evening! You were always an
                  angel of mercy! Do take your father off; and, as we are all faint with listening,
                  I am sure you will never again greet a pilgrim band so glad of a little
                  refreshment!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               A NEW LIFE.
               FRANK ESEL returned from his summer wanderings, reveries, and conversations with a
                  divided heart. Never had he loved his mother more or hungered more for home. Yet
                  there was a shadow on his brightness. He evidently had much to think of. He was
                  more industrious. Never before had he applied himself with so serious a purpose to
                  his art. His young friends noticed the change.
               "Frank, what's come over you?" said his gay, long-haired, much-smoking friend,
                  Lewis Keswick. "You have taken to drudging ever since you came back. You don't
                  seem like yourself."
               "But I think I am only just coming to myself."
               "How's that? Not going to be religious, eh? None of that sort of thing?"
               "Not exactly. In fact, I hardly know what ails me. But it seems as though I had
                  been trifling all my life and using my art to do it with. Hitherto I have been
                  painting playthings in a life frolic. Now I only know that I am dissatisfied
                  without knowing how to amend."
               "Thunder! What's got into you? I should think you had run afoul of a minister, or
                  stumbled into a church-door!"
               "I might do worse!"
               "Why you're going to preach, I'll bet! Come, out with it! I'll join your
                  church—I'll turn deacon when you become parson! You and I together ought to run
                  the machine!"
               "No such good news, Lew. My reformation does not reach outside of my art. But, to
                  tell the truth, I don't see what the — you and I are painters for?"
               "For? What does any body paint for? Because it's an agreeable way of getting a
                  living. It's genteel; light work in winter, pleasant strolls in summer, reasonable
                  pay, good company—why, it's the jolliest kind of a life!"
               "That's about it; and I turn away from it. It seems to me that one cannot live an
                  earnest life in such a way. At any rate, I've got to find out how to do something
                  more, or quit."
               Frank's mother perceived the difference in her son's moods. The change to
                  seriousness was great. He began to read Ruskin's works with avidity.
               The scales were falling from Frank's eyes. Little by little the great aims of life
                  were rising before him, and asserted their full power upon him. Then, his art fell
                  down into its true place, and became a mere instrument; no longer was it an
                  end.
               He began to experience an earnest desire to be an actor, through his art, in the
                  movements of society.
               "Shall all the struggles of man go on and I have no part in them? Shall men emerge
                  painfully, before my eyes, from rudeness, and I, ordained a priest of beauty,
                  reach forth no hand to help?"
               Frank Esel looked back upon his joyous dalliance with art in former days with
                  repugnance, His old portfolios he brought out to burn. Many of his sketches he did
                  destroy. But, while in the act, it occurred to him that an occasional sight of the
                  things which he once thought very clever might be a good discipline and measure
                  his progress. All those which in the days of his blindness he had thought very
                  fine, he laid back into portfolios and burned the rest.
               His mother did not think it prudent to question her son. From his summer's letters
                  she knew that he had been greatly delighted with Rose Wentworth. Whatever
                  solicitude or curiosity she may have felt to know the real state of his heart, she
                  did not deem it proper to be inquisitive.
               If indeed Frank could have formed a connection with Dr. Wentworth's family, she
                  would have esteemed her son, and herself, most fortunate. That something had
                  greatly influenced her son, was too plain to be missed even by the dimmest eye.
                  But what it was she could not divine. On the one hand, there was a sobriety tinged
                  with sadness—the rising within him of new forces,—a persistence and industry in
                  which hitherto he had been signally deficient but which now became a marked
                  feature of his life. She hardly knew her own son. His tenderness for her was if
                  any thing greater than before. Now and then his old boisterousness of glee would
                  break out again and he would frolic
                  with her in a whirl of gayety almost delirious. But such seasons grew rare. He
                  seemed more and more like one full of some inward and controlling purpose, toward
                  which he was turning all the forces of his life.
               On the other hand, he spoke of Rose with the utmost frankness. Scarcely a day
                  passed that some word of hers was not repeated. This did not seem compatible with
                  the shyness of beginning love.
               One day his mother ventured to say:
               "Frank, it seems to me that Rose Wentworth is your model, and the very arbiter of
                  your opinions. She must be a remarkable young woman."
               With no disturbance of manner Frank replied ingenuously:
               "I do not think that I owe so much to what Miss Rose said as to what she
                     was herself."
               "You mean that she drew you to her by the charms of her person more than by her
                  conversation?"
               "No, not that. I was thinking of the influence which I have derived from that
                  family, in my own art. What Dr. Wentworth and his family said was certainly more
                  instructive to me than any thing I had ever heard until then. It was he that urged
                  me to study Ruskin. We were sitting on the door-step one evening, and Miss Rose
                  was questioning her father about some statement of Ruskin's that seemed
                  extravagant. He replied:
               "'It is extravagant, my dear. Ruskin is full of wildness, and tangles himself up
                  with himself like a vine twisting on itself. You read Ruskin just as you explore a
                  region, finding many treasures and much that you avoid. He has his brier thickets,
                  his contorted trees, his muddy molasses. But, taken as a whole, the landscape is
                  rich and grand. Ruskin is like a forest, on whose edges and in whose depths are
                  many noxious plants—but these bear no proportion to the magnitude of the woods,
                  the grandeur of the trees, and the sublimity, in winter and summer, of the music
                  which the wind draws from their boughs and tops.'
               "Then, turning to me, he said:
               "'Have you studied Ruskin?'
               "I replied—'I have read portions—extracts—from his works.'
               "After a pause, he said in a very gentle way, in an undertone, but earnestly—'My
                  young friend, Ruskin is not to be read in extracts—nor simply read either. You
                  ought to take him as an infection. He should throw you into a fever. The whole
                  system should be pervaded by it. He is like those diseases which renovate the
                  system. Do not try to check it. Let it run its full period. Afterward you will
                  recover well you will throw off much. You will retain, perhaps, little. But, your
                  whole constitution will be changed. You will observe differently, think
                  differently, reason differently, all the rest of your life.'
               "'But father,' said Rose, 'is it not a pity that one so good should not be
                  better.'
               "'Certainly it is. What then? We are glad to gather thirty bushels of wheat from
                  an acre of ground, but there were two tons of straw and chaff required to grow the
                  wheat. Would you have a man all grain? Yet, worshipping is natural; and our first
                  drift when one affects us well, is to begin shaping him in our thoughts to an
                  ideal perfectness. Then comes the shock of disclosure. Every body is imperfect;
                  and strong natures, strong enough to overturn old errors, and fight great battles,
                  are likely to be too strong to walk safely in harness and drag our phaetons and
                  chaises!'"
               Frank had been led along by his reminiscences, till he forgot the point he had
                  started for. After a moment's silence he started up.
               "Oh, mother, I forgot to say the only thing I meant to—That which I most felt in
                  the Wentworths was the intimate relationship and personal sympathy which existed
                  between them and nature. Her father has brought Miss Rose up to feel that all of
                  nature is, literally, but a way which God has of making known to us his feelings,
                  tastes and thoughts. It was so from her infancy, that sounds, colors, forms,
                  phenomena, did not stand for mere science, but suggested a living presence. It was
                  unconscious. Others went to nature. She dwelt in it always. I had
                  never before met with such deep insight, such a pure love, such reverent
                  admiration, such fullness and richness of knowledge, in a young person, too, most
                  accomplished and attractive."
               "I should have thought, Frank, that such charms would have been irresistible."
               His only reply was:
               "Too unequal—too unequal."
               
               The winter rolled away speedily. Frank Esel was never so little pleased with the
                  result of his work. He had never labored so hard. But men beginning new courses
                  are like ploughed meadows. The roughness and waste are indispensable precursors of
                  the new sward. Frank never had advanced so far, and yet never seemed to himself to
                  have moved so little. But as this was his appointed life-work, he came out of
                  repeated discouragements with renewed courage, and kept bravely on.
               Already Spring had supplanted Winter, and now Summer was fulfilling the tender
                  prophecies of Spring. It was full time for him to leave the city. But this year
                  his mother would go with him; and early in July, Frank, in over measure of joy,
                  found himself again in Norwood, and among friends that he had learned to regard as
                  his benefactors.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               LEAVING COLLEGE.
               BARTON'S four years were ended. The senior vacation had come and passed. He had
                  won the first honors of his class, and there was not a member of the class—not
                  even the two who had most nearly been his rivals—that did not heartily accord to
                  him the first rank. He was not simply first as a student but as a good fellow.
                  None led him in athletic exercises. In a certain degree he was accessible,
                  familiar, and most gay and social; yet it was with a reserve that showed that he
                  did not carry all his nature on his sleeve.
               He was one of the men whom close study had not invalided. He, was, if possible,
                  more vigorous and elastic than when he entered college. When he returned to take
                  the honors of his class at Commencement, it was agreed by every young lady of
                  taste that a finer form and nobler face had never been seen in those streets.
               His townsmen were rightly proud of Barton's distinction. His father was
                  universally respected. Barton himself was popular. His intimate friends were among
                  the most influential citizens. All Norwood looked forward this year to the
                  Commencement-day, and it seemed as if the town itself was about to go over to
                  Amherst on the occasion.
               Tommy Taft, too, was to go! This was Dr. Wentworth's arrangement. Nor had he ever
                  done a kinder thing. To go to Amherst and see his boy, Barton, receive the first
                  honors, was a glimpse of paradise! What these honors were to be he had not the
                  slightest idea. He was in much uncertainty as to the nature of a college. Was it a
                  sort of factory? The distant buildings, which he had often looked at through his
                  spy-glass,—a relic of his seafaring life—might easily be mistaken for mills. Did
                  they drill boys there, as on shipboard? or what on earth did they do? When Barton
                  explained their studies and recitations, Tommy looked wise and nodded his head
                  knowingly, but it is doubtful if he had any very luminous ideas on the
                  subject.
               
               The Commencement-day proper was on Wednesday, but there were services on Tuesday
                  which Dr. Wentworth wished to hear, and duties which, as a Trustee, he had to
                  perform, which required him to go over on Tuesday. Tommy Taft was to come over on
                  Wednesday in an early conveyance arranged for this occasion.
               The morning came. Rose and her mother were ready. The doctor would let his own
                  horses rest and Hiram Beers was to come with a stylish team and open carriage.
               He came promptly upon appointment. The boys cheered him as he left the stable. His
                  deep chestnut-colored Morgan horses—matched to a hair,—and, what is more rare,
                  matched in gait and spirit,—came out of the yard on tip-toe. They did not rear nor
                  run sideways, nor kick.
               "That would do under saddle said Hiram; "but when the harness is put on, sech
                  things is immoralities in horses. Why, them nags is well brought up. They are jest
                  like good boys goin' to meetin' on Sabbath-day; they don't play, though they may
                  giggle a little."
               Down the street went Hiram, looking neither to the right or left, though every
                  soul, right and left, was looking at him. Do you suppose he didn't feel it?
               "Wal," said Tommy to him, as Hiram was loosening one strap, drawing another a hole
                  tighter, dressing a lock of hair under the head-piece to tassel below the eyes,
                  and tucking up his pets generally—"wal, Hiram, you've done it this time."
               "Of course I have, Tommy. Why not?"
               "You've got a pretty pair of gals there,—a pretty pair as ever I laid eyes on. A
                  fellow might be proud of bein' captain in such a consarn."
               "Wal, suppose I am proud Tommy. What may a fellow be proud of, if he mayn't be
                  proud when he's got sech a team as that afore him and sech folks behind him as I'm
                  goin' to drive? I tell you Wentworth's a whole team, and his wife's a woman, I
                  tell ye! and Rose," said Hiram, slapping his leg in a kind of ecstasy—"Rose
                  is—well, she's enough to make a feller cross 'cause he ain't young and handsome
                  and rich, and she in love with him! I tell you, Tommy, I'm out for a day of it.
                  And it'S my opinion that Solomon, in all his glory, never went over to
                  Commencement rigged out like this."
               The conversation was cut short by the arrival of the Cathcarts. Dr. Buell and
                  Judge Bacon were to go over, and Mr. Brett, Mr. and Mrs. Templeton, and several
                  families besides. This year all Norwood felt complimented that one of its boys was
                  to carry off the honors.
               Hiram took the lead. Not a smile was on his face. His small eyes flashed out from
                  under his projecting eyebrows with uncommon brightness, and his good spirits
                  showed themselves in endless speeches to his horses; in salutations to every body
                  that he met, whether he knew them or not; in a neat touch of his whip on a dog
                  that ran out to salute the company; in twirling the lash round the neck of a goose
                  that stood pensively looking at the road full of people, and dragging her several
                  yards, saying:
               "Come along; don't squawk; lots of your sort been to college afore you."
               They soon came to the bridge across the Connecticut. Hiram must have a word with
                  the woman who took toll. She was some sixty years old, of sandy complexion, with a
                  thin and hard face; her large spectacles, mounted on the top of her head, looked,
                  as Hiram said, "like the dormer windows in the roof of the doctor's house."
               "Miss Palfry, have you seen a man come across here this mornin'—a rather big man—a
                  little cast in one eye—looks as though he was winkin' at you all the time—red
                  hair, wears it long—and has a red handkerchief round his neck? Rides on a gray
                  horse—well, something of the size of Cathcart's yonder?"
               "A man with red hair and handkerchief?"
               "Yes."
               "On a gray horse?"
               "Yes—with a long tail."
               "Let me see—Polly!—here, Polly!—have you seen a man this mornin' comin' across
                  with red hair?" Hiram struck in—"With red hair, and white-tail horse?"
               "About what time?
               "How do I know? That's what I want to find out. He had a porkmanty behind him, and
                  a green umbrella."
               "Wal, I guess he han't come along yet. Shall I tell him any thing if he
                  comes?"
               
               "Yes; tell him that I think he had better stop, when he gits where he wants to go
                  to."
               And with that he gave a sharp cluck or sort of throat-whistle which every horse
                  understands and in a moment disappeared in the covered bridge. The woman looked
                  after him with the slightest possible look of humorous vexation.
               "Go 'long, you old fool! I don't believe he's expecting any body.
                  Well, I shall learn, one of these days not to believe a word Hiram says. Might a
                  known he was quizzin'—shouldn't wonder if he died laughin', and cracked jokes at
                  his own funeral!"
               "Hiram," said Dr. Wentworth, "who is this man you inquired for?"
               "Well, sir, when I find out, I'll let you know. A long bridge to walk over,
                  Doctor?"
               "Do people always mind the law and keep upon a walk?"
               "That depends. When the boys are on a spree, and have had a little suthin', I
                  allus raises a trot about here: they thinks the bridge too long. But when a
                  feller's along with his gal, he allus thinks the bridge too short; and he's
                  particular about keepin' the law. Only last week I was about here, and I heerd a
                  sort of smack behind me, and the horses thought I was chirrupin' for 'em, to go
                  on, and started off. But I cooled 'em down and began to whistle like, so that you
                  couldn't hear any little sound. The fact is, Doctor, young folks will be young
                  folks, and I never was one of them as wanted to larf at 'em. Let 'em have their
                  time. I think it rather beautiful like to see young folks take to each other. The
                  Lord knows they'll have trouble enough afore they get through livin' with each
                  other, and it would be a shame to spile the beginning, when it's all sweet and
                  pretty like.
               "No," said Hiram, virtuously straightening up; "when Zeke Lash driv over one day,
                  and interrupted zome little cooin' and billin' that he had no business with and I
                  heard him tellin' of it in the stable—'You're a darned fool,' sez I, 'and if it
                  had been any of my folks, I'd made you taste the horsewhip, every inch of it from
                  the tip of the lash to the butt end. I'd as soon throw stones at the birds
                  whirlin' and kissin' in the air. When they are old, and we're used to 'em, I don't
                  object to throw a stone or two at a robin. But any feller that would do it when
                  they fust come, he's a mean cuss!"
               But other business soon diverted Hiram's attention. After leaving the bridge, and
                  while he was driving at an easy trot, there came up behind him a span of horses,
                  driven by Zeke Lash, who held out in Norwood that no man could equal
                     him in the management of horses. Watching his chance, he dashed by
                  Hiram. Without turning his head, just as he slid past him, Zeke looked at Hiram
                  out of the corner of his eye, With a glance which pierced him, as if it had been a
                  sting.
               Hiram changed his tobacco from the left to the right side of his mouth and chewed
                  it with uncommon energy. But in no other way did he show that he felt himself ill
                  used.
               "Who is that, Hiram, that drives such a fine team?" said Dr. Wentworth.
               "It's Zeke Lash. He and Overman have set up a new stable."
               "What sort of a fellow is he? I've seen him about the streets a good deal
                  lately."
               "Wal, he's cute. There's nobody else that can touch him with a ten-foot pole in
                  pickin' out horses. As for tendin' and drivin', he's a perfect revelation—a new
                  dispensation, miracles and all. At any rate, that's his own opinion about it."
               "And do you think so too, Hiram?"
               "I have my own opinion. He's cunnin' enough, that's sartain. You never know what
                  he'll do. He's like my old Tiger. He'll be good-natured for weeks, and some day,
                  when you ain't thinkin' on't, he'll give you a lift with his heel and land you
                  t'other side of the barn. But it's not my way to talk about him. Mebbe he'll keep
                  ahead of me all the way to Amherst. He's got a light wagon, and only two in it,
                  and I'm drivin' five. Never mind."
               As they drew near to the village the road inclined upward. Hiram had kept well up
                  behind and forced Zeke to trot up hill steadily. Just as they came to the street,
                  where a wider track gave him opportunity, Hiram gave a low hiss, which acted on
                  his horses like fire on powder. Hitherto their trot had been gay, nimble and
                  graceful, with short and springy steps. At Hiram's signal they instantly let out a
                  long reaching pace, crouching down nearer the ground; and swinging with a freer
                  action, they caught Zeke's team, that now had gone into a thundering pace, held it for a moment, just to make sure
                  that it was doing all it could and that all was fair and then with a splendid rush
                  they swept away from them and rolled back the clouds of dust in their faces.
               The whole thing was so sudden that Dr. Wentworth had no time to protest against
                  coming into town at such a rate. Rose, excited with the race, was even more
                  delighted with the humor of the whole thing—with Hiram's characteristic shrewdness
                  and at her father's ludicrous position. The boys cheered, and not a few judges of
                  horses nodded as they went past, as much as to say:
               "That'll do, Hiram!" "I guess that will do," said Hiram to his nags.
                  "We'll save up the rest till next time. Whoa! come down, beauties,—come, come,
                  childen—don't be agitated," said Hiram, in his blandest tones; "remember where you
                  are, boys! Whoa! that's enough! nicely done, ponies!"
               "I tell you," said Hiram, turning slightly toward the doctor, "these horses are
                  jest as near human as is good for 'em. A good horse has sense jest as much as a
                  man has; and he's proud too, and he loves to be praised, and he knows when you
                  treat him with respect. A good horse has the best pints of a man without his
                  failin's."
               "What do you think becomes of horses, Hiram, when they die?" said Rose.
               "Wal, Miss Rose it's my opinion that there's use for horses hereafter, and that
                  you'll find there's a horse-heaven. There's Scripture for that, too."
               "Ah!" said Rose, a little surprised at these confident assertions. "What Scripture
                  do you mean?"
               "Why in the book of Revelations! Don't it give an account of a white horse, and a
                  red horse, and black horses, and gray horses? I've allers s'posed that when it
                  said Death rode on a pale horse, it must have been gray, 'cause it had mentioned
                  white once already. In the ninth chapter, too, it says there was an army of two
                  hundred thousand horsemen. Now I should like to know where they got so many horses
                  in heaven, if none of 'em that die off here go there? It's my opinion that a good
                  horse's a darned sight likelier to go to heaven than a bad man!"
               With this Hiram rounded up with a driver's flourish before the house at which the
                  doctor and his party had taken rooms.
               Already the town was astir with excitement. Commencement-week is the one week of
                  the year that every family, from the highest to the lowest, feels alike.
                  Commencement-day is the rival of Thanksgiving-day. New England has always been
                  economical of holidays. Christmas she threw away with indignant emphasis, as
                  stained and spattered with Papal superstition. The only two festivals were
                  Thanksgiving-day and Fast-day—the last to put in the seed with, and the former to
                  celebrate the year's harvest. New England never made provision for amusements.
               Amusements have for ages, in Europe, been the bribes which governments threw to
                  the people for their political rights. Fiddles were cheaper than ballot-boxes.
                  Kings, formerly, would pay liberally to amuse, but nothing to instruct. The old
                  Puritan, regarding games and amusements as poisonous flowers, whose odor bewitched
                  the senses and stupefied manhood, abhorred them. It was not a hatred of pleasure,
                  but of the seductive purposes to which it had been cunningly put.
               It was the practical philosophy of New England that a free and intelligent people,
                  thrifty in business, managing their own matters, and zealously occupied in
                  building up the commonwealth, had excitement enough and variety of interest enough
                  in their normal affairs and that earnest men did not need like children, to be fed
                  on frolic and amusement. This view was carried to an extreme. But it was a
                  reaction from a use of amusements which was degrading to manhood and inconsistent
                  with the freedom of the commonwealth.
               On the next morning Rose was called early, for her father wished to see the
                  sunrise from the college chapel-tower. Many men graduate from Amherst without
                  knowing that they leave behind them unseen one of the fairest sights that will
                  ever bless their eyes—a sunrise from the chapel-tower.
               It was yet a half hour before the sun would come over the Pelham hills; but the
                  east was all aglow. Scuds and scarfs of cloud seemed shot up from below the
                  horizon as if from a crater of colors. Long beams of light rayed out, fan-form, as
                  if there had been a fibrous structure to the light.
               They had scarcely turned to look upon this flaming East before they were joined by
                  Barton Cathcart, who had in some
                  unaccountable manner learned of Rose's intention to see the sun rise upon the
                  valley of the Connecticut.
               They had hardly exchanged greetings when the sun shot its light along the notched
                  ridges of the hills on the south, of which Mt. Holyoke and Mt. Tom are the
                  westward summits.
               At the same instant it glowed along the west, and upon Sugar-loaf at the north. In
                  a moment more the valley, in its length and breadth, was full of light. A slender
                  film of white hovered along the line of the Connecticut river. Beyond it, shining
                  out and glittering, the white-housed villages looked out from among the trees on
                  the far hill-sides.
               "This is a scene less admirable but more lovely," said Dr. Wentworth, "than many
                  which men travel far to see."
               "Father, you have seen the sun rise on the Rigi and upon other Swiss
                  mountains?"
               "Yes. It is a sight of unequalled grandeur; but from high mountains the landscape
                  is generalized by its distance from the eye. It excites the imagination more than
                  the feelings. It inspires a kind of separateness and lonesomeness, which seem to
                  be constituent elements of the sentiment of grandeur.
               "But if one would feel nearness and affection—perhaps lower but more pleasurable,
                  emotions—he must be near the objects seen. A hill for prospect should be so placed
                  as to get a wide view without great elevation."
               "Barton," said Rose, "is this a favorite resort of the students?"
               "I suspect not," said Barton, smiling as if the idea were even comical. "I have
                  been here many scores of times, both at morning and at evening, and I remember to
                  have met but once or twice any of the boys here. Indeed, I have been attracted to
                  it by its solitude."
               "You must have seen this valley in many fine varieties of atmosphere," said the
                  doctor, "if you have frequented this place. Few persons that I meet seem to have
                  been struck with the variety which nature produces by vaporous vestments. We
                  notice the atmosphere in its extreme conditions, but not in all the fine
                  intermediate gradations. The world puts on a thousand garments, and seldom two
                  alike. Men and women are so busy with their own apparel that they have no time to
                  behold the wonderful ventures which God lets down upon the earth."
               Barton's appearance was striking. Rose's presence, his own approaching farewell to
                  the scenes of so much enjoyment, stirred him to the utmost feeling. But, according
                  to his nature, he repressed all signs of it, and grew calm as he grew intense. Yet
                  the light came through. His face had a high and commanding look, and every word he
                  spoke came as a tone comes from a chord well strung. Yet there was no stolen
                  glance at Rose. There was neither hiding nor revealing. There was on both parts
                  simplicity and ingenuousness.
               "Some mornings there must have been which stand out in your memory with peculiar
                  force?" said Rose.
               "Scarcely two have been alike. But some few, stand out with extraordinary
                  distinctness. One morning, I came up here when the whole valley lay tranquilly in
                  a fog. Only the tops of Holyoke and Tom appeared, and they were like islands in a
                  wide sea. It was very impressive. It seemed as if a flood had submerged the earth
                  and drowned all the living people, and I was left a solitary spectator, looking
                  out over this wide, desolate and silent sea. But as soon as the sun rose, its
                  action was magical. There seem to be in vapor very different degrees of
                  sensibility to the sunlight. It is often sluggish, and is little affected by hours
                  of sunshine. But this morning, no sooner did the rays pierce it than it began to
                  writhe and twist and roll up in all forms of convolution, as if suffering pain. In
                  a moment openings appeared, through which I saw the earth beneath, and the first
                  distinct picture happened to be Norwood itself, which I looked down upon as
                  through an open window in the heavens whose sides shut out all else. The whole
                  scene lasted scarcely half an hour."
               "What was the other one?"
               "It was an evening scene. I was on the east side of the college, when I noticed a
                  singular glow in the air. The grove, the students, every thing seemed roseate. I
                  knew that something was going on worth seeing, and made for this place as speedily
                  as possible. The scene that burst on me was wonderful. The heavens seemed to be
                  drenched with rose-color. All the west glowed with it. It ascended to the zenith.
                  It seemed to pour over and down to the very horizon in the east. A slight haze, or
                  rather scales of thin vapor, filled the hemisphere, and these were saturated with rose-color. Gradually it changed to
                  flame-color and then the landscape was more wonderful still. Fearful it was. It
                  seemed to be like a universal conflagration. I thought of the language of
                  prophecy, When the moon shall be turned to blood; and of that Great Day when the
                  elements shall melt with fervent heat. The whole world stood in an unnatural
                  trance, and the most familiar things looked wild and almost fearful. But the
                  vision was of short duration. Suddenly, and while I was looking, the color was
                  caught up again out of the air. Things resumed their common look, and the glory
                  had left no effects behind."
               "No effects?" said Rose. "Did it not leave its effects upon your mind? Did it not
                  leave a new color in the imagination? new conceptions of Divine power?"
               "In truth it did. It awaked all my mother in me!"
               "What?"
               "My mother has the sense of infiniteness and mysteriousness more than any that I
                  have ever known. Something of her spirit I have inherited."
               "I know what you mean," said Rose, quickly.
               "This is the true moral effect," said Dr. Wentworth, "of the more impressive
                  natural phenomena. Men grow intensely egotistical. They are saturated in human
                  life as if God had made nothing but men, and men only in their everyday uses and
                  deployments. Whatever gives a shock to this trite egotism, and awakens, even for a
                  moment, in men, a sense of God's presence in all nature, cannot but inspire a more
                  wholesome spirit than that which usually frets and weaves out the over-busy
                  day.
               "Such days as Barton mentions stimulate one with surprise, and serve, as is said,
                  in medical practice, as alternatives; but I doubt whether a
                  recurrence of them would give so much pleasure, as is derived from days of
                  ordinary sunshine. Nothing is so full of joy to me as the simple sunshine of days
                  following rains or snows, when the atmosphere is washed clean, when the blue is
                  deep and sober, when all objects rise before the eye clearly defined, and with
                  what seems to me, always earnestness. There is an exhilaration in simple sunlight.
                  A flower is beautiful; forests and mountains are noble; clouds measure the whole
                  scale, from simple beauty to superlative grandeur. But, after all, sunlight light,
                  as an object of pleasure, of admiration, and even of affection, in the sense in
                  which the term is applied to insentient things, is far beyond them all. There are
                  no storms or convulsions in it. Its waves fill up the universe, but never rage nor
                  utter sound. There is unwasting power, in utter silence, in it. Sounds are very
                  impressive, but silence is far more so; and to me no silence is like that of
                  universal sunlight. Out of its stillness come all those energies which awaken life
                  upon the globe. It is father of the forest and the field. It creates the currents
                  of the ocean and the storms of the air, and yet the sunlight itself is forever
                  tranquil. It is to me the most impressive feature of the world. It is that symbol
                  which most nearly represents the universality of God the energy and fruitfulness
                  of Divine power, and its modesty, as well.
               "For, I often reflect how it seems to hide itself, by revealing all the objects of
                  creation. It lives and rejoices in what it creates. But sunlight itself is far
                  more beautiful, infinitely more wonderful than are the innumerable broods of life
                  that spring from it. When I am in perfect physical health there is no delight
                  which I am more grateful for than a simple sunshine, in a clear atmosphere. I
                  never so much wonder as then at that unaccountable propensity of men to forge
                  religious symbols.
               "I admit the need which men have of some concrete representation of invisible
                  truths. For that express purpose the whole globe has been fashioned. But men are
                  absolutely afraid of Materialism in religion! They dread to use the instruments
                  which God ordained. With the saddest egotism, they set up artificial signs that at
                  best but poorly suggest the pure, the true, the good, the infinite. Stars and suns
                  give way to candles; cotton and wool from the loom set aside the garments of light
                  with which God glorifies the world; and while ten million flowers around the world
                  offer perfume, men burn handfuls of frankincense in cramped temples. When the
                  perfect day comes, all men will worship, and in Nature they will find all the
                  symbols needed to set forth the glory of the incommunicable God."
               "But, father," said Rose, "did not God himself appoint ritual and symbols for his
                  people?"
               "For a stone-race, too gross to understand the imagery of nature, he gave, as it
                  were, a translation designed to bring them back to the primal and grander temple service. When
                  this had answered its purpose, he abolished it and in the advent he swept altar
                  and vestment away, and, opening the realm of Nature, he revealed the hidden truth
                  that it was the realm of Grace."
               "But my dear father, is not nature corrupt?"
               "What nature? Human life is corrupt enough; but is this habitable globe, its
                  generous tones, its munificent seasons, its pictorial scenery, its marvellous
                  processes, its gorgeous imagery, its days and nights, summers and winters, its
                  oceans and air, and sun and sunlight, are these corrupt? Since when have the
                  heavens ceased to declare the glory of God?"
               Barton and Rose had met during his college course several times. Yet, their
                  intercourse had been so different from former days, when they met every week, that
                  it was in effect separation.
               Those who are ripe and fixed in their opinions may be separated long without
                  losing sympathy or acquaintance. But in youth, when the mind is just opening, when
                  opinions are changing, and while the whole character is subject every year to the
                  impress of new forces, a long separation is, virtually, the loss of acquaintance,
                  particularly with persons of a deep nature. Conscious of great changes in
                  themselves and supposing like ones to have taken place in others there is an
                  exquisite curiosity to know each other again, and to prove whether both have grown
                  in sympathy toward a common centre or whether development has been dissimilar and
                  repellent. There is in every sensitive soul a fine jealousy that refuses, after
                  long separation, to be taken again at the old estimate. Barton did not commit the
                  mistake, either in manner or feeling, of saying:
               "We shall be intimate now just as we were four years ago!" His manner said, "Four
                  years ago, as boys and girls, we were friends. You have passed on to a higher
                  level."
               Rose had more than attained to the utmost bounds which his imagination had ever
                  placed for improvement. Barton, more than ever, felt in her presence a kind of
                  hopelessness. His love for Rose had with manhood gained strength and breadth. The
                  interviews during his senior vacation had shown no change in her but the regular
                  and beautiful evolution of a nature that had inherited without struggle the
                  harmony which in others comes by violent conflicts, or not at all. If she had
                  seemed good and noble before she seemed to his riper judgment yet lovelier, and
                  further removed from need of him.
               But the consciousness of a feeling far deeper than he supposed Rose suspected, the
                  constraint which he laid upon it, the attempt which he made to leave Rose free
                  from the slightest pressure of his wishes and feelings, wrought a kind of formal
                  manner—at times, almost coldness. He was not acting from a selfish pride, unduly
                  solicitous for his own standing, but from a high and conscientious determination
                  not to embarrass the woman whom he most honored and loved.
               When Tommy Taft reached Amherst on Commencement-day, his first desire was to
                  ascend the hill and inspect the college buildings. In the confusion of the day, he
                  might easily have been left to find out his own way without benefit of
                  explanations. Indeed, he had gone alone up to the college buildings. He had looked
                  curiously in at the dormitories, had gone to the chapel, and looked wonderingly at
                  the recitation rooms, and with some surprise at the "crockery shop," as he called
                  the room of philosophical instruments. But, luckily, he met Hiram Beers, whose
                  frequent visits to Amherst had made him familiar with every portion of its grounds
                  and buildings. Under such good pilotage, Tommy Taft proceeded to the Library,
                  whose magnitude impressed him profoundly. Drawing near to Hiram, he said, with a
                  knowing wink:
               "That is what they come for, eh?"
               "What do you mean, old fellow?" said Hiram.
               "They come to college to read all them books? I don't wonder it takes 'em four
                  years. Do you s'pose Barton has got all this inside of him?"
               "Very likely," said Hiram; "but it's mighty poor feed, I should think; for the
                  sellers that read most git the leanest."
               "Do you know which end they begin at?" said Tommy, with a curious awe.
               "Wal," said Hiram, "I've been here before, but I never saw many folks a readin'
                  here. I guess the fellers play ball pretty much all summer, and read winters."
               They proceeded to the Natural History Cabinets. Tommy was exceedingly delighted
                  with the shells. They seemed to take him back to familiar objects.
               
               "Now that's somethin' wuth seein'. But I never dreamed there was as many bugs in
                  all creation as they have stuck up here. It's surprisin'! Wonder how they got
                  'em?"
               Hiram showed him into the geological rooms, where were the famous bird-track slabs
                  of Connecticut River, so dear to Professor Hitchcock.
               "There, Tommy. What do you think of that for bird-tracks?"
               Tommy looked at them closely, with his head cocked first on one side and then on
                  the other.
               "Them's pretty big birds, Hiram. But you won't make me believe there was ever
                  birds as heavy as that!"
               "Heavy as what?"
               "Why, heavy enough to make tracks in solid stones," said Tommy, with a little
                  indignation at being supposed capable of such imposition. "I can stand a deal of
                  stuffin', as I tell Dr. Buell, when he preaches on the doctrines. Sez I,—Doctor I
                  can stand it as long as you can. If you ain't satisfied, jest go on and fetch out
                  some more. But I be darned, Hiram, if you can stuff me with these 'ere
                  stories."
               "Well," said Hiram, "I wasn't there when they did it but they say it's so. You'd
                  better ask Barton."
               Tommy had not half satisfied his curiosity when he was warned that, if he would
                  hear the speaking, he must make haste to the church where the Commencement
                  exercises were to be held. This village church was the antithesis of the Temple of
                  Minerva upon the Acropolis. That exhibited the utmost degree to which
                  symmetry and beauty could be carried. Taking the other direction, this village
                  church, which was a Grecian temple with a cupola on its back, demonstrated how far
                  it was possible for man to go in the direction of monstrous ugliness. What can be
                  done in that case no one will ever imagine who has not seen this remarkable effort
                  at architecture. It left nothing more to possibility in that kind.
               Hither flocked rustic beauties. Hither streamed hundreds of honest-faced farmers,
                  whose sons were in college, or had been. The procession was advancing and the band
                  of music was filling all the air with exhilarating sounds. All was excitement and
                  bustle.
               By great boldness and some strength, Tommy forced himself near the front of the
                  gallery, where he could see and hear all. A sly use of his wooden leg was of great
                  service. Did any one refuse to move, Tommy, accidentally putting his wooden leg
                  upon his toe never failed to produce a sudden retraction of that member. Of course
                  as he deftly slipped himself forward into the crevice thus opened he was quite
                  unconscious of any mischief. Any one could see that who looked upon his hard
                  unmoving face.
               Through all the weary variety Tommy kept watch. Others changed places, went out
                  and returned, but not Tommy Taft. He came there to see Barton graduate, and that
                  he meant 
                     too
                     to
                   see, without regard to time or fatigue. The heat was great, but Tommy
                  had found greater in the tropics. He wiped his face with his great red cotton
                  handkerchief, with such vigorous rubs that one feared lest his features should
                  disappear under such a currying process. He joined heartily in all the applause
                  which was given one by one to the speakers. But when, at length, Barton appeared,
                  the old man seemed in raptures. "Now you'll hear him. That's the boy! Now,
                  hark!"
               At the passages which elicited commendation, Tommy's foot joined in with an
                  emphasis that left nothing to be desired in the way of noise.
               Far different were Rachel Cathcart's feelings. Not far from her son she sat, and
                  when he rose, it seemed to her more as a vision than a reality. Was this indeed
                  her own son? the very babe that she had brought forth? the child which she had
                  tended? the boy that she reared? the little farmer that rose in her memory as he
                  used to appear when at work? She was like one in a dream! His voice sounded
                  strange in her ears. This great crowd of people, all looking up with admiration
                  and sympathy, and her own son the centre and cause of all! She scarcely heard what
                  he said. When loud plaudits startled her, she looked as one roused from reverie.
                  At length the valedictory was delivered. It was indeed a farewell. Barton had felt
                  in his very soul, and probably more than any of his classmates, the full sentiment
                  of parting, and it gave a tenderness and solemnity to both his words and manner
                  which touched all the audience to tears.
               
               When the services were closed, many there were who congratulated Barton. But with
                  a fine delicacy, there were more who offered respectful congratulations to 'Biah
                  Cathcart and Rachel. Both seemed willing to avoid their son in such a crowd. They
                  extricated themselves from the throng, and repaired to their lodgings, that none
                  might look upon the joy of a family whose love and pride had that day been so
                  signally blessed.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXX.
               DOCTOR BUELL'S SORROW.
               THE trustees of Norwood Academy consulted the universal wish when they appointed
                  Barton Cathcart to take charge of the institution. He did not long hesitate. Local
                  prejudice in Barton's case was disarmed, and none more ardently urged him to
                  accept than those who had known him from his boyhood. On the other hand, there
                  were weighty reasons for assuming this position. It gave him an immediate
                  pecuniary support. It spared him a precipitate choice of his profession. It
                  brought him home for a term of years to his family, and especially to his mother.
                  When the transition from boyhood takes place, men are apt to assert their
                  individuality with some jealousy of parental interference, and break away in
                  search of their own liberty. After manhood is reached, and something of the world
                  is learned, men go back to their homes with a love which is no longer a mere
                  childish feeling, but an educated affection, competent to weigh and measure. This
                  second love of a child to its parents is so much richer, deeper, and more enduring
                  than any other, that it is worth any price of intermediate suffering.
               But another reason more influential than all was, perhaps, the least demonstrative
                  in his thoughts. He would be near to Rose Wentworth.
               In this case, as in so many others in the life of every honorable nature, his
                  feelings proved wiser than any mere reasonings would leave done. Rose was not one
                  likely to "fall in love." She might grow to love. But it would be a gradual
                  unfolding.
               Being richly benevolent affable with all, buoyant in spirits, one not deeply
                  acquainted with her nature would be apt to imagine himself rapidly advancing in
                  her graces, and would flatter himself that he had secured a sympathy which might
                  be carried forward by his own will to every range of love. But, in a fall and
                  large nature, friendliness is but the outer court, love is the holy of holies.
                  Into that enters only the ordained of God.
               
               If Barton had been far wiser than he was in reading the secrets of the heart he
                  could not have done better than by leaving his hopes to Time, and to the results
                  of a renewed intercourse no longer as children but as man and woman, developed by
                  study, and ripened by some degree of experience in adult life.
               Barton entered upon his duties with a calm earnestness which marked his nature.
                  His spirit was soon felt in the whole school. Before the winter closed the Academy
                  was filled to its utmost capacity. Selecting his own assistants, he brought to his
                  aid those who would work in full sympathy with him.
               He did not confine his efforts to the school alone. The village Lyceum opened for
                  him a sphere of activity which he was not slow to enter.
               He was foremost among the young men in all exhilarating and manly sports. He
                  joined a military company, and becoming deeply interested in military science,
                  soon rose to the command. In these and various other ways, Barton preserved
                  vigorous health and that sympathy with active daily life which prevented him from
                  sinking into the recluse babies of a mere student and from every trace or trait of
                  pedagogue formality.
               In school he was the master, and out of school the genial leader of the boys, and
                  in both spheres raised them apparently without an effort.
               It was during this winter and spring of 1858 that two events occurred that
                  produced the greatest effects upon his after life. Before entering upon the first
                  and most momentous it is necessary to precede it by some notice of events which
                  were in many respects intimately concerned with it.
               Our readers have already formed some opinion of Dr. Buell. But thus far it has
                  been casual and exterior. We must ask them now to go with us to the parson's
                  house, and to see him in his family life, with all its peculiarities.
               The minister's house was as white as paint could make it and its window-blinds
                  were of no flimsy Paris-green color, but of a good old-fashioned green—so green
                  that you would almost think it black. Not a blind is open on the front—all is
                  closed, orderly, clean. A front door-yard there is; in one corner an elm tree
                  whose wide-curving branches were the only graceful thing about the place, and, in
                  the far corner, a clump of lilacs, seven or eight stems springing from a centre,
                  and grown almost to the dimensions of trees.
               At the back of the house was a vegetable garden; and, at the far end a stable
                  large enough for a cow and horse, and for the shelter of an old-fashioned chaise.
                  An outlying lot of land sufficed to furnish the hay required for the horse and
                  cow, and a small strip was devoted to potatoes. The horse was the parson's
                  favorite. He literally had no faults. He was never known to kick, or to bite any
                  thing but food. Hay constituting his principal food. a larger quantity was
                  required than would have been if oats or corn had furnished more concentrated
                  nourishment in smaller bulk. Nature, ever kind to her creatures gradually enlarged
                  the barrel of the horse until his belly was puffed out far beyond any requirements
                  of beauty. A large, mild, and sleepy eye revealed but half the quietness of his
                  disposition. His legs might be handled by boys. You might sit down safely between
                  his hind legs. There was no liberty which you could not take, except that of fast
                  driving. You might pour a bushel of potatoes suddenly upon his haunches without
                  producing excitement—not, however, because he was lifeless, but from mere
                  self-possession; for a peck of oats (a luxury seldom ventured!) at the other
                  extremity quickly showed there was life in him.
               He was safe. "Slow and sure," was his maxim. When the good parson was once seated
                  in the chaise, the events were as follows: when the self-possessed animal, with
                  his head and neck declining a little below the line of his back, felt the reins in
                  the doctor's hands he opened his eyes; and having been standing on his three legs,
                  the fourth crooked up and resting on the edge of the hoof, he brought them all
                  squarely under him, as if saying, 'I am all here, sir!' Next the doctor pulled
                  both reins, and they were pulled. Then he lapped them both upon the back, with a
                  gentle slap, and pulled one of them with some decision. The time had come. The
                  horse started, walked into the road, and then, after several admonitions fell into
                  an easy jog, which satisfied the parson is ambition. But no persuasion could carry
                  that trot up the slightest rise in the ground. It was this habit of stopping early
                  in ascending and starting again late in descending hills, that secured to this
                  matchless horse long life and immunity from strains. Dr. Buell innocently told Hiram Beers that he never
                  used bottle of liniment in his life.
               Hiram waited till the parson was out of hearing, and then discoursed:
               "Wal, I'd bet on that! Bottle of liniment! I should as soon think of liniment on a
                  hoe-handle or a gun-stock! That horse thinks it's always Sunday, and that he's
                  goin' to a funeral all the while. I'd give any body five dollars to git three
                  miles an hour out of that critter! If there was two of 'em they wouldn't go a mile
                  an hour, and four such horses—good gracious! it would take a yoke of oxen to start
                  'em anyhow!"
               If you enter the front door of the minister's house the walls will shine upon you
                  with the unblemished whiteness of "hard-finish." Not a spot of dirt not an
                  engraving, not a picture, was allowed to mar the fair expanse. The ceiling was
                  white and glistening, the side walls were white; enter the parlor, a large room
                  consecrated to company, and if the walls had been cut through banks of snow they
                  could not have been whiter or colder. The sitting-room was white and clean. The
                  chambers were all white and all clean, and every chamber was like every other one,
                  and they all together lay like half-a-dozen eggs in a nest.
               One or two extraordinary water-color pictures executed by his wife, as the last
                  consummate efforts of her expiring school-days, had been framed in black, and how
                  hung in the sitting-room. It always pleased Dr. Buell to have visitors notice
                  them, and his invariable comment was, "My wife's paintings!—when she was younger
                  and less occupied. I am told that they are remarkable." They certainly were.
               A portrait also, much smoked and tanned, hung over the fireplace. It was grim and
                  sharp-eyed. Very badly painted, one derived from it a pleasure in thinking,
                  "Nobody ever looked like that!"
               The furniture of the house was very plain, in no wise tending to self indulgence.
                  The single symptom of luxurious ease was the rocking-chair.
               But if once you sat down in it the illusory notion of luxury vanished. It was
                  wooden throughout. Only if some one was sick in the house was there a cushion in
                  it. Its joints by long use had formed a complaining habit and you might in any
                  part of the house know whether the rocking-chair was in active use. We are obliged
                  to say that it was a treacherous chair. The rockers had been curved to such lines,
                  that if you ventured beyond a very gentle motion the chair would give a backward
                  lurch, as if going over, and there are few things more unsatisfactory to a
                  sober-minded person, careful of appearances, than to be carried over backwards in
                  the midst of a quiet conversation. It is true that the chair never did go over.
                  The shape of the rocker was such, that when the victim had spread his arms and
                  flirted his legs into the air, in an involuntary effort at equilibrium, the chair
                  stopped and set itself firmly, as if it had been blocked, returning again to its
                  normal state only upon a violent effort of its occupant. The neighbors were aware
                  of this propensity and avoided the chair. Strangers usually had an experience with
                  it. The good doctor, or his wife, for the hundredth time re-assuring them, "Don't
                  be alarmed. It won't go over. I never knew any body to fall?"
               The doctor's study was the room of the house. Two sides thereof were
                  occupied by shelves laden with books. The supply of theology was large. The
                  critical apparatus for studying both the classical languages and the Hebrew tongue
                  was ample. Histories, sacred and profane, abounded. Select English literature was
                  represented. The doctor's excellent sense was shown in the exclusion from his
                  library of all novels, against which, if we were not writing a history which
                  admits of no delay, we should pause to speak. The Pilgrim's Progress, Milton's
                  Paradise Lost, Scott's Lady of the Lake, and kindred poems, Don Quixote, and two
                  or three of the Waverley series, were found there. But these were not, in his
                  judgment, properly to be called novels. They were beneficial stories. By novels he
                  meant "fictions of an injurious tendency." Accordingly, while he admitted that
                  stories might be sparingly read, novels were always to be avoided.
               The order of the doctor's study was extreme. Regularity had well nigh become
                  formality. Could all his books have been of one size, or could each shelf have
                  presented an even line of well-matched books, it would have pleased him well.
               But in spite of him his books would be picturesque. Some were in paper, and some
                  in leather; some were of octavo size, and some duodecimo; some few had gilt backs,
                  and others sombre black; paper backs in red, in green, in blue, in gray, and
                     russet still added to the mixture.
                  Some fat and thick books stood in a good-natured way, as if saying: "We've got all
                  we want inside!" while, next to them some thin, volume would look as if pinched in
                  its stomach and forever hungry for contents. There were aristocratic volumes—tall,
                  most respectable, and self-important; and next to these, perhaps, a dumpy little
                  volume, squat, like an asthmatic shoemaker.
               Even Dr. Buell when the afternoon sun poured a yellow light into his favorite
                  study and lit up all the various faces of his books, was conscious in a dim way
                  that there was something more pleasant in their looks than their mere order could
                  account for. But fidelity had been well nigh left out in the composition of his
                  mind, and the logical faculty, strong by nature, had struck out its roots by use
                  into all the ground, with such resolute and exhausting growth that the imagination
                  like a fruit-tree caught in a forest could never grow larger than a bush, and bore
                  neither fruit nor blossom.
               He was thoroughly good. Conscience penetrated every faculty of his mind, and gave
                  rest to none of them. As not unusually happens, he felt most condemned for those
                  very qualities in which he excelled. Neither weather nor weariness, nor occupation
                  nor sickness in any common measure could hold him back from those ministrations
                  which he had assumed. Unselfish to a degree unusual even with the benevolent he
                  reproached himself ever day with self-indulgence. Never sparing himself or his
                  time when the poor or the sick needed his ministerial offices, he carried in his
                  heart a feeling that he was guilty of much waste of time and of negligence in the
                  best use of that time which he employed.
               With the material world he had no other relations than such as served the
                  practical and material wants of men. There was little beauty to him in the
                  seasons, though much of usefulness. Colors had little charm for him. Forms seldom
                  attracted his notice. In short, the artist eye and the poet's sympathy for nature
                  seemed utterly foreign to his mind.
               Mrs. Buell was one of those women who, alone, are feeble and colorless, but who,
                  when joined to others derive to themselves the strength and character of their
                  surroundings. Like a vine, she had all the strength of the tree around which she
                  twined and upon which she grew. Her father's house had been always the home of
                  ministers visiting the town. She was educated to regard ministers of the Gospel as
                  the complete ideals of manhood. When the prospect arose before her of being a
                  minister's wife, she could hardly convince herself that the Lord had reserved for
                  her so great a mercy. To her natural and ardent love of Dr. Buell as a man, she
                  added the uttermost reverence for his office, and her household duties seemed to
                  her a perpetual religious service, as much so as if she had lived in a temple, he
                  a priest and she priestess. With a sweet, confiding nature she accepted her,
                  husband's mind, and only used her own when his was not at hand. She never disputed
                  his word or doubted his wisdom. And when, inadvertently, she expressed views not
                  in agreement with his, the moment he disagreed with her she yielded and changed
                  her opinion, as if a God had spoken to her. This was not a grudging submission,
                  nor the fruit of duty, and still less was it in a subservient spirit. Like pure
                  water, she took the color of the sky and clouds that lay above her.
               Of a sweet disposition, always inclined to do right almost without an effort,
                  never doing enough, active beyond her strength, and neat to a degree that no
                  description can measure, she made the Parson's home almost happier than he thought
                  it ought to be.
               "My dear Eliza, I sometimes am afraid that we have too many good things in this
                  life. Our chastisements are so few and so light that I query whether God loves us,
                  'for whom he loveth he chasteneth.'"
               A slight blush of pleasure would come upon her delicate cheek. Sometimes she would
                  say:
               "If our boy had lived, we should have been too happy."
               That boy died at twelve years of age. The neighbors thought that he was not a
                  saint. Therein they differed from his mother. Besides him they had no children.
                  That grief borne, all the rest of their life seemed tranquil and prosperous.
               Unconsciously and gradually her husband became her god. All that he did was right.
                  All that he said was true. He never made mistakes. Not to like her husband was to
                  be bad, of course. To differ with him showed weakness of character. She repeated
                  his sayings with an infantine simplicity. She wondered that other people did not
                  talk more about him. Dr. Wentworth was a great man, because he was warmly attached
                  to her husband. She would not hear a
                  word against Tommy Taft, and she took every word of his speeches to her husband as
                  literal and sober verity.
               "There must be a seed of grace in him," she would say, "or he would not be so fond
                  of good men."
               We may be sure that this did not escape Tommy's eye. He would call at the Parson's
                  house when he was pretty sure not to be at home.
               "The Doctor's not at home, you say? That's my luck! But what a blessin' to this
                  town to have such a minister in't! Sez I to Hiram, t'other day, sez I, 'Hiram, you
                  ought to be a better man than you be, seein' you have sech extraordinary preachin'
                  and example.' But Hiram, you know, marm, though nowise vicious, is not given to
                  speritual things. More's the pity! But what a privilege it must be to you, marm,
                  to be his wife! Remarkable that sech a blessing should be given to just one woman!
                  Your husband don't never swear, marm does he?"
               The start of unaffected amazement with which Mrs. Buell echoed the word "swear!"
                  seemed infinitely gratifying to Tommy, who raised and lowered his shaggy eyebrows
                  several times, saying with each movement:
               "Of course not—of course not. I knew he didn't. If any body had told me that Dr.
                  Buell swore, I wouldn't a b'lieved it on oath. Impossible! impossible! Jest think
                  of it—the Doctor swearin'. Oh, it's beautiful to see a man that don't swear and
                  don't want to. But really, marm—when you see how wicked folks is—what ugly things
                  they will do—don't you think its kind o' natural to swear? Not profane swearing,
                  of course, but pious swearin'."
               "My dear," said Mrs. Buell to her husband, "don't you think Tommy Taft is near to
                  the kingdom? He seems to me to have much that's good in him. I can't but hope
                  there's a work going on slowly in him."
               "Yes—very slowly."
               For several winters Mrs. Buell had suffered from colds. Each year her system
                  seemed less able to resist attacks and more and more weakened by them. She was
                  herself not aware of danger. But her husband instructed by Dr. Wentworth, was
                  seriously uneasy. As winter drew near her strength seemed failing. She struggled
                  bravely and hopefully. But each month reduced the number of hours in which she
                  could attend to household duties. Her face grew thin, but even more beautiful
                  every week. Her eye was never brighter. Her cheek, like an October apple, showed
                  by its brightness that the harvest time was drawing near.
               Not a word was spoken by either of them of that Great Fear, which was dimly
                  disclosing itself to her, and which had long been defined and clearly visible to
                  him.
               During the autumn, Dr. Buell had taken his wife, on various pretexts, to ride with
                  him far oftener than was usual. As cold weather approached, he prepared his house
                  for winter with more care than ever before. New arrangements for heating were
                  introduced. The windows were calked and the doors listed to prevent drafts of air.
                  Little by little the whole economy of the household revolved around this shadowy
                  fear, of which no one spoke. Every one acted as if a danger impeded, but no one
                  uttered a word of it. Even to Dr. Wentworth Parson Buell spoke with muffled
                  indirections, as though to put his fears into words would give them some
                  advantage.
               This could not last. Little by little the invalid yielded one and another task,
                  saying:
               "I don't know what ails me, but I grow so weak."
               In vain were tempting dishes prepared; and jellies, cordials, wines, with which
                  parishioners filled the house, gave no strength. The white upon her countenance
                  grew whiter, and the scarlet more intense. With a gentle reluctance, she gave up
                  one after another of her household duties, but strove to fulfil little personal
                  services to her husband. She looked over his linen every week, and languidly
                  repaired any little break. She laid out for him his Sunday apparel, and saw that
                  his clean white handkerchiefs were duly laid upon his coat. One by one, even these
                  small but precious duties of love were taken from her, and she seemed to herself,
                  as by some invisible power, to be drifting further and further away from him.
               It was one brilliant Sabbath morning in January that she had prepared for her
                  husband his white cravat, which for many years she had fondly placed upon his
                  neck, and tied in a perfect bow, smoothing the ends, and by dainty touches here
                  and there giving the look of neatness and simplicity for which Dr. Buell was
                  noted.
               
               On this morning the bell tolled long for the minister. The deacons looked uneasily
                  toward the door. Such a thing as tardiness was never known in Dr. Buell. What
                  could keep him?
               Deacon Trowbridge, big with an innocent sense of the importance of the matter,
                  looked at the pulpit, then at Deacon Marble, then into the broad aisle, and then
                  closed his eyes for a moment and cleared his throat. He repeated this service once
                  or twice in an codifying manner, and then slowly rose and went over to Deacon
                  Marble to consult.
               First one whispered and the other nodded, then the other whispered and the first
                  one nodded; then both of them looked perplexed. Meanwhile the boys tittered; for
                  while the deacons were absorbed in each other, Dr. Buell had passed down the aisle
                  and entered the pulpit, and his voice, opening the service, put a hasty end to the
                  two deacons' perplexity.
               What had detained him?
               When he came that morning for his cravat, his wife with trembling hands essayed
                  her accustomed offices. She laid back the collar of his vest raised his shirt
                  collar, and sought to clasp his neck with the cravat, but her little strength was
                  gone. Panting, and smiling sadly, she sought to cover the failure by plaiting the
                  cravat a little differently, and again rose to place it round her husband's
                  neck.
               Her hand trembled and failed. Now for the first time the grief brought forth the
                  confession:
               "Oh my husband, I shall never do it again. I am dying, and I must leave you."
               Clasped in his bosom, she gave way to a paroxysm of weeping. There was silence.
                  Tears poured down his face. With ineffable tenderness he bore her to the bed, and
                  kneeling down by her side, he poured out his thanksgiving for all her love and
                  service to him, in broken sentences, wet with tears, as if it were an offering of
                  flowers wet with dew, and in solemn simplicity he gave her back to God, from whose
                  hand he had taken her. The clouds rolled away. From that moment both of them spoke
                  of her death with tender frankness.
               When he arose in the pulpit that morning his voice did not falter. There was
                  neither weakness nor excitement; but there was an irresistible fervor. Once or
                  twice he came so near to the expression of feeling that all the house grew still
                  and the ticking of the round clock on the singing-gallery could be plainly heard
                  all over the church. It was but a moment's weakness, and his strong heart overcame
                  the tendency, and his work went on to the end unfalteringly. Few ever forgot the
                  strange solemnity of that morning.
               Meanwhile a new energy seemed to fill the minister's soul. As he had been jealous
                  always lest any thing should withdraw him from his work, by any self-indulgence,
                  so now he was afraid of the self-indulgence of sorrow. He left nothing unperformed
                  that he had been wont to do. He visited the schools with even more fidelity than
                  hitherto, he held his neighborhood meetings, he was present at all the committees
                  and various circles, which fill up a parish life. But the moment his tasks were
                  done he flew back to his wife's chamber.
               From her childhood his wife had been a member of the church but now that she was
                  so soon to go forth from all temples made with hands, her husband's deepest
                  anxiety was as to her full preparation for the great change. Not one word had he
                  ever uttered to his congregation of the awful issues of the future, that he did
                  not now feel in her behalf who so long had walked with him to the house of God.
                  Day by day, he held up before her the searching tests by which, since the days of
                  Jonathan Edwards, the more earnest New England Christians have tried
                  themselves.
               It would have been a great relief to his soul if instead of a gentle, languid
                  submission to the will of God, she had been favored with more earnest experiences.
                  Her views of her own sinfulness were correct, but without great strength. Her
                  faith was mild, but not strong. She was willing to go, but did not rejoice. She
                  could not say, for a long time, that she was willing to leave her husband. Still
                  more trying was it that she had to confess, that she loved her husband more than
                  any thing else. Her soul had as yet no wings, but would cling and brood in its
                  nest.
               Her husband was jealous for the honor of his Master, and sincerely mourned that
                  his beloved clung to him with such utter and undivided love.
               Agate Bissell, who had lived in the house ever since Mrs. Buell ceased to leave
                  her room, though profoundly sympathizing the minister in his religious views, yet
                  had a sympathy with a woman's nature, which enabled her to help both of them.
               
               "Why do you worry the poor child, doctor? She can't give you up while the Lord
                  keeps you both together! Seems to me it will be time enough to let go of you when
                  the Lord takes off her hand. As long as we are living God will give us living
                  grace, and he won't give us dying grace till, it's time to die. What's the use of
                  trying to feel like dying when you ain't dying—nor anywhere near it? It seems to
                  me that folks that are afraid of not following the Lord, might sometimes be afraid
                  of going before him when not called."
               Dr. Buell made no reply. He looked upon Agate with a thoughtful, wondering look,
                  as if grateful for unexpected help. At length he said, as if hoping help in other
                  points:
               "I have prayed that the Lord would make to her a fuller disclosure of his glory,
                  and that he would give her such an assurance of her acceptance, as would leave us
                  a comforting evidence afterwards."
               "You want your wife to be submissive to God's will. Are you
                  submissive? Are you willing that God shall show his sovereignty by giving just
                  such a dying experience to this poor child as he pleases? She's been all her life
                  clasping round you, tight as a vine, and she's grown so. Now you want her to
                  unclasp, and let go, just when she's so weak and trembling that she needs more
                  than ever she did the support of leaning on and loving you. You are in danger of
                  oppressing one of God's little ones, by putting the burdens of the strong upon
                  her. And as for her evidences, I don't know why a whole life of consistent piety
                  should be thrown away, when you are groping for feelings in a poor,
                  feeble, dying creature, that is too weak to manage her thoughts or feelings."
               Dr. Buell was used to Agate Bissell's straight-forward sense, and now he was more
                  than willing to take the implied rebuke contained in her words. Indeed, his
                  solicitude, his fear of not being faithful, his anxiety that nothing should be
                  left undone in this last great experience of life—departure from it—had somewhat
                  disturbed that nice judgment which he manifested in ministering to others in their
                  last sicknesses.
               It was past the middle of February, and so near to March that already its
                  searching winds were abroad, when the crisis of Mrs. Buell's disease was reached.
                  On a Sunday morning, brilliant but blustering, Dr. Buell proceeded as usual to the
                  church. His wife had not for a long time seemed so well. She lay propped up with
                  pillows. Her wan and wasted face was refreshed this morning with a return of
                  almost childlike beauty. Flowers brought by Rose Wentworth stood near. At her
                  husband's appearance, a very sweet smile went over her face, and, as he stooped to
                  kiss her, she whispered: "The Lord is very good. He sends me great peace to-day.
                  Good-bye! Come back again soon, dear husband!"
               It was the Angel of Peace, whose wings were already bearing her up above all
                  storms or sorrows!
               Dr. Buell was gone scarce half an hour before the sufferer groaned with pain. For
                  a few moments she seemed in anguish. Suddenly she placed her hands on her bosom as
                  if something had given way. The experience of pain faded out of her face—a sweet
                  smile came. She seemed as if she was gazing at some surprising sight. Agate spake
                  to her—spake again. It was vain! Other sounds were now about her, and her voice
                  was heard in other realms!
               Rose was sent to call Dr. Buell. He was in the closing passages of his sermon when
                  he saw the door of the church open and Rose enter. She cast upon him a beseeching
                  look, and then, as if hesitating, she turned and whispered to one who sat near.
                  They both went out into the vestibule.
               Though agitated, his sense of duty in God's house inspired Dr. Buell to finish the
                  morning services in every particular. It was not meet that his private feelings
                  should disturb the services of the sanctuary!
               No sooner had he come forth than Rose met him. Without waiting for her message, he
                  said:
               "Let us hasten! Is she worse?"
               "No;—better!"
               "Is it so? God help me!"
               Bewildered and hardly conscious of surrounding things, he entered the room where
                  his wife lay. He gazed long upon her. Then, in a wandering way, he stretched out
                  his arms and called her, "Eliza! Eliza!" He sat down upon the side of her bed. He
                  placed his hands upon her face. He took her poor little hand in his. There was the
                  wedding-ring, and no other had she ever worn! All the past seemed to come back
                  upon him.
               
               "Dead? Impossible!—Eliza!—speak! just one word! Speak! Oh my wife!"
               Then with all the fond names which he had ever used he plead with her.
               Agate and Rose withdrew—let us draw back! This first sorrow is for the soul's self
                  only, and for God!"
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               THE TWO SEXTONS.
               "GOOD morning, Mr. Turfmould," said Tommy Taft. "Fine weather. Very busy you were
                  yesterday!—a solemn day."
               "Yes, Mr. Taft, a fine funeral—as fine a funeral as ever I see. Such lessons must
                  have an effect on the careless and worldly."
               "You must be a judge of sech matters, by this time, Turfmould!"
               "I've been in my business nigh about thirty years. I've done most of the
                  respectable buryin' hereabouts, and though I say it that shouldn't say it, I've as
                  good judgment about a funeral as the next man!"
               "I thought the hull country had turned out. I never saw so many folks in that
                  church. There must have been fifty carriages."
               "Fifty? nearer a hundred! Then there was six ministers from out of town, besides
                  all that lives here. Gener'ly a funeral in the week time is like a shadow in one
                  spot. But yesterday it was a cloudy day all over town. Indeed, it was just like
                  Sunday."
               "Only a good deal more so."
               "Yes—a good deal more so. It was certainly edifyin'."
               "Ah!" said Tommy Taft, with a look of great simplicity, "the ministers were all
                  very well, but folks couldn't keep their eyes off from you and that beautiful
                  coffin."
               "A better coffin was never brought into town. Poor thing! I knew her taste. She
                  was awful neat. The last thing afore they put the linin' in I went myself and
                  stood the coffin on end, and brushed it out every crack and corner, just as she
                  would have done herself, poor sufferin' creature, if she had been there. But she
                  was a kind thing—very good to folks in distress, and I felt like suitin' her 'if I
                  could. I just said to myself, 'Turfmould, this is the last time you can pay her
                  back any thing for all she did for your child, poor thing!'
               
               "I tell yer, Mr. Taft, I never quite liked the way that funeral was served on my
                  child! Tompkins hasn't got the feelin's that our profession requires. Do you
                  s'pose I would take advantage of him, if he'd had a body in his
                  house, and one of his own bodies, too, a child, or a wife, or somethin' like that?
                  That's no time to run a fellow, when he's doin' his own mournin'. Nobody loves his
                  child any better'n I did mine. And there wasn't a puttier girl in this town, that
                  was allowed on all hands. Yes, sir. They used to call her the lily of the
                  grave-yard—they did. That was a delicate allusion to my bizness, you know. I
                  hadn't expected that she'd drop off. When I got back from Squire Cheney's funeral,
                  and was putting up my hoss, Pete he came out, and looked at me a kind of wet and
                  wild-like, and so I run past him, and went in. Oh, dear me! I don't like to tell
                  about it. My wife she didn't say any thing, and I didn't say any thing, and Rhoda
                  didn't say any thing. She lay on the bed, and her hair hung down on the pillow,
                  and her face was white—and her mother never cried, and couldn't; she didn't look
                  at me, nor at the poor child, neither, and didn't stir; and I never saw two folks
                  look so much alike as they two did; and both of 'em, you know, was called Rhoda! I
                  never was in such a peck of troubles. I thought I'd go for the minister, and then
                  I thought of Dr. Wentworth, and just then, who should open the door but the
                  Doctor's Rose? She'd been comin' every day, and fetchin' things, and she loved
                  Rhoda dearly. The child just worshipped Rose. Well, she came in and had some
                  flowers, and she walked straight up to the bed, and said 'Rhoda, Rhoda,' and then
                  she sort o' came to the meanin' of things; and she looked with her great blue eyes
                  at the poor dead thing, with such a lovin' way, that I rally thought the child's
                  face was gittin' brighter; and once I thought she was comin' to; her face trembled
                  like; but it was just my eyesight,—you know when tears are movin' round you can't
                  see very correct."
               At this he wiped his eyes with the back of his hand; and drawing a large red
                  handkerchief from his pocket, he gave a sonorous blowing, sounding, as Tommy Taft
                  said, like the rams' horns around Jericho.
               "Well, I was sittin' on the foot of the bed, tryin' to git over it, when the door
                  opened agin, and Rhoda's mother came in—that is my wife's mother, you know,—and
                  walked right up to the mother. And afore she had time to say a word, Rhoda she riz
                  right up, and gave such a scream as never was heard afore, I do believe. It cum
                  from the very heart. Oh, Lord, how it hurt me! 'Rhody, Rhody' sez I, 'don't for
                  pity sakes!' But I didn't need to say so, for that's the last time she ever opened
                  her mouth. I don't wonder. There was a year's feelin' in that one scream, and it
                  killed her. She sort o' fell in her mother's arms, and Rose and she got her on the
                  bed, and she lay sleepin' like through the night, and in the mornin' when the sun
                  rose she was gone, and nobody knew when she breathed her last. And then I had two
                  bodies in the house at a time. Providence don't often provide such materials for a
                  funeral. Well, I found it putty hard. Rose, she sent for Alice Cathcart, and they
                  wouldn't let any body touch her but themselves; and Rose, she put flowers 'round
                  her, and said she was the sweetest flower of 'em all; and Rose kept smilin' and
                  cryin' softly all the time,—and was as gentle, and lovin', and careful of me as if
                  I'd been her father; and she cum to me when I sat in the door, next day, feelin'
                  as if I was dead inside and couldn't feel, only my head it went on thinkin',—she
                  cum and read the Bible to me. At first I couldn't hear much, only her voice was
                  sweet and comfortin'; but as she went on, I seemed to cum to myself just as she
                  was readin', 'And Jesus said, Suffer little children to come unto
                  me, and forbid them not, for such is the kingdom of Heaven. And he took them up in
                  his arms, and put his hands upon them and blessed them.' It seemed as if I heard
                  somebody say this in the air; and I felt as if I knew what had become of Rhody,
                  and her mother, too—for she warn't more'n a child herself—and I bust into tears,
                  and didn't feel as bad agin through the hull of it. Well, at first I thought I
                  should send down to Springfield for a funeral. Tompkins hadn't done the right
                  thing by me, and though we never had any words, we'd had more'n enough feelin's.
                  He had a smooth way of edgin' into my custom. When young Brace was buried, every
                  body said, I ought to have had it.
               "And then he hadn't no family of his own and there wasn't no chance for me some
                  time, in like circumstances, you know. Well, this is the way I got out of it: I'd
                  been sittin' still after Rose left off reading, and I heard somebody talkin' in
                  the room where Rhody was—both of 'em—and I went to the door, and there was Rose and Alice kneelin' down by the
                  pillow, and Rose was prayin'. Such a sweet prayer I never did hear. It beat the
                  minister all to nothin', and it was fall of thanks, and as happy as a Spring bird
                  is when he sets in the apple trees yonder and sings; and when she stopped I went
                  back and sot down, and all my feelin's was changed and I said: 'Git thee behind
                  me, Satan. Tompkins shall have this funeral;' and so he did. I'll say
                  this for him, that I believe he tried to do about right. But nature is strong, you
                  know, and I did think he took on a leetle more than he need to.
                  Mebby, if it had been me, I should have done so too. It makes a difference, you
                  know, whose house a funeral's in. And when we was all in the carriages, and the
                  two coffins was in the hearse,—he wanted two hearses, but that would not be in
                  good taste. I didn't like so much show, and besides, I knew the mother ought to
                  keep her child close to her;—and when the procession was ready, he came walkin' up
                  to see, for the last time, if all was right, it wa'n't in human nature to keep in
                  his satisfaction with the occasion! And when he mounted and sat down with the
                  driver on the leadin' carriage, I do believe there wasn't so proud a man in this
                  town.
               "Well, he was very kind though, and we've never had any words since then; and,
                  considerin' the temptations of the business, we are pretty good friends; and so I
                  thought it fair, when the minister's wife was goin' to be buried, to show him some
                  attention, so I asked him to officiate with me. Every body knew that it was
                     my funeral, and it looked right to let folks see that there wasn't
                  no jealousy. I think such a great loss ought to produce a solemnizing effect on
                  everybody, particularly the young. I always try to make my funerals means of grace
                  to somebody. Every body's got to die. Nobody dies but once, though, and any good
                  you're goin' to git out of 'em, you must git then. So I thought I ought to to ask
                  Dr. Buell if he had any thing specially improvin' to suggest. But he turned as
                  pale as ashes when he saw me, and shuddered all over as if he had a chill comin'
                  on, and Agate Bissell, she said, in a hurry like, as she pushed me out, that he
                  wa'n't in a state of mind to see me.
               "But I went over to Tompkins, and he and I consulted about it.
               "'Tompkins,' says I, 'this is a peculiar occasion.'
               "'Yes,' says he, 'it is. It's enough to make one's reputation.'
               "'Now I want,' says I, 'to have just such a funeral as would suit her, so that if
                  she could come back, she'd say, "I thank you, Mr. Turfmould; you have done exactly
                  to my mind." You know that if there was a woman in this town who hated dirt, she's
                  that woman, and I think we're bound to respect her taste when she's gone just as
                  much as if she's livin'.'
               "'Well, that's easy enough,' said Tompkins. 'We can slick up every thing with
                  extra care, and have a double inspection of all the materials—'
               "'Well, that of course; but I was thinkin' about the grave. You know you can't dig
                  a grave and have no dirt. Deceive ourselves as we will, you know we've all got to
                  come to it,—dust we are and to dust we return; but then, you know, we can break
                  the matter gently like, keep a large tarpaulin lyin' over the dirt and then I mean
                  to cover the outside box with turf, which keeps the gravel and stuff
                  from rattlin' in when the coffin is down.'
               "'That's a good idea,' sez he, 'and I think all your arrangements are good. They
                  are new, and ought to be fashionable.'
               "'I don't care for fashion,' says I. 'I think it will be comfortin' to the
                  minister and respectful to her memory. I've seen things managed quite the
                  contrary. You know when Bidwell's wife died, they put him in the coach with his
                  sister-in-law, and they had always quarrelled, and they didn't mend matters that
                  journey. Old Bidwell told me of it. Says he, 'If I ever have another funeral you
                  shall have it, Turfmould. Jones is no sort of a manager. He just spoilt my wife's
                  whole funeral. I never took a bit of comfort in it from beginning to end.'
               "'But Dr. Buell had no reason to say that,' says Tompkins. 'I am sure we did every
                  thing that we could. I think Kyle beat himself with those flowers. I never saw
                  such splendid funeral flowers. I didn't know what flowers was made for till I saw
                  wreaths, and crosses, and dishes. Flowers is certainly very useful, and, if well
                  managed, considerable profit may come from them.'"
               For some reason Tommy Taft seemed to enjoy this exhibition of professional feeling
                  with the utmost inward satisfaction. He let the sexton go on uninterrupted, except
                  a word here and there to set him forward again.
               
               "Well, Mr. Turfmould," said Tommy, at length, "it's a serious loss to the town,
                  but that's nothin' to what 'tis to Dr. Buell. I really pity him. There's no
                  mistake the minister feels it. He acts as though he'd lost somethin', and didn't
                  exactly know where to look for it."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               THE FRUIT OF SORROW.
               NOTHING strikes all value out of the ordinary affairs of life so soon as sorrow.
                  It works alike in all, but the deepest natures are the most affected by it. A
                  single blow descends, and the world is changed, and rises before the eye as
                  another creation. Yesterday the soul surveyed its garden, to-morrow it will see
                  only a wilderness.
               Sorrows work upon the soul as late rains do upon vegetation. All night a cold rain
                  falls, and in the morning the leaves are gone. The coverts are no longer shady,
                  trees hold up bare branches, and the air with every puff of wind is filled with
                  leaves, languidly descending to the ground. After the first shock and excitement
                  of grief, which sometimes carries the soul high up toward serene experiences,
                  comes the reaction. The nerve of pleasure is paralyzed. All objects report
                  themselves to the senses in sombre colors. Values are changed or destroyed. Life
                  is empty and effort useless. In thoughtful natures next arise anxious
                  questionings. The breaking up of the heart seems, for a time, to overturn the
                  conclusions of the reason itself. Men doubt their most settled beliefs, and bold
                  skepticisms invade the secret calm of Faith. While the nobler sentiments are
                  silent and torpid, there spring up in their place sudden repulsions and capricious
                  disgusts.
               The valley and shadow of Death is not dreadful to those who pass
                     through it, but to those who follow after but may not
                  pass through!
               Dr. Buell, whose simplicity was childlike, felt himself strangely tempted. Such
                  terrible thoughts never before assaulted him. For a refuge he sought his study,
                  that there in pious meditations and devotions he might combat the adversary.
               But, after a little, he fled out of it as from a furnace. Such horrible doubts
                  assailed him—such wicked feelings coursed through his heart, that he almost
                  believed himself given over of God. His very struggles increased his difficulty.
                  They heightened the excitement, and carried him further from rest and nearer to a
                  morbid condition. His discourses on the first Sunday after the burial of his wife were even more impressive than
                  usual and his flock admired the faith which lifted him above such sorrow. On the
                  second Sunday a marked change was visible. His sermon, like own soul, was
                  irregular and unbalanced. The quick eye of Dr. Wentworth discerned the minister's
                  condition. Now it was that friendship could make itself felt. He affected to have
                  much need of the minister. He carried him to-day in one direction to counsel a
                  dying person, to-morrow he consulted him respecting some orphan children. It was
                  necessary, too, it seemed, that he should go with Dr. Wentworth to a school
                  district lying remote from the village. During these rides, which were every day
                  varied be gently drew from the minister an account of his experiences, and
                  prescribed so skilfully for both his moral and his physical need that months of
                  suffering, and perhaps the usefulness of his life, were saved.
               "Nothing exhausts vitality faster than the exertion of the will," said Dr.
                  Wentworth. "Already the tone of your nerves is lost. You are still further
                  reducing yourself by attempting to restrain and combat irregular and morbid action
                  by simple will-power. The disease and the remedy are both of them exhausting you.
                  Let yourself alone. Avoid solitude. Turn to the help of others. Take on business
                  which will occupy without tasking your mind. Nothing is half so medicinal for our
                  troubles as benevolent sympathy and occupation in the troubles of others. This is
                  the true moral recreation."
               "But is it right, doctor, that one should seek relief from trouble sent of God,
                  except by going to the hand that has afflicted?"
               "He seeks God who accepts His laws," said the doctor. "The best preparation for
                  personal communion is a devout fulfilment of the duties owed to God through
                  natural laws. He who asks God's help should at least show respect to his laws, and
                  not make prayer merely a petition for the suspension of the penalties of the
                  violated laws of mind."
               Dr. Wentworth's efforts availed so far as to rescue the minister from the danger
                  of breaking down in health. Little by little his spirits rose. Yet life seemed
                  changed and emptied. He turned all his powers into his ministerial work. A new
                  fervor filled his preaching. His appeals became more tender and solemn. It was
                  noticed that gradually the audience was filling up. Men listened with more
                  earnestness. Week after week the community were moving together in one direction,
                  under the influence of the profoundest sentiments which can inspire the human
                  soul.
               Judge Bacon was sitting in Dr. Wentworth's library, one Sunday evening, and seemed
                  unusually talkative. Yet, there was an emphasis and point not ordinarily observed
                  in his half-negligent and polished manner.
               "The parson has a grand battue on hand."
               "Ah? I don't understand."
               "Why he has for several weeks past been sweeping around the people with his grand
                  doctrines; and now the circle is formed, and he is driving in toward the centre.
                  Oh, you'll 
                     see see
                     see
                   rare slaying before long."
               Dr. Wentworth made no answer, but sat as one who is meditating.
               "You can see," said Judge Bacon, "every Sunday he advances a step. I've seen this
                  thing before. I know how it will end. By and by there will come a break down;
                  then, like frightened sheep, a crowd will make a rush toward the church-doors,
                  pell-mell. After a while, a count will be made, and the results published. The
                  upshot of it will be that, while before, one hundred selfish, bustling,
                  disagreeable people lived outside of the church, afterwards they will live inside
                  of the church—that's all."
               Still Dr. Wentworth made no reply. At length Judge Bacon said abruptly:
               "Doctor, do you believe in Revivals?"
               "Certainly."
               "You surprise me! I had supposed that you were too firm and intelligent a believer
                  in Natural Law."
               "It is on that ground that I believe in Revivals. In every department of life men
                  are moved in masses, And, as it were, with social contagions. Few men in any thing
                  act alone. They kindle themselves in the simplest employment by social contact.
                  Social enthusiasm have characterized the progress of the race in every department
                  of society."
               "Because societies have been rude," said Judge Bacon, " and men have been animal
                  in nature, and it is no wonder that their animal feelings should be excited."
               "On the contrary," replied the doctor, "animals are not subject ject to social enthusiasm, or only in the most
                  rudimentary manner. Men are susceptible of such excitement in proportion as they
                  recede from animal conditions. In art, in amusements, in social improvement, in
                  patriotism, men tend to act in masses, to be kindled by each other to enthusiasm,
                  and such conditions develop, not obstruct, the active powers. This social
                  excitement is favorable to taste, affection, judgment, and reason. I do not know
                  why moral emotions should be exempt from this same law."
               "But you can plainly see that these things are got up. I can give you a
                  prescription for a revival."
               "Why not?" replied Dr. Wentworth. "Is not education 'got up?' Is not art culture
                  'got up?' Is not your own profession, and mine, 'got up?' Why should men be afraid
                  to speak of moral states as the result of deliberate and intentional effort? Why
                  should not men apply the term education to moral faculties as well as to others?
                  and study for moral results as they do for social or æsthetic? Are not the moral
                  sentiments subject to laws as much as any other parts of the mind?"
               "Yes—but church people imagine that revivals descend upon them from above; that
                  they are mysterious and divine; that the less human agency is concerned in them
                  the purer they will be."
               "It is only another instance," said the doctor, "in which a fact is recognized
                  before the theory of its causation is understood. I do not the less believe that a
                  divine influence is experienced because it pursues the channels of established
                  law. Men account for phenomena by natural laws, as far as their knowledge goes,
                  and then they ascribe whatever is left over, beyond their knowledge of causation,
                  to superior beings. The higher ranges of human experience are the most complex and
                  subtle, and seem mysterious, because the lines of causation are finer and more
                  spiritual. But the profoundest mysteries of human experience will one day be found
                  to furnish the most admirable illustrations of the universality and constancy of
                  natural laws."
               "I don't see, Doctor, but you are as bad as the rest of them. I shall have to be a
                  philosopher without company. It will never do for us to submit to this influence.
                  An enthusiasm, in my mind, would mix up things worse than a wind in my study would
                  dishevel my papers. I shall stand aloof and see others act."
               The doctor continued:
               "All nations, pretending to moral life, have been subject to these outbursts of
                  feeling. It is all very well to declare that a gradual and constant progress in
                  goodness would be better. Such is not the law of development. Nations advance by
                  paroxysms. The race has gone up not by steady improvement, but by leaps, with long
                  rests between. At a later period, when society has reached a higher plane than at
                  present, progress may become even, uniform, and constant. At present that seems
                  impossible. And we are to regard these moral freshets as admirable, relatively to
                  the wants of the whole community."
               Here the discussion ended for that time.
               We have little idea of the power of truths till we see their action, without
                  obstruction, upon a whole community that is aroused to a sensitive and sympathetic
                  condition. Truths ordinary run through societies as gold does in rocks—a thin vein
                  shut in by wide measures of stone. When enough men hold a truth in common to give
                  to that truth a social influence, its range and power become greatly increased;
                  but no one knows the very royalty of a truth until the whole community are
                  aroused, made sensitive and sympathetic, and give to truth the force of glowing
                  enthusiasm. Not only is the power of a truth thus disclosed, but a community is
                  knit together and enriched by being made subject to some one worthy impulse all
                  together, by consciously holding some great truth with a common enthusiasm. And if
                  the truth is a profound moral truth, and the enthusiasm a moral enthusiasm, no man
                  can measure the cleansing inspiring, and strengthening influence arising from such
                  a unity and intensity of experience as it produces.
               The indirect effects of those moral experiences called revivals, in vivifying the
                  moral sense, elevating the sentiments, and giving to daily life a larger moral
                  element—in bringing over secular things the shadow of the Infinite, are so
                  important that they should be accounted great benefits, quite independently of the
                  special personal reformations which they work.
               This religious movement, which was itself remotely connected with Dr. Buell's
                  bereavement, was one of the occurrences which we alluded to in the last chapter as
                  having an important influence upon Barton's life. It brought to a head a long
                  train of moral symptoms.
               With his mental organization, and with the domestic influences which had from his childhood been acting upon him,
                  Barton Cathcart could hardly fail to be of a religious turn. But in New England,
                  preeminently, the religious dispositions and affections are required to be
                  conjoined with the great philosophical statements of religious truths. It is not
                  enough that one is good, he must be sound. There is a practical toleration toward
                  those whose lack of education or feebleness of mind gives no power of reasoning
                  upon such themes as are involved in the great doctrines of revealed religion. But
                  in proportion as men are educated is the demand intensified that right affections
                  shall proceed front right beliefs.
               Young Cathcart, during the last two years of his college course had found his
                  religious life passing from a state of acquiescent acceptance into one of eager
                  questioning. His Reason was asserting its sovereignty. Should he believe because
                  his parents and teachers did? Should he suffer himself, among so many sects,
                  holding widely different beliefs, to be located without any deliberate
                  investigation or honest judgment of his own? Was a man to be superscribed by his
                  parents, like a letter, and sent to this or that church?
               To this rebound of reason from youthful faith was added the influence of
                  scientific studies, to which his taste had strongly inclined him. But the result
                  was far other than he had anticipated. He proposed to himself to open, investigate
                  and settle, one by one, the great truths of religion. He but half succeeded. He
                  opened but could not close. He had power to bring into doubt every one of his
                  childhood beliefs, but he had neither the experience nor the grasp required to
                  conduct them back to certainty.
               He began to feel that convictions did not follow logic. The feelings must be
                  consulted, and the imagination as well as the reason, in re-establishing
                  faith.
               At one time he would drift far away from all positive belief. All the more
                  familiar truths seemed paralyzed. As men look back upon nations in the olden time,
                  and know that amid their fondest convictions they were in profound error—that
                  their gods were myths, their histories half fables, and their theology a mere
                  fiction, so now and then it came home to him with ghastly distinctness, that a
                  time would come when men would look back upon him and his generation in the same
                  manner.
               From these dreary solitudes, Barton would rebound, after a time, into an
                  enthusiastic re-acceptance of all his childhood faith. He was enraged at himself
                  and at his intellect for robbing him of peace.
               It was like him to carry on these conflicts within himself silently, and without
                  help from. others. Thus for two or three years his soul rose and fell like the
                  tides. He was swept far out into the solitudes of the sea, where sometimes silent
                  mists, and sometimes mighty storms befell him. Then, with inexpressible relief,
                  the current changed, and be swept shoreward, and flowed in again to familiar bays
                  and rivers and rejoiced in the old places.
               This could not continue always. The painfulness of this dreary uncertainty at
                  length had become so great that he relinquished all thought of religious themes,
                  in so far as he could, and assisted himself in his efforts by excessive
                  application to study. During the first year after he graduated, he had contrived
                  to smother his difficulties and to maintain a peace which he hoped would become
                  permanent.
               In this state of mind when a deep religious movement began in Norwood, he found
                  that his troubles were only covered up, not extinguished.
               His mother's solicitude that he should rise into an open and earnest religious
                  life was extreme. She ventured but a few words, but they were like arrows. Dr.
                  Wentworth and his family left Barton to follow his own bent without seeking to
                  force it. Dr. Buell, kindly but firmly, pressed him with considerations of duty.
                  Barton shrank from disclosing his real state. If he had reached any settled
                  convictions he would have had courage to avow and defend them; but to say that the
                  religion of his childhood had let go and dropped away from him, and that he held
                  in doubt all that those most dear to him held in a blessed certainty, was to make
                  himself the victim of feelings worse than pity. He lived in a community where to
                  be an unbeliever was to be a criminal.
               A new misery befell him. The consciousness of a secret life utterly at discord
                  with his seeming life, and with that of those dearest to him began to raise in him
                  the fear that he was practising insincerity;—that lie was living a false and
                  double life. He abhorred duplicity. He loved truth and frankness. And yet, in
                  matters of the most vital moment, he was living a life utterly different from that
                  while all that knew him supposed. At times his distress grew so great that he was on the point of
                  disclosing his feelings. But to whom? Not to his mother. That would pierce her
                  without relieving him. Not to Rose. He shuddered at the thought. It would be like
                  letting night down upon his already faint hopes. Should it be to Dr. Buell? But
                  the doctor, he thought, had never doubted as he had, and could, therefore, have no
                  sympathy with one upon whom an argument and a text produced little salutary
                  effect. The question was soon answered for him.
               "I have called," said Parson Buell to Dr. Wentworth, "to speak with you concerning
                  our common friend Barton Cathcart. I have talked with him several times on the
                  great subject on which so many are interested. But I obtained no response. It was
                  plain to me that his thoughts were disturbed and from certain signs I am led to
                  fear that his views are unsettled. I am distressed to think that this season may
                  pass and leave no blessing for him. We cannot endure to see a nature so noble made
                  a cast-away. Perhaps it will be in your power to aid at least to ascertain his
                  true state. The spring is passing. Summer will soon be here. He is a child of
                  faith and of many prayers. I am aware of his partiality for you, and of the great
                  influence which your mind has over him. It may be that he will repose in you a
                  confidence which he seems indisposed to place in me."
               The doctor promised to give to Barton an early opportunity of conversation, should
                  he wish it. But it came even before he sought it. Rose on the next morning told
                  her father that Barton had been questioning her on many points of religious
                  belief, and had expressed a wish to converse with her father.
               That very evening Dr. Wentworth and Barton were long together. The result only of
                  their conversation did the doctor deem it best to report to Dr. Buell.
               "I think Barton has stumbled at the letter, but has not fallen from the spirit of
                  the Record. Unskilful handling of his own case has made him morbid. He desires the
                  truth as an unwanted child yearns for its mother's breast. It ought not to be
                  difficult for such a one to find firm faith. His is a clear instance of that doubt
                  which has widely sprung up in the track of physical science. It arises from the
                  introduction of a totally new method of investigation. It must be met
                  on its own ground. If the distinguishing doctrines of grace have their types and
                  root in nature, as I believe lieve they have, then evidence from that source will
                  reach the trouble. The alphabetic forms of moral truth found at large in the world
                  will serve to teach one at length how to read those clearer manifestations of the
                  divine nature, and of moral government which are perfectly disclosed only in the
                  life and teachings of our Saviour."
               But we prefer to let Barton Cathcart speak for himself. From a private journal we
                  extract a few passages.
               
                  BARTON CATHCART'S JOURNAL.
                  "June 10.—To-day has been full of excitement. I have seen Rose.
                     Why do I seek to unsettle her peace? Should I love her, if her soul wandered as
                     mine does? Am I not drawn to her by her deep peace, by that very faith that
                     does not falter? And yet I am provoked that she is tranquil and I am not. Why
                     should she have all the gifts of God and I none? Every thing with her tends to
                     fullness of peace, and to gayety and joy. But I am heavily laden. Thought only
                     mires me deeper. I cannot get my consent to relinquish it. It follows me—haunts
                     me. I cannot accept the religion of my fathers. I cannot get rid of it. I am
                     vibrating between faith and skepticism. I envy little children. I would give
                     all the world if I could go back to be like them—to have their unfaltering
                     trust in truth. I am giddy and whirled and very unhappy.
                  "Dr. Wentworth told me yesterday that my trouble was that I was living in my
                     own personality; that I was too low down to see the truth; that I should never
                        reason my way through; that moral truth could not be perceived
                     by pure reason; that it must leave an emotive inspiration, and come first as an
                     experience, and afterward, if at all, as an analysis and deduction; that I must
                     grow tired and despair of engineering my way by mere reason; that when I came
                     into a state of moral exaltation, I should see truth and its harmony; even then
                     that it would not be expressible; that a moral view that satisfied
                     a full nature could not be reduced to terms of language. I have had several
                     conversations with him. He, if anyone, can help me. But how to come to that
                     exaltation? Am I to believe what I don't believe, in the hope that it will
                     kindle my moral feelings to luminousness? Am I to stultify my reason first, in
                     order to educate it?
                  
                  "Yet, the doctor knows the courses of scientific thought; he certainly has kept
                     pace with the knowledge of skeptical schools, and yet he is a Christian
                     believer. He seems to carry nature and Christianity in harmony. He is certainly
                     at rest. That I do know. I have too sure an instinct not to know who are
                     doubting. My sore heart is so sensitive that I feel, almost before I hear one
                     speak, what he will say. I am repelled from those who are at rest in unbelief.
                     Judge Bacon chills me. I rebound from Wentworth, because he believes, and from
                     Bacon because he does not. His cold touch shocks me. I feel when he talks about
                     religion as I should if my mother were dead and I saw a surgeon using her body
                     for anatomical demonstrations. All my life is woven into Christian faith; to
                     rid myself of it is to tear every thread that connects me with the past, with
                     childhood, with home, with taste, with love, with knowledge itself. What is a
                     thread worth drawn out of the fabric? That is a man separated from the
                     influences and beliefs that formed him, and that are woven into society. Dr.
                     Buell warned me against becoming fascinated with specious unbelief, said that
                     the pride of my heart would deceive me and flatter me to my ruin. Great God!
                     what is there attractive in not believing? It is living torture. I am like a
                     man who, walking unconsciously, has slipped into a dry well, whose sides defy
                     climbing. I am alone, men walk a hundred feet above me—perhaps near me—no one
                     hears, no one extricates. I look up and see the sky, only to measure how deep
                     my grave is and how hopeless of ascent! I am alone there—I am without food or
                     water or companionship, at the bottom of a well, looking up in despair of ever
                     again feeling benign influences! Fascinations of skepticism! They are to me the
                     fascinations of the torture-room, they are as attractive as nightmares in a
                     fever!!
                  "To all the rest is this secret horror that I am separated by my miserable
                     state from Rose. She could never love me, could she see what a soul I bear. I
                     would not deceive her if I could. Could a man of honor, if he was diseased, be
                     so foolish as to hide it from a woman whom he honored—knowing that he would
                     secure her hatred when she discovered it? But how much more is a soul and mind
                     in disorder than a body? I dare not love Rose and lose her. I do love her, and
                     despair of ever coming nearer to her. She would not love me, I know, if she
                     knew me. I would not be united to her if she in her divine kindness, would!
                     What, marry a mere nurse! a soul nurse! Marry for my own sake, and not for
                     hers! Bring her no peace? no joy? no larger life than she had before? I wish
                     that I could worship God as easily as I can Rose.
                  "June 15.—My school, at any rate, is helped by my inward
                     disquiet. I seek relief in labor and thought. I fly from those sad and dreary
                     moods, introverted and self-conscious. They ruin me and would poison every one
                     should I infect them. I watch my scholars to see if they know that I am
                     swinging like an unlighted star in a great circuit of darkness eternal motion
                     without light or rest. I shrink from them as if I were false to my place, and
                     had no business with children. Oh! those dear faces, turned up to me with such
                     clear trust, I look upon them with unutterable feelings. God! suffer not
                     contagion to go from me! I redouble my energy. I seek to fire them with ardor
                     and honor. I seek to so burden myself with duties toward them that I shall have
                     no room for suffering myself.
                  "They certainly answer to my exertion. All the nobler natures are inspired by
                     me with almost romantic zeal. I see by their eyes admiration and fondness; but
                     it falls upon me as the ardor of worshippers once fell on marble gods. I am
                     cold to it. I have that sense of unmanly suffering, of soul disquiet, of utter
                     ruin.
                  "June 20.—A strange experience befell me yesterday. My day's work
                     was done. My walk was completed. The sun had gone down. I had fallen into one
                     of those balanced states of mind in which is calm, and all the evening scenes
                     tended to soften even to tenderness. A robin flew into the trees over against
                     my room, and began that peculiar song which indicates the absence of its mate.
                     It is the sweetest and most passionate of all their singing. And since I have
                     learned that it is a call of loneliness for company, of love for
                     love, it seems to me very exquisite, though very sad. I sat in the window till
                     the light had faded, the song growing more and more restless and almost
                     expostulatory. Soon the bird flew and I heard it again further off; and, after
                     a little, it seemed to have flown yet further, and its now waning notes died
                     out in distance. My soul was strangely affected. I almost ceased to be
                     conscious of my body. Stealing up from the east, the moon threw a light on the
                     valley, upon the tops and edges of the village trees. There lay Holyoke and its silent fellows brooding in
                     sombre silence. I was inexpressible sad. I seemed alone, helpless, unhappy. I
                     involuntarily called out, 'My God, why hast thou forsaken me?'
                     What followed I can account for only as a phantasy. Or was it
                     real? Is there still an inspiration? I did not think.
                     It was seeing rather! The whole heaven seemed full of ineffable
                     gentleness. It seemed as if I was caught up into it, and felt borne in upon me
                     a sense of God's care for me—his love, his wisdom in guiding me. A wonderful
                     conviction seemed to flow in on me that I should surely be brought out of my
                     darkness, and that all this trouble of soul was like the trouble which a seed
                     feels when yet under ground—dying that it may sprout and live. Then, all
                     unbidden, there sprung upon me such a desire to praise God as I had never felt
                     before or imagined. For the first time in my life I had a conception of
                        infinite love. I had heard the words before. Now I had a sense
                     of the thing itself. All my soul seemed urgent to utter itself and I could not
                     speak a word! The psalms rushed before me in which trees, mountains, sun, moon,
                     stars, all nature, were called upon to join in praising God. But how strangely
                     different in effect! Before, I had read them as one hears Handel's Messiah, in
                     fragments, on a piano. Now it was as I imagine the Messiah to have been when
                     thousands of singers and instruments gave it forth in all its grandeur at
                     Westminster Abbey. Every thing within me became heroic. I could have yielded my
                     life with ineffable joy to please God. All complaining seemed to me like dust
                     which one kicks with the feet. I was absorbed and almost identified with this
                     Universal Presence. And now, as remember it, the strangest part of the
                     experience though at the time it did not strike me as such, was the nourishing
                     pity with which I looked upon myself. I seemed to comfort myself, as if my
                     higher self was consoling a lower self. I felt a true and ineffable pity and
                     sorrow for myself, for my doubts and yearnings, for my longing ambitions and
                     unsatisfied striving; and it seemed to be borne in upon me, in a way such as no
                     words could have done it, that all my faculties, tendencies, aspirations, had
                     their natural and perfect fulfilment in God, and not in attaining any thing in
                     myself. I remember a sort of figure that seemed to come forth from nature to
                     me—that flowers never blossomed inwardly, into themselves, but outwardly, into
                     the light, and that all the beauty they had, either of form or color, was what
                     they borrowed from the light which they received and reflected, and so a soul,
                     it seemed to me, was never happy or beautiful except when it was unfolding into
                     God.
                  "How long my trance lasted I cannot say. I threw myself upon the bed without
                     undressing. A tide of tranquil delight gently flowed through my soul. I asked
                     myself whether, were it God's will, I could yield up all my prospects in life.
                     The mere thought of pleasing God seemed rapturous. I repeated 'Thy will be
                     done,' and the effect was wonderful. I had a vision—shall I call it—of the
                     divine beauty, and of a realm which was glorified by its shining light, and all
                     my desires, personal and secular shrunk and faded. In that exceeding light and
                     beauty I seemed to myself unutterably insignificant. The course of my thoughts,
                     the nature of my feelings, the ambitions and pursuits of my life seemed under a
                     shadow—stained, and poor, and degrading. I never imagined before what it meant
                     to be a man nor how far I had been from it. In those blissful moments I tested
                     my feelings for Rose. If any thing in my life had before seemed to me pure and
                     noble, it was my hidden love for that noble creature. But I was amazed to
                     perceive how in the light of His countenance, the very fragrance and blossom,
                     of my heart seemed rank and coarse. My whole life withered, and my virtues
                     dropped like blackened leaves. And yet this unbeauty, this moral poverty,
                     brought joy. Right over against me rose to a stately height the conception of a
                     Being whose very nature it was spontaneously and with deep yearning, to love
                     and embrace such unworthy. I remember thinking—for I then thought,
                     as one sees, vast ranges of truth and ideas flying at once before
                     me, almost without succession in time—that love of God came to me as I had seen
                     the sun pour and flame, in the Spring, upon a brown and frozen knoll, and
                     pierce it, and thaw it, and warm it, and nourish in it the hidden roots, and
                     day by day bring them out in beauty. So it seemed that God's nature fell upon
                     mine. How long this lasted I cannot tell. When I awoke in the morning I seemed
                     like one who had missed his latitude. I went asleep in summer and awaked in
                     winter. I ran to the window and saw all things as I had been wont to see them.
                     Birds were singing—men and boys walking—wagons rolling—the smoke rising pale
                     against the sky, hardly crooked by a breath of wind. The vision had been caught
                     up. In its place was the great working world. I never was so sad to be awake. I longed for something
                     lost. Yet I am wonderfully quieted. I do know that there is a realm of
                        truth. I cannot well be made to believe that there was nothing divine
                     in this exaltation and spiritual insight. It is an expressible relief to feel a
                        certainty that nature has a Master. Now I will seek Wentworth
                     again, and see what be means when he says that the Bible interprets nature, and
                     that nature nourishes the truths of the Bible, and that they are parts of one
                     development, and in harmony.
                  "July 1.—The town is filling with strangers; also come back
                     acquaintances. Young Frank Esel has come, and is of course much at W.'s.
                     Exceeding good company. His genial gayety refreshes me. We have much in common.
                     I don't think that Rose can flirt. Yet she is a woman, and is
                     pleased with attention, and seems fond of Esel. They are much together. They
                     work together drawing and painting in the open air, and holding large
                     discourse.
                  "There comes, too, this summer one Heywood from Virginia. I am told that he is
                     highly accomplished, and I perceive that he is elegant. I met him once or
                     twice, and am drawn to him, as he seems to be towards me. He has been bred to
                     the Law, and is now studying, nominally, with Judge Bacon. He wonders that I do
                     not study law. I am every day more inclined to do it. Heywood does not intend
                     practising Law. He tells me that his tastes lead him in the direction of
                     Political Economy, to which in reality he devotes most of the time which is
                     supposed to be spent in the Law.
                  
                  "August 1.—Something has happened I am sure. Frank Esel seems
                     much disturbed. Rose is even more kind to him than before. But I think it is
                     sisterly. He still visits much at the doctor's. But he is less buoyant. A dash
                     of sadness. I find him looking fixedly at me, as if studying my innermost
                     thought. Poor soul! I shall not be in his way. He leaves for home soon.
                  "I learn that Heywood is to be heir of the Chandler property, and that he is to
                     reside here. He has property in the South, and if he inherits the Chandler
                     estate he will be one of the wealthiest men in these parts. Chandler is said to
                     be worth half a million. Chandler's wife and Heywood's mother are sisters, so
                     that there is relationship between them. He lives with them now. I covet his
                     royal ease in society. He is charming even to men, and I do not wonder that
                     ladies welcome his attentions. He has a high bearing without haughtiness, and
                     he is truly considerate of every one, and kind to overflowing. If all
                     Southerners are such as he, I am henceforth in love with them. Such as I have
                     met, however, have been different."
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXIII.
               TOM HEYWOOD.
               THE most noisy and ostentatious influences of summer are not those which chiefly
                  shape its destiny. It is the sum of small and even inconspicuous things, acting in
                  gentle continuity, that give tone and character to the year. Frosts, that in
                  summer become dews; dews, that in winter are transformed to frosts; tiny mosses
                  and silken glasses; the up-sucking of moisture by hidden and silent roots; the
                  fall of outworn leaves, and their conversion to mould the silent power of remote
                  orbs, that sheet the earth with light, pierce it with heat, that move the tides,
                  and swing the globe itself around its circuit—these undemonstrative and modest
                  influences—silent, precious, invisible attractions—are the great workers of
                  Nature.
               Nor is the analogy wanting in the soul of mail. The influential agents which
                  determine destiny are often so soft and subtle that the very touch is not felt,
                  nor the presence discovered of things which change or fix the mind's moods, and,
                  with constant recurrence, fashion the character.
               The unexpressed thoughts of Barton Cathcart, the rising and falling doubts, that
                  shifted and changed like the sky-fleece of a summer day, were wearing channels in
                  his soul, and threatening to undermine his life.
               Nor could he tell what, at length, arrested the morbid tendency, or what,
                  gradually and gently acting, began to give hope and health to his moral nature.
                  Certain it was that, from the period recorded in his journal, the disintegrating
                  tendency of his mind was checked, and a constructive tendency was established. The
                  fascinations of self-torment seemed to have spent themselves. It is true that the
                  progress toward health was imperceptible at any single point. But the morbid
                  symptoms had been checked, and a curative tendency had been established.
               Even more than ever before, he became a frequent visitor at Dr. Wentworth's. Much
                  he talked with the doctor, and much with Rose; but never respecting himself. It
                  was his wont to converse of some principle or process, or of some imagined case,
                  although the subject matter was in reality his own experience.
               This thin veil did not deceive his friends but served to save his delicacy, and
                  secured a frankness and liberty which would have been otherwise impossible to one
                  so sensitive.
               Rose, peculiarly sagacious in penetrating character, discerned, in a certain
                  general way, and appreciated Barton's state of mind. Nor was she insensible to the
                  attractions arising from the very troubles of so noble a nature.
               The suffering of a great nature, if silently borne and uncomplainingly, is
                  irresistibly affecting. In Barton there was the greatest energy and the greatest
                  helplessness, the strength of a vigorous manhood and infantine weakness. To common
                  eyes his lot seemed eminently fortunate. He was the envied man of the village.
                  Every one predicted the most auspicious future. But Rose knew that all the outward
                  portion was hollowed out and made empty by the disquiet of his mind.
               When Cathcart met Rose in the presence of others, he joined in the common
                  conversation or in the amusements with a gayety that rendered his presence
                  charming. But no sooner were they thrown together alone than to Rose he began
                  speaking of deeper themes and in a tone of earnest and at times almost anguishful
                  enthusiasm. She could not but perceive that to her he brought the treasure of his
                  inmost deepest nature. Nor could Rose hide from herself the fascination of such an
                  intercourse. It was a mute appeal for help. This unconscious and artless flattery
                  was exquisite. A woman's pity often opens the door to love.
               But equally strong is the need of looking up, of worshipping. If a woman must
                  lean, she needs strength to lean upon; if she must look up, then there must be
                  some one higher than she; if she reveres, there, must be to her imagination
                  something of divinity to call for a worship. All women marry gods, but sadly
                  consent afterwards, to live with men. The quenching of their resplendent
                  imaginations, the discovery and full conviction that the husband cannot, by his
                  strength and goodness, dominate the heart and be sovereign in love, at length
                  produce a great crisis. Some easily yield up the delusion, call it romance, and
                  consent to live a life of feeble and fitful love, which has in it no worship, and
                  much contempt. Others there are, of diviner mould, who cannot lose faith in Love, though they sadly admit that they
                  have missed it. They know that there is a life which they never live; that there
                  might arise out of their hearts a love so great, so pure, so commanding and
                  satisfying, that all other experiences of fortune would, in comparison, be of
                  little moment. Royalty and Fortune have no light to fill the vault of life when
                  Love is eclipsed or has gone down. But if Love be regent every other light may go
                  out and it will fill the life with a light that shall make poverty itself
                  luminous, and sickness and toil bright and joyous.
               Many and many a heart there is that has missed its aim, confessed its defeat. Some
                  there distribute their affections in many channels, as if to gain by diffusion
                  what they have lost in concentrated form. Some bury their Love and keep watch as
                  over a sepulchre, with sorrow, and yet with hope. Hope on! There is a resurrection
                  for every true heart that suffering for love is faithful to the end!
               Rose was one of the few who knew beforehand, and as by an inspiration, that she
                  must love upward, and that the man to whom her heart should go forth must be found
                  on no downward path, nor on any level, but along an upward road. It was the want
                  of that over-shadowing power in Barton, the want of that commanding energy, which
                  held her affections in warm friendship, but failed to ripen them into love. And so
                  long as Barton was not the master of himself—so long as he carried a divided life,
                  and uncertain and vacillating hopes, he could not rise to that calmness of
                  strength and loftiness of soul which draw men to a great nature, as birds are
                  drawn to build and sing in the boughs of a great tree.
               But, whatever might leave been the result had Barton pressed his suit with Rose,
                  he was unconsciously led in a wiser way.
               Some of his feelings we have seen in the record of his journal. But he was not
                  destined to maintain his honorable reserve without some painful struggles. The
                  appearance in Norwood of Mr. Thomas J. Heywood was an event intimately connected
                  with his whole after life.
               Heywood's mother had an only sister living here, and that fact, joined to the
                  reputation of the place for health and beautiful scenery, led him to choose
                  Norwood in preference to any of the hundred points of attraction in New England
                  for a summers resort. No considerable intimacy had existed between these two
                  sisters. His mother had married early and always had lived in the South. Visits
                  had, to be sure, been occasionally interchanged; but that was all. They loved each
                  other because they had the same mother, and because they lived hundreds of miles
                  apart. Had they lived together, utterly different tastes and associations would
                  have produced discord. As it was, each imagined the other to be what she wished
                  her to be.
               Heywood, or as he always called himself and was called in his home, Tom Heywood,
                  was about Barton's age, of peculiarly winning manners uniting a certain lofty air
                  to a genial familiarity.
               To be reared in wealth may or may not be a blessing. But to inherit a sound
                  constitution, a mind of good quality and inclining to moral and intellectual
                  pursuits, a disposition elastic and cheery, surely this is to be born to fortune.
                  If to this be added the society of cultivated people, and companions who both love
                  and admire one, it may well be expected that a young man's head would be slightly
                  turned. Tom Heywood's head, however, stood quite well upon his shoulders, and he
                  showed very little spoiling. It is probable that he perceived the good impression
                  which he made wherever he went. The flattering cordiality with which his advances
                  had always been received had not tended wholly toward humility. In honest truth,
                  there was a gentle impression in his mind that he was very attractive and that
                  when he should find a woman of qualities admirable enough, he had only to pass
                  through the decorous processes of approach and acquaintance, and to propose
                  himself to her with due ardor to be duly and heartily accepted. This slightest bit
                  of conceit was almost unknown to himself. It was the unconscious effect upon a
                  sensible and honorable nature of having been a supreme favorite from childhood.
                  But it did not stain through and affect his manners. It remained latent,
                  restrained from expression by good sense and good breeding. On his first visit to
                  Norwood he spent but a summer, visiting very little except in his aunt's family.
                  So well was he pleased that the next season he returned early, and with the
                  purpose of study as well a amusement. And although for a time he preferred rooms
                  at the Mansion House, toward autumn he accepted the continuous solicitations of
                  his aunt and her husband, and became a member of their family, and took the place
                  of a son their only child who had died a few years before, just as he was entering
                  upon manhood hood. It was said by those
                  who thought they knew, that it was Josiah Chandler's intention to make Heywood his
                  heir. However this may have been, there can be no reasonable doubt that Mrs.
                  Chandler proposed in her heart to secure that for him which it had been the hope
                  of her life to secure for her son—a connection with the Wentworths. And during the
                  summer of 1859, and the winter following, Tom Heywood was very generally spoken of
                  as Rose's suitor. But the same thing had been said of Frank Esel, of Barton
                  Cathcart, and of several others, and all the stories about Tom Heywood might have
                  been just as baseless.
               Until we learn something about it from the parties themselves it may be as well to
                  imagine that we know nothing about it.
               We prefer to let Heywood give his own impressions of Norwood and its people.
               
                  HEYWOOD TO HIS BROTHER.
                  
                     "My DEAR HAL:—In spite of your predictions, I am settled in Norwood! It is
                           not a huge jumble of bricks, as you predicted, nor a noisy
                        manufacturing town swarming with operatives. On the contrary, I find an
                        extremely attractive village, of a few thousand inhabitants, nestled down
                        close upon the Connecticut river, and in sight of goodly hills. To be sure,
                        these mountains, as they are here called, would cut a sorry figure by the
                        side of the Mountains in old Virginia, but they are quite promising in their
                        way. I quite admire the good taste and smugness of these Yankee houses.
                        Especially do I approve of setting back the houses and separating them from
                        the street by deep ornamental yards. There is an air of elegance and
                        seclusion given to the buildings which, if, like our village houses, they
                        were placed on the very line of the street without shrubbery or grounds,
                        they would utterly fail of having.
                     
                     "Behold me then, prying and spying, sharp as a lynx but just as a judge—a
                        political economist of whom Henry C. Carey need not be ashamed! Expect from
                        me no vain discourses of sport; nothing of horses or bounds; nothing of
                        hunting or fishing; nothing of frivolous pleasures, which I am expected
                        suitably to look down upon. I am in Puritan New England! Already I feel my
                        face sensibly longer. My features are clanging into a sharper and more
                        inflexible cast! I no longer spend my money needlessly—no; I am infected
                        with economy—I ask the price of every thing, turn it over with an inspecting
                        eye, as if weighing the great question of the relation of price to cost of
                        production. I pay with slowness, and count the change with solemnity. 'When
                        you are among the Romans,' etc. The nasal twang I am practising. If you
                        should come hither, do not look for a chestnut-haired, blue-eyed young
                        fellow, with a cherry cravat flaming at his throat, a cigar in his mouth,
                        laughing loud enough to be heard all over the village; look for a precise
                        young gentleman, stepping with only less formality than is required at a
                        funeral and looking as earnest and as anxious as such eyes and features
                        can—then recognize your friend! How long I shall enjoy my metamorphosis I
                        cannot predict; but it is certain that I am amused at my own propriety thus
                        far.
                     "I will keep you advised, every few weeks, of my affairs, and shall expect
                        in return a full disclosure of all at home, which I hardly dare think about
                        for fear an unmanly home-sickness may befall me. But, good-bye! Be virtuous
                        and you shall be happy!
                     
                        "TOM HEYWOOD.
                     
                  
                  
                     "P. S.—I have just come in from a stroll, since writing the
                        above, and my vanity is a little piqued. I overheard one of the young clerks
                        saying to another, 'I know that fellow is Southern by the free and easy way
                        he uses money!' So all My efforts are no deception! What would they think if
                        they saw me at home?
                     "Another thing,—and horrible to relate,—I have just learned that there is a
                        race-ground at Springfield, hardly twenty miles from here! Is this New
                        England? Have I not held my peace, as if even to speak of field-sports would
                        banish me from all respect? I am informed that while racing is discouraged,
                        trotting is so much in vogue, that, in agricultural fairs, it constitutes
                        the chief attraction!
                     "How does that compare with our notions of Puritan strictness? Who knows but
                        I may find out that this gelid land and rigorous people may have, under
                        their ribs, as much heart as Virginians have, with only a different way of
                        slowing it?
                     "I must draw rein, or my postscript will be longer than my letter. A woman's postscript, you know, is
                        said to contain the gist of the letter, or, as you would say, the letter is
                        the pistol, and the postscript the bullet. Again, fair thee well!
                     
                        T. H."
                     
                  
               
               
                  HEYWOOD TO HIS BROTHER.
                  "Thanks, dear Hal, for your long and substantial letter. You are the best of
                     all correspondents.
                  "Your letters are pictures. Strange, that a sheet of paper, with mere lines and
                     blotches, should bring before the mind more clearly than painting could do
                     objects which they only suggest by the law of association, but don't represent
                     in the slightest degree in form or color! After reading your letter, do I not
                     see the dear old home in living form? father—tall, dignified, fiery, and yet
                     running over with kindness—every day blazing out at something, and yet cheery,
                     playable, and generous to a fault?
                  "Do I not see Sue and Mary romping? and young Hillyer, with that good-natured,
                     boastful tongue, running like Miller Gibbs's wheel,—foam without, yet grinding
                     good grain within? I really felt a qualm of home-sickness as I read your
                     charming account of matters—coming in early from the garden with flowers for
                     the breakfast table. But homesickness is unweanedness. Its existence and
                     severity show how much need there was of removing from home and of learning to
                     live by one's self.
                  "I am sure I have enough to do, and matters of a kind congenial to my tastes. I
                     am studying this Yankee people with the utmost zest. Of course, many of them
                     are like our own folks. Cultivated people are always more or less alike the
                     world over. On that very account one studies the middle and lower classes for
                     distinctive characters, as there, if anywhere, is apt to be found originality
                     and eccentricity. I had an impression that the rigor of Puritan morals, and a
                     coercive public sentiment, held every thing here down to set patterns, and that
                     I should find a dreary sameness of a kind not very interesting. But the under
                     people here are rich in peculiarities. They open up well already.
                  "In the South there is more liberty of action, and in the North of
                        thought. Law is not so strong among us. A population thinly
                     scattered through wide territory are obliged to take their affairs into their
                     own hands, and are less likely to wait for redress or opportunity for the slow
                     process of law. Men here live in attrition, yet universally respect the law.
                     Among the lower classes law is put instead of Religion. Yesterday a man had
                     been aggrieved by a neighbor. I heard him say, in a great passion, I'll have
                     the law of him if there's any justice in the land.' Had it been in Virginia,
                     the man would have thrashed the offender on the spot, and settled his grievance
                     without judge or jury.
                  "I hardly know how to convey my impressions of Yankee activity. It is something
                     fearful to me. Leisure and laziness seem to be regarded as equivalents. There
                     is a constant pushing industry. I see this strikingly in the conveniences about
                     their dwellings. Almost every house might be studied by our people to learn how
                     many comforts and economies may be concentrated in a dwelling without expense,
                     except of wit and skill.
                  "I should never have known but for this New England experience, what wealth
                     there is in economy. And what economy is possible when people put as much
                     thought and earnestness into every detail of life as they do here! It is a
                     perfect study and amusement to me. Brought up to hear the Yankee stigmatized as
                     stingy and mean, I cannot divest myself of a certain contempt for their minute
                     frugality, and their everlasting calculations, and the repression of impulse in
                     favor of principle, or foresight, or prudence of some sort or other.
                  "I cannot better illustrate the traits of some of this people than in giving an
                     account of a fellow called Hiram Beers, who seems to have an eye on this whole
                     community, and whose tongue walks to and fro and cuts like a razor. He is a
                     wag, and yet as far from being a fool as he is from being a gentleman.
                  "Did I tell you that I had bought a horse?—a Morgan horse—with his hoofs filled
                     with steel springs, and his eyes with lambent fire?
                  But I must not take the credit of buying, but of only consenting to his
                     purchase. Hiram Beers is my good angel. By the way, if you were to call him
                        Beers, nobody would know whom you meant, on a week day.
                        Hiram is his name. And though there may be a hundred Hirams
                     hereabouts, only he is Hiram!
                  
                  "You might search all the Old Dominion for such a specimen and not find it. He
                     is the growth of this community, as much as air plants are of the tropics. He
                     is a mixture of deacon, doctor jockey, jester and philosopher—if you can
                     imagine what that compound pound
                     would be. He is of that nervous temperament, that sleeps little, eats little,
                     works incessantly, thinks and talks for his own mere relief. And yet,
                     contradictory as it may sound, he produces the impression on you of a shrewd,
                     cautious and considerate man. He is always saying some humorous thing, and
                     giving half-laughs as if he had thought of something else and could not afford
                     the rest of a laugh. He knows every body that ever lived in Norwood. Every
                     summer, when the town is thronged, Hiram knows who has come, where he stays,
                     when he goes. It is the same, apparently, for the whole neighborhood. And as
                     for horses his knowledge is intuitive, and almost a homely omniscience.
                  "Behold me then sitting in the office of the Mansion House, the very disciple
                     of this cute and curious Yankee teacher!
                  "'Beers, I want a good horse—'
                  "'My name is Hiram;—I keep Beers for Sunday. When I get my meeting clo's on, I
                     expect folks to call me Beers, or Hiram Beers; but week days I go and come on
                     Hiram. What was you sayin'?
                  "'Can you tell me where to look for a good horse?'
                  "'Wal, Bledsoe's got about the best steppin' creetur that I know of. Can do it
                     in about two-thirty, and do it every-time; sound as a knot; hain't a scratch on
                     her; silk feels coarse after ye take yer hand off her hide; and the lovin'ist
                     eye ye ever saw in a man's head, or a woman's either.'
                  "'What does he ask for her?'
                  "'Wal I don't know,' said Hiram, glancing at one or two persons present, and
                     then looking steadily out of the window for a minute. 'I guess you'll have to
                     wait till he's sold off every thing else pretty much down to her. After he's
                     sold his wife and children, I expect you may get a bargain out of him for the
                     mare.'
                  "'But I asked you for a horse that I could buy.'
                  "'Mebbe you did. But all I heerd you say was,—Can you tell me where I can look
                     for a good horse? Now you can look at Bledsoe's horse for a year runnin', and
                     he won't charge you nothin'.'
                  "I colored a little but Hiram did not move a features or look away from an
                     empty fireplace into which every now and then he squirted a volley of tobacco
                     spittle.
                  Presuming that I had neglected a proper fee, and that there was the rub, after
                     a few minutes I quietly slipped a dollar bill into his hand. Slowly unrolling
                     it, he examined the engraving, read the signatures, held it up to the light,
                     and then gravely handed it back to me.
                  "'Yes, Mr. Heywood, that's a good bill—ginooine—no counterfeit, about it.'
                  "'Keep it, Hiram—keep it.'
                  "'What should I keep it for? You don't owe me any thing!'
                  "'Well, Hiram, I ought to pay you for any information I can get.'
                  "'Oh, you think the information about Bledsoe's mare is worth a dollar, do ye?
                     Wal, I don't. Put up your money to pay your debts with. When I've
                        airnt it, it'll be time to pay me. If you want me to lay myself
                     out for you on a good horse, say so, and then I'll tell ye what I'll do it for.
                     I don't want no charity yet.'
                  "'Very well. I wish a good horse, as good a horse as can be had, without going
                     to an extravagant price, and I am willing to pay your expenses and trouble if
                     you will serve me.'
                  "'I'll show you five good creturs, and if any of 'em suit you, you may pay me
                     ten dollars; and if I fetch you five more you may pay me fifteen. and then if
                     you ain't suited, I can't please you.'
                  "A few days afterwards, I was called down to try a horse. It was a picture!
                     Black as a coal, and not a spot on him. Docile and obedient, but
                     with immense spirit. I had not driven a half mile before I was satisfied.
                  "'Hiram, this'll do. I'll take him. What's the price?'
                  "'Well now, you was born down South war'nt you? If you had been born along the
                     Connecticut you'd asked the price first, and held off a good bit, afore you let
                     a fellow know whether you was pleased or not. Howsumever, it's all right. I
                     thought I'd try you and so I brought the best one first. If you'd neglected
                     this, you'd sartainly have got a poor one.'
                  "'Well, I like him so much said,' said I, the next day, 'that I am willing to
                     pay you twice as much as I promised,' offering him two ten dollar bills. Hiram
                     took one of them, folded it carefully, put it in his wallet, and then looking
                     in an amusing way at the head of some president of a bank, engraved on the
                     other bill, he began to soliloquize. 'Yes, old fellow—president of a bank—no
                        doubt rich as medder land. Made
                     it all yourself, too. I s'pose you bought at just what folks said. I s'pose you
                     paid twice as much as you promised! That's the way hereabouts in New England.
                     That's the way to get rich,' and with that he laughed down in his belly, though
                     only a sniff or two came out of his face. Handing me back my money, with very
                     much the benignant air with which a relaxing father gives back a forfeited
                     jackknife to a repentant boy, he lectured me in a most edifying manner.
                  "'I've seen a good many men from your parts. They come up here every summer,
                     and are very flush of money. They think they can buy every body. They fall in
                     with a low sort of people and foreigners, mere hangers-on, and such returns
                     will take as long is you will give. Lord, sir, they are like a barrel with two
                     bung-holes, one atop and the other under. You may pour in all day and they
                     won't fill up. But they are not our people. The fact is, we northern men work
                     hard, and have to. We know the value of time, and stuff, and work, and if we
                     weren't close as bark we should all be in the poorhouse. But there is a sight
                     of difference between being tight and being mean. If a man airns his money he
                     has a right to it, and to the last cent jest as much as to the first. And if a
                     man hasn't airn'd it, he's a mean cuss if he takes it anyhow, unless he's
                     extremely old, very lame, and hain't got no children, nor relations, and is
                     afeerd of goin' to the poorhouse. That's the very difference between an
                     Irishman and a Yankee; a Yankee wants his own money, an Irishman wants
                        yours.'
                  "I was too much amused to find fault with Hiram's airs, especially as he gave
                     me to understand that he highly esteemed my judgment in stable matters, and, in
                     the under society of the town, you may be sure Hiram's opinion established my
                     reputation; for he is the oracle."
                  
               
               
                  HEYWOOD TO HIS BROTHER.
                  My DEAR HAL:—You rally me upon the character of my acquaintances, and
                     compliment me upon the improvement which will appear when I return from, this
                     elysium of gardens, workmen, hostlers, &c. It would be a pity that you
                     should fail of your own enjoyment, since I certainly have mine. Working people,
                     in a community where work is the badge of servitude, cannot represent sent the
                     value and personal excellence of working men in a different state of society
                     where nothing is more honorable than labor where all, more or less, perform it;
                     where men are taught from childhood that manliness and honor require one to be
                     personally as much as possible independent of others' help, and to perform with
                     one's person a large part of the offices which, with us, servants are expected
                     to render. So much, at least, I have already found out. As a student of
                     political economy, I begin to perceive facts and truths about this northern
                     population, which I could never have learned but by living among them. The
                     common people of such communities give tone and character to society, more than
                     do the educated people. For they are intelligent, inquisitive, endlessly
                     curious of knowledge, and accustomed to dispute and argue every question that
                     arises. They are readers of books and devourers of newspapers. It would be
                     impossible to find in all New England, in the remotest and rudest portions,
                     such neighborhoods of hopeless ignorance as we have at home, on every hand.
                  But you inquire what other acquaintances I have formed? Many, and most
                     agreeable ones. What intimacies have ensued? Well but one
                     companionship as yet. I am becoming warmly interested in a young man here, who
                     has been teaching here since he left college, and who designed studying for the
                     pulpit. But some trouble of mind, I know not what, seems to shut that avenue,
                     and he is now, in his leisure, studying law with Judge Bacon, and so we are
                     much thrown together.
                  "I suspect that there is more than the love of science that takes Barton
                     Cathcart to Dr. Wentworth's house. There is a Miss Rose Wentworth, you should
                     understand, whom, not her features, but her expression makes handsome. When her
                     face kindles, as it easily, does, it is surprisingly attractive. Quite learned,
                     I am told, and especially a lover of the fields and forest, as all maidens at
                     the sentimental period of their lives, are or ought to be. This inclination was
                     inherited from her father, Dr. Reuben Wentworth, and the tendency became fixed
                     by his careful education of his daughter. This I am told by friends of the
                     doctor, who look upon him not only as a man of remarkable skill in his
                     profession, but as an original nature in as utter contrast with the surrounding
                     people as an opal is with the rock in which it is imbedded. Judge Bacon, an
                     astute New-England man, himself a notable character, calls Dr. Wentworth an idealistic naturalist with a
                     practical shell on. By the way, Barton's own sister and his one, Miss Alice
                     Cathcart, was at Dr. Wentworth's yesterday. Like her brother, she is brunette.
                     Both of them have high blood—I know it by the clearness of the features, the
                     fine lines of the lips. The whole face and form represent the higher human
                     element—moral sentiments and intelligence, more than the annual mature; and
                     this is what I call high breeding.
                  "The two young ladies, Miss Rose and Miss Alice, are of one age to a night and
                     a day, and call themselves the twins with two mothers.
                  "My acquaintances are limited and casual. With Judge Bacon, more than with any
                     one, I have lead familiar intercourse. He is one who might have been born in
                     Virginia. What bigger compliment could I pay?
                  "But I find many Southern families here, and were I so minded I might pass my
                     time from morning to night in agreeable company. But I have other ends in view
                     than mere amusement. Do not smile when I say that I am reading diligently. Why
                     should I bore you with that? I know that you would rather hear of
                     sports, horses, people—and so I have written!"
                  
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIV.
               HEYWOOD RETURNS—ESEL DEPARTS.
               WHILE Heywood was spending the winter at his father's house, and enjoying all the
                  recreations which abounded in the hospitable old Virginian mansion, he found
                  himself unwittingly thrown into an attitude of defence of his Northern friends.
                  Although he was thoroughly Southern in his prepossessions and prejudices, yet he
                  was highly endowed with the sentiment of justice, and it was not consistent with
                  his honorable nature to hear his late acquaintances undervalued and stigmatized,
                  when he knew the amputations to be unjust. The same thing had happened reversely
                  while he was at Norwood. Thus in the North he defended the South and opposed
                  Northern prejudices, and in the South he defended much which he had witnessed in
                  Northern society, and opposed the violent tone which prevailed among his
                  companions. He was not one of those whose pride it is, returning from foreign
                  travel, to boast that they have seen nothing worthy of imitation in all their
                  journeys—a confession that they have learned nothing, and well nigh an evidence
                  that they are capable of learning nothing. Of a studious and reflective turn of
                  mind, he had eagerly observed and reasoned upon the interior facts of Northern
                  society, and particularly its industry and its universal education. He had not
                  succeeded in breaking away from those fatal notions of political economy instilled
                  into his own generation, nor did he yet see clearly the Philosophic explanation of
                  that diversified industry and universal prosperity which he beheld. But he was on
                  the way.
               The prejudices of his friends, which once were his also, served to show him how
                  far he was changed.
               "Come, Tom," said his favorite sister, "be a good boy and own how much better you
                  like the South than you do that mean New England."
               "Most certainly, fair Kate, I prefer the South, but without prejudice to New
                  England. You ought to think well of a land which gave you such a
                  mother as ours."
               
               "Ah! mother came away from the North when she was but seventeen; and then she was
                  of good family, and never worked for a living."
               "It is true that she did not; but her mother did. Her father was a
                  farmer's boy, and made his fortune by integrity and industry. Every one respected
                  him for his solid worth."
               "No matter, Tom; mother is a Virginian and not a Yankee. All her habits and
                  thoughts have been formed here, and every body says that she is a true specimen of
                  a Southern lady."
               "I am not a whit behind you in love for mother and admiration for our own native
                  State; but if you mean to imply that only in the South can be found gentlemen and
                  ladies of the highest breeding, I cannot go with you. Nay, I know from my own
                  observations that this very New England, which you so little know, or you would
                  not so detest it, is full of families that no man can but respect and admire. I
                  speak from my own knowledge. No one could see Farmer Cathcart, who works daily for
                  his living, and not respect his sturdy independence and admire his great
                  intelligence. His daughter Alice,—ah! Kate, if she were here you would need to
                  look out for your laurels. But even she would not command your admiration so much
                  as Rose Wentworth would."
               "Well done, Tom!" cried his beautiful sister, who was as fierce as a dove, and as
                  restful as a bumming bird, and full as dangerous, and whose duty it seemed to be,
                  on all proper occasions, to manifest a State patriotism. "Well done, Tom; I wonder
                  that you ever came back single! Pray, why did you not bring one of those high-born
                  Yankee dames with you, to outshine us all?"
               "Stranger things than that have happened. If your father went to New England for a
                  wife, why shouldn't his son? And his notable success adds encouragement. Indeed, I
                  think that I only want a little opposition on your part, or on the part of some of
                  my friends, to propose for Miss Wentworth and marry her."
               "Of course you would. And I don't mean to give you the motive—though it would
                  rescue one more Yankee girl, and by bringing her into good society it might be the
                  making of her."
               "Come, come, my dear sister, this is all very well for jesting. But I tell you in
                  good earnest, that it is not just or wise for the people of our one country to
                  spend their time in deepening prejudices udices and promoting alienation. The
                  times are hot enough already. I confess that I dread the future, unless there can
                  be infused more moderation and mutual respect on both sides."
               "Who cares?" said young Hillyer. "Let times grow bad—I know who'll suffer, and who
                  will not. The Yankees are a mean-spirited, peddling set. We have managed them for
                  fifty years, and we shall do it still. I could thrash ten of them without winking.
                  I hope I may see the day that we shall try it on!"
               "Well, Hillyer," replied Heywood, with a grave countenance, "it will be a terrible
                  day for our country if the North and South should go to arms. I have no doubt of
                  our valor, but I have just as little of theirs. They are not a people who like
                  fighting. They will be slow to enter upon it. But, if ever it is thrust upon them,
                  they will take up war like a trade and learn it thoroughly. New England has had
                  the prejudices of this whole nation against her for a hundred years, and yet she,
                  more than any part of the Union, has gone right on prospering in every element
                  that makes States strong. And I do not believe that she is likely to be checked
                  now. But this talk is all folly. At any rate, God grant that we may never put to
                  proof our respective opinions."
               With such views, it will not surprise our readers to learn that Heywood returned
                  to Norwood for the second season with far more eagerness than when he had first
                  sought it. His lively sister sent him back loaded with injunctions against
                  apostasy from the true Southern spirit. "I will never, never forgive those Yankees
                  if they get my brother away from me."
               Every man, we are often told, has a mission in this life. Josiah Chandler happily
                  found out his mission, which many people never do; or if they do, then one cannot
                  but marvel that they should be sent so far on so poor an errand. Josiah Chandler's
                  mission was to make and keep money. He was of slender stature. A round head, with
                  a face not noticeable, unless, upon close examination you discovered a shrewd look
                  about his eyes. He was in no sense a genius. He simply possessed consummate good
                  judgment in business. He had no passions. He was always calm. He was never carried
                  away by immoderate expectations; never speculated. He was one of the few men whose
                  success did not unsteady or so excite that he could not take sure aim. For twenty
                  years he increased his gains surely and gradually. For ten years more wealth came faster. Every thing he touched
                  seemed to prosper. Had his son lived, he would have gone on accumulating probably
                  to the end of life. But that death seemed to give a shock to his whole nature. Why
                  should he go on toiling without an end or aim in life except to amass property, of
                  which already he had far more than he could employ? Mr. Chandler had no ambition
                  to be thought rich. Indeed he was far richer than any one knew. He began to wind
                  up his affairs to consummate such enterprises as were on hand, and to institute no
                  others. He built him a large and comely mansion, and for a year this gave him
                  occupation. Not a nail was driven without his inspection. Every board and beam,
                  every particle of paint, strip of lead, pane of glass, came under his scrutiny.
                  Conveniences of every kind were multiplied. He never talked to any one not even to
                  his wife, of what was going on. Diligent, shrewd, watchful, unostentatious,
                  thorough, and, above all, silent, was he. If any thing went wrong no one knew it.
                  If things succeeded beyond his expectation, no one knew that. He kept his own
                  counsel. One would have thought that it was in his eyes a mortal sin to speak of
                  his own affairs: not a man in town would have been personally so little
                  missed.
               After he moved into his mansion, every thing fell into orderly arrangements,
                  seemingly without special effort from any one. He was mildly pious. He never
                  knowingly did wrong. He presumed himself to be sinful, as he had been assured that
                  he was; and it was a cardinal practice with him not to contradict. He observed the
                  Sabbath day with calm acquiescence. He had united with the Church not from any
                  passionate experience, but because for some unexplained reason he thought it the
                  right thing to do. But his whole life moved on as shadows creep over the ground
                  from the west to the east, attracting no attention and making no noise.
               One day Dr. Wentworth called upon some business, and found him in his library. He
                  was astonished at the beauty of the room and at the number of books. Then first it
                  was found out that Josiah Chandler had a curious taste for books, with a
                  speciality of love for old books. No one had ever heard him speak of books. No one
                  had seen boxes unloading at his door. He was the last man in town who would have
                  been suspected of such a mania, Yet on examination Dr. Wentworth found a large
                  collection of rare tracts, scarce books—illustrating American history. He had
                  gathered them up in a quiet way. They were bound in Boston, and returned to
                  Norwood, and took their places in his library, without sign or hint to any one.
                  How much he had read of them no one knew. It was certain that he knew something of
                  every volume, especially its bibliographical history. That same instinct of facts
                  which had given him such success in business was manifest in this dry and silent
                  amusement of his leisure.
               How grateful ought we to be to that distributive Providence which draws men and
                  women to each other, not by agreements and likenesses, but also by differences.
                  Otherwise, people coming together by elective affinities would whirl away down the
                  path of life,—tall people with tall, short people with short, sober with sober,
                  the merry with the merry, the good with the good, and the bad with the bad. And
                  the end would be that the world's population would soon become fixed in certain
                  lines, and run into the extremest exaggerations. But, now, a tall man snatches up
                  a darling little short creature for his wife. He has had tallness enough, and
                  wants variety. All the town is aghast when it learns that some Amanda Sexton, the
                  finest woman of the place, beautiful as a rose, has surrendered herself to some
                  Luther Walpole, whose face is so homely as to make one almost doubt the
                  benevolence of Providence. And so a devout woman is joined to a merry, thoughtless
                  wretch; and in like manner a grave and reverend man is led about by some rosy,
                  sprightly creature, who foams and sparkles on his surface, as the beautiful
                  water-crests do upon deep and solemn waves.
               In only one thing was his wife like unto Josiah Chandler. Neither of them had any
                  illusions. He saw things in their most absolute literalness; she saw people, and
                  their action, without charitable or malign mists, but in a merciless truthfulness.
                  And though a wise woman, yet she spoke out with a literal truthfulness which
                  frequently astonished men, accustomed to the indirections, the disguises, and the
                  deceptions of society. She was a large, portly woman, of a serene, but fine and
                  energetic countenance. She was in every way superior to her husband except in the
                  singular talent for making and administering wealth. She could converse; he could
                  not. She had tastes refined by literature and good society; he was one of those
                  men that you would forget to notice,
                  and, whether he was cultivated, really you forgot to inquire!
               She studied with profound sympathy the writings of Jonathan Edwards and Madam
                  Guion; he read Scott's Commentaries and Barnes's Notes on the Gospels. Every
                  morning at family prayers, he read five or six verses of Scripture from Scott's
                  Bible, and then came rivers of interpretations, and notes, and improvements which
                  overflowed and submerged the Scripture texts, and left them lying like pond-lilies
                  in a broad lake—a few silver cups exquisitely floating on a wilderness of waters!
                  Yet, patient as he was, he seldom could read at a sitting the whole of those
                  reflections by which Scott converted the Bible into an exceeding great army of
                  unpreached sermons. After he had read to the limit of time, he would break off
                  with a quiet "and so forth, and so forth, with much more to the same purpose."
               Does any one believe that she loved him? Is it possible that one in every range of
                  faculty so much larger and richer, could fail to perceive the unmatched condition
                  in which she lived? Did she marry for wealth? She seemed to care little for it,
                  except as a means of kindness. Did she in youth have more imagination than now,
                  and suffer herself to see him through iridescent mists of love awakened by fancy?
                  And having awakened to the literal reality, did pride lead her ever after to cover
                  the mistake by an appearance of affection? If she was playing a part, it was
                  superbly done. No man, however sharply he might discriminate, could detect the
                  slightest signs of affected regard. On the contrary, there were all the tokens of
                  a real, enduring affection.
               Agate Bissell had been skeptical, but even she yielded:
               "It's no use. You may as well give it up. That woman does love that man, what
                  there is of him, and it's the Lord's wonder!"
               Heywood had been brought up in an atmosphere of hospitality. There was a certain
                  largeness in the home-life of his father's house. There was always more or less of
                  company. Every one was free to come and go according to his own good pleasure.
                  There were horses in the stable for such as would ride; guns and rods for such as
                  loved the field and the stream. Seldom was there a day when the family was at home
                  when the young people could not find enough companions for all summer sports and
                  amusements. Enjoyment was not casual and special. It was the ruling element.
               It must be confessed that the change to Norwood habits was great, and that in his
                  aunt's mansion the contrast was still more violent. All was sedate; all was
                  peaceful, regular, silent.
               But after a while he began to lose that latent repugnance which at first barred
                  familiarity. As soon as he had made up his mind not to compare his aunt's
                  household with his mother's, but to consider it as a new species to be studied, by
                  itself, he began to find points of curiosity and of attraction. He recognized,
                  also, a distinct influence which his aunt exerted upon him, and he could not help
                  admiring both the shrewdness and solidity of her judgments upon men and things in
                  society.
               It was novel to Heywood to find a woman of strong sense, of clear discernment, who
                  always spoke the truth, and who loved to have the truth spoken to her. This last
                  trait was remarkable. She refused to be praised in the slightest degree beyond
                  what she esteemed fair. But a merited compliment she accepted with manifest
                  pleasure. Not remarkable for insight and analysis of the subtle elements of
                  character, she saw those broad effects which are developed in action with
                  accuracy, and judged them impartially. Heywood soon found in his aunt a friend
                  whom he could trust implicitly, and whose judgment was invaluable; and every month
                  of his stay made absence from his home easier to bear.
               The appearance in Norwood society for a second season of this brilliant young
                  Southerner could not fail to create an interest in all concerned, and that was not
                  a small number. There was no house at which he would not have been welcome. The
                  young People deemed his presence at any gathering a sure presage of a brilliant
                  time. All admitted that Norwood had never seen, and would not soon again see,
                  three such glorious fellows as Frank Esel, Tom Heywood and Barton Cathcart.
               Frank Esel had maintained his intimacy at Dr. Wentworth's. His admiration had not
                  abated. In spite of all his philosophy, he had found himself more and more carried
                  forward toward that intoxication of feeling where one ceases to be the master of
                  himself and the judgment loses control, and every object is seen in the color of
                  passionate love. This growing feeling could not fail to be observed by Rose. It
                  troubled her. So much was there in Frank Esel to admire, so sound was his moral
                  nature, his heart was so good, and his tastes so refined, that Rose Wentworth
                  placed a sincere cere value upon his
                  friendship. Few women can decline a proffered love without wounding both pride and
                  vanity. Not many men are noble enough to accept friendship when their love has
                  been refused. Pride and vanity, too deeply wounded by defeat, often change to
                  anger, and men seek to undervalue what they have failed to secure.
               Returning home with Miss Wentworth from an afternoon's gathering in the village,
                  Frank Esel thought that she had never seemed so beautiful as on this day. It
                  chanced that the doctor and Mrs. Wentworth had gone out to make some evening call.
                  The young folks were in the other part of the house, and Rose sat in her father's
                  library. There rose in Frank's heart an impulse, as often before, but which now
                  seemed to rise and impel him in spite of every resistance which he could make. All
                  the prudent resolves he had formed were gone, and seemed like faint memories, pale
                  and afar off. He began to speak, and started at his own voice. His color came and
                  vanished. And so much was he agitated that Rose perceived it nor was the meaning
                  unknown to her.
               How much one may think in the duration of a flash! Under low excitements the mind
                  finds its way from thought to thought gradually. But when the brain is fired,
                  whole fields of thought spring up before the mind like pictures, and all
                  progression of view seems to give place to instantaneousness of sight.
               In one and the same instant Rose saw and determined all these things, viz.: that a
                  crisis had come in Frank Esel's feelings, that the tide was too strong to be
                  stayed or turned aside, that should he be suffered to pour out all his heart, he
                  would, in the necessary disappointment which must befall him, not only greatly
                  suffer in pride, but lose by rebound a position of friendship fall of pleasure to
                  both of them, that it was far better that she should herself take the initiative,
                  and, meeting his rising feeling, forestall it. Her purpose was taken instantly;
                  and when Frank, suddenly rising, came toward her, with glowing cheek and an eye
                  almost wild, she rose to meet him, and, extending her hand to his, she said, with
                  a voice in which command and kindness were blended:
               "My dear cousin Frank, come and sit down by me on the sofa, until I say what I am
                  sure you will forgive me for saying! Our acquaintance has been a joy to me. I have
                  learned much from you, and much more I hope to learn. I value your friendship, and
                  ask for it. Frank, I am grateful and proud of your good and kind thoughts of me.
                  It would be a grief all my life if any darkness should come between us. No, my
                  dear cousin, do not speak—I know what you would say. I know that you would be
                  sorry if you said it, and I should be too; for, Frank, better friends
                  than we are there could not be, but more than friendship is impossible."
               Then Rose's voice trembled, and her face was suffused with blushes as, with great
                  sensibility, she turned full upon Esel, and added:
               "Forgive me, Frank, for my boldness and accept it as the token of my friendship,
                  that I say, before you have even spoken of love to me, that you must not speak of
                  it! Do not think ill of me, Frank, that I decline what has not been offered. I
                  would have had it otherwise. And now I would save you from uttering a word which,
                  in a few hours, you would be grieved that you had said. For, it must not be.
                  Nothing is more certain, Frank, absolutely certain, than that you must rest
                  contented with friendship. I must not detain you—I hear voices—father is
                  returning. Come hither tomorrow night, and be your own noble self, and my friend.
                  Pardon the pain—I am sure that you will believe it kindness."
               "One word if I may—one word Miss Wentworth—"
               "Miss Wentworth! Then you are offended?"
               "No, cousin—cousin Rose! I am only bewildered! May I ask?—no, I will not ask the
                  question—Good night!"
               As he passed out of the door he met Dr. Wentworth and his wife; but Frank seemed
                  indeed, as he had said, like one bewildered. He was going on without salutation,
                  till the doctor spoke:
               "Good-evening, Mr. Esel. Whither away so fast?—the evening is not yet spent!"
               "How do you do, sir;—I mean good night sir;—I quite forgot."
               "Why, what is all this?" said Dr. Wentworth to his wife, "What has happened to
                  Esel? He talks as if he had been drinking."
               His wife with woman's wit suspected the state of the case, and only replied:
               "Oh, it's some little dispute, I dare say. But if nothing is said to us, we had
                  better not inquire."
               Leaving the door-yard, Esel turned from mere habit in the direction of his rooms.
                  But so absorbed was he in thought that he walked slowly past his
                  boarding-house,—far along the street,—
                  under the darkness of the great elms,—sometimes pausing,—once or twice crossing
                  the street without knowing it. The alternation between feeling and thought in a
                  mind painfully stirred as Esel's was cannot be set down in any words. Yet, leaving
                  out the hundred flushes of shame, the sharp pangs of regret, the reaction of
                  generous feelings—we may give a faint notion of his state.
               "And so it is ended:—(a deep sigh.) Then it was not to entice me that she spoke.
                  There was no need of it. Rose could not do it either. I've brought it on myself—(a
                  blush stole over his face, growing hotter and hotter.) All my resolutions and my
                  better judgment thrown aside,—and the sweetness of infatuated feeling was
                  followed!—(then speaking aloud)—and so plainly did I show it that she saw it, and
                  knew what I was going to say, and anticipated me,—foiled—outwitted!—fooled! (His
                  voice sounding in the silence seemed to annoy him, and be became silent.)
                  Friendship?—it's easy to convert friendship into love. I've found that out; but
                  not so easy to put love back into friendship. I see now—that brilliant Southerner.
                  I wish I had asked what was on my tongue's end—Is there any other one
                  whom you love? No, I had no business to do it. To-morrow I will go home. Fool, to
                  have ever gone away. No, I am not a fool. I should have been less than a man if I
                  had not loved her. I am not ashamed of it. I am not worthy of her. God saw it. But
                  I would have given my whole life to becoming worthy of her. I never can see her
                  again—never—never. I could not look upon her and be silent. Now that she knows my
                  secret, how can I look into her eyes without a burning tell-tale face; and that
                  will be a renewing of the suit. Oh, I did not know how far I had gone. This has
                  sucked up my very life."
               By this time Esel had strayed out of the village, and was more than half a mile
                  beyond on the road towards Cathcart's. He sat down upon a large white rock as if
                  he were looking at a landscape, though the darkness and silence were
                  remarkable.
               The heaven was full of concealed clouds. Now and then a distant flash of lightning
                  revealed them and long ranges of "thunder heads" shone brilliantly out, but in a
                  second sank back into darkness. Low rolls of heavy thunder sounded the coming on
                  of a storm. A fitful wind swept through the near woods with a sound like rushing
                  waters. In a moment it was gone not a leaf moved, not a sound was uttered. An
                  unweaned calf bleated from the pasture; a short bark from a distant dog, instantly
                  broken off, gave to the silence a profounder influence. Again and again the cloud
                  ridges and mountains shone out and receded into darkness. Esel sat as if watching
                  this grandest phenomenon of summer, the advance through the heavens of a great
                  storm. But he saw nothing, or was at least unconscious of seeing any thing. The
                  flashes grew more frequent, the thunder advanced and rolled with deeper cadence;
                  large drops of rain, slung from the clouds, smote the earth—a few only, and they
                  suddenly ceased. A whirl of wind rolled up 
                     the the
                     the
                   dust along the road, bent the trees in its course and swayed the bushes
                  almost to the ground, and then fled away and left a dead calm behind. Soon a fine
                  sound filled the air; it was the rain descending in good earnest, and sounding
                  upon a million leaves. It came with a rush upon Esel, and awoke him to some
                  consciousness.
               He looked up in surprise as if awakened from sleep. He did not know where he was.
                  Fortunately he took the right direction, and now running, and then walking, to
                  catch his breath, he regained the village, drenched to the skin. The storm
                  accompanied him all the way. It thundered behind him, above him, all around him.
                  Torrents poured down, and the roads run like rivers.
               The storm had, at least, restored him to some self-possession but not to prudence.
                  Casting off a part of his clothes, and throwing a cloak loosely about him, Frank
                  Esel sat down by the open window.
               The storm had wasted its substance, or rather appeared to have driven forward like
                  an advancing army, whose artillery was still sounding in the far front, while
                  cloud-stragglers swarmed in the rear.
               There was something in this war of the elements that suited Esel's disturbed
                  feelings; yet his mind fell off from the scene before him and wandered back to his
                  childhood. Tears came at the thought of his mother. He strove to bring together
                  the disconnected scenes of his childhood that rose up before him, and to feel that
                  he was that very one; for his very identity seemed slipping from him, and he could
                  hardly make himself feel that he was that person whom he remembered in so many gay
                  and happy experiences. It was past midnight. A chill crept over him, and he
                  gathered his cloak closer about him. But he was no warmer. He shut the window and retired to his bed; but the
                  sleep he sought fled from him.
               At length, toward morning, he fell into an uneasy slumber, and dreamed all manner
                  of dreams. All the day following he was languid and depressed. He knew not what
                  ailed him. He started on looking in the glass to see the haggardness of his own
                  face. Toward evening, remembering Rose Wentworth's wish he determined to go to
                  her; but a strange apathy seemed to hang upon him. He remembered the different
                  feelings of yesterday as he trod the same path, but remembered them without
                  emotion. As he entered Dr. Wentworth's yard Rose saw him from the window, and
                  greeted him at the door.
               "Frank, this is good and noble. I knew that I did not misjudge you—But what ails
                  you, Frank? How ghastly you are!"
               For a moment a pang of anguish pierced Rose's heart. She could hardly imagine that
                  a disappointment could, in a few hours, work such a change! Esel made haste to
                  say:
               "It is nothing. I was imprudent last night. I was caught in the storm and
                  thoroughly wet. I must have taken a severe chill, for I have not felt well since.
                  But it will pass with a good sleep."
               Dr. Wentworth, overhearing a word, came from his library.
               "What, Esel, did you say you were not well?" He approached and examined him.
                  "Esel, you should return to your room; I will send you some remedies. It may be
                  but a cold; it may come to something more."
               The next day the doctor found him in a high fever, and his mind confused and
                  wandering. His mother was sent for. For many weeks he lay helpless. At length the
                  fever left him. It was several weeks yet before he could be moved; and when he
                  could bear the journey, he returned to his home. The love that he had cherished
                  for Rose was no longer a thing of this world. It had risen into the place of
                  devout thoughts. It was like a remembered vision of another world, not lawful to
                  be uttered.
               One chamber of his soul was set apart, consecrated, and there his thoughts, as to
                  a shrine, came reverently.
               As his health returned, Frank Esel betook himself to his profession with even a
                  deeper feeling than ever. He had become a man. For he had become a disciple of
                  Suffering, the only schoolmaster master who can bring men to their true manhood.
                  He had passed through his youth-time with abounding joy. Then came the real
                  awakening of his intellect, where new flights seemed like inspirations, and cast a
                  shadow upon all that went before. At last came Suffering! Not that play of care or
                  vexation which only creases the soul's surface as a puff of wind wrinkles the
                  waters, but sorrow which moves the foundations, and so deepens one's nature. No
                  one has suffered enough until he is patient of suffering. "Made perfect
                     through suffering!" Men stamped with this brand have God's mark on
                  them.
               But one should not imagine Esel as a discouraged or a broken man. He was never so
                  strong as now. He had in early years insensibly been drawn under the influence of
                  that vicious school of self-contemplatists whose victims revolve around themselves
                  all their lives, watching the development of their own genius and by self-culture,
                  attaining to self-consciousness. Esel's natural generosity had restrained him from
                  that besotted conceit which blights so many. But he had not learned to derive his
                  pleasure from the end sought, so much as from the conscious exercise of those
                  faculties by which he sought it. His sickness and previous experiences left upon
                  his mind a deep impression, that in so far as he himself was concerned, life was
                  ended. Now, whatever power he possessed was to be spent for others. All his
                  ambitions now assumed the form of kindnesses. Gradually he found his former
                  enterprise developing itself under new motives. With less exhilaration than
                  formerly, he found far more peace. He seriously questioned whether he should not
                  enter upon the service of the church, and while in that mood he wrote to Dr.
                  Wentworth, a part of whose reply we will print:
               * * * * "If you had been living out of the line of action of your strongest
                  faculties if deep religious feeling had developed powers which had been restrained
                  or overlaid by selfish plans, there might be good reason for a change of
                  profession. But you were born to be an artist. All your faculties and feelings
                  harmonize in the pursuits of art. Why should you change? You speak of self-denial
                  as necessary. Do not search for it. Whenever a lower course, a less worthy
                  feeling, contest better ones, deny them. Do not seek pain for its own sake.
                  Suffering is like many chemical agents, wholesome when combined by nature in
                     organic forms of fruit or grain, but
                  separated and employed alone, super-stimulating and injurious.
               "What would you gain? You can seek the moral benefit of society by your art as
                  really as by sermons, and probably with far greater success. Have you considered
                  in how many ways your peculiar genius can be applied to the refinement and
                  happiness of your fellow-men? Let me state simple cases which I have often
                  imagined. A sweet landscape, painted by one who saw a soul in nature, and not
                  merely forms, hanging in a sick-room for long months cheers the declining invalid
                  and becomes a minister of consolation. When the spirit is liberated, thereafter,
                  to the whole household, that picture has a sacred association. It becomes a family
                  talisman. When it passes on into another generation, it renews its labor of
                  love,—proving that the spirit of beauty may become a spirit of mercy. I can easily
                  imagine a simple landscape wrought out in the spirit of love by a skilful hand,
                  which shall diffuse more happiness than most men do in a whole life-time.
               "But your profession is, Christianly considered, the education of the community by
                  the ministration of Beauty. Painting is only one way of doing this. Why should
                  there not be drawing-classes among the poor as well as sewing-classes,
                  reading-classes, singing-classes, etc.? Men collect funds to put books
                  gratuitously in the dwellings of the poor,—why should not some Christian artist
                  spend a portion of his time in ministering beauty to households of the worthy
                  poor?
               "Even if one had no skill in painting, the ministry of beauty does not depend upon
                  manual skill. One might gather flowers day by day, from the fields to cheer the
                  poor and crippled to stand in schools; or, with faint symbolic power to bring into
                  gaunt churches some wealth and grace of natural beauty. What if one were to visit
                  the poor-house in each town, and minister,—not alone to the social feelings, to
                  the physical wants,—but to the taste and sympathy of its inmates, with gifts of
                  beauty?
               "I have often marvelled that, in a time of such taste and liberality, so little
                  should be done with trees. New England might be made a magnificent
                  park, with but a slight expense, if only one dedicated himself to doing good
                  through the love of beauty. Every great road, every bye-road, connecting towns and
                  villages, or neighborhoods, if concert were secured, might not only be judiciously
                  planted, but, by a little study and care in the selection, all the fine trees
                  might in time be employed, one road being lined with oaks, another with elms,
                  another with pines or spruces, another with maples, another with purple beeches,
                  and so on, until every county would become an arboretum. Such is the spirit of
                  emulation that, if a single town should perfect this work, other towns would catch
                  the inspiration, and the work would go on with energy until an unclothed road
                  would become a reproach. All this is a part of the work of true benevolence. If
                  you would teach within the church, you must seek ordination at the hands of man.
                  But whose heart soever God has touched with a spirit of benevolence is ordained to
                  go forth into society and preach the gospel to every creature, each man speaking
                  in the language of his own business!" * * *
               Esel had never been so busy as now, and was never so cheerful. Yet he carried in
                  his heart a feeling that never died. There was no hope in it, but a gentle
                  patience. It burned on in solitude, like a sacred lamp, which hermit hands trim
                  and feed in some recluse's cell or cave far away from the fever of the world.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               CONTRASTS.
               IF people are attracted by their opposites, as some hold, there was every reason
                  to suspect that a strong sympathy would draw Heywood and Cathcart together; for
                  they represented in a striking manner contrasting elements. Heywood's face was
                  fine even beautiful. Blue eyes, chestnut hair, inclining to curl, fine complexion,
                  and fresh color,—need it be said that his was a sanguine temperament? Cathcart's
                  striking in appearance rather by expression than by positive beauty of features,
                  dark and piercing eyes, features framed both for strength and refinement, black
                  hair;—his temperament, too, could not be mistaken. Heywood's face was genial, and
                  when excited radiant. His whole soul shone through it. Excitement shot fire
                  through every feature of Cathcart's face; but every one felt that more lay behind
                  than was expressed. There was a sense of repressed feeling and reserved
                  enthusiasm. Heywood would flame soonest, Cathcart would burn the longest.
               They were contrasted in mental qualities. Barton Cathcart's mind was reflective,
                  Tom Heywood's perceptive. Both were reasoners; but Heywood loved physical facts,
                  and reasoned upon them. Cathcart reasoned more deeply upon relations of facts, and
                  upon more subtle philosophies. As was natural, Heywood loved to reason upon the
                  actions of men, the events of society. Cathcart inclined to the study of the
                  causes of events, the nature of the mind, and the structure of society.
               It was natural for Heywood to utter, and to long to utter, whatever he had wrought
                  out in thinking, and he left the impression that in his frankness he had expressed
                  all that he had thought.
               On the other hand, Barton Cathcart without seeming reserved left the impression
                  that he offered you but a sheaf from a field, and that the reserved treasure far
                  surpassed that revealed.
               They were more nearly alike in disposition, but as contrasted as possible in the
                  forms which disposition took on. Heywood's conscience developed in the form of
                  Honor. Cathcart's moral sense had been trained as a deep, reflective, religious
                  feeling, rather than as a social element.
               Heywood did right, as in the sight of men; Cathcart as in the sight of God. Both
                  were kind, with great disinterestedness; but in the Southerner it was
                  demonstrative and generous. Less demonstrative in the Northerner, perhaps less
                  prompt, and far less attractive, it endured longer and achieved more. In the one
                  it was a blossom, in the other a fruit.
               Heywood had been reared in affluence, and had never learned to work nor to have
                  sympathy with those who did. Barton Cathcart had been inured from childhood to
                  toil, and was drawn by vital sympathy to all who labored. The Virginian was born
                  to command. He had looked down upon men from the necessity of his social position,
                  there being but two classes in the society in which he was bred—that class in
                  which men must work, and that in which they must not. The New Englander had been
                  reared in a true democracy, in which classes represented the relative forces of
                  the actors, into which and out of which men passed at their pleasure, and in which
                  there were few leaders and no aristocracy, except that which was conferred by the
                  consent of all.
               In religion they were equally contrasted. Reared an Episcopalian, Heywood regarded
                  religious truths as something settled beyond all questioning—worked out and fixed
                  as definitely as are the elements of mathematics. He had never searched the
                  grounds of truth. The church he believed to have been shaped and patterned by God
                  as much as the natural world was. He would as soon have thought of discussing the
                  authenticity of heat, or the propriety of frost, as of the services of the church.
                  Ordination was a natural law—the ministry a part of the constitution of the
                  world.
               Barton Cathcart had been reared even more earnestly to believe in revealed
                  religion. But, from his childhood, an appeal had been made to his reason. Nothing
                  marks so strikingly the faith of New England in the truth of her religious systems
                  as the boldness with which she has always challenged for them the utmost scrutiny
                  of Reason. Cathcart, from an early period, felt himself drawn into deep thought.
                  He could not rest with traditional knowledge and hereditary faith. He pursued
                  inquiries into the nature of the human mind,—whose nature will in the end
                  determine all formulas, as its philosophy has in every age fashioned all
                  theologies. He analyzed the doctrines
                  trines of the church, and disputed many of them. Led on by an indomitable desire
                  of knowing the very truth, he explored the Bible for himself with indefatigable
                  zeal. Finding the extreme reactionary Protestant doctrine, that the Bible was the
                  sole fountain of religious truth, could not be true, he began to question the
                  grounds of inspiration; then the reality of the truths revealed; what truth was
                  only relative to a process, a condition, and an age, and what was absolute—alike
                  true to every people in every age, and in all conditions of their development and
                  progress.
               Such a career of thought would have been as impossible to the brilliant Virginian
                  as the act of flying. He believed that the church categories of truth were so
                  absolutely true, that it was audacious even to question them. Investigation he
                  deemed to consist in assuming these and simply seeing how far one might go
                  consistently with them.
               Not only did Heywood rest unquestioningly upon the religion and church of his
                  fathers but he could not understand philosophical inquisitiveness in religious
                  matters in any other light than as an immorality. It was a sign not of
                  intellectual life, but of moral death. He shrunk with something akin to disgust
                  from that free spirit of inquiry and discussion which he found in New England.
               Alike in contrast were these young men in their views of life. Barton Cathcart's
                  freedom in searching the foundations of religious truth did not seem half so
                  strange to Heywood, as to Cathcart seemed Heywood's utter levity, regarding human
                  life and society. From his childhood Barton had looked with the deepest solemnity
                  upon a man's duty to his fellows. Society did not seem to him as it nearly did to
                  Heywood, a contrivance for his pleasure and aggrandizement. On the contrary, he
                  was oppressed with a sense of duty to society, which tasked him, and, after his
                  utmost industry, still chastised him for negligence.
               Barton could not imagine how Heywood could look with such a frivolous eye upon
                  human society, and yet be so conscientious almost superstitious—about religious
                  forms of thought and worship. It seemed to Barton as if Heywood worshipped
                  institutions and cared little for men,—much for the temple, nothing for the
                  worshippers.
               In spite of all these differences, these young men became warm friends. Friendship
                  is not the result of reasoning, but of sympathy; and sympathy is a thing too
                  mysterious for solution. Why do some like the smell of sandal wood and others
                  sicken at it? Why is bitter agreeable to some and offensive to others?
               Lovers sit in the early ecstasy, saying, Tell me why you love me? And
                  then, when every reason is given that fancy can suggest, does not every one know
                  that there is something deeper than all that is told?—that there is in the hidden
                  nature of faculty an attraction of one for another, which, when the conditions are
                  once secured, acts as do the great attractions of the globe, drawing all things
                  together centreward. So it is that people love not only without the leave of
                  reason, but against all its protests. There is a wisdom of feeling, as well as of
                  thought. Calculation is as often wrong as inspiration. The intuitions of our moral
                  sentiments seldom mislead us. The passions need the rein and curb, but moral
                  sentiments need the spur.
               Such differences could not but stir up frequent discussions between these friends.
                  Discussions carried on from day to day began to work their natural effect upon
                  Heywood. Questions began to arise in his mind. Doubts began to hover unbidden over
                  themes before unsullied by the faintest uncertainty. He shrank back from the
                  experience.
               "Barton, what's the use of all this disturbance? A fellow had better stick to the
                  religion to which he was educated. I do not think that it is the gentlemanly thing
                  for a man to desert his side. The Church is a good bridge enough for me. If it is
                  not right, it is not likely that I could mend it."
               "But what," said Barton, "if the bridge should stop before you reach the farther
                  bank?"
               "It will be time enough then," replied Heywood, "to consider what I shall do. But
                  the case is this: here is a river so wide that neither you nor I can see the
                  further bank. It is a turbulent and dangerous water. I see a bridge which has a
                  good and solid abutment on this side. As far its the eye can reach the bridgeway
                  is secure and ample. I propose to try it. You, on the contrary, have a notion that
                  you will row yourself over the stream, and with a skiff and an oar you intend to
                  play ferryman!"
               "Your illustration is ingenious at least," said Barton. "Now give me my turn. We
                  are upon an island in the ocean, desiring to return to our homes. Many vessels appear, and offer to takes off. All claim
                  to be safe and efficient. Shall a man use his reason and judgment in determining
                  whether any of them, and, if any, which is safe and trustworthy?"
               "There is no end to figures," said Heywood, "you can prove any thing and disprove
                  any thing by ingenious illustrations. I've seen many a jury led to the very deuce
                  by a lawyer skilful in metaphors and similes although the facts and the law were
                  against his case. But the fact is, Barton, I am no Yankee. I am not troubled with
                  that intolerable curiosity which puts your people upon prying into every thing in
                  creation. If the good Lord wants to keep any thing secret, I can't imagine what he
                  created Yankees for! They are the most restlessly inquisitive creatures—always
                  fretting themselves to find out something that was hidden away on purpose. If
                  Nature has a secret, a Yankee, I'll be bound, will pick the lock where it is kept,
                  or be eavesdropping till he gets hold of it. The fact is there is too much brain
                  here in New England. Every body is racing and chasing after causes. I believe your
                  people think they have the responsibility of the universe on their shoulders. When
                  the Bible said, 'Canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection?' there were no
                  Yankees about. Since then, five hundred ministers in this very New England think
                  they have done it! They have found God out—all that He has done, why He did it,
                  what He has not done, and why He could not do it! Did you hear that young sprout
                  preach, last Sunday afternoon, fresh from New Haven? He was amazingly precocious.
                  He went on glibly unfolding moral government. 'God must do this,'
                  and, 'God, from the nature of things, cannot do that.' There was not
                  a thing about the Infinite and Eternal which he did not fancy himself entirely
                  familiar with! Pah! I hate so much disturbance. A gentleman wants a decorous
                  faith, a good, plain, sensible worship; and then, with a good conscience, he turns
                  to the enjoyment of life, leaving to the Deity and—excuse me!—to the Yankees the
                  management of unfathomable mysteries."
               Barton could not help laughing at Heywood's banter, extravagant as it seemed.
               "Well, Heywood," said he, "I admit that there is something of the Greek in the
                  Yankee nature. Dr. Wentworth says that the New England mind is a threefold
                  cross—it has the moral nature of the Jew, the intellectual spirit of the Greek,
                  and the practical tendencies of the Roman."
               "Indeed! Did he say whence they derived the element of modesty? Only three nations
                  spoiled to make this marvellous New England? That cannot account for the riches
                  which abound! Let me see—ingenuity from Egypt, humility from China, bravery—well,
                  that must be indigenous, it is of a peculiar kind."
               "That will do, Heywood! that will do. You have given reasons enough already, why
                  Virginia should send her daughters to New England for education and her sons for
                  wives! The State that yields the best schools and finest women ranks highest."
               It might be supposed that on a subject so all-engrossing as politics had become in
                  the spring and summer of 1860, two young men like Cathcart and Heywood would find
                  themselves often in collision. But Heywood had not adopted the extreme views that
                  had prevailed in the South on the subject of slavery. He regarded the institution
                  as a misfortune. But he apologized for it, as a thing entailed upon the South, and
                  for which no present remedy could be found. Though Heywood deemed it prudent to
                  abstain from an active part in politics, yet it was plain he did not care to have
                  it concealed that his sympathy was with his Southern kindred. By a sort of
                  understanding, at length, Tom Heywood and Cathcart avoided all discussions on
                  current topics. But when did two clouds oppositely charged ever come together
                  without drawing each other's lightning? Then comes the thunder-crash; afterward it
                  clears up, and for days the air will be purer. But such crashes between friends
                  are safer in almost any other matter than politics. In spite of every effort, they
                  found themselves less intimate, less affectionate and confiding. Other causes also
                  tended and tempted to more alienation.
               Heywood's aunt had secretly determined to spare no pains to bring about a
                  connection between Rose Wentworth and young Heywood. In the first place, she
                  deemed the connection one eminently fit to be made. They seemed suited to each
                  other. Was he not a fine fellow, handsome, of gentlemanly manners, of good
                  disposition, of good family and connections? Was not Rose of noble presence, most
                  comely, a woman of genius, yet of rare domestic qualities, of great culture,
                  trained to observation, and withal free from pedantry? What more could be
                     wanting? Nothing except the consent
                  of the parties. Match-making is an art so fascinating that it is no wonder that
                  people become addicted to it. Love in young people is of itself one of the most
                  charming spectacles in human life. To see the spark struck, the fire kindled, its
                  first faint flame spreading, and finally the full glow and warmth established and
                  then to be able to say complacently, "I did it," is not all this inducement and
                  reward enough to tempt amiable souls to this species of benevolence?
               Aunt Chandler was no match-maker. This she often said. But she had no objection
                  occasionally to give good advice. She was of that honest and plain-speaking way
                  that inspired confidence. She was shrewd and prudent. She was really unselfish.
                  She had no daughters of her own. With a great motherly heart, she had no children.
                  With great skill in management, she had nobody to manage. It was quite natural
                  when young people came to her for advice she should give it. Having given advice
                  it was natural that she should be interested in seeing what became of it. But she
                  was not a match-maker! That she disapproved of. It was a responsibility that no
                  one should take. "No one could tell after all how a match might turn out; and if
                  badly, one could never forgive one's self for having brought it about."
               There was a great difference, she pleased herself with thinking, between
                  match-making and a mere influencing one to make one's own match. Suggestion,
                  reasonable influence and suitable advice did not amount to match-making.
               She beheld these two young persons, Heywood and Rose Wentworth, and saw what from
                  inexperience they might have failed to perceive, that they were "just made for
                  each other."
               She made various occasions of meeting at her house, and in her grounds—"no party,
                  a mere gathering of neighbors in the most familiar way;" teas and door-yard
                  picnics—all in a manner so natural and accidental, that she could not forbear to
                  admire the fortunate happenings of things. When people of sagacity set on foot
                  plans with foresight, if they are of a devout turn of mind, they often see the
                  hand of Providence wonderfully stretched out in their behalf. When Mrs. Chandler
                  had sent some rare old books of prints over to Dr. Wentworth, had heaped up Mrs.
                  Wentworth's table with fruit, apologizing that their grounds produced so much more
                  than they could use that it was a kindness if the neighbors would help her to use
                  it, it was natural that the doctor's family should all come over, without
                  formality, to spend an evening, and just as natural that Mrs. Chandler and her
                  husband should return the visit. And when, after the elderly people were seated in
                  a manner evidently studied for their pleasure and Rose and Heywood had the two
                  only places left, and were obliged accidentally to bear each other company, and
                  seemed content to do so, Mrs. Chandler, looking down upon them with benevolent
                  eyes, could not refrain a pious and grateful ejaculation: "How providential this
                  is! If I had had the ordering of it myself, the Lord could not have pleased me
                  better!" The more she thought about it the more Providence seemed to smile. The
                  more Providence favored it the more Mrs. Chandler smiled. It was so easy for her
                  to act with sagacity that she did not see herself in many events which fell out,
                  and fell out of her hand.
               Weeks and months passed. The young people were happy; the old people were happy.
                  It seemed strange, however, that Heywood had never spoken a word to his aunt of
                  his intentions. In imagination she had seen the happy pair coming to thank her,
                  she had helped to arrange the bridal party, she had seen the ceremony, she had
                  been to church on the first Sunday after their return from the bridal trip, and
                  she had drank in great draughts of satisfaction at the admiration with which till
                  the congregation looked on the beautiful couple; she had walked home behind them
                  and observed with rare relish those tender ways of first-blossoming love, which
                  discover newly-married people as surely as a bed of mignonnette—simple as it
                  looks—is detected by its odor. But, pleasing as are the pictures of imagination, a
                  practical mind needs something less spiritual and more substantial. Why did not
                  Heywood make some progress? Did not Rose please him? Or was there some impediment?
                  It was plain that no visible progress was made. Therefore, though averse to
                  match-making, it was proper that Mrs. Chandler should take observations and find
                  out the latitude and longitude of affairs.
               Could it be that Heywood was already engaged in Virginia? The thought was
                  startling. His aunt did not wait long for a providential opening; but, on
                  Heywood's return from an excursion, fell into conversation with him.
               "Have you had a pleasant time, Heywood? of course you have, I can see by your face. When I was young, they did
                  not have as many rides and picnics as they do now; though I fancy the young women
                  then were more sedate, less frivolous and pleasure-seeking than now."
               "Bless me, aunt, I do not know what you would call propriety if the Norwood girls
                  are not proper! I wish you might see some of our highflyers in the South!"
               "I suppose you naturally would prefer the society of Southern young ladies?"
               "I don't know about that; of course I like my own folks."
               "Well, suppose you were going to settle down in life, and wanted to choose a
                  wife—for I take it for granted that you are not engaged—are you?"
               "No, aunt, I am too young for that, or, at any rate, not yet quite ready to settle
                  down. Besides, no man marries till his time comes. I am waiting till I see some
                  one that is irresistible."
               "Do you expect some one to charge upon you and whirl you away captive?"
               "No, not exactly that; but one likes shy game and fish not easily landed. I see
                  persons good enough, doubtless—perhaps too good for me; yet, after all, one does
                  not like to know before he takes a step just how it will all end."
               "Upon my word, Heywood, this is superlatively modest! I did not think that you
                  were one of those conceited dandies that thought every woman who looked at him was
                  in love with him. But I can tell you in good earnest, sir, that those who are most
                  worthy when won are not the easiest to win."
               "Aunt, I mean no offence to the sex, and none to you especially. You asked me a
                  plain question, and I gave you a plain answer."
               "Of the young ladies, sir malapert, whom you have laid under obligation this
                  afternoon with your charming presence, how many of them do you believe that you
                  could have for the asking?"
               "Every one of them. This sounds conceited to you, aunt, but I look at it in this
                  way: I know that I am a presentable young gentleman, with reasonably good
                  prospects. I cannot deny the sight of my eyes that my presence is agreeable to the
                  young ladies. I take it for granted that they all expect to enter the matrimonial
                  state whenever a suitable offer is made; and it does not seem conceited cited at
                  all to imagine that a lady who receives your addresses with marked favor would
                  accept your offer, should you press a suit."
               "You were never more mistaken in your life. I will instance but a single one—Rose
                  Wentworth. I wish with all my heart that you might win her; but it will not be
                  done just by the asking, let me tell you."
               "Why, there was not one of the party so cordial and frank. I went home with her,
                  and she seemed a good deal softened and sentimental. She talked of trees and
                  flowers, and of the spirit and of an inner life. I think I understand such things.
                  If I had just said the word, I fully believe that I should now be asking your
                  approbation to our union."
               "This passes all belief! I lose faith in you, at least in your good judgment. You
                  have no more conception of Rose Wentworth than you have of those who live in the
                  stars. If you had presumed upon her cordial ways and mentioned love, I should like
                  to have stood by and seen her large eyes flash upon you."
               "Why, aunt, do you think she is such a paragon?"
               "I do—I do. She is beyond all words the noblest young woman that I have ever
                  known. But what she is no one can know, nor she herself, until something rouses
                  her. She is capable of rising into grandeur if circumstances favored. If by the
                  wisest and most skilful wooing you could win Rose, you would be the happiest of
                  living men; and twenty years hence you would find your happiness but just
                  begun!"
               "Why, aunt, you rather pique my curiosity. If you really think that she is so hard
                  to win, I am almost disposed to try it."
               "Young man," said Mrs. Chandler, almost sternly, "you may as well let it alone as
                  to try in that spirit."
               And the subject was dropped.
               Some influences are like spurs and striking into the sides they produce instant
                  motion. Others are seeds, and when sown seem utterly lost; yet in silence and
                  darkness they are germinating and growing. Mrs. Chandler said no more, but she
                  thought a good deal more.
               "I don't believe things will rest as they are. I think Heywood has received some
                  notions that will work in him. But what if Rose should not take a fancy to him? Of
                  course she likes him; but that does not
                  mean any thing in particular. She is a world too kind and generous, and likes
                  every body, and Heywood has been fooled by it. He thinks that kindness is love.
                  That's just like a man! But then he has all his life been run after and praised,
                  poor fellow. He is to be pitied, not blamed."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVI.
               VARIETIES.
               NOTHING enhances the value of an object more than to know that others value it and
                  are competing for it. Mrs. Chandler furnished both stimulants to Heywood. I cannot
                  say how she obtained the information, but she had been led to believe that Barton
                  Cathcart had directed his attentions toward Miss Wentworth. Some such stories had
                  risen and died out in the village. The signs all failed. Mrs. Chandler, perhaps,
                  had not even heard of them. One day, however, she returned home after a visit to
                  Dr. Wentworth's, and in consequence of information—what, I never knew—she said to
                  her husband by the merest accident, in Heywood's presence:
               "Would it not be strange, my dear, if Barton Cathcart should marry Rose
                  Wentworth?"
               Her husband looked at her with simplicity, and said:
               "I suppose so."
               "Do you think it would be a good match?"
               "I don't see any objection, provided the parties are willing."
               "But really, my dear, I can't hardly imagine that Rose should prefer such a man,
                  unless it was her only chance. But then you can never tell. Getting in love is
                  like picking garden flowers in the night. You may get a violet, or you may pick a
                  nettle. It seems to me that Rose might do better than to take Cathcart."
               Tom Heywood thought it worth his while to take a more close survey of the ground.
                  He had been under the impression, for some time that he had gone as far as it was
                  safe to go unless he were willing to go, further; that Rose was very susceptible
                  and simple; and that, as a man of honor, it was his duty, having a far better
                  knowledge of life and especially of affairs of the heart, to see to it that she
                  was not harmed.
               He was so far influenced by his aunt's remarks from time to time that he was
                  determined at any rate to probe the matter, and to see just how things really
                  were. His visits became more frequent and his attentions were assiduous. He
                  exerted himself in conversation, he
                  went through the usual musical routine on such occasions and after a considerable
                  period he found himself in just the same place as at the beginning. It was a new
                  experience, and piqued his pride. He began to perceive some zest in this pursuit.
                  On the whole, he was glad that Miss Wentworth had not dropped into his hands as
                  easily as he at first feared. He was satisfied that Miss Rose was genuine; that
                  there was no artfulness; that she was playing no part.
               He absented himself for a time, but at his next visit his absence excited no
                  remark. He discussed the ladies of Norwood, and expressed admiration for one or
                  two in particular. He found Miss Rose the most generous of critics and the most
                  discriminating of friends. Thus far Miss Wentworth had been to him an inferior, in
                  the sense that a beautiful child is to an elder brother. He began to admit now
                  that she was his equal, and to experience a respect which he had never felt before
                  for a pretty woman. He now read favorite authors aloud, and indulged in
                  criticisms. He discussed various questions in literature, in art, in science. If
                  Heywood chose to talk of gay trifles, so did she. Just as naturally and
                  unaffectedly did she follow and accompany him if music or painting were the theme.
                  If he introduced a discussion, Rose entered with zest but never with heat, into
                  philosophical reasoning and in matters of natural science proved herself far
                  better informed than was Heywood. He could not deny that a more intimate
                  acquaintance raised his opinion of Miss Wentworth. Indeed he began to admit to
                  himself that she was a woman worthy of pursuit! But he made no progress. He was as
                  near, and just as far from, her, after weeks and months had passed, as at the
                  beginning. He could not understand it. He watched to discover the exquisite art,
                  the subtle fence, by which he was warded off. Nothing could be discovered but
                  simple, artless, straightforward conduct.
               It would not be just to leave the impression that Heywood's pride alone, or
                  chiefly, had wrought in him a determination to press his suit to an issue. At
                  every step he found warmer sentiments kindling. Admiration had passed on a stage,
                  and began to take on the colors of love. Love, once entertained, throve; and with
                  a genuine affection there came a great change over him, and for the better. A deep
                  and true love is full of humility and gratitude. Heywood dropped that ill-fitting
                  conceit which veiled his real goodness, and his overweening confidence in himself
                  gave way to diffidence. Once or twice, arming himself with a determination to
                  bring his fate to an issue, he found himself, he knew not how, carried away from
                  his purpose, and as far from success as ever.
               At last he determined that, with whatever abruptness it was necessary, he would
                  make known to Rose his sentiments and at least, know whether or not he was to be
                  blessed.
               There was to be the weekly gathering at Dr. Wentworth's on the morrow. The house
                  and grounds lay open to all family friends. No formality prevailed. Every one was
                  left to come and go with perfect freedom. One might be sure of seeing Judge Bacon
                  there, and Mr. Edwards, and almost always Parson Buell, and Mr. Brett, and Mrs.
                  Chandler, and occasionally Mr. Chandler, and once in a while 'Biah Cathcart and
                  his wife. Alice came every week and Barton was there at least to take tea. Besides
                  these regulars, there was a militia of visitors, or the friends of friends, so
                  that on pleasant days, sometimes two or three score of people roamed about the
                  grounds in knots and circles; the young people securing their own company, and the
                  elder people discoursing apart, or joining the young folks, as it chanced to
                  please them. It is in such circumstances that love finds its fairest
                  opportunities. A thousand chances turn up for a look, a word with an emphasis, or
                  for a passing sentence, and if both parties be in sympathy, it is surprising to
                  see by how many accidents they are favored. They are sent on some errand, one to
                  help the other; or they are left alone, every person about them having the most
                  natural reasons in the world for going off. The very sun seems to wink at them
                  through the blinking leaves. The shadows that gather about them serve as a
                  protecting screen. Every thing favors fortunate love! No one knew the advantages
                  of such circumstances better than Heywood. No one had less art to discern
                  opportunity than Cathcart.
               On the appointed morrow, therefore, Heywood, with a charming grace, passed from
                  group to group, and not a person in the grounds was there who did not feel that
                  Heywood had paid them most agreeable personal attention. Certainly Alice Cathcart
                  thought so with reason. Heywood took his place by her side, and either he found
                  her in her happiest mood, or had the art to draw forth her hidden power: for Alice
                  fairly blossomed. Rose, who knew what
                  treasure lay hidden deep within, was delighted to have others perceive it. Barton
                  had never seen his sister so radiant, and exhibit such force of conversation. She
                  met Heywood's compliments and threw them back as a mirror throws back the sunlight
                  that falls upon it; and when, in an encounter of wit that followed, Alice fairly
                  vanquished him, Heywood, plucking a wreath of the honeysuckle vine, and twining in
                  it a spray or two of crimson fuchsias, with fine manner offered to crown her
                  saying, with a humorous modesty: "The Muses are to be crowned, not contended
                  with."
               All clapped and cried bravo! bravo! and no one seemed so radiantly happy as Rose,
                  except Alice herself. She seemed strangely brilliant; and when the beautiful,
                  glossy green leaves, and the glowing colors of the fuchsia, were laid upon her
                  raven hair, Heywood called all to witness how much she resembled Raphael's picture
                  of "Poesie."
               Dr. Wentworth and his friends repaired to the old drooping elm. Soon they fell
                  into conversation. I know not how the subject of cathedrals came up, but Dr.
                  Wentworth called to Rose:
               "My child, bring me two or three volumes of Britton's Cathedrals of England.
                  Perhaps some of these nimble gentlemen will help you."
               Heywood was standing by Alice, though listening to every thing that concerned
                  Rose. He would have sprung to fulfil the intimation, but at that moment Alice was
                  addressing a question to him. Barton Cathcart quietly moved toward the house, and
                  repairing to the library, brought out the volumes. One of them was opened to the
                  ground plan of York Minster, and laid upon the grass.
               "Sit down by me, disciple," said Judge Bacon to Cathcart, "and hear Dr. Wentworth
                  make a plea in behalf of idolatry."
               "The unassisted reason of man must derive its notion of Divinities either from the
                  material world, or from man himself. I suspect that much of what we have been
                  taught to regard as a stupid idolatry was regarded, in its time, by intelligent
                  worshippers, only as a kind of symbolism. Trees were supposed to
                     contain deities. Fire was the element through which gods
                  manifested themselves. If I had lived before the days of Revelation, I should have
                  worshipped the Sun, or Trees."
               "On such a day as this, Doctor," said Bacon, "I think you would be glad to run
                  under your tree-god to get rid of your sun-god. But I suppose you would divide the
                  year between them, and say prayers to the sun in winter, and to the trees in
                  summer."
               "You were speaking of cathedrals and the origin of Gothic architecture," said
                  Edwards.
               "Yes, I was reprobating the idea that Gothic architecture was in any sense an
                  imitation of trees. There is some analogy, however, between the impression made
                  upon the mind by a forest and by a cathedral. There is the same sense of solitary
                  grandeur, the same peculiar feeling of solemn mystery arising from vast height, a
                  similar play of light and shade, and a spirit of devotion which I think is
                  spontaneous and inevitable in both."
               "Father, were you as much affected by the first cathedral that you saw as you
                  expected to be?" asked Rose, who had placed a stool near her father, and left
                  Alice on the outer part of the circle attended by Heywood.
               "I really had expected but little. It was neither taste nor devotion that first
                  drew me to York Minster. It was curiosity. But I was overwhelmed with wonder. The
                  mystery and awe produced by height and vastness in the interior I can compare to
                  nothing but the feeling which one has who, either by day, or in a starlit night,
                  lies alone in the fields on his back, looking long right up into the heavens,
                  which seem slowly to open, deeper and more deep, until, with strange presentiment,
                  one almost feels that he is drawing near to the Eternal City! By some subtle
                  sympathy, one's spirit swells and is conscious of wonderful elevation. It is a
                  consciousness of superiority, dignity, grandeur. The same thing befell me on the
                  first time that I stood at Niagara. I found myself stepping proudly, like a
                  conqueror, and moving with the dignity of a prince. But in a cathedral-experience
                  this is tempered by certain other influences, which inspire tenderness and
                  sadness. Now if upon this state of mind there arises a solemn chant borne upon the
                  waves of organ music especially if one is in a foreign land touched a little with
                  homesickness and hears those sacred psalms which are laden with the most solemn
                  and tender associations of his life, coming back to him in such a bewildering
                  place, fringed with murmuring echoes, is it strange that the spirit seems to drop the body, and to hover, in
                  its full glorious liberty, on the bounds of the Infinite and the Eternal?"
               Judge Bacon watched the Doctor as he proceeded, with a smile, whether of sympathy
                  or of incredulity one could not well divine. Neither did his words make his real
                  thoughts any clearer. He was so used to a bantering irony that he often employed
                  it when, at heart, he was in full sympathy with the person against whom it was
                  directed.
               "I confess, Doctor," said he with mock sadness, "that I have never felt this sense
                  of leaving the body and rising into a beatific condition, except in one set of
                  circumstances."
               "What were they?" asked Wentworth, with some slight surprise.
               "When I have been in the act of falling asleep in church, under the refreshing
                  influence of a long and sound discourse?"
               "You are not a frequent sleeper, Judge, according to my observations," said Parson
                  Buell. "Indeed I have regarded you as one of the wakeful and watching."
               "Ah, that is the minister's fault. Instead of the absurd method now pursued of
                  doctrinal examination, if I were set to select clergymen, I should pick and
                  determine by their somniferousness. I would settle the man that yielded sleep, and
                  turn away every candidate that kept me awake. A minister should be a true Pulpit
                  Poppy! But go on, Doctor, as your remarks were not half an hour long, I know that
                  you had but just entered on the topic of cathedrals."
               "The cathedral is really a symbol of Christianity, complex, multitudinous,
                  sublime! It was not enough for men to make the cross the symbol of their faith, to
                  wear it on the person, to affix it to churches, to shape utensils to its form, to
                  fashion the very doors and windows so that they should frame to the eye the figure
                  of the cross; but some bold man determined that the cross should be reared in
                  proportions so vast that a Christian assembly could worship, not before it, but
                  within it. Look upon this ground plan. It is a noble cross. A cathedral script of
                  its accessories is but a sublime cross subsidizing to itself the resources of
                  society. The gorgeous windows the elaborate ornaments the exquisite carvings of
                  men, beasts and foliage, silently represent the homage which art, man, and nature,
                  pay to the cross. Symbolism can go no further. Every city of England has lying in
                  tranquil grandeur within it an architectural cross. Not that one which glows upon
                  the spire like the morning and the evening star; nor those which stand at the
                  altar; or are wrought in colors upon the windows; but in the foundations
                  themselves! All the rough and hidden stones have for hundreds of years lain in the
                  silent and invisible fashions of the cross, upon whose pattern rises—glowing more
                  and more with beauty and art—every wall, and the mighty whole. The cross is thus
                  the root of architecture!"
               "For once, I must say, bravo! Your notions have some plausibleness, though little
                  originality," said Judge Bacon; "and I can well imagine how a thousand men shut up
                  in a stone cross, on oak benches, and obliged to listen, as we are, to prolix
                  discourse, might think it a kind of crucifixion."
               "Oh, Judge, if I could once see you fairly taken off your feet with enthusiasm, as
                  I was at Winchester, I would willingly suffer all your jibes for the ret of my
                  life."
               "How was that father? Do tell us," said Rose who had changed her place to give
                  Alice a nearer seat, placing herself in such a way that Heywood was no longer
                  facing her.
               "The day had been warm, like this, though a month earlier, it being in July. The
                  afternoon was well advanced, and the sun was sunk so low that it poured its light
                  through the exhalations rising from the ground—very much as the sun is now doing,"
                  said the doctor, turning toward the west. "See how these evergreens seem fairly
                  banked up against a very cloud of light! Well, I had little idea of the interior
                  of Winchester Cathedral, and the exterior was not as impressive as several others.
                  But as I entered the west door, the nave clear up to the ceiling seemed to blaze
                  with light. The construction stone is pale yellow almost white and the red light
                  of this afternoon gave it a peculiar charm. Unlike other cathedrals, there were no
                  dark spaces, no mysterious recesses, nothing dim or solemn. All was radiant and
                  glorious. It was not Mystery and Awe, but Revelation and Joy, that were
                  symbolized! To complete the enchantment, the organ was filling the vast space with
                  rich harmonies."
               Judge Bacon, who had been looking toward the haze of golden light, turned round
                  with an impressive gesture.
               "My dear Doctor, if one could only go to meeting in a cathedral dral, what joy would it be! Especially for
                  children, what a godsend under a dull sermon. Now what can children do in church?
                  The sermon they can't understand. They are not allowed to sleep; they are too
                  tired to sit up, and are not allowed to lie down. Cry they can't, and laugh they
                  must not. I used slyly to make rabbits with my handkerchief. But a cathedral
                  affords boundless amusement for the eyes. While a prosaic passage was droning in
                  my ears, I could busy myself in tracing the colors in the windows making out the
                  ridiculous old saints or recalling the amusing legends. If the discourse ran on
                  doctrine—the veritable act of giving a stone to those who want bread—I could study
                  the curious carvings—stone foliage, stone dragons, stone beasts, in all their
                  varieties! Look here, Doctor,—I believe that cathedrals would convert me! What a
                  pity that we have none! One of the benefits which I anticipate from the spread of
                  Romanism in America is the introduction of the Roman Civil Law and of cathedrals
                  to put to shame the plainness of meeting-houses, and also to ally religion with
                  taste!"
               "You might as well sigh for barons' castles, princes, palaces, Roman forums, Greek
                  temples, Egyptian pyramids. Men forget that all institutions, customs, schools of
                  painting, special forms of architecture are the outworking of the inward spirit of
                  an Age. When that spirit changes, or dies out, it is in vain to attempt to
                  reproduce its mere forms again, except as dead memorials. Cathedrals had their
                  epoch. They represent a geologic period, as it were, in the moral world. We might
                  as well attempt to bring back ancient manuscripts with their splendid
                  illuminations, instead of printed books; or to re-introduce the armor and armies
                  of the Middle Ages, instead of rifles and artillery. It is this very blunder that
                  they commit who attempt to reproduce the art-spirit of a period long gone by, by
                  copying its dead forms. If it was good for any thing in its own time, that is the
                  very reason why it will be out of place in our time."
               "For gracious' sake, Doctor, pause! What have we done to deserve such a discourse?
                  Bethink you! It is not Sunday! A gentleman in Boston sent his Irish servant to his
                  wine cellar to draw from a cask of choice Madeira a specimen glass. The servant
                  forgot to turn the faucet, and all night the stream trickled—ran—trickled until
                  not a drop was left."
               "Well, Judge, what then?"
               "Sure enough, I begin to see that the case will not apply to you; for the cask
                     did at length run dry, and stop. You run dry enough, but never
                  stop. But, at the risk of starting you off again, I cannot help saying that, after
                  such a sentimental description as you gave of the effects of a cathedral on
                     you, to follow on with the statement that cathedrals have no
                  longer any function—are dead—mere mighty museums, is peculiarly refreshing to a
                  logical mind!"
               "Both things are true, nevertheless. I was speaking of old cathedrals, in whose
                  presence a thousand years rise up in dim procession, whose very strangeness stirs
                  the imagination, in which lie buried kings and prelates whose doings filled their
                  own age and gave color to history,—to walk in them is like a vision of the
                  Resurrection! Generations long gone, with passions like ours, but with ideas
                  foreign and strange, rise before you. While the trance is upon you, if the organ
                  sounds and the choir chant, you seem to stand with the exceeding great multitude
                  of past ages, and the imagination, that flies free through all time and space,
                  gathers about you the good and great of ten centuries, and you are one of an
                  invisible multitude which no man can number of every age, and all tongues, lifting
                  up a common praise to God! Your own heart, for the moment, seems to express a
                  devotion as wide as creation, find to be the instrument by which generations are
                  praising God! You can reproduce a stone cathedral in our day, but can you clothe
                  it with five hundred or a thousand years? A clean, new cathedral, in America, is a
                  solecism. It is not in harmony with our wants, our ideas, or our sympathies. It is
                  a huge and bungling imitation, and counterfeit. It is a forgery upon Time. Even
                  old cathedrals have lost their power upon those familiar with them. Use deadens
                  romance. They are for pilgrims,—far-comers,—not for the resident inhabitants. For
                  a few, of romantic tendency, they may retain their influence ever fresh, but for
                  the mass of men they no longer have any message. The common people have gone on
                  and left these magnificent monuments of the sincerity of a strong but rude age to
                  poets and antiquarians!
               Religion seems to have had a hard time in this world. It is busy with its
                  institutions, its governments, its doctrines and orders that it has little time to
                  bestow on men."
               "That is more true than you meant. But it is not true of religion more than of justice of beauty, of every
                  organized principle."
               "You are right for once, Doctor," said Judge Bacon. "The law is an analogous case
                  in point. We go back with great interest and profit to the Roman law and to the
                  common law of England. But, if the common law of England as it was three hundred
                  years ago, or if Justinian's code were to be introduced bodily into modern courts,
                  they would be in incessant conflict with society in all its interests."
               Dr. Wentworth resumed:
               "Cathedrals and liturgies, after losing their original force and function, derive
                  a secondary value as a connecting medium between remote periods and ages. Their
                  associations are like mistletoe on aged trees, which have a value which the trees
                  do not. The attempt to create a modern liturgy is evidence of how little men
                  understand the law of growth. Liturgies of power are those which have in them the
                  voice of ages. It is the breath of the whole Church that breathes through them. To
                  forsake these, and to make modern liturgies is as if a man should cut down from
                  about his mansion the oaks and elms that had grown majestic through hundreds of
                  years, and then attempt to imitate their shade and grandeur by setting out
                  starveling Lombardy poplars."
               "But," said Judge Bacon, "you ought to admit that a Puritan cathedral would be
                  proper. Its structure might be new, but its spirit, which according to you is the
                  essential thing, would be old enough. It would be far older than Justinian. It
                  would be as old as Moses. The Puritans were men of the Old Testament more than of
                  the New. Their writings breathe its spirit, employ its language; and their laws
                  sought to imitate the old Hebrew code, and in some instances the Levitical laws
                  are ludicrously woven into the old colony legislation."
               "It will always be so," responded Dr. Wentworth, accepting the new direction thus
                  suggested for the conversation, "with men in a minority suffering persecution for
                  a good cause. They will take to the Old Testament as patriots do to the mountains
                  when oppressors harry the land. The reason is obvious. The old prophets were grand
                  figures, standing almost alone against a back-ground of cruelty and corruption,
                  both in faith and morals. Their experience breathes in the psalms, and in the
                  major and minor prophets. No mistake is greater than to suppose that the Books of
                  Prophecy are filled with prophesying, or that the special predictions constitute
                  the chief value of these undying Scriptures. They are the heart journals of great
                  men, almost alone, waging war with every form of civil and social iniquity. They
                  reveal all the shades of fear doubt despondency, incident to moral conflict. They
                  reveal Suffering and Consolation as no drama ever did. The great truths of Natural
                  Justice; the absolute faith that the world was organized for righteousness, and
                  that iniquity is sure to be a losing game; that the Invisible Power, who sits
                  silent behind the clouds while every thing seems to overwhelm the good and promote
                  the bad, is nevertheless awake, aroused and terribly in earnest for truth and
                  justice; and that he seems remiss only because Jehovah works in larger circles
                  than those in which men work, and brings events to their account and judgment a
                  little later and lower down than men desire and expect. These are those elements
                  of the prophetic books that will always make them the refuge of the oppressed. But
                  the Puritan, if he went to the Old Testament for consolation and strength,
                  certainly did not find there the peculiar intellectual elements which marked him.
                  The intellectual contrast between the Hebrew and the Puritan is as great as that
                  between Jerusalem and Athens. The Hebrew was neither an analyst nor a reasoner;
                  the Puritan was both. Emotion is the staple of Hebrew thought. His very reasoning
                  were swells of moral feeling. In Judea it was feeling that fed thought; in New
                  England it is thought that produces feeling."
               "You mean that ought to do it," said the Judge. "I wish in my soul it did! It was
                  a poor exchange that the Puritan made when he bargained off imagination for logic,
                  emotion for metaphysics, moral consciousness for proof. A genuine Yankee Puritan
                  thinks that he can prove any thing. He would address an argument to each letter of
                  the alphabet, proving that A is A, that B is B. He would delight to hear somebody
                  doubt the multiplication table, that he might prove it. I am tired of logic, and
                  argument, and doctrine, and discussion. The fact is, Doctor, since Tommy Heywood
                  has been in town, I have taken to the Episcopal Church, where every thing is cut
                  and dried, and the service is so long that the sermon has to be short. I leave
                  serious thoughts of joining."
               
               "I am glad, Judge, to learn that you have serious thought about any thing
                  religious. The New England theologians have not been poetic, Edwards, perhaps,
                  excepted; and he soon repressed a genius which, under other culture, would have
                  placed him among the immortal few. Curiously enough, they have undervalued the
                  imagination, and sought to replace it with solid reasonings, I must admit that, at
                  some period, they have had an almost pharisaic pride of logic and pure
                  metaphysics. But in spite, of their exclusion of the literary forms of the
                  imagination, they have dealt with great moral truths in such a manner that the
                  imagination of their people has been powerfully developed. The impression that New
                  England men are practical and shrewd, but not imaginative or æsthetic, has arisen
                  from the fact that peculiar influences prevented the development of imagination in
                  the direction of poetry, and music, or of the fine arts. Puritan influences shut
                  up in a measure these channels. Imagination followed the lines of speculation.
                  Instead of forming itself into sound and physical forms it inspired systems of
                  thought. The poems of Dante are not more complete pictures than are the sermons of
                  Edwards, if you drop from both the instrument of language, and compare simply the
                  picture which is left in the mind. The vast realm of thought traversed by New
                  England theology, involving the philosophy of the human mind, the nature of moral
                  government, and so, by corollary, of human governments-the profound inquiries into
                  cause and effect,—the invisible sphere of the will,—the relations of character to
                  future condition,—the Future itself, its eternal sovereign, its antithetic
                  kingdom, like night over against the day,—and the pressure of thought toward
                  infinite and insoluble problems might have been expected to give a very practical
                  result. In fact, however, it led to immense fertility and to a practical
                  wisdom.
               "In a greater extent, probably, than ever before was the whole population, for two
                  hundred years, educated to receive a copious, minute and immense system of truth,
                  without any symbols, without old superstitions, without any thing for the eye or
                  ear, sustained purely by the exercise of reason, and in directions where the
                  reason depended largely upon the imagination. In other lands, the popular faith
                  rested upon an order of men lifted into splendid authority. The New England
                  clergyman was a plain citizen, utterly disdaining ing all trappings. Elsewhere,
                  cathedrals, festive days, and gorgeous ceremonies sustained men's belief. It is
                  hardly possible to make barrenness more bare of all appliances for the senses than
                  was New England. Yet there arose in the popular mind a vast and stately system of
                  truth covering two worlds."
               "Take breath, Doctor, let us see! Elm trees, cathedrals, pre-Raphaelitism, the Old
                  and New Testament, the Puritan, New England clergymen, and New England theology! I
                  put it to you, as a humane and honest physician, whether there are not too many
                  medicines for one bolus? You are a perfect old Druid, and sit under your tree as
                  if the chief end of man was to talk and hear talking! By the way, your elm tree
                  ought to be an oak—that is the tree of piety and wisdom."
               "By no means. The oak is the English tree. But the elm is the American tree."
               "I suspect you are led astray this time, Doctor," said Judge Bacon, "because you
                  own so wonderful a tree. Every body praises his own. The pine tree is the symbol
                  of New England. It is the tree of liberty, flourishing as liberty always has among
                  the hills and mountains—tough and hardy, deriving nourishment from the poorest
                  soils and enduring the severest winters, without losing its foliage, fighting
                  winter storms with its banner all unfolded! The only tree fit to represent our
                  liberty people is the one that is as green in winter as in summer. There! what do
                  you say to that as a specimen of discourse in your own vein?"
               "It is thoroughly well said," replied Wentworth, "and if we were at liberty now to
                  select the tree of Liberty, undoubtedly that would be it. But it has been done for
                  us. The elm is historic. It is identified not only with American ideas and men,
                  but with the great struggles of liberty. The Pittsfield elm, now a mere wreck, was
                  a rallying point in our Revolution, as it had been before among the aborigines.
                  What shall we say of the elms in Springfield, in Hadley, in Hatfield, which have
                  played a part in colonial history? And what of that famous Boston Common Elm,
                  which is to Massachusetts what the Charter Oak was to Connecticut?"
               "Stop—stop. Now you are on my ground. The elm on the Boston Common was not the
                  Charter Oak of Massachusetts. It was another elm tree which you have probably
                  forgotten. I mean the old elm that
                  stood on the corner of Essex and Medway Streets in Boston, now Essex and
                  Washington streets. Planted in 1646, it was more than a hundred years old when the
                  pre-revolutionary excitements were taking place in Boston. I don't believe there
                  was ever a city in the world where the men in authority had such hard work in
                  putting a yoke on its people, as Boston. It was always a famous talking place. I
                  can imagine a governor's opinion of such men as Sam Adams and old John Adams and
                  their set. Let me see—didn't you come from Boston, Doctor? Well, no matter. One
                  bright morning, when the sun rose, a marvel appeared. In the night the dew, or
                  Puck, had shaped in golden letters and nailed with a spike upon the elm, 'Tree of Liberty.' The offence was remembered, and in 1775 the British
                  soldiers cut down the dangerous tree."
               "Thank you, Judge. If any tree should be adopted as the national symbol, it is the
                  American elm—the historic 'Tree of Liberty.'"
               "I forgot to say," said the Judge, with a knowing look, "what every true Yankee
                  will be delighted to learn, that the tree cut up into fourteen cords of wood! Only
                  imagine what a fortune that would be, if all this were to-day in the hands of some
                  honest farmer. He would fill the land with souvenirs and make his fortune to boot.
                  For we should have the miracle of the oil and meal over again. The wood would
                  never give out. It would grow on his hands faster than ever it did on its own
                  roots."
               "We are agreed, then, the elm is the Tree of Liberty. It is the National
                  Tree!"
               The sun went down. Pete Sawmill was busy passing from the kitchen to the table,
                  spread in an adjoining space among evergreen trees. The company broke up and
                  repaired thither for tea. Seats were arranged in nooks and coverts, among the
                  shrubbery, and friends formed into groups here and there, in the most
                  unconstrained liberty. Rose flitted hither and thither with hospitable attentions,
                  seeming to take no part for herself except the pleasure of serving. So Heywood
                  found to his chagrin. An evil fate hampered him all the evening. Nothing fell out
                  fortunately; and he returned home under a cloud. Alice remained for the night.
               "Why, Alice," said Rose when they had repaired to their rooms, "what a woman of
                  society you have become! You used to admire my freedom in company. It is now my
                  turn to envy you. I never saw you so brilliant."
               Alice smiled. Yet the expression of her face was not altogether of pleasure. As
                  clouds coming and going, in a bright moonlight evening, seem to shade or brighten
                  the lawn, so in alternation pleasing thoughts and sad ones cast their reflections
                  upon Alice's face.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXVII.
               NUTTING—ITS JOYS AND DISASTERS.
               WHEN Autumn days come, Nature, like a retired merchant, changes its manner—from
                  thrift and bustling industry to languid leisure and to ostentatious luxury. The
                  sun rises later and sets earlier than when it had all the summer crops on hand and
                  was Playing universal husbandman. There is no nest-building now, and no
                  bird-singing,—which is a purely domestic arrangement, designed on the birds' part
                  to keep peace in the family while the children are being raised, and laid aside as
                  soon as the young birds are off their hands. Mornings come fleeced in mists, which
                  hang over streams and low, moist places. The sun plays with them, but they perish
                  in his arms. A few belated flowers yet keep watch, but chiefly the asters, which
                  fringe the fields, star the edges of forests, and, like a late-comer at a feast,
                  seem bent upon making up lost time. At night, crickets and katy-dids scrape their
                  shrill viols, and fill the air with stridulous music. Over all the shrinking
                  fields, the trees lift up their gorgeous foliage, and, like those who wait for the
                  marriage-bell and the bridegroom, they shine out in glorious apparel.
               The hills, forest-clad, are become the Lord's younger sons, and, like Joseph, they
                  are dressed in a coat of many colors. October days, short between horizons, reach
                  higher into the vault than any days of the year; and through them the season seems
                  to look with softened sadness, as one who, in the calm of age, meditates on all
                  the mistakes of his past life and solemnly thinks upon the advancing future. Along
                  the fence rows, where seeds and late berries may be found, birds hop silently, as
                  if ashamed to be seen. Soon they will change their solitary ways and collect in
                  flocks. To-day, the fields will swarm with them; to-morrow, there will not be one
                  left, and they will be picking their food many degrees of latitude south.
               In the gay sadness of autumn, Barton Cathcart, now released from his school,
                  wandered about with his gun. Sometimes he brought home from the hills his bag full
                  of squirrels, and sometimes times from the bosky coverts he secured many brace of
                  partridges. At other times, he wandered all day without once firing his gun.
               Barton loved field sports, yet not so keenly that he chased through the woods and
                  coverts without observation. He stopped to trace the lines of lichen on stones or
                  the exquisite mosses in damp and shaded nooks. Many squirrels ran and hid while he
                  stood under the yellow-leaved nut trees admiring the russet hickories, the
                  brilliant maples, scarlet, pink and yellow. He remembered what Dr. Wentworth had
                  said of cathedrals, and stretched on a dry knoll, he sometimes lay for a long time
                  looking up into the arched trees, tracing imaginary groinings, or listening to the
                  low sounds of the winds that chanted through the trees and cast down to the ground
                  multitudes of yellow leaves on which they had just been playing. So silent and so
                  immovable did he lie, and so long, that the squirrels forgot to be shy, descended
                  to the ground and played their nimble pranks before him, or sprung from branch to
                  branch overhead, barking and chattering in full security. Ah, these great October
                  days!—October woods! October musings!
               It was his purpose in November to repair to Cambridge to attend a course of
                  lectures upon law.
               Meanwhile he was at home again,—living over, as in a gentle trance, the scenes of
                  his boyhood visiting the haunts which his early experience had made dear to him.
                  He recalled the frolics which Rose and Alice had so often had around the old
                  farm-house.
               But when he thought of his sister now, and of Miss Wentworth, these memories
                  seemed like some fairy tale, read in a book, rather than an actual history in
                  which he himself had been a living actor.
               But young Cathcart's mood was not wholly a sentimental sympathy with the changing
                  year, the shortening days, the flight of birds and the decay of flowers. He had
                  not been unobservant of his friend's demeanor. He fancied that he perceived in
                  Rose Wentworth a growing pleasure in Heywood's attentions. He resisted the
                  impression stoutly. He cast it out with a resolute effort. it returned again. When
                  the mind is ill at ease and restless a forbidden thought in spite of all its
                  efforts, will play about it as at night a moth whirls about a lamp; and, like this
                  foolish moth-miller, the more it is hurt by the flame through which it dashes, the more irresistible seems the
                  attraction, until singed, maimed and sore, the poor insect lies crumpled up
                  beneath the light which lured it to its destruction.
               It is not to be imagined that Cathcart had for the several years past lived in an
                  unbroken dream of hope, while at the same time he had taken no direct steps to
                  secure his position in Miss Wentworth's regard.
               Until he was established in life, or had a near prospect of it, he did not deem it
                  honorable, certainly not wise, to disclose to Miss Wentworth the secret hope of
                  his life. A more impulsive and less reticent nature could scarcely have met the
                  object of his supreme affection from week to week without disclosing his feelings.
                  Some moment of unguarded enthusiasm would be likely to draw forth the confession.
                  Some eager and supplicating glance would be likely to betray what the tongue
                  faltered to tell. Even in a nature as self-restrained and silent as Barton
                  Cathcart's, this long probation must have ended itself in some unexpected
                  disclosure, had he not marked out for himself a clear line and followed it with
                  scrupulous fidelity. He had already learned an invaluable secret, that one-half of
                  the troubles of life may be prevented, and of the troubles that arise one-half may
                  be alleviated, by occupation. He had given to his school an unstinted measure of
                  his time and thought; but whatever time could be wrung from sleep and amusement,
                  compatible with health, he bestowed upon the study of law. But this school was
                  ended. His legal preparation was already far beyond what has been found sufficient
                  to set up many a successful lawyer. But it was not enough for him barely to
                  succeed. After another year spent at Cambridge he hoped to have laid a foundation
                  on which he could build for life. When, therefore, during this summer, he had
                  noticed Heywood's increasing interest in Dr. Wentworth's family, he could not
                  forbear uneasiness. The matter was not helped by Tommy Taft's affectionate
                  solicitude.
               "Look here, Barton, what is your opinion of that southern feller that's come to
                  live at Chandler's?"
               "My opinion, Tommy, is very favorable. He is a perfect gentleman and an honorable
                  man. I think very highly of him."
               "Well, I s'posed so by the way you and he went round together. They say he's goin'
                  to get Chandler's money. I've no objection. Mrs. Chandler's a mighty nice woman;
                  but he,—Lord, Barton, he's nothin' but a needle pullin' a gold thread
                  after it; the needle ain't a mite fatter for all it does. But I guess that
                  southern feller wants a leetle more'n money."
               "I should hope so Tommy. Money is useful in its way; but it takes more than that
                  to make a man."
               "Sartain! But some folks thinks they have the right to the best of every thing,
                  jest because they've got money. Now, for my part I don't believe that southern
                  fuller goes down to Dr. Wentworth to git pills. If he's sick as often as he goes
                  there then it's a sort of ailin' that doctor-stuff ain't likely to cure!"
               Barton knew that Tommy Taft's judgments of affairs were seldom mistaken, and these
                  hints fell in with his own fears. Yet he had no wish to make Tommy a confidant of
                  his hopes and fears. The color came slightly to his cheek, and he was silent.
               "It's my opinion that Miss Rose knows who she likes," added Tommy, sententiously,
                  at the same time nodding his head cornerwise several times at the ground, as if
                  the grass had disputed him.
               "I presume she does," said Barton. "Most rational people do."
               "There was that Boston feller that was here two or three summers I could have told
                  him from the fust that he couldn't catch that bird. Why, you see, I watched 'em
                  pretty close at fust, but after a little while, I let 'em swing. I seed that she
                  looked down, on him; and I'm thinkin' Miss Rose won't choose below her."
               Barton did not care to prolong the conversation with Tommy Taft; but except by an
                  abrupt departure he could not easily stop him. The moment that any one showed an
                  anxiety to avoid any topic, Tommy seized upon it with the avidity of a terrier and
                  raced it and chased it to the uttermost. Tommy resumed:
               "I kinder think it's another thing with this southern feller;" for Tommy would
                  never call him by his proper name. "I've seen 'em a good deal more'n they think,
                  and I've noticed that she sort o' holds back and don't look at him so straight and
                  honest-like as she does to other folks. And she gives him a chance too; and he's
                  there almost every day on one arrant or another. To be sure, it's a great place to
                  go to, and every body is to hum there; but, then," said Tommy, with a knowing wink
                  "there's a difference you know. If she ain't about the best pleased with him of
                  any feller that's come along, then all signs fail, that's all."
               
               And Tommy renewed his bows at the ground in the most solemn and emphatic
                  manner.
               Every word was a confirmation of Barton Cathcart's fears. They irritated him like
                  the spines of nettles.
               "Well Tommy, I presume it's her own business. If she's suited I suppose we ought
                  to be."
               Tommy drew himself up to his full height, and turning his face directly on Barton,
                  without any sting in his tone or banter in his manner, said:
               "Barton, my boy, I've know'd you ever since you was so high. I took to you
                  naturally. I've jest been prouder of you than I ever was of anything on ship or
                  shore; and if I could see you married to Rose, I wouldn't care a wink if I didn't
                  live an hour afterward. 'Tain't no use, boy, for you and me to be covering' up
                  things. I know ye better'n you do yourself. Let me tell ye, you keep too shet up.
                  There's a heap of things in you that you'd do better to git out. What sort of a
                  room is it where the fire hain't any chimney? Now it's my opinion that you are
                  smoked up inside with thoughts and feelins, jes' 'cause you've no vent to let the
                  stuff out. And though Tommy is a one-legged old sinner, the man's not alive that
                  dare say he ever forgot his friend."
               Barton needed no assurance of the old man's fidelity. Although he knew that his
                  unbounded audacity would lead him to thrust in his remarks upon any man's business
                  for the mere pleasure which he seemed to take in the exercise of his shrewdness,
                  yet, in his own ease, Barton knew the real and almost romantic affection which old
                  Tommy bore to him. He was also affected by the fact that the old man, hanging on
                  the skirts of society, poor, and now growing every year more and more feeble, had
                  evidently been watching for his interest, during years of absence, with paternal
                  fidelity. Besides all this, a proud and sensitive nature finds it far easier,
                  often to speak confidingly to one in a station below him than to an equal or a
                  superior.
               Whatever may have been the influences moving him, Barton felt that it would be a
                  great relief to lean on another's judgment.
               "Well, Uncle Tommy, what would you do if you were in my place?"
               "Now that's sensible like, Barton, my boy. I'd go right to that fellow and ask him
                  plump what he's after. If he's just foolin' round for the fun on't, he ought to
                  understand that there's other folks lives in this world as well as him. And if he
                  is in 'arnest, why, then the woman has got to choose between ye, that's all."
               "I'll do it, by heavens!" said Barton with intense earnestness "I've lost too much
                  time a'ready."
               "That's it,—you're right now." Then, with a half relapse into his ordinary teasing
                  manner, Tommy added: "It's surprisin' how we take advice that travels the same way
                  we do! It's like hittin' a ball the same way it's rollin' a'ready."
               The best advice in the world may be ruined in the execution. And the execution of
                  a delicate task depends chiefly on the fine condition of a man's faculties. On
                  some days the mind comes up out of sleep, like the sun in a clear October morning.
                  There is neither cloud nor haze. The thoughts and feelings move in unison and the
                  tongue, touched from within like a magnet, draws to itself fitting words and
                  sentences. It no longer moves like a tugging plough, heavily and slowly, but
                  touches lightly and glances from topic to topic as sunlight from dew drop to dew
                  drop.
               Then come the cloudy days. Ill-assorted thoughts procure for themselves a
                  disagreeable utterance. We spoil whatever we touch. We do nothing lightly, deftly,
                  wisely. The astronomer must defer his observations when clouds are in the sky. In
                  some of the more delicate operations of mechanics the workman will not touch a
                  tool on days when, as he says, "his hand is dead." What lawyer has not lost cases
                  because he came before the court and jury with his head wearied and his whole body
                  jaded by long-continued and exhausting excitements? What doctor has not lost
                  patients by being called, after sleepless nights, with a stupid brain, to a case
                  requiring insight, precision, and instant action? What minister has not spoiled a
                  good subject by a poor sermon because the Sabbath had come round and he must
                  preach, in spite of catarrh and influenza? What fisherman has not lost his trout
                  by an unskilful splash, when he meant delicately to skim the surface with the
                  likeness of a flitting, fluttering fly?
               Enough. Barton slept little after this interview with Tommy Taft. When he awaked,
                  he woke with only half of himself, and that the poorest part. But the impulse of
                  the night before remained.
               Barton left Tommy Taft resolved to see Heywood and to have an understanding with him. He went to Mr.
                  Chandler's house. But already in his walk thither his purpose was somewhat shaken.
                  For, as he reflected how he would break the matter to his friend, he began to see
                  so many difficulties that his purpose wavered. "Shall I ask him what his
                  intentions are toward Miss Wentworth? What if he should reply by asking me on
                  whose authority I inquire? She has a father and mother; have they
                  deputed me to watch over their daughter's welfare? Or he may say, 'Are you an
                  accepted suitor of Miss Rose? If not, on what grounds do you interfere? What
                  business have I at any rate to meddle with Heywood's affair in this matter? There
                  is nothing in my relations to Rose which makes it improper for any other gentleman
                  to solicit her affection. What would Rose think if she knew that I had
                  interrogated Heywood about his affection for her? She would have a just reason for
                  being angry with me. It would be an impertinence. I could never look her in the
                  face afterward if she knew it."
               So reasoning, he would have gone past, without calling, but Heywood saw him, and
                  called out:
               "Barton, come in! Where do you keep yourself lately? Are you hidden in the woods,
                  or have you gone home to live like a hermit? What are you doing nowadays! Since
                  your school was given up I hardly see you any more. By the way, what a splendid
                  fellow the doctor is! But he ought to be a professor in some college, where
                  talking is the proper business. At his house I think there is a little too much of
                  it."
               "I've noticed, though, that he never talks without listeners."
               "That's the mischief of it. We young folks want a good time. But as soon as they
                  hear him speaking, off goes Rose, and off goes every body, and we have to go too.
                  How did you enjoy the other evening?"
               "Not much—I was not in good trim. Are you going to the grand nutting party next
                  week?"
               "Of course I am. Miss Rose has laid injunctions upon all her friends. Let all the
                  squirrels take notice! Not a nut do we mean to leave behind us, and any winter
                  stores which they may desire should be put up immediately!"
               Barton, who had started rather fiercely on his errand, returned with a sense of
                  leaving escaped a great blunder.
               "This comes," said he to himself, "of acting without reflection. My own way is the
                  best, after all. I never talk over my feelings with any one, and act upon his
                  suggestion, without regretting it afterward. I will keep my own counsels, and act
                  upon my own proper judgment, and especially, I do not think I shall go to Tommy
                  Taft again. Fool that I was to let him see—after all he knew it before. A strange
                  old man!—full of experience and of wisdom, of which he makes playthings—never uses
                  them soberly for himself. I cannot hide any thing from him. But I can keep him
                  silent.—Shall I speak with my mother? Why should I? What advice can she give me?
                  She knows my mind already. It will only be another cloud on her shaded path. I
                  always have carried my own troubles in silence, and why not now? If God leavens
                  human thoughts and purposes with an element of his own wisdom all will come
                  right."
               Continuous and intense excitement of feeling works a morbid physical condition of
                  the brain. It becomes at once fertile and poor. It pours out an endless abundance
                  of thought and emotion but without variety or control. The same feeling rises and
                  breaks only to bubble up again, pass through the same course, to be followed a
                  hundred times by the same process. Over and over again a thought traverses a small
                  circle coming back to its starting place, and moving a narrow round, until the
                  mind seems like a clock whose weights pull at the wheels and move the hands round
                  and round the dial, day and night, with perpetual iteration.
               It was in vain that Barton Cathcart sought to control his mind, so long as he
                  remained at home with the leisure of vacation and in the presence of those objects
                  which wrought such disturbance to his thoughts.
               His father had long wished Barton to visit several of the remote western States
                  where he had invested some money in land to examine the various tracts ascertain
                  their quality, position and prospects arrange for the proper settlement of taxes,
                  and, in one or two instances redeem some small parcels which had through the
                  neglect of agents, been sold for taxes.
               All day long after seeing Heywood he had turned his affairs over and over in his
                  mind, till he was weary of them, of himself, and of life. But all night he
                  repeated the process whether dreaming or waking. As the next day dawned, Barton
                     awoke from a short sleep by hearing
                  some one say, "Go West." At any rate, he thought he heard the sentence, though on
                  springing up no one was present. But the impression was strong that he had heard a
                  real voice. The project stood out before him with attractive features. It would
                  break up his nervous irritation, give him an opportunity of seeing something of
                  his native land, and satisfy that love of novelty and adventure which every young
                  man of mettle is apt to have.
               Before he had fairly dressed himself, Barton had settled the matter. When his
                  father came in to breakfast, Barton said with some suddenness:
               "Father, I am going out west, and if you will make out my instructions, I will
                  attend to your business."
               Before sundown every thing was prepared, and early on the next day Barton was on
                  his way to the far west.
               Meanwhile, the arrangements had been made for a grand nutting expedition on the
                  week succeeding Barton's departure. The suddenness of his start took every one by
                  surprise. Why did he go before the picnic? Why did he not at least
                  say good-bye. What had happened, or was about to happen, that he should disappear
                  so mysteriously?
               But, like all other minor matters in life, it was a day's wonder, and then sank
                  and was forgotten, especially when the Sabbath was passed and Tuesday was set for
                  the excursion. The region selected for the expedition lay a mile or two beyond
                  'Biah Cathcart's, where long strips of chestnut woods covered a line of low hills,
                  or skirted down their sides. Near the centre of this range of hills, but half a
                  mile back, was a ravine, one of the most romantic and picturesque places in the
                  region, and not the less attractive to many because its pools of clear, cool water
                  were filled with trout. Not far from the opening of this ravine the dinner was to
                  be eaten; and all the basket and packages pertaining thereto were put under charge
                  of Hiram Beers, who also had a general oversight of all the "critters," as Deacon
                  Marble styled the horses. This annual nutting day was in no respect
                  ecclesiastical. It was not marked down in the calendar. No sin was imputed for the
                  neglect of it. Yet, with occasional exceptions, it had for many years been a kind
                  of parish reunion. The minister, the deacons the trustees, the staid and dignified
                  old members were expected to turn out to renew their youth and gallantries; and
                  even more than on Thanksgiving Day certain antics and frivolities were permitted
                  among church members which on any other occasion, would have savored of a levity
                  that Aunt Polly Marble would have witnessed with severe disapprobation.
               Early on that morning there began to wend along the road families of young and
                  old, parties of young men and maidens, a few on horseback, many in wagons which
                  were built for harvest, but by a little "slicking up" served to carry parties to
                  fishing excursions to hustings, and to nutting parties. Farmer Cathcart was
                  already waiting—his handsome team hitched at the post, his wife Rachel cutting in
                  the last little delicacies for the dinner. One after another of his old friends
                  passed by, cheerily saluting him—some with a hearty good-morning, some with an
                  exhortation to make haste and one or two with specimens of homely wit, the more
                  relishful because well seasoned and often used.
               Hiram Beers, of course, shone glorious with a span of Black-Hawk Morgan horses,
                  for which "a New York gentleman said that if he had them in the city he could get
                  a thousand dollars!" Of course this thousand-dollar team was worthily employed in
                  bringing Dr. Wentworth's family,—a portion of them at any rate he doctor and his
                  wife Rose and Agate Bissell, while the residue followed in another vehicle, drawn
                  by the doctor's own horses, under the direction of Pete Sawmill, who on such
                  occasions felt his own superiority over all the rest of mankind.
               Dr. Buell rode in his favorite chaise, carrying with him a neighboring minister
                  who had preached for him on Sunday, and with whom he had sat up half of Sunday
                  night discussing certain recondite points of theology on which said brother had
                  shown a dangerous laxity of opinion.
               Behind him came Deacon Trowbridge, to whom a good conscience and a good digestion,
                  well exercised, had given such admirable proportions that all men wondered how he
                  and his wife, who was not a whit less blessed than her husband, could sit in one
                  seat, or how one ordinary horse could draw them!
               Hiram kept up a running fire as they severally arrived.
               "Good mornin', Doctor Buell! drive in here—that's a good hitchin' spot. Don't stop
                  now. I'll take the darlin' out of the hills, and see that he's fastened all right.
                  You'd better go on and keep the deacons
                  in order. There's no tellin', when a horse or a deacon gits loose in a big
                  pasture, what he'll do. I've known old horses break their necks tryin' to race and
                  jump as the young colts do."
               Next came up Deacon Trowbridge.
               "Bless me, Deacon!—Good morning, marm!—if I'm not glad to see you! We've been
                  waitin' for some slim fellow like you to climb the trees and shake off the
                  chestnuts. The boys all look to you, Deacon, for an example!"
               The good-natured and fat deacon smiled, and even essayed a faint joke:
               "Yes, Hiram, you'll see the nuts fly, if I only get up into them tree-tops!"
               "Yes, yes; I'll bet on you and the squirrels!" said Hiram, who could spare but a
                  word or two on each party, and already had turned to a new coiner, leaving Deacon
                  Trowbridge standing with an answer in his mouth, in a waiting posture, as if he
                  could not afford to lose a good thing.
               And we think so too, and will present it for him. The deacon was waiting to
                  say:
               "If I get on a squirrel, Hiram, he'll not be worth much!"
               There is an unending charm that goes with the supple gayeties of the young. But
                  another interest, scarcely less, though of a different kind, attends the
                  occasional outbreak of youthful frolics among the old. Here were the yellow woods
                  full of happy people; and, among them, many old men and women of stern morals and
                  severe manner of life,—most of them stiffened with hard labor, and not more than
                  once or twice in a year seeking pleasure or recreation for their own sakes. Many,
                  many years it is since they sprang into the trees as do those nimble youngsters
                  who are making the chestnuts rattle from the topmost boughs. But they remember
                  their youthful feats, and boast them, and banter each other. Hiram seemed
                  determined to have some of the old gentlemen up in the trees:
               "I tell ye, Deacon Trowbridge, I think you're as smart yet as Deacon Marble is,
                  though he takes on sech a nimble sort of steppin' 'round. It's my opinion that, at
                  a fair climb, You'd beat him."
               "Oh, Hiram I'm too heavy—though I'm pretty spry yet. You see, brother Marble
                  hasn't got so much to carry up with him!"
               No, nor so much strength to do it with."
               "I'll tell ye what," said Deacon Marble, quite in the spirit of a boy "I'll stump
                  you, Trowbridge, to try it. I'll give you that big tree with low branches, and
                  I'll take that slim one—and beat you."
               They soon pulled off their coats and assailed their respective trees. Good Deacon
                  Trowbridge, when his phlegmatic nature was thoroughly aroused, was a man of great
                  strength. He took a hug at the tree such as a bear might have given; and, at
                  first, it seemed as if he were going to succeed. But each hoist grew slower and
                  though cheered by Hiram, it was doubtful if he could reach the limb just above his
                  head. If each jerk upward had carried his body up as fast as it did the leg of his
                  pantaloons, he would soon have mounted the coveted branch. At length he got hold
                  of it but no more could he do. It was too high for him to let go and jump, and as
                  to getting any higher, it was out of the question. The poor man seemed in a woful
                  plight; but Hiram, equal to every emergency, had procured a rail, and, planting it
                  under his foot, eased him down safely to the ground. Meanwhile, Deacon Marble,
                  slim and nervous had gone up his way like a squirrel. Already he was seeking out
                  the topmost boughs, and rattling down the chestnuts in a perfect shower.
               The shouts of merriment soon drew many to this rather unusual scene and among
                  others, the deacons' wives. Mrs. Trowbridge gave way to unrestrained laughter. She
                  was a natural laughter. She laughed with her mouth, her eyes, her whole face, with
                  her voice and all her body. It was no silvery trickle but a generous tide that set
                  in strongly, filled every indentation along the shore, and plashed up in spray all
                  the more, if any obstacle sought to stay it.
               "Well, Trowbridge,"—and then, like a child with the hooping-cough she gave way to
                  a paroxysm of laughter,—"I should as soon"—and again she was swept away from her
                  remark, like one carried out from shore by a refluent wave,—"I should as soon
                  expect"—the words were drowned in laugh—"to see" * * "to see * * "a but—" at which
                  she fairly seemed to dissolve, and could no longer hold herself up, "—a butter-tub
                  climb a tree!"
               
               Far other were the emotions which filled the soul of Polly Marble when she beheld
                  the scene. A fire blazed behind her spectacles. Though she was infirm in limb, the
                  weakness had in no respect reached her head, every member of which was active. At
                  first she seemed unable to utter her amazement. At length she gained relief:
               "Deacon Marble, you'd better come down! An old man like you a courtin' death in
                  the top of them trees ought to be ashamed of himself! It ain't decent."
               Then turning to those around her, she expressed herself thus:
               "Wal, Hiram, I dew hope you're satisfied at last. You're always huntin' after
                  mischief, and now you've got it. To think of't! One deacon a puffin' and red on
                  the ground, and the other tip in the tree-top! No, it's no laughin' matter! It's a
                  sin and a shame and I'm surprised that any body should laugh at such levity and
                  folly," giving poor Mrs. Trowbridge a look of reproof that ought to have sobered
                  her, but which in fact served to renew her agony of laughing, for she palpitated
                  and held on to her sides and gasped: "Oh, I shall die—with—laughing—dew stop!"
               Turning to her husband, Mrs. Marble began expostulating with him.
               "Deacon Marble, if you have any respect for me or for yourself—and I don't think
                  you have a speck—you'll come down! Everybody's laughin' at you. You're a sight to
                  behold. It's a wicked thing, and agin' natur', for an old man like you to think
                  he's a boy, and caper about in the trees. If the Lord had meant you to be a
                  squirrel he'd a made you so!"
               "Don't, Polly, don't. I'm comin' down. Just look here, I wan't to tell you
                  something!"
               Incautious Polly! Will you never learn the deceitfulness of that husband of yours?
                  She ventures under the tree to hear what he has to say, just as he gives a rousing
                  shake to the branch on which he was lying. Down came the chestnuts, and down came
                  the chestnut-burrs! They rattled on her bonnet, they pattered on her shoulders,
                  and one burr—a frivolous burr, given to levity,—struck her new spectacles and
                  knocked them quite out of symmetry.
               The nimble deacon was soon on the ground, and would fain have left the impression
                  on his spouse that it was merely the act of getting off the limb to come down that
                  brought upon her the chestnuts. Hiram was in ecstasy.
               "Isn't the deacon cute? Oh, what a politician he'd a made, if he'd only kept out
                  of the church and away from religion!"
               Other parties along the hills, widely separated, were busy with pranks and mirth.
                  The young people climbed, the old and the very young picked up the brown nuts. The
                  scene was charming. Dr. Wentworth and his family were as busy as any. It was
                  Pete's office to shake the trees. The whole force of his peculiar genius now had
                  full play. His skill in climbing was something worth looking at. His
                  venturesomeness was equal to his skill and strength. It was no great feat to him
                  when trees interlocked to swing from one to another,—to drop from a higher branch
                  to a lower, never missing his hold. He cleared a tree of nuts in an incredibly
                  short time, and the doctor's brown bags replenished from Pete's labors, began to
                  stand out with fatness.
               Heywood had made, himself agreeable to the various parties. His aunt had joined
                  the Wentworths, and Rose seemed not displeased with the attentions which he paid
                  her. In truth, there was something in Heywood's manner peculiarly winning. He was
                  strong, frank, manly; but in every thing an innate refinement manifested itself,
                  and that unconscious self-possession and quietness which come from long
                  familiarity with good society. Rose had seldom, if ever, met with one whose
                  manners approached so near to a fine art while his spirit was as artless,
                  apparently, as a child's. That the charm had produced no effect I cannot honestly
                  affirm. That it was more than an impression upon her imagination I do not believe.
                  This certainly is much, and in perhaps a majority of cases it is final and
                  effectual. But while Rose was pleased with Heywood and found his presence more and
                  more agreeable, she began to look more closely at her own feelings, at her
                  relations and his to other people.
               During the whole summer Rose had perceived a declension of attention in Barton
                  Cathcart towards her and nearly in the proportion in which Heywood had grown more
                  attentive. It seemed is if one was quietly withdrawing and giving place to the
                  other.
               There are many things which we do not value if only we can have them, but which we
                  painfully miss if they are withheld. Every one has noticed how little effect
                  praise produces on him, and yet how
                  distinctly he feels the brick of it when it is not given. While Barton seemed at
                  home with her, and the long acquaintanceship and childhood associations clustered
                  about their familiar intercourse, Rose did not fairly estimate the value at which
                  she held Barton. But when he seemed to fall off, when in his stead another, of a
                  wholly different and contrasted nature, came in his place, Rose was conscious, not
                  of positive pain, or even regret, but of uneasiness and of a questioning within
                  herself.
               Heywood she believed to be true and right-minded. She thought that his nature was
                  transparent. He was one who could never appear in any society without drawing to
                  him all eyes, and could never be known without drawing to him as well the
                  confidence of all. And yet there was no sense of reserved power with him. His
                  whole nature lay apparent. There were no depths out of which might rise unexpected
                  disclosures. He was fine-natured, handsome, accomplished, brilliant in society,
                  and true-hearted. These qualities could not fail to touch any one's fancy. But in
                  all their intercourse he had never introduced any subject deeper than is sounded
                  by common experience. While both of these friends were near her, each yielding the
                  fruit of his own nature, the contrast was not so much displayed. Rose had felt a
                  vague uneasiness through the summer, that Barton, though seeming the same in
                  manner as ever, had less and less frequented her father's house. During his
                  vacation he had but once visited them; and now, suddenly, without any
                  leave-taking, he had gone away, to be absent for months. Rose was surprised and
                  piqued by this seeming want of care for her, who had been his friend from
                  childhood. It did not seem as if there could ever be a pause in their friendship
                  any more than between herself and her father or mother. She could scarcely mark
                  the decrees through which in some measure she and Barton had let go of each other;
                  but it was clear to her that they were receding. With distance came perspective.
                  More than ever now she valued that depth of nature in Barton, out of which endless
                  mysteries came. She could never divine from the themes of to-day what would be the
                  range of thought on which his mind would travel when next they met. There was a
                  strong aspiration in him, an indefinable yearning, which wrought in him on the one
                  side self-distrust and humility, and on the other exceeding boldness and changeful
                  activity. Her father was fruitful of thought, but restful. Barton was restless—a
                  voyager along new seas and strange continents. Now that he was parted from her—so
                  abruptly that it seemed as if he was broken off—she became conscious of the force
                  and depth of his character. If there was an uncertain unrestfulness in it, it was
                  perhaps but the fermentation which when completed, would sink the lees to the
                  bottom and leave the generous wine clear and strong.
               It ought not to be thought that these analyses were made by Rose. They are but the
                  philosophical deduction and solution of certain impressions and convictions in her
                  mind. And it was necessary to draw them out with some distinctness, in order to
                  account for her present course. For, by one of those fortunate accidents which
                  seem to attend picnics in the woods, Heywood and Rose had wandered off from the
                  family. Either chestnuts lay thicker toward a little brook which gurgled and
                  twined through a dell, and was proud of the yellow leaves which it whirled in
                  mimic rafts down its pretty cascades or collected in some eddying pool, or else
                  they were attracted by the mossy beauty of a beech-tree whose roots had been
                  partially undermined, but whose undiminished green yet braved the frosts. There
                  sat Rose and Heywood in his very soul believed that so lovely a creature there was
                  not in all the world besides. Could he bear her in triumph home to his friends he
                  could ask no other surety of happiness for life and no other pledge of his victory
                  over Virginia prejudice!
               Why did Rose suffer these illusions which in her secret soul she knew could not be
                  realized? Tell me, ye who have suffered the enchantment of the midsummer night's
                  dreams and fancies! Tell me, ye who remember how the charmed imagination hushes
                  every caution, sees all events in heightened colors, and bears one as in a
                  delicious dream over paths and through experiences which, though distinct, seem
                  unreal, magical, enchanting!
               Have you never seen a child's bubble blown till its glowing sides are pictured in
                  exquisite tints and then thrown off into the air rising or settling down with
                  motion so gentle that it seems more like a thought than a thing? Untouched, it
                  holds on, a brilliant globe, on whose sides earthly objects, purified and refined,
                  are reflected, as if they were heavenly pictures—revelations of scenes
                  unapproachable. But once seek to possess it lay but your lightest finger upon it, and the arch and orb collapse, and
                  the brilliant picture disappears!
               The horn sounded for the dinner. Calls were heard for one and another, and for
                  Rose. Soon she was seen slowly coming up the dell. Her eyes showed that she had
                  been weeping. Heywood was with her as one who is absent. Something between sadness
                  and sternness was in his face. I know not what had passed; nor how Rose excused
                  herself for permitting what she had always before forestalled and prevented.
                  Perhaps she did not excuse herself. Perhaps her sense of regret at Barton's
                  neglect and unceremonious leaving had carried her farther than she knew and she
                  awoke with a strong rebound into her full former self. I only know that she seemed
                  more pained and regretful than she had ever been seen before. But even greater
                  pangs were just before her.
               The stream near whose border Rose had been sitting came down, not far above them,
                  from a ravine of singular beauty. At the point where the water fairly escaped from
                  its entanglement, the rocks came so near together as to form a kind of door, not
                  more than twenty feet wide, but its sides were steep, and rose to a considerable
                  height, and then sloping off backward, were covered with shrubs and finally with
                  trees. Once within that door a charming space opened, between one and two hundred
                  feet in diameter, and shut in by walls to a great height. At the farther side as
                  you entered the stream, descending in a fall about thirty feet in height, fell
                  into a deep pool. It then stole away close by the rocks, leaving a level space on
                  the other side large enough for a party of several hundred. Before it made its
                  plunge, the waters far up might be seen rushing down an incline on the shelving
                  rocks at an angle of forty-five degrees. On either side of this chamber the rocks
                  were stratified, and shrubs and plants grew in their seams. The more adventurous
                  among the young men, by dextrous use of their toes in these rifts, and by grasping
                  firmly the roots or stems with their hands, climbed up the steep face of the
                  rocks, and ascending above the cascade, followed up the ravine to new falls and
                  romantic passages. Already a dozen, against the protestation of the ladies, had
                  scattered themselves along the precipitous cliffs. Heywood, who sat buried in
                  thought, seemed suddenly to awake, and began climbing the dangerous way. No one
                  could be more adroit; yet even he could not afford to go along that perilous way
                  with wandering thoughts. Suddenly there arose a wild outcry. Those below looked up
                  to see the splash of water along the inclined way above the fall, and quicker than
                  thought, shot out over the fall, Heywood was seen descending toward the pool
                  beneath! Within it lay many rocks broken off by frosts and hidden by the water,
                  and no more dangerous place for a plunge could well found.
               Into the boiling pool he dropped and disappeared. In a moment—it seemed to Rose an
                  age—a dark form emerged along the edge of the pool. Instantly, on the alarm there
                  was a rush from every direction. But Pete, who was half way up the cliff, seemed
                  fairly to glide down the side of the rock so nimbly did he descend; and first of
                  all he was by Heywood's side and lifted him from the water, and laid him upon the
                  mossy meadow just beyond.
               Dr. Wentworth was sent for, and soon arrived. Heywood lay like one dead. The wet
                  hair fell back from his white temples. Rose chafed his hands and gazed upon him
                  with an expression of indescribable anguish. With a faint cry, as Pete laid
                  Heywood upon the moss Alice Cathcart fell into her father's arms fainting. But
                  already Heywood began to revive. He had been stunned by the fall. Arrangements
                  were speedily made to convey him to 'Biah Cathcart's, the nearest point at which
                  he could receive needed attention, and where Dr. Wentworth could make a more
                  critical examination of his hurts.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXVIII.
               CONVALESCENCE.
               HEYWOOD revived a little. But he was unable to stand, and it was necessary to
                  carry him out of the gorge. It was not difficult to convey him to the opening. But
                  here he was stopped. The only mode of entrance or exit was by a narrow ledge, some
                  six feet above the brook, and this path was so difficult that each one was obliged
                  to sustain himself by holding fast to the limbs of a spruce tree which, growing
                  out of a rift in the rocks above, reached down its branches and afforded a safe
                  hold. At the very turning point of the rock it was necessary to slip around a
                  jutting corner in order to get securely upon the path on the other side. This
                  feat, to one of moderately firm head, was not difficult or perilous. It was often
                  accomplished, and had been, as we have seen, to-day, by ladies, and was a bit of
                  bravery which enhanced the pleasure of an excursion to the glen. But a path which
                  could be easily traced by a single person would be far more difficult when a party
                  should attempt it bearing a helpless man in their arms. Various devices were
                  suggested, but all seemed impracticable and the counsellors were at a loss what
                  steps to take. It was suggested that they should send down to Cathcart's for
                  ropes, and fastening them to trees above, swing Heywood around the point; or draw
                  him up the face of the rocks to the slope above, and convey him thence down an old
                  charcoal-burners' road.
               An exclamation of fear and wonder called all eyes to Pete's doings. He seemed to
                  have taken in all the difficulties at a glance, and to have seen the easiest
                  solution of them, provided one had strength enough, a good eye and sure foot.
                  Without saying a word or asking permission, Pete took up Heywood, as if he were no
                  heavier than Rose used to be when he strode all over the country with her, and
                  laid him diagonally across his breast, so that his own long left arm passed under
                  Heywood's right arm, over his loins, with a firm clasp, such as only great
                  strength and length of limbs could have effected. But Heywood groaned with pain,
                  and Pete relinquished this hold. After a moment's pause, Pete lifted Heywood
                  again, and laying him back to back, so that his own head would come at Heywood's
                  neck, he held him fast with his right arm upon his shoulder, leaving his left hand
                  free for other purposes. Then, with short steps, he descended into the brook which
                  made its way out of the gorge through rocks lying in every position sinking now
                  into deep pools then sliding over wide and slippery stones with a shallow sheet,
                  and playing every other feat which an untamed mountain stream is wont to do. With
                  a practiced eye Pete selected each point for his feet; with a sure foot he planted
                  himself firmly on each selected spot—now wading, now with the help of a branch
                  turning sharp angles never baffled or for a moment perplexed, until, before those
                  who took the regular path could get round below to the point where the stream
                  issued from its rough rocky bed, Pete had come out triumphantly, and was walking
                  rapidly through the woods to 'Biah Cathcart's wagon, in which Heywood was speedily
                  conveyed to Cathcart's house.
               It was with clouded face and more suffering than she had ever experienced that
                  Rose followed with her father in the steps of the injured man. Alice, in full
                  sympathy with Rose, seemed even more affected, but in a different way. They
                  appeared to have changed natures—Rose was sunk in thought; Alice was demonstrative
                  in her feeling. But neither of them spoke.
               As soon as they arrived, Heywood was conveyed to the blue room opening out of the
                  sitting-room. Upon an examination it was found that two ribs had been fractured
                  and he had received a blow upon the head,—whether severe or not, could not be
                  determined except by after-symptoms. It was judged wise not to attempt to remove
                  him to Mr. Chandler's and for several weeks he was the guest of the Cathcarts.
               The centre of authority in a household is permanent, but the centre of interest
                  fluctuates almost from day to day: now, it is a little child around which all
                  revolve; a long-absent friend, or a child returned from school, for a day or two
                  holds all other interests subordinate. But nothing transforms the house so
                  instantly, and reaches out with such force to change the whole economy, as a
                  sick-room. It is the heart of the house and the pulse of the mansion beats
                  according to its expansion or contraction. The patient it may be, can neither
                  speak nor see, yet any member of the
                  family, rising up or sitting down, going out or coming in, is conscious that he is
                  affected by the relations of his action to the coin. fort of the sufferer. And so
                  sickness is a silent legislator, and lays its law upon the domestic
                  commonwealth.
               If Heywood had sought out a place in which to be sick, he could not have selected
                  more skilfully. The social atmosphere of the place was cheering and soothing. The
                  order and quietness of the household, that inexplicable something which makes some
                  houses frigid and repulsive, and others genial and attractive,—let something made
                  up in part by the dispositions and ways of the inmates, and in part too by the
                  proportions and style of the rooms and passages, the colors and details of
                  form—all contributed important elements.
               The blue room was wainscotted for about four feet from the floor. The residue of
                  the sides was papered with pale pearly blue. The ceiling had a faint tint of the
                  same color.
               In this room stood an old-fashioned secretary of solid mahogany; on
                  another side the book shelves; and all the chairs were old-fashioned heavy and of
                  mahogany. The windows too, were old-fashioned, with small six-by-eight panes of
                  glass, with inside folding shutters. From the bed one could look out into the
                  sitting-room, through the open door, and through a window on its far side, the
                  yard and its shrubbery could be seen, the western horizon, and the setting sun
                  which when the curtains were removed, shot its last rays clear through the
                  sitting-room across the door of the blue room, where, from the opposite horizon,
                  through its own windows, every morning the sunlight fell.
               For a day or two Heywood seemed stupefied; then a slight fever arose; he was
                  restless and wandering in mind. He seemed oblivious of the recent scenes, and made
                  no allusion to persons or things in the North. Starting from a moment's sleep, he
                  would call his mother; and when Rachel Cathcart, who was seldom beyond earshot,
                  came to his side, a perplexed smile would come over his face, as if he was
                  conscious that he had made some mistake, but was unable to discern what the
                  mistake was.
               During this time his aunt, Mrs. Chandler, remained continually with him, dividing
                  the care with Rachel Cathcart.
               One morning, while Mrs. Chandler went home for an hour or two, Alice sat in
                  Heywood's room. The window stood open. The autumnal sun and autumnal air gave a
                  peculiar charm to the day.
               Nature seemed as one who has been at a banquet. The hills glowed with brilliant
                  colors. The near trees were like jovial maskers in a holiday. Many of the trees on
                  which Alice's eye rested had been planted by her brother Barton, who, instructed
                  by Dr. Wentworth's better knowledge, had selected them with reference to spring
                  and autumn tints as well as to their forms and relative harmonies. A clump of
                  Norway spruces was fringed on one side with scarlet sumachs, a fine mountain ash
                  relieved its clusters of berries against the dark green, and on one of the
                  evergreens an ampelopsis had climbed, and peeped out in crimson here and there up
                  to the top, where it had completely covered the tips. There was something freakish
                  in the gay and familiar way in which this brilliant vine took liberties with a
                  sober tree reminding one of the caprices which a pet child sometimes takes with a
                  solemn old grandfather—climbing his shoulders, disarranging his hair, pulling at
                  his sacred spectacles! Alice, like many another not given to talking, made up in
                  musings and reveries. She was this morning full of nameless feelings, changing
                  from light to dark almost as fast as the colors changed when her eye moved over
                  the external prospect. Yet Heywood's very breath was audible to her ear nor could
                  he draw a long breath nor move a hand without her notice. Thus the woman heart
                  pulsed between affectionate duty and fanciful beauty. Now she listened to murmurs
                  of the bees then to the pretentious buzzing of the flies, that seemed inspired
                  to-day with more than usual affection. They insisted on familiarity. They refused
                  to take offence at the utmost rudeness. Then she watched the spiders' webs which
                  had been spread and hung in every direction, saying in herself—"How many hopes are
                  like the spider's web, woven in the night; bright in the morning dew, perishing
                  before the first footfall! A cat, a pure Maltese, sat on the path making her
                  toilet. She licked her paws, and then with them sponged her face rubbing down her
                  ears with the greatest care; and then she began licking her breast, bending her
                  pliant neck as if intent upon reaching under her very chin. Alice smiled. She had
                  seen other people who thought that their nature was changed because they had
                  licked their breasts smooth. She turned to the bed! It was only a long breath—a
                  sigh in his sleep!
               
               A woodpecker with little sharp claws that could hold its snug little body in any
                  position, head up, head down, head sideways, ran nimbly round the tree, keenly
                  inspecting each crevice, and probing here and there with its bill. The tree was
                  miserably healthy, and this critic flew away with a harsh, grating note of
                  disgust.
               Surely he moved! No. His eyes are closed. He sleeps. Will he ever wake to
                  consciousness and reason?
               A crooning of hens and flutter of chickens drew her attention. A hawk was flying
                  past, far above in the sky. What?—danger close up to the heaven? Is the deep pure
                  air infested, as well as swamps, and coverts, and dens? If one creeps, there are
                  creeping enemies. If one flies there are winged pursuers!
               Some one called her:
               "Alice!"
               She started and went to Heywood. It was his first lucid morning.
               "Where am I? What has happened?"
               Alice in her joy could hardly answer his questions. Her face was radiant; but with
                  strong restraint upon her feelings, she quieted herself, as if afraid that talking
                  might harm him. She told him simply that he had met with an accident; that he had
                  been for more than a week here in her father's house; that Dr. Wentworth came
                  every day to see him, and would soon be here, and then, if he thought
                  best, she would talk with him more.
               The name of Dr. Wentworth seemed to catch his ear, and, as a clue, helped him to
                  regain some faint hope of memory in the past.
               "Wentworth? Ah—I remember. Were we not in the woods? Let us see. Did not something
                  happen to Miss Rose? Was she hurt?"
               Then an expression of sadness fell upon Heywood's face, and he half turned away
                  from Alice, saying:
               "No, no, no;—I remember."
               The expression of joy and exhilaration which had lit up Alice's face passed away.
                  She turned to the door to summon her mother. Dr. Wentworth was already with his
                  hand upon the latch.
               "Ah, Alice, how is our patient? Worse? Your face carries bad tidings."
               "No, Doctor, good tidings. He is in his mind again."
               "Well then, my dear, you could afford a gladder look for a friend's improvement.
                  But I must see for myself."
               Heywood improved every day after this, though at first slowly. His constitution
                  had never been shaken by indulgent habits, and now he reaped the benefit of a
                  virtuous and temperate life. The blow upon his head gave most concern to Dr.
                  Wentworth, and a depression of spirits which hung upon him seemed to the Doctor a
                  not favorable sign. Still, as his symptoms steadily ameliorated, and his strength
                  began to return he was allowed to hear reading a little at a time. His aunt most
                  frequently took the place of reader. But for some reason her manner of reading
                  rendered Heywood nervous. On the other hand, Alice's voice and manner had a
                  soothing and refreshing influence. Little by little this task fell almost
                  exclusively to her. Her good nature and her kindness never wearied. Whatever she
                  was doing, or however weary, the least hint by word or look was sufficient. Every
                  day she culled from papers and from magazines such passages as she thought likely
                  to please him and was never better pleased herself than when Heywood's interest in
                  her reading led him to remarks and conversation. After he had begun to sit up a
                  portion of the day, the details of the accident by which he had been injured were
                  told to him. But he recalled nothing distinctly. He remembered the nutting, and he
                  had a faint impression of the glen into which the party had entered. But there was
                  an indistinct impression on his mind that somehow Rose had been connected with his
                  fall and injury. This subject seemed painful to Alice.
               "Alice, were you there when I fell?"
               "Yes. I saw it all. It was fearful beyond any experience of my life."
               "I was climbing?"
               "Yes—you had risen higher than the falls."
               "And was Rose climbing?"
               "No."
               "How came she to fall then?"
               "She did not."
               "How did I fall then?"
               "You slipped."
               "And she held fast?"
               "She had nothing to do with you."
               
               "I am sure she had," said he looking doubtingly at Alice.
               But as the subject seemed unwelcome to the gentle Alice, after once or twice
                  renewing his questions, he dropped the subject. As strength returned, so Heywood
                  sought to relieve his kind friends of the tasks of nursing, or at least to lighten
                  them. His thoughts naturally reverted to his Virginia home; and as he found Alice
                  interested in his reminiscences, he was quite willing to solace himself by
                  describing the scenes of his childhood, his father's plantation, mansion, and
                  household. A listener more sympathetic than Alice one could not desire. She
                  delighted to sit upon her low sewing-chair near the window. Thus the light was
                  thrown upon Heywood's face, while her own was in shadow. Many of the happiest
                  hours of her life were passed thus, and Alice began to dread the day when her
                  gentle services should be no more needed.
               October was ended. Its golden scroll was rolled up and put away. November had
                  come, and its nightly frosts, its cold rains, its vigorous winds, had stripped the
                  trees, and the forests were bare. Orchards yet maintained a show of damaged
                  leaves. The white oak and the beach refused to part with all their foliage, and
                  tufts of russet leaves clung to the ends of the branches, not in bravery and
                  beauty, but as mourning weeds worn by trees disconsolate for the loss of summer.
                  It was with surprise, when Heywood first went to his window, that he saw the
                  change. A month had transformed the fields and bills. He had left them glowing
                  with gorgeous colors. Now they were sad and sombre. Nor did he fail to draw an
                  analogy between his own hopes then and his prospects now.
               But great as had been the physical changes during his sickness and recovery, yet
                  more wonderful changes had taken place in society than in nature. The great
                  political contest had closed in the election to the Presidency of the United
                  States of Abraham Lincoln (a name then but little known, but since spoken in every
                  corner of Christendom) and added to the roll of those upon whom Time has no power.
                  Of all the strikes and struggles Heywood knew nothing. And, as 'Biah Cathcart,
                  little by little, detailed the narrative of events, and recounted the early steps
                  that were then taking place in that great and terrible tragedy of civil conflict,
                  Heywood, free from those influences which were swaying so many of his friends in
                  Virginia entered warmly into Cathcart's feelings for the integrity of the
                  nation.
               Heywood could not conceal from himself with what regrets he left this hospitable
                  farm-house of 'Biah Cathcart's to return to his aunt's. He had already staid a
                  fortnight after Dr. Wentworth gave him permission to remove. There was a charm in
                  its quiet which stilted both his feelings and his physical condition. The family,
                  too, grew upon his respect and affection. He found in 'Biah Cathcart, though
                  simple and unpretentious, a degree of knowledge which would have been remarkable
                  in a professional man and which he would never have thought of looking for in a
                  plain farmer. His wife, Rachel Cathcart, seemed like a second mother. With
                  scarcely an element of character like his own mother she yet produced upon Heywood
                  the same effects that he remembered at home. Alice, too, on nearer acquaintance,
                  and after her timidity was broken through, disclosed a wealth of character which
                  he had not suspected.
               It was not, however, till he had returned to Norwood that he became alive to the
                  excitement which prevailed in the nation. The letters from his home gave evidence
                  of the intensity of Southern feeling.
               A few extracts from his letters, written or received, will serve to show the
                  influences acting upon him.
               * * * "Father says that separation will come and he does not care how soon. If
                  South Carolina goes out, and a convention is already called to frame an ordinance
                  of secession,—he says that every Southern State will follow—will have
                  to follow. He is quite enthusiastic, about the Great Republic of the South; and he
                  is doing all that he can to spread his sentiments among the gentlemen who visit
                  us. He derides the idea of war! 'I can carry in this cup,' said he this morning at
                  the breakfast table, 'all the blood that will be shed.' If the South are united
                  the North will never choose to resist. And if the do, he argues there will never
                  be more than a single fight. The Northern people, he says, handle tools too well
                  to meddle with the sword. You know that he has great contempt for Northern
                  laborers. They are a sordid set, fit for drudgery, but not for fighting.
               "He is vexed that you do not write. It is two months since we have heard a word
                  from you. From some hints in your last
                  letter, he suspects that you are entangled with some fair Yankee damsel; and
                  sister says she knows who it is. Father frets and fumes. 'Every man that loves the
                  South should be at his post. Tom has no business, when Virginia is getting ready
                  to lead the new Republic, to be dallying in the North. He ought to show his colors
                  and stand up for his principles.' And so, you see, Tom, just what is going on

                           * * * "I do not wonder that my silence attracts attention. For, though
                              I am not a very diligent correspondent at any time, yet I seldom allow
                              ten weeks to pass without a letter. But you may now know,—I did not
                              care that you should before,—that I have been confined to my room for
                              some six weeks, on account of injuries received by a fall. I was
                              climbing rocks, and fell more than thirty feet, breaking two ribs and
                              receiving a severe blow upon my head. I have had much to sober me;
                              much to give to life a more serious tone. If now the country shall
                              rush into war, as I fear it will be the climax of my trouble, and I
                              shall almost wish that the blow on my head had been some degrees
                              harder. I cannot sympathize with my father. I am in a better situation
                              to know these Northern people than he or any of our Southern friends
                              can be. You may depend upon it that separation will not be peacefully
                              allowed. There is an under spirit among this people that politicians
                              don't take into account. The Southern opinion of their courage is
                              founded upon a difference in the education, principles and spirit of
                              the North and South, which makes it well nigh impossible for you to
                              appreciate the reason of their seeming reluctance to fight. But should
                              they once be aroused by circumstances which appealed to patriotism and
                              duty, you may depend upon it that they will show not only courage, but
                              an indomitable perseverance which will wear out opposition. And should
                              the question be Union or Disunion—two nations or one United States—I
                              am free to say that my heart goes with the old flag, and though I hope
                              to be spared the dreadful necessity of lifting my hand against my own
                              State, yet I should deem that, terrible as it would be, an evil less
                              to be dreaded than to lift my hand against that flag of our fathers
                              which gathers to its folds the dearest memories and the most honored
                              associations of American history."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               During the whole winter Heywood sought to shield himself from the turbulence of
                  public feeling, which increased with every month. His health, though rapidly
                  improving, was yet delicate, and rendered him specially liable to excitements. He
                  fondly hoped that by some fortunate arrangement the great parties to the conflict
                  might harmonize their differences, and secure that day of peace which for thirty
                  years public men had hoped for and sought in vain.
               It did not occur to him that the differences were radical, that should they be
                  really brought into conflict one must destroy the other and that they
                     were being brought into conflict by a course of events which moved
                  with such breadth and power as to give all the signs that it was impelled by a
                  Divine decree. As men, when a stream begins to rise over its banks eagerly seek to
                  stop the breach, to dam against and to control the ravages of the rising flood,
                  which disdains all interference and sends them back in dismay to wait and watch
                  what the waters will do so the wise men and the managers found themselves dealing
                  with uncontrollable events, that were working out their own career, and would not
                  suffer men to restrain them.
               About the middle of February, fearing the boisterous weather of March in
                  Massachusetts, and hoping by change of scene and association to put the finishing
                  stroke upon his recovery, Heywood bid farewell to his friends in Norwood and left
                  for New York, on his way to Charleston in South Carolina.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXIX.
               THE OLD MAN'S JOURNEY.
               SINCE winter shut in, in good earnest, and snows were deep, and the winds were
                  searching, Tommy Taft found himself every month less able to get about. His last
                  visit had been at Dr. Wentworth's, hoping to hear something about Barton Cathcart,
                  whose continued absence the old man found it hard to bear. He asked no questions.
                  The sturdy old fellow would scarcely be beholden to any one even for information.
                  His own hands could no longer provide him the means of support. Charity he
                  resented. Had it not been for the kindness of Dr. Wentworth and the Cathcarts, he
                  would have suffered. But through his wife, unknown to him, they contrived to
                  supply his necessities under the color of his wife's earnings.
               His last visit, we said, was at Dr. Wentworth's. It was a fine winter day, in
                  January. It was one of those days in which nature is both brilliant and
                  relentless. The sparkle of the air, the scope of the sunlight, the transparency of
                  the atmosphere, seem like kindness in nature. But out of that very nourishing air
                  sweep sharp winds, whose temper is mollified by the sun, and which turn all the
                  radiance of the day to mockery. Did you never think of this? Then you
                  have looked out of a parlor-window into this air; or bundled up in furs, you have
                  shot through the snow in a brilliant sleigh, protected from cold; or you have such
                  vigor of health, that your warm blood with merry rebound, beats off the assaulting
                  frosts. But were you ever called out into such a day poorly clad, poorly fed, and
                  with slender health? The great northerly winter rolls down her fleece upon her
                  insentient family of sleeping children, and tucks up the flower-roots, and broods
                  upon all the buried, waiting, hibernating creatures; and then careless of the
                  rest, she sings harsh songs in the woods, and roars all night through the air, as
                  if men in novels, in sick-rooms, in poor-houses—the sick, the feeble, the old—were
                  none of her concern. And then, after one of those wild winter revels, when the
                  snow has blinded the air, and whirled and sifted through every crevice and heaped
                  itself against fence and hedge, and settled down in sheltered places in
                  mountain-drifts, how the morning will come in with open face and charming
                  expression, as if there had been no quarrel all night, nor a saucy wind, nor a
                  pitiless storm, but all was good and beautiful, and not nature, but the lame and
                  feeble were at fault, if any body was chilly, or cold, or suffering!
               It was on just such a morning that Tommy Taft grunted and stopped, now and then,
                  for breath, as he made his way to Dr. Wentworth's. He did not think all these fine
                  things. And yet, that was about the meaning of his grunts, if he had had the fancy
                  to unroll and interpret them to the best advantage. Agate Bissell saw him coming
                  up the path. She went to the front door, in real kindness, opened it to the old
                  man, saying:
               "Really, Mr. Taft, I pity any body who has to be out on so cold a morning."
               "Thankee, marm, for nothing. Keep your pity for those that need it—I don't."
               "There's no use in being touchy. You are sick, Taft, and you know it. I think it
                  would be better to let the doctor know, and see if he can't help you."
               "He help me? That's good. What can he give me for eyes worn out. Eh? What's good
                  for the innards pretty much used up. Eh? Do you think, Agate, he would give me any
                  thing for my wooden leg? Eh? It's getting monstrous heavy nowadays."
               "There was something ghastly to pious Agate in such talking by a man seemingly not
                  far from the grave; and though her genuine pity led her to forbear such a reply as
                  she would once have given, yet she could not help saying:
               Taft if you don't get help it's over with you. Honestly now, my friend, you seem
                  to me to be not far from the grave."
               "Jest as true as ye live, Agate. I've ben on the road to it seventy years, and I
                  know I must be gittin' near it by this time. The grave is a tavern where a good
                  many put up, Agate, and I never heerd that any body complained of his fare."
               This was said in a peculiar tone that might be banter, or sad earnest, and Agate
                  could not tell which. She looked earnestly at Tommy and said:
               
               "Taft, have you made your preparations? Have you done any thing to get ready?"
               "I've been gittin' ready as long as I can remember; and as to preparations, you
                  know that Turfmould and I are neighbors, and he's agreed to do the right thing by
                  me. Don't be afraid, Agate. I shall be a landholder before long. Turfmould makes
                  good titles. I guess mine'll hold."
               "Taft, I don't know what to make of you."
               "You don't need to make any thing. I am made up, already, and have been as long as
                  I can remember, though if I was to be made up agin, Agate, I don't know any body
                  that would do it better than you, eh?" said Tommy, giving Agate one of those winks
                  that acted upon her like a spark of fire upon powder.
               She rose with the dignity of anger, and was spared the trouble of opening the door
                  by Rose, who came in just as Agate was ready and anxious to pass out.
               Rose went to the old man with an affectionate cordiality that seemed more like a
                  child's love for a grandparent than the greeting of a neighbor or benefactor.
               Tommy tried to rise but Rose laid her hand on his shoulder familiarly and pressed
                  him back into his chair.
               "No no; there is no use, Uncle, in ceremony. You are not strong. How pale your
                  face is! Father tells me that the winter goes hard with you. I know you will be
                  glad to know that we have heard from Barton Cathcart. He wrote to father on some
                  business. He is very happy, and talks of living in the West."
               "Living in the West?" said Tommy, with unaffected surprise, as if his feelings had
                  been hurt; "living in the West? and I sha'n't see him agin? Die, and
                  not see the boy agin? I can't have it; indeed, Miss Rose, I can't. You must write
                  and tell him so. There ain't but one Barton Cathcart in this world, and, if other
                  folks don't know his value, I do. I'd rather die to-morrow, if I could see him
                  to-night, than live a year and not see him. I tell you, Miss Rose," said Tommy,
                  with a solemnity which she had never seen him manifest before, "I can't die till I
                  see Barton. I want to ask him something. I want to know—" and with that he
                  hesitated, and looked at Rose almost imploringly. "I want to know something about
                  it. If Barton says it's right, it's right, and I'll believe it."
               Rose could make nothing out of these sentences. But looking at Tommy as if it was
                  all plain, she said:
               "Barton writes that he will be home in February, and I've no doubt he will make it
                  all right."
               "Comin' in February? Let's see, that's three or four weeks. Mebbe that'd be too
                  late."
               "Can I help you, Uncle Tommy? Am I not as good as Barton?"
               Tommy had risen, and, looking at Rose with great kindness, said:
               "Bless you, dear child, you're good enough to be Barton's own self; and—well I
                  must hobble home. I'm afeered of an attack."
               Tommy had become subject to paroxysms of severe pain in the stomach. During their
                  continuance he was peculiarly unwilling to have any one present, even his wife. He
                  would shut himself up in his loft and growl and groan by himself. These attacks
                  were becoming more frequent, and the whole system was becoming weakened by this
                  affection. To his daughter's inquiry, Dr. Wentworth replied:
               "The disease is obscure. I suppose it to be a cancerous affection of the stomach.
                  That it will prove fatal I do not doubt; but whether he will drop off suddenly, or
                  be gradually worn out with suffering, I cannot tell."
               The old man bravely resisted all sympathy. He would allow no one to pity him. He
                  had nothing to say about his own sufferings, and was angry at any allusion to
                  them. Mother Taft, herself feeble, hovered around the old man with a kind of
                  helpless pity, which she dared not speak and could not hide. The most unlovely
                  side of his character Tommy Taft showed to his wife. This habit was contagious,
                  for several others in the village were known to have the same disagreeable trait.
                  Fortunately it was confined to the one sex!
               As the old man rose to depart, Rose felt a presentiment that she should never see
                  him again. She was just about leaving home to make a visit to her relatives in
                  Boston, which should have been made during the holidays but was prevented by her
                  mother's transient illness. As he moved slowly toward the door, she recalled the
                  days of her childhood, how many times he had frolicked with her, how many little games he had taught her,
                  what funny stories he had invented to amuse her, visiting his rude quarters, and
                  her heart was deeply touched with the old man's sufferings, which, every time she
                  saw him, seemed to be gaining ground. When Tommy turned at the front door, as Rose
                  reached out her hand to say good-bye, a tear rolled down her cheek and fell upon
                  the old man's hand.
               "Good-bye, dear Uncle Tommy; I shall never meet you again, until we meet in
                  Heaven."
               At first the old man seemed annoyed at her feeling, and said somewhat harshly:
               "What you cryin' for? I ain't dead yet? That's funeral business." But, changing
                  his tone, Tommy Taft for a moment seemed to identify Barton with Rose. Looking
                  tenderly at her out from under his great shaggy eyebrows, he said: "It's jest as
                  like as not that what you say is true; and if I don't see him again, you tell him
                  that I wanted him. I won't trust none of them folks to show me. It's a pretty dark
                  way for a lame old man to be stumblin' in alone; and I shouldn't like to take the
                  wrong turn, you know. This kind o' journey's one a fellow can't go back on. If he
                  gits wrong, why wrong it'll have to be; and if Barton was only here to show me the
                  way—eh?"
               Rose was deeply affected. She had never in all her life heard Taft speak of
                  religion except in broad humor, and never at all in its relations to his own
                  future condition. It was not the languid sentiment of one weakened by long
                  sickness, nor the inspiration of fear. The old man would have been as sturdy and
                  defiant as ever had one word been spoken amiss!
               Rose knew, in spite of all his faults, the real depth of the old man's heart. She
                  knew the rugged strength of his mind and the unusual sagacity of his perceptions.
                  Why was he lying useless at the bottom of society? His power should have ranked
                  him among the first. To see such a one peering into the dark future and confessing
                  his inability to see how to tread its way, would have touched the sympathy of one
                  far less sensitive than Rose.
               Looking tenderly at the old man, Rose repeated the words:
               "'Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil;
                  for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.'"
               "That's it," said the old man, "you've hit it exactly. If Barton was along I had
                  as lief trudge as not."
               "Barton could not help you. There is One who has said, 'I am the Way, and the
                  Life,'—He can help you."
               "I shouldn't wonder. But I know Barton, and he's got a headpiece. He's thought of
                  all these matters, and ain't tied up to old world notions; and if he
                  says, 'Tommy, it's all real,' that's enough. You must understand, Miss Rose, that
                  I don't care much about myself; but, do ye see, I'd like to keep along with
                  Barton, and if I knew the track he's going to take, you may be sure you'd find me
                  there."
               If it had been Dr. Buell be would not have suffered Tommy Taft to rest on any such
                  human affection as a security in death. But Rose, without reflecting on the
                  theological aspects of the case, was glad to see in the old man any thoughtfulness
                  about dying, and she hoped that through his affection for Barton he might be led
                  to a higher trust and a surer hope.
               It was indeed the last time she ever saw Taft. Before her return from Boston both
                  Tommy Taft and Barton Cathcart had left Norwood, the one on that road where
                  travellers journey only one way, and Cathcart had gone to the great war which
                  broke forth in the spring, like the conflagration of a continent.
               For a week after this interview Tommy Taft was detained in the house by the
                  severity of the weather. When the skies relented he was too weak to get about
                  alone. Every week his anxiety increased to see Barton. Pain could not subdue his
                  stubborn will. But no will could sustain the daily weakening body. It was the last
                  week in February before the old man fairly took to his bed and gave up all hope of
                  seeing Cathcart before he died. His spirits were depressed and his temper not the
                  best, Dr. Buell, faithful to his fractious parishioner, still visited him from
                  time to time hoping that in some favorable hour he might cast light into his
                  darkened mind. One day a knock sounded at his door.
               "Come in,—or stay out, as suits ye best," said Tommy.
               Dr. Buell entered.
               "Come in, Doctor. You're always at work on the old sinner. Really, I had a pain
                  this morning that liked to let me through."
               "I hope, Taft, that you find yourself willing to depart, if it be God's will."
               
               "Well, well, as to that Doctor, I guess when a clock has run down it stops, not
                  because it has a mind to, but because it can't help it!"
               "Yet, one may have Christian resignation to events which he cannot control. It is
                  a very solemn thing to die, Taft, and the future is dark to those who have no hope
                  in the Saviour."
               "When a ship's driven in by gales, and has to make a harbor, it's mighty
                  convenient to have a light-house; but if there ain't any, why a feller must get in
                  the best way he can."
               "But there is a light. Christ is the light of the world. There is no need of
                  darkness to one who trusts Him."
               "That's so; that's good doctrine—sound views, no doubt. You was always very clear.
                  I often said that if a man didn't understand you be needn't go to meeting any
                  where, for there wan't any better preaching in the State."
               In short, it was plain that Taft did not mean to talk about his feelings with the
                  minister. Dr. Buell was deeply moved with pity. The old man's pale face, his
                  weakness, the nature of his disease, indicated that he had not long to live. He
                  hesitated a moment in doubt whether it would be worth while to suggest praying
                  with the sick man, who sat propped up in bed.
               "Taft, if it would be pleasant—if you desire it, that is—I shall be glad to pray
                  with you."
               "No objection in the world! If I was one of the elect I'd do it myself."
               "Is there any thing that you would like me specially to solicit?"
               "If it's proper, and just the same to you, ask the Lord to send Barton Cathcart
                  home, and let me see the boy once more afore I die."
               Tommy Taft had a large head and face. Usually there was a rugged and somewhat
                  sharp expression to his features. But sickness had turned his face pale, his bushy
                  side locks were very gray, and his eyes peered out from under his brow with more
                  than common brightness. He did not shut them while Doctor Buell prayed. He looked
                  over the form of the kneeling minister with an expression in which mirth was
                  blended with pain. It seemed to say:
               "Poor fellow! It don't take much to make you happy."
               It was very plain that Tommy did not accept any one as priest but Barton Cathcart,
                  and that the only thread by which his rugged nature could be led was the single
                  golden strand of affection.
               He grew daily weaker, and more and more crabbed. It was a hard task for Mother
                  Taft. He poured out words like paving stones upon her. He would agree to nothing,
                  and seemed likely to go out of the world like a shaggy bear seeking his northern
                  covert for hybernation. On the first day of March it was, that Tommy Taft had been
                  unquietly sleeping in the forenoon, to make up for a disturbed night. The little
                  noisy clock,—that regarded itself as the essence of a Yankee, and ticked with
                  immense alacrity, and struck in the most bustling and emphatic manner,—this
                  industrious and moral clock began striking, whir-r-r, one; whir-r-r,
                     two; whir-r-r, three; (Tommy jerked his head a little
                  as if something vexed him in his sleep;) whir-r-r, four; whir-r-r,
                     five; whir-r-r, six; ("Keep still, will ye? let me
                  alone old woman! d— your medicine;") whir-r-r, seven; whir-r-r,
                     eight; ("God in Heaven! as sure as I live," said Tommy, rubbing
                  his eyes as if to make sure that they saw aright;) whir-r-r, nine;
                  whir-r-r, ten! Then, holding out his arms with the simplicity of a
                  child, his face fairly glowing with joy, and looking now really noble, he
                  cried:
               "Barton,—my boy, Barton,—I knew you wouldn't let the old man die, and not help
                  him! I knew it! I knew it!"
               After the first surprise of joy subsided, Tommy pushed Barton from the edge of his
                  bed:
               "Stand up, boy; turn round! There he is! Now I'm all right. Got my pilot aboard.
                  Sealed orders—ready to sail the minit the hawser's let go."
               After a few words about his return from the West, his health, and prospects the
                  old man returned to the subject that seemed to lie nearest his heart.
               "They've all had a hand at me, Barton. There twenty firms in this town that is
                  willin' to give a seller sailin' orders, when they see he's outward bound. But I
                  am an old salt—I know my owners!" said Tommy, with an affectionate wink at
                  Barton.
               "Oh, my boy, you're back agin; it's all right now. Don't you let me go wrong. I
                  want you to tell me just where you're goin', and I'll bear right up for that port!
                  You know, Barton, I never cheated you when you was a boy. I took care of ye, and
                     never told you a lie in my life, and
                  never got you in a scrape. You won't cheat an old man now, will ye?"
               It was all that Barton could do to maintain his self-possession. Tears and smiles
                  kept company on his face.
               "My dear old Tommy, we won't part company. We're both bound to the same land. God
                  will, I fervently hope, for Christ's sake, forgive all our sins, and make us meet
                  for everlasting life!"
               "Amen!" roared out the old man. "Go on. You really believe in it?
                  Come here Barton, sit down on the edge of the bed look me in the face, and no
                  flummery,—do you really believe that there's another world?"
               "I do, Tommy, I believe it in my very soul!"
               "That's enough! I believe it too, jest as sartain as if a shipmate had told me
                  about an island I'd never seen, but he had."
               "Now, Barton, give me the bearin's of't. D'ye believe that there's a Lord that
                  helps a poor feller to it?"
               "I do. Christ loves me, and you, and all of us. He is glorious in love; and for no
                  other reason in the world than because He loves to do kind things, He saves all
                  who trust Him."
               "He don't stand on particulars, then? He won't rip up all a feller's old faults,
                  will He?—or how's that? Don't you ease up on me, Barton, just to please me, but
                  tell me the hardest on't. I believe every word you say."
               Barton's own soul had travelled on the very road on which Tommy was now walking,
                  and remembering his own experience, and some of those wonderful crystals which he
                  had dug out of the ridges of the Old Testament, and which he had set in his memory
                  with even more feeling than before, made up in part by the renewal of his own
                  former experiences, he repeated to Tommy these words, saying to him:
               "Tommy, if I was describing a man to you, you would take him to be just what I
                  say, wouldn't you?"
               "Sartain!"
               "Well, this is God's nature. You are going toward him, and ought to know how to
                  behave."
               "That's as true as the compass. Did'nt I tell ye, old woman, when Barton came it
                  would be plain sailing?"
               "'And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God,
                  merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.
               "Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and
                  that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the
                  fathers upon the children and upon the children's children, unto the third and to
                  the fourth generation.'—Exodus xxxiv. 8, 9.
               "Then again, Tommy, hear this:
               "'Who is a God like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by
                  the transgression of the last of his heritage? he retained not his anger for ever,
                  because he delighteth in mercy.
               "'He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our
                  iniquities; and thou wilt cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.'"—Micah
                  vii. 18, 19.
               "Now that's to the p'int, Barton. The Lord will tumble a feller's sins overboard
                  like rubbish, or bilge-water and the like, when a ship is in the middle of the
                  ocean? Well it would puzzle a teller to find 'em agin after that. Is that all? I'm
                  to report to Him?"
               "Yes, Tommy; you are to report to God just as I should report to you if you were a
                  ship owner, and I were the captain, and had made mistakes and losses on the
                  voyage. Suppose you loved me just as you do now, and I were to come back to you
                  and make a clean breast of it, what would you do to me?"
               "Do? You know what I'd do? I'd say—Barton, hold your yawp; not another word atween
                  us. I care more for you than for every d— dollar of the cargo."
               Barton did not stop for Tommy's adjectives.
               "That's just what God says to us: 'All his transgressions that he hath committed
                  they shall not be mentioned unto him.' 'Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked
                  should die, saith the Lord God?'"
               "Well, now, this is honorable! It makes a feller feel mean, though, Barton, when
                  he's treated so, and then thinks what sort of a feller he's been."
               Barton then read from the fifteenth chapter of Luke to the old man the parable of
                  the prodigal son.
               "Barton, would ye jest as lief do me a little favor as not?"
               "What is it, Taft?"
               
               "Would ye mind sayin' a little prayer—for me—it makes no difference, of course;
                  but jest a line of introduction in a foreign port sometimes helps a feller
                  amazingly."
               Barton knelt by the bedside and prayed. Without reflecting at the moment on Uncle
                  Tommy's particular wants, Barton was following in prayer the line of his own
                  feelings; when, suddenly, he felt Tommy's finger gently poking his head.
               "I say, Barton, ain't you steerin' a p'int or two off the course? I don't seem to
                  follow you."
               A few earnest, simple petitions followed, which Taft seemed to relish.
               "Lord forgive Tommy Taft's sins ("Now you've hit it," said the old man, softly.)
                  Prepare him for Thy kingdom. ("Yes, and Barton, too!") May he feel Thy love, and
                  trust his soul in Thy sacred keeping. ("Ah, ha! that's it—you're in the right spot
                  now.") Give him peace while he lives. ("No matter about that—the doctor'll give me
                  opium for that! go on.") And, at his death, save his soul in Thy kingdom, for
                  Christ's sake. Amen."
               "Amen. But did'nt you coil it away rather too quick?"
               The fact was, that Barton was not used to the office of public prayer, and still
                  less to the running commentaries of Tommy Taft, which, though helpful to the old
                  man, were of no assistance to Barton.
               "Now, Barton, my boy, you've done a good thing. I've been waiting for you all
                  winter, and you did'nt come a minit too soon. I'm tired now; but I want you to
                  come back to-morrow. I've got somethin' to tell you. I never let you know nothin'
                  about my life, and I've a mind to tell you. Oh, it was a cruel shame for my uncle
                  to treat me so! I might have made a man if I'd had half a chance. No matter. But I
                  want to say one thing: Barton, when I'm gone, you won't let the old woman suffer?
                  She's had a pretty hard time of it with me. She's like a sparrow that builds 
                     it's
                     its
                   nest in a thorn bush. I knew you would. One thing more, Barton," said
                  the old man, his voice sinking almost to a whisper, as if speaking a secret from
                  the bottom of his soul, "Barton, you know I never had much money. I never laid up
                  any—couldn't. Now you won't let me come on to the town for a funeral—will ye? I
                  should hate to be buried in a pine coffin, at town expense, and have folks laugh
                  that didn't dare open their head to me when I was 'round town! And then, Barton,
                  you'll put old Smasher in with me! Of course, it ain't any matter, but I'd rather
                  take my leg along, if it's all the same to other folks!"
               Barton could not forbear smiling, as the old man, growing visibly feebler every
                  hour, went on revealing traits which his sturdy pride had covered when he was in
                  health.
               "And Barton, I wish you'd let the children come when I'm buried. They'll come if
                  you'll just let 'em know. Always trust the children! And—(pain here checked his
                  utterance for a moment)—and let's see, what was I saying? Oh, the children. I
                  don't want nothin' said. But if you'd jest as lief let the children sing one of
                  their hymns, I should relish it."
               The color came suddenly to his cheek, and left as suddenly. He pressed his hand
                  over his stomach, and leaned his head further over on his pillow, as if to wait
                  till the pang passed. It seemed long. Barton rose and leaned over him. The old man
                  opened his eyes, and with a look of ineffable longing, whispered:
               "Kiss me."
               A faint smile dwelt about his mouth; his faced relaxed and seemed to express
                  happiness in its rugged features. But the old man was not there. Without sound of
                  wings, or footfall, he had departed on his last journey!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XL.
               FAITH REKINDLED.
               ON their way home from the burial, Judge Bacon, Parson Buell, Dr. Wentworth, and
                  Barton Cathcart walked together, talking of the old man and the funeral. The whole
                  town seemed to have turned out. It was even proposed to use the church, not so
                  much in respect for the dead as for the living. Few families were there where
                  Mother Taft had not ministered, and there was unusual sympathy for her now. But
                  she and Barton, who assumed the arrangements, thought it wiser that Tommy Taft
                  should go to his grave from the homely quarters where he had lived. A prayer was
                  made, a hymn sung, and, if Tommy heard it his spirit could not but have been
                  content with the number and sweetness of the children's voices. There were enough
                  people, now that he was gone, to say kind things of him, and to apologize for his
                  eccentricities.
               "I have always been of opinion," said Judge Bacon, "that Taft would have been a
                  man of great power in society if he had been subject to early training and
                  fortunate circumstances. The rough material was in him, and education might have
                  shaped it to the proportions of an uncommon manhood."
               "You were with him, Barton, when he died—did he seem to have any proper conception
                  of the solemn event?" inquired Dr. Buell.
               Barton's account of his interview was striking. There was a moment's silence.
                  Judge Bacon remarked, breaking it:
               "I suspect that it is all right with Tommy. No doubt, the good Lord was
                  merciful."
               "God's mercies and man's saving evidences are not to be confounded," said Parson
                  Buell. "All that man can do is to inquire whether in the judgment of charity,
                  one's life or dying experience, gives evidence of gracious affections. Tommy
                  Taft's character was marked with many strong excellences, but he would be bold who
                  should say that his was a Christian life."
               "But do you not think there is some evidence that, at last, he was led to put
                  faith in the Saviour?" said Barton.
               "My own pastoral visits developed nothing particularly encouraging," replied Dr.
                  Buell. "Your narrative is certainly more hopeful. Yet, I should speak of a sudden
                  dying experience with great caution. It would be mischievous for men to suppose
                  that a whole life, perverse and worldly, can be rubbed out like a slate, by a
                  momentary glow of feeling in the last hour. I should think Barton, that his
                  experience was more a manifestation of affection for you than for his God."
               "Since there is no positive evidence," said Dr. Wentworth, "of his condition, let
                  us charitably hope that the spark which glowed at the last was not quenched in
                  death. He humbled himself to Barton for very love. He followed him to Christ. True
                  love is mediatorial. If to any state of mind God would reveal himself, it would be
                  to love and submission. It was not regular. What repentance is ever logical? Will
                  a shepherd refuse a returned sheep because it followed home a bell-wether instead
                  of the shepherd's own call?"
               "I perceive, gentlemen, with all due submission to your superior gifts," said
                  Judge Bacon, blandly smiling and waving his hand with a gesture that seemed to put
                  away the whole discussion, "that your wisdom increases as your knowledge fails.
                  Poor Taft is gone. That is all you know about it. But no! You mount up above all
                  facts logic or vision, and one weaves for him a garment of salvation while the
                  other pulls out the stitches! Ah, what tailors of cloud-clothes you would make! If
                  Taft had been a deacon, or a minister, of course we should have to let him go in.
                  As he was a rough old sailor, with a hard tongue—"
               Barton interposed with some slight asperity:
               "Do you think that a smooth tongue and a hard heart would have served him better
                  than a rough tongue and a warm heart?"
               "A thousand pardons, my young friend," said the judge, accepting with perfect good
                  nature the implied comparison,—"I yield, I yield. I shall put Tommy into the
                  calendar, and hereafter swear by St. Taft. He excelled in the grace of
                  swearing!"
               "I fear that he was profane," said Parson Buell, "though not in my presence."
               "No? I am surprised!" returned the judge. "However, swearing is for the most part a mere rhetorical
                  enforcement—a system of interjections, in bad taste because of exaggeration. There
                  is much pious swearing. A church-member slips on the ice, and exclaims, 'goodness,
                  now!' Tommy Taft would have said, 'd— it!' Both meant the same thing.
                  A bold man means swear, and says it. A timid man means swear, but
                  says 'gracious!' All interjections are swearing, a kind of latent oaths, are they
                  not, parson?"
               "Swear not at all; let your communication be yea, yea; nay, nay," said Buell. "No
                  doubt many common by-words are only a sort of cowardly profanity. But the guilt of
                  profane swearing is not lessened by calling it an interjection, or by raising the
                  culpableness of by-words."
               "Well, well, Doctor or Minister, whichever of you conquers, I perceive that both
                  of you in your hearts have put Tommy in heaven, and that he is as well off as if
                  he had died at a stake a martyr for religion."
               "By no means," replied Buell. "There are infinite degrees of excellence and of
                  happiness in heaven. One may enter as a king, crowned; another enters 'so as by
                  fire.' One emigrant may come on to the coast by shipwreck, saving nothing but his
                  life; and another, after a prosperous voyage, lands, with his goods, among friends
                  that had come over before him. Both are safe; but one is a pauper, and the other
                  well advanced in society. Let us reverently hope that Taft, at the last, beheld
                  and accepted the Saviour. But that by no means places him at the side of those
                  whose earthly life was a long career of virtue and self-denial."
               "Bereavement," said Dr. Wentworth, "is a great heretic. I I have found few persons
                  who do not contrive to believe that their friends are saved. It is
                  other people's friends that we remit to justice. Our own are, by some mediation of
                  affection and grief, rescued. Indeed the Infinite and the Eternal are words without meaning till grief interprets them. Tears
                  are like chemical re-agents, whose touch brings out colors. When, bearing our
                  beloved in our arms, we come face to face with eternity, all our reasonings
                  retreat into our hearts. Men do not deny their beliefs. But they will not let them
                  speak. Like light in a sick room, they must be turned down and softened, and
                  sometimes, before the morning comes, they go out."
               "Truth," replied Buell, "is not less true because our sympathies flow out against
                  it. The sun shines on in spite of weak eyes. Has a man a right to put a bandage on
                  his eyes and call it sunset?"
               They had reached Dr. Wentworth's mansion, and all turned in thither. It was a
                  bright, but coldly blustering day. The hickory fire cheerily blazed on the hearth.
                  The conservatory door stood wide open, and the eye discerned an artificial summer
                  there, whose greenness and beauty was now, after the long winter, inexpressibly
                  attractive. The azaleas were coming into bloom. Exquisite ferns of various
                  tropical kinds grew with luxuriance. There was a summery feeling in the room. Its
                  light, its warmth, and the sight of plants and flowers all helped the illusion. A
                  canary bird hanging in the conservatory sang merrily, and one or two flies buzzed
                  against the window, or flew dreamily through the air. After a long winter, a fly
                  in the house brings with it a sense of summer. If old and torpid, we take it in
                  hand, blow warm breath upon it, put sugar before it. Imagine a man doing all that
                  to a fly in August!
               Judge Bacon could not tarry, and waited only till the flowers which the doctor was
                  cutting for the ladies were arranged, and then departed. But not till he had he
                  joined all further discussion.
               "When Buell and I meet you, Wentworth you always seem moved with talk. Why, if all
                  that you have discoursed to me, to say nothing of Buell, were written in a book of
                  what dimensions would it already be! I know very well what you are both thinking
                  of. Buell wants to say now that your doctrine of Nature is injurious
                  to Scripture. Then you, Doctor, are full of a reply, viz.: that the
                  globe, but particularly the human mind, by its best specimens, is a
                  previous, or co-ordinate, or auxiliary revelation. Then Buell will snap you up
                  with the question, 'Do you bring the Bible down to the level of Nature?' and you will answer, 'No, I attempt to raise nature up to the level of
                  the Bible.' Then he will say, 'What do you mean by Nature?' and you
                  will reply, 'Whatever God has created, but chiefly the human mind.' Then Buell
                  will look very sober—he always does—but he will look soberer yet, and trust that
                  you are not going off into mere natural religion. Then you will say that you
                  prefer natural to unnatural religion. He will then look hurt, and you will grow
                  dignified. Then after a while Doctor Buell will very mildly ask whether you think
                     the deductions of science are upon
                  an equality with the doctrines of Christ? and you will say they are infinitely
                  below them—not because they are science, but from the nature of the truths
                  themselves, one relating to matter, and the other to the soul. Whereupon he will
                  introduce a question in mental philosophy, and you will snatch it away from him,
                  and then he will get it away from you, until, before you know it, the clock will
                  strike twelve—midnight! and then every thing will be left just as it
                  was before, to be gone over again at some future meeting.
               "Ah, there is nothing so improving as philosophical discussion! But my health
                  suffers from such luxuries, and I must deny myself and bid you good evening." And
                  with a courtly manner the judge bowed himself out.
               "A most agreeable and discriminating scoffer," said Dr. Buell, as the door
                  closed.
               "Oh no, not scoffer, which implies something bitter or malignant. I think he has a
                  conscience, and that, in spite of his badinage, he is not without serious thoughts
                  and purposes."
               The tea was announced. Barton sat in the place which Rose usually occupied, Dr.
                  Buell sat next to Agate Bissell, and the children, great and little, filled up the
                  interstices between the doctor and his wife. Barton gave some account of his
                  western experiences—some further facts relating to Tommy Taft. He appeared
                  unusually vivacious. Dr. Wentworth remarked afterward to his wife that he had
                  never known young Cathcart to be so buoyant and modestly self-confident. He seemed
                  like one who had seen trouble, but had found peace.
               Leaving Dr. Buell with the ladies—to whom, and to Agate in particular, he was
                  laying open some plans for usefulness—Barton and Dr. Wentworth repaired to the
                  study.
               Barton began:
               "I do not feel, as Dr. Buell does, that your views of God's use of Nature as a
                  revelation tend to unsettle faith. In my own case, it has led me back to my
                  childhood faith again. I was brought up, in effect though not in theory, to look
                  upon Nature as something dangerous, having no relation to religious feelings, and
                  indeed, as a storehouse of infidel dangers. I had never heard a minister employ
                  nature as an auxiliary of the Bible, as if there had been not one, but a
                  converging series of revelations all witnessing nessing to the same truths, but in
                  differing degrees of clearness, the full light and disclosure coming in Christ
                  Jesus!"
               The doctor answered:
               "And yet the Old Testament is a storehouse of religious feeling excited by the
                  objects in Nature. The Psalms of David play upon all the aspects of nature
                  familiar to Palestine, and summon every living thing to bear witness to God. But
                  many ministers seem to think that Nature has a secret grudge against the Bible,
                  and they are determined that they will defend the Bible against its insidious
                  aggressions.
               "In making the world, many seem to think, God saved up the best truths, refusing
                  to let Nature shadow them, reserving them for a written book. But Paul thought
                  otherwise declaring that God framed the world for the purpose of revealing himself
                  and his government to man. 'For the invisible things (truths) of Him are clearly
                  seen from (in) the creation of the world-being understood by the things that are
                  made, even to his eternal power and Godhead.'"
               "I am almost certain, Doctor, that but for your help I should have made shipwreck
                  of my faith. I had come to a state in which nothing was true to me merely because
                  the Bible said so; but when, under your help, I found the great truths of the
                  Bible indicated and corroborated in Nature, I was wonderfully strengthened.
                  Indeed, I consider that the turning point in my history."
               "There are a variety of influences which make religious difficulties almost a
                  disease," said Dr. Wentworth. "A person cannot ravel out the threads of religious
                  belief which from his childhood have woven the figures of taste, fancy, affection,
                  and reason itself, without doing a violence to his nature which few have the
                  strength to survive.
               The process is itself destructive, but it is made worse by the odium attached to
                  scepticism-especially in New England, where it is deemed the mother of all
                  immorality. This public sentiment is either to be dared or evaded. If defied, it
                  soon drives a man desperate by its inflections. If to avoid this one is prudently
                  silent his mind grows hot and morbid by speculations which he supposes to be
                  purely intellectual, whereas they are a mixture of intense feelings, of fancies,
                  and of unregulated reasonings—a medley, as far from philosophy as possible, but peculiarly
                  well calculated to produce morbid conditions both of body and soul."
               Barton replied:
               "I need no testimony on that point. I now wonder, as I look back, that my reason
                  was spared. But it was in some respects this very intensity of suffering that
                  worked a cure. I became satisfied that the reasoning of those men whose steps I
                  was following, if carried forward legitimately and fearlessly, would not stop with
                  discrediting a revelation, but would go on to discredit the existence of a God.
                  The question came home—are you prepared to follow out your reasoning, and to give
                  up faith in the existence of any God? Since no man can prove that God does not
                  exist, I found that I should vibrate like a pendulum between Theism and Atheism,
                  and that I should have my convictions just as little settled as before, only I
                  should be unsettled in a different place; I should be acting in that remote region
                  just as uncertainly and insincerely as before I had sacrificed my Christian
                  faith."
               "Certain natures must ferment," said Dr. Wentworth. "They do not become clear or
                  deep till after a process of that kind. But I have noticed a great many men who
                  went no further than to drop their faith in Christianity, which, as it is now
                  held, represents not only the mere words of Christ, but all the experiences which
                  have since sprung from these words, in good men, and so is the substance and
                  epitome of all the moral good which the world has learned. They were not honest
                  enough to go on with their principles to the logical result, and became torpid or
                  frivolous skeptics without moral depth or moral honesty."
               —"It was at the point of this rebound in me, from the darkness and horror of
                  atheism, that I was helped to a degree of which you were never conscious, by an
                  almost accidental train of conversation illustrating the difference between the
                  essential truths of revelation and the vehicles of these truths. I had been
                  sticking at a great many of the so-called difficulties of the scriptures. I
                  pricked up my ears at your illustrations. You said, 'If a messenger were to come
                  to a poor man saying, "I bear in my hand the will of a relative of your mother's.
                  He has left you an estate, and here are the documents which will put you in
                  possession,"—a sensible man would at once, upon a tolerably fair showing, take the
                  documents and test them. He would see if they had been recorded; if there was such
                  property; if, upon presenting his claims, it was made over to him. But what if,
                  instead of regarding possession as the best argument in favor of the
                  genuineness of the will, he should indicate his philosophy and shrewdness by
                  picking flaws with the grammar, quarreling with the messenger, instituting a
                  special plea on the doctrine of probabilities in the case?' Out of that view came
                  great relief to me. I said 'Here is the will and Testament of my Father. Let me
                  take possession of the contents rather than criticise them.' I considered the New
                  Testament ideal of human life—its pattern of character, its delineation of the
                  ends of a true life, its code of moral sentiments—and said to myself, 'Is there
                  any thing nobler than this? Has nature any thing better to teach me?' I considered
                  the conception formed in Scripture of God, his universal Fatherhood, his Remedial
                  Nature as Manifested in Christ, the whole, as it now seems to me, a marvellous and
                  transcendent picture of excellence; and I contrasted this positive, effulgent
                  sympathetic Being, with that uncertain, protean, pulseless, soulless Solitude
                  which Pantheism and Atheism call God. The contrast was salutary. It really brought
                  my pride and my moral sense over on to the ground of my childhood belief! It
                  seemed to me that such fruit could be found growing nowhere else, and that to
                  refuse it was as if a man should refuse oranges because the tree was crooked, or
                  the bark diseased, or the thorns too long and too sharp.
               "In connection with this, came to my relief this view: 'I am undertaking to
                  construct a theory of the universe as the condition I precedent to my own life.
                  But I have a personal duty. I have to develop a character, to perform, my part in
                  society, to be a man among men. Am I at liberty to defer this until I have put
                  Time, History and the Globe to analysis and synthesis? If right living is
                  immediate, urgent, the duty of to-day, then I must take the best ideals that
                  exist, and work them out.' But that view brought me right back to the New
                  Testament, and I could not help saying to myself, 'What book is this which an
                  earnest man desiring to live a high and noble life, finds at every turn supplying
                  him with the very elements which he needs? Is it not the Book of Life?'
               "There came, finally, one experience further. When I was most imbued with the
                  truth as I found it in Christ, most tender in my feelings, I seemed to have on
                  various occasions, borne in upon me a
                  tide of influences which I could account for on no theory of ordinary causation,
                  and which I have come to believe was divine. The spirit was promised. To me it has
                  been fulfilled.
               "I have not got beyond difficulties. I cannot answer certain technical questions
                  arising in my mind respecting Revelation. I am more than dubious of much of the
                  philosophy in which religious truth is clothed in the pulpit. But this I know—I
                  have found the road to Manhood; I know my duty to society; I have a sure faith in
                  immortality; I behold the glory of a God worthy to be praised, I accept as my
                  guide, friend and Saviour, his Son, the Redeemer of the world. And I believe that
                  he gives forth to me the Holy Spirit. I never could have said as much as this to
                  any one but to you. For you, sir, have had more influence in restraining my
                  aberration, and in establishing points of cure in me, than all others."
               A pause followed this conversation. Tears rolled down the doctor's face. The clock
                  on the mantel chimed the hour. The fire snapped and showered its sparks up the
                  chimney. There needed no words. Silence is sometimes the most perfect
                  communion.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLI.
               CHANGE OF LATITUDE.
               IT was on an overcast day early in March that Heywood entered Charleston harbor.
                  It was not that low and smothering cloudiness which shuts in and diminishes a
                  prospect, but one of those gray, lowering skies which cause every thing to loom up
                  and to seem larger and grander than they appear in the white flat light of the
                  sun. Heywood was on deck, and as the channel carried them nearly parallel with
                  Morris Island, the captain pointed out the lines of batteries that were night and
                  day in process, of construction. For Major Anderson, on the 26th of December,
                  1860, acting upon his own military judgment, had abandoned Fort Moultrie, upon
                  Sullivan's Island, on the north side of the harbor, and had conveyed his whole
                  force to Sumter, a fort rising on every side right out of the water, and not
                  accessible to assault, as was Fort Moultrie from its land side. This judicious
                  movement took the authorities by surprise. Had Beauregard been then in command in
                  Charleston, it is hardly possible that the opportunity would have been left open
                  for Major Anderson to secure a position far better suited to the number of his men
                  than Moultrie in better repair and removed from all danger of surprise.
               The surprise at this movement was the greater because it had been believed that
                  Major Anderson, a Southerner by birth, would ultimately come over to the Southern
                  cause; or, at any rate, Perform his duty in such a manner as not to molest the
                  plans of the Confederacy.
               To reduce Fort Sumter would require the erection of many batteries. No other spot
                  in the harbor of Charleston could have been selected where a fort that commanded
                  the entrance could be itself so dominated from every side by batteries on the
                  shore.
               As the steamer neared this fort, all eyes were turned toward this centre of
                  attraction, and opinions were exchanged among officers and passengers as to the
                  probable fate of its garrison. So little was then known of war, and especially of
                  improved artillery, that the most extravagant opinions were expressed both on
                     the one side and on the other.
                  Heywood felt the tears rising to his eyes as he looked upon the stars and stripes
                  waving over the fort. His soul revolted against the folly and crime of those who
                  should dare to touch that sacred emblem of the country's glory! As he stood
                  gazing, he unconsciously said aloud, "God keep thee, flag of my fathers!"
               "You, a Virginian," said the captain, "and praying for that Northern flag? I am a
                  Southern man, and if I lived in Charleston I would have that rag down as soon as
                  powder and shot could fetch it down! You'll see that palmetto flag yonder waving
                  over these bricks before many weeks!"
               Heywood turned to look at the flag toward which the captain pointed as he spoke.
                  It was too distant to be clearly discerned. But, through the captain's glass he
                  saw over Castle Pinckney, and now over Moultrie, the State flag of South Carolina.
                  His heart sickened. He turned and walked away. The gray sky—the dark and scowling
                  water—signs of a coming storm—all seemed to him in keeping with the events
                  transpiring. To himself he said: "Have I lived to see the day when the government
                  and its flag will be assailed with war? Do I dream? Or is this a hideous reality?
                  Well may the heaven hide its brightness, and the storm wail. A mightier storm will
                  soon burst?"
               Heywood soon landed and repaired to his hotel; nor did he regret that the day and
                  night were stormy, as he desired to get settled in his quarters before going out
                  or presenting his letters. On rising the next morning his senses were soothed and
                  delighted with the fragrance of the air and the genial temperature of the
                  atmosphere. It almost shakes one's sense of personal identity to be changed by a
                  short voyage of a few days from snows and frosts into the midst of growing gardens
                  and blossoming fields. Early March here answered to late May in New England. The
                  roses and honeysuckles were in blossom. Even his Virginian home had no such
                  luxuriant growths as he witnessed here. The Lamarque rose, the Chromatella, the
                  various Noisettes and Tea roses which he had been wont to see grown under glass,
                  or, if out of doors, subject every winter to frosts which pruned them to the
                  ground, here grew from year to year in open gardens, becoming large and luxuriant,
                  and hanging in clusters of magnificent buds and blossoms in wonderful
                  profusion.
               He strolled through the streets to gain some general idea of the city. The finest
                  dwellings, however, seemed half hidden by high brick walls around the yards. Over
                  the tops hung many a vine, or clump of climbing rose. Now and then some open gate,
                  or some more generous and open fence, enabled him to look through and see beds of
                  early bulbs in full blossom, the long glossy leaves of laurel the deep green and
                  polished leaves of the Pettisporum and the Cape Jessamine.
               The air was delicious. It was perfumed and balmy. Heywood strolled on from street
                  to street in the early morning with unaffected delight. Suddenly he was challenged
                  by a sentinel, and warned off from bounds which he was just crossing. It was a
                  camp of Georgia troops just come from Savannah. His heart sickened. With hastening
                  steps he returned to his hotel. The front was already swarming with citizens, and
                  among them many military men. He began fully to realize that Charleston was a
                  foreign city! He was in his own land and yet not under his own government! He was,
                  however, not regarded as a stranger. Not only was his father known, but his zeal
                  in the cause of the State was known also; and young Heywood, on presenting his
                  letters, found himself welcomed to the best society of the city. It was taken for
                  granted that a young Virginian of such lineage as his, would cast in his lot with
                  instant enthusiasm with the exultant and glorious movement for Southern
                  independence. But he can best tell his own experience in a sort of journal letter
                  which he kept for Judge Bacon, who leaned to the Southern views far more than did
                  any of Heywood's other friends, and who, therefore, was relied upon for advice
                  with more confidence than they would be whose identification with the North would
                  of necessity give one color to all their counsel.
               * * * "You can imagine the state of feeling here by nothing which you read or hear
                  in the North. It was the opinion of many in Massachusetts that much that was done
                  and said here was merely for political effect. I confess to have had the same
                  notion; but I have it no longer. These people are in terrible earnest. I do not
                  seem to myself to be in the same country or nation as when at the North. If every
                  man I met talked to me in a foreign language, he would hardly be more an alien.
                  Nowhere in the city or harbor, except at Fort Sumter, is the flag of the United States flying; everywhere it
                  is the Palmetto flag! The people are intensely exhilarated—there is no resisting
                  such a current. I am no more a secessionist than I was in Norwood; and yet, as
                  every one takes it for granted that I am heart and soul with him, I reproach
                  myself with my insincerity or moral cowardice. Every night, when I reflect on the
                  whirl and excitement of the day, I am ashamed that I do not show my colors. But
                  one must be brave indeed who would deliberately leap into the fire. It would be
                  scarcely less than this to avow sincere attachment to the Union. I have seen one
                  act of ferocity and heard of others which for the sake of the South I will not
                  repeat. But I am determined, at all hazards, to state to some of the leading
                  gentlemen my true convictions. * * * * *
               "Since I have made known to my father's friends my Unionism, if it were possible,
                  I am treated with more cordiality than ever. I am not only invited to social
                  gatherings and made much of, but my friends take me with them to their political
                  consultations. I am thus put in possession of the secret counsels of the leading
                  Southern men. I am in despair of the Union, in so far as South Carolina is
                  concerned. And the letters and messages from other States seem to give assurance
                  of cordial cooperation. My future looks dark to me. * * * *
               "I wish you could have been with me last night! I have had the inside view. I am
                  less sanguine of future union than ever. After much importunity, Major Anderson
                  has consented to send an officer to Washington, with a committee of citizens, to
                  induce the Government to withdraw its troops from the fort. Lieut. Hall is the
                  officer. But he says distinctly to the committee that he shall advise his
                  Government to maintain their possession of the fort. In hope of changing his view,
                  and of convincing him that there is no chance whatever of Union, and that
                  secession is a fact accomplished and ended, the managers here last night arranged
                  a meeting for conference, and as my case needed treatment also, I was brought
                  in.
               "Mr. — said, frankly, at the opening of the conference that he should speak
                  without disguise. It was something in this wise:
               "'The people of the North and South are essentially different. There is no hope of
                  their assimilation. Their climate, industries, political opinion, social customs,
                  cause, and will maintain these differences. It is useless to try and conduct a
                  Government together. Perpetual disagreement and jangling must follow. That the
                  leading thoughtful political men of South Carolina had long been satisfied of the
                  soundness of these views. That they were fully determined at all hazards to
                     separate from the North. It was not a sudden freak, but a matured
                  purpose. Was it not better then, instead of patching, or dosing a desperate case,
                  to yield to the inevitable? That no compromise was possible simply because there
                  were no special grievances which the South need complain of. That, to speak
                  frankly, their grievances had been urged merely as the method of holding their
                  people, but that the thinking men did not regard them as of any value. But the
                  real motive lay in the prospect of a future which could not be realized without
                  separation. To make new arrangements, to devise peace measures, concessions,
                  compromises, was to prescribe for the wrong disease. The South really had no
                  grievances whatever. That it had ambitions, and was determined to
                  realize them. Under these circumstances, and in view of these disclosures, was it
                  not wise for Lieut. Hall to join with the committee in saying to the Government at
                  Washington that the stay of troops in the harbor could serve no useful
                  purpose?'
               "I do not know what Lieut. Hall will do, but my eyes are open. Can it be that
                  these things are true beyond the bounds of South Carolina? I am sure that in my
                  own State it is not so. Virginia is true to the Union. But what if the flames that
                  are here kindled should spread? What if my own State should go with the seven
                  already seceded? Can I fight against my own State? Can I join my kindred and fight
                  against the Government? Can I remain neutral, and let this great issue be settled
                  by others, striking neither for the Union nor for my State?
               "March 25.—I have been making a tour of the batteries with Gen.
                  Beauregard. If I had ever thought that Sumter could long resist the bombardment
                  which threatens her, I should be disabused of such opinions after seeing what I
                  have to-day! Every point of land from which a battery can be made to bear on
                  Sumter has been seized. Great numbers of men are perfecting the works. Huge cannon
                  are lying under cover and waiting the completion of the works. In many batteries
                  cannon are already mounted. In Fort
                  Moultrie, the artillery destroyed by the garrison when they took possession of
                  Fort Sumter, has been replaced. Every thing is approaching completion. March is
                  wearing away; April is just at hand. Every effort has been made to induce Mr.
                  Lincoln to withdraw the garrison, and thus avoid a collision. But I am told that
                  he is obstinate, not to say deceitful. Again and again, he has either promised, or
                  left upon those who have visited him the impression that a promise was given; yet
                  the flag waves there defiance to the Confederate flags which fly from the
                  beleaguering forts and batteries.
               "As I stood upon the parapet of Fort Johnson this afternoon, the wind freshened
                  and rolled out the flag from over Fort Sumter with that peculiar motion which
                  gives one a feeling that there is life in the flag, and that it stretches out its
                  arms from some volition of its own. It lifted itself from its drooping position,
                  half disclosed its form, and then languidly relapsed again. Again, and with more
                  impetus it raised itself, rolling out heavily in a series of convolutions, as if
                  it felt an inward struggle or spasm. It drooped again. Then, though I felt no
                  quickening wind where I stood, it was plain that a current moved high in the air,
                  in which, with a certain calm force, it was lifted up and stretched out at full,
                  with all its stripes displayed, and so it held itself without recoil or droop.
               "I inwardly said, 'So it shall be. After some struggles the banner shall stand at
                  last, spread abroad in full glory!'
               "Beauregard, too, had watched the same scene. I know not what his thoughts were.
                  He seemed pensive. There is a singular combination in his expression. His face is
                  dull, his eyes fiery, so that his whole countenance is like ashes, with fire raked
                  up beneath it.
               "With some emphasis he said:
               "'It shall not fly there long.'
               "I asked him whether it did not pain him to do violence to the flag under which he
                  had been reared? He paused, as one does who analyzes his feelings before
                  speaking:
               "'In our fathers' day that was the flag of the Union. But it has been made
                  sectional by Northern fanaticism. It no longer suggests protection and friendship,
                  but injustice and aggression. We look upon it as it is, not as it was. And yet,
                  sir, if Major Anderson would evacuate the fort, and relieve this harbor of the
                  threat implied in his presence here, I should be saved a painful necessity.'
               "'Then you do not sympathize with those who wish to humble the North?'
               "'I sympathize with those who believe that a new empire is arising! I care nothing
                  for the North. Let them have their way. We mean to fulfil our destiny. All nature
                  has conspired to make this southern realm a grand empire. The climate is perfect.
                  It is garden on the pattern of a continent! We have an industry which will enrich
                  the world—but ourselves first and most. Ours is not a rude and clumsy slavery like
                  that of antiquity. It combines in it the patriarchal simplicity of the Hebrew and
                  the fine organization of the Roman. The negro not held in slavery spreads out like
                  a torpid swamp and poisons the land with laziness. We have forced him into
                  channels—converted him, as it were, into a river, with a regular current, turning
                  a thousand mills. Our people, relieved from drudgery, have leisure for refinement
                  and public administration. Here is to be a new era—an epoch in civilization. In a
                  hundred years the great schools of science and of painting, the colleges and
                  universities of America will be here! When I see that flag standing in the way of
                  all this glorious progress, and forbidding it, I would fire upon it if it were
                  thrice as glorious as it has been, but has ceased to be!'
               "I think he was sincere. He is an enthusiast. He has the air of a man who has
                  great self-confidence and is not unwilling to express it. On that account he is
                  fit to represent the South Carolinians. They are certainly eager, opinionative,
                  and prodigiously confident. I inquired:
               "'Will it be a difficult task to breach the fort, and likely to be attended with
                  much loss of life?'
               "He replied:
               "'We and they are well protected from artillery fire. Anderson is a good officer
                  and will not expose his men. If blood is spilt, it will be in storming after the
                  fort is breached.'
               "'Will raw troops be serviceable in so desperate an enterprise as assailing a
                  breach?'
               "'Sir, the Southerner is a natural soldier! His courage is such by nature, that it
                  is hardly a credit to him to be brave, any more than for a horse to be strong, or a hound
                  swift. The Northern man is dull, slow, peaceful. If ever, it will be years before
                  he learns to fight. The Southern soldier is quick, fiery, intense, overwhelming.
                  We shall sweep every thing before us!'
               "'Is there no way of avoiding actual conflict? Might not the fort be starved out?
                  I am told that the garrison are not permitted to draw provisions any longer from
                  Charleston.'
               "So far as I am concerned, I would defer operations, provided Anderson would state
                  the day when want of provisions would compel him to Surrender at any rate, if it
                  were a near day.'
               "'I am sure he would. He is an honorable and Christian gentleman. I would
                  cheerfully undertake the mission. I am a Southern man, but I am opposed utterly to
                  forcing this issue by arms.'
               "'This is beyond my province. You must get authority from Montgomery, or from Gov.
                  Pickens.'
               "Filled with this errand, I desired to hasten back to Charleston. The sun was
                  already low down in the west, and flamed across the harbor with wonderful beauty.
                  The channel guard boats were under way to their night-watch on the bar, that no
                  vessels might steal in for the relief of the fort. To the seaward, the harbor
                  opened out grandly. The atmosphere, the setting sun, the meeting of the harbor
                  with the ocean, gave a largeness to the scene which filled my heart with
                  admiration. As I was looking, the sun sank. Then Sumter fired a gun, and the flag
                  slowly and gracefully descended. In rapid succession, the flag over our head, that
                  of Fort Moultrie, of Castle Pinckney, and of every fort and battery around the
                  harbor, came silently down, and twilight seemed like a peacemaker! All the tokens
                  of defiance and war were wrapped in quick-coming darkness. The little steamer on
                  which we returned sped toward the city, whose outlines were lost in the dusk, but
                  painted again in the lights which shot out along either shore and from beyond the
                  White Point Garden. The few craft that lay off at anchor showed each a solitary
                  light. We saw them, shot past them, and left them behind, in the same moment. My
                  heart was happy in the strange hope that I might at least contribute in a small
                  degree to avert a collision.
               "Without delay I sought out Gov. Pickens and suggested the plan. He met me
                  cordially, but hesitated on hearing my errand. He spoke of consulting the
                  Government at Montgomery.
               "'But, sir, if South Carolina is sovereign enough to withdraw from the Union, and
                  to repel the soldiers of the Union from her stores, she is sovereign enough to
                  negotiate a peaceful evacuation of Fort Sumter.'
               "'Oh, there's authority enough. I would take it anyhow; but it may not be
                  expedient.'
               "'Expedient! I do not understand you.'
               "'Well to be plain, it may be necessary to come to blows for political
                  considerations. If all the Southern States would promptly move into line, we could
                  get along without bloodshed. But then we have but six or seven, out of fifteen,
                  that have acted. This sluggishness will ruin us. We can't afford to wait. If the
                  tide slacks and turns it will carry all our hopes out to sea with it, never to
                  return; but once let the Government at Washington fire one gun upon ship or man
                  and that flash will set on fire the whole South! Some of us are in favor of
                  bringing on the issue by striking; others by waiting till we are struck. By noon
                  tomorrow I shall know. Come then and I will see you. Meantime, our friends are in
                  the parlors to-night. The sons of Virginia are always welcome in Charleston!'
               "I plead fatigue, and hastened back to my lodgings, and have saved myself from
                  many unpleasant musings by writing this account to you.
               "The clouds are very dark. While I was in Norwood I thought them wind-clouds, of
                  threatening look and harmless contents. Now they are lurid with fire and portend
                  terrible disaster, if some happy expedient does not succeed in conveying the
                  electricity silently to the ground!
               "The whole city is feverish and inflammable. It seems to me that a spark would
                  explode the community. Moderation is unknown. It is dangerous not to burn and glow
                  with hatred of the Union. To resist secession would be fatal. I keep aloof from
                  all but a select few, and their prominent position, their very leadership in this
                  disruptive movement, gives me standing and character, which I maintain by holding
                  my peace, and so get the additional credit of being deep and cautious!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLII.
               BOMBARDMENT OF FORT SUMTER.—HEYWOOD'S LETTER CONTINUED.
               "April 10.—I am informed to-day, by Governor Pickens, that he has
                  word from the Government at Washington, that provisions are to be sent to Fort
                  Sumter at all hazards, and that he has communicated the same to his Government at
                  Montgomery. There is great excitement. I urged the plan already mentioned Anderson
                  cannot hold out many days. Starvation will give the fort into their hands full as
                  soon as artillery can. Unless bloodshed is needed for some political purpose, I
                  cannot imagine a reason for bombarding. Meanwhile the city swarms with troops
                  arriving with every train, while those hitherto camping here have been distributed
                  to the forts and batteries. Business is almost dead. It seems like a military
                  holiday. The current for secession and a Southern Republic rushes like a mighty
                  stream. Nothing can stay it, and nothing resist. It amounts, if not to a phrensy,
                  yet to an irresistible enthusiasm. Every one is exhilarated. The most extravagant
                  pictures are drawn of the future of this new empire. Last night I heard several of
                  the leading men and managers of affairs discussing the prospect. 'Bombard the
                  fort—commit the State irrevocably by shedding blood. The Government at Washington
                  cannot do less than to threaten coercion. The first step in that direction will
                  bring every cotton-growing State to our side. If the conflict begins, even the
                  border States must come to this side. Against such a front no war will ever be
                  made.' Turning to me, one of the gentlemen said: 'You shrink at the shedding of
                  blood. Is it not better, by the loss of a few lives, and the consolidation thereby
                  of fifteen States, to prevent war, than by temporizing to go at
                  length into a conflict which, though not doubtful in issue, will sacrifice
                  hundreds, and it may be thousands of lives? Even humanity would dictate decisive
                  measures.'
               "I replied: 'I think, gentlemen, that you mistake the whole feeling of the North.
                  If the flag is fired upon there will be war. If there is war, you must prepare
                  yourselves for a long and terrible one. The South will not yield easily. The North
                  will be even more tenacious.'
               "Some of the gentlemen were curious to know more of my opinion of the North, which
                  I gave. But the majority laughed to scorn the idea of Northern courage. What is
                  most singular is, that the men who most doubt Northern fighting qualities were
                  themselves from the North, or were born of Northern parents! One or two fiery
                  spirits declared, that with a thousand picked men, they could march from
                  Charleston to New York; that there were more in number in the North who would
                  greet them than would fight, and that in less than a year peace would be
                  established. The meeting broke up, and as we walked together, I again and with
                  warmth urged upon Governor Pickens to use his influence to prevent actual
                  hostilities. I know not why, with my sentiments plainly disclosed, I am treated
                  with so much confidence by gentlemen who are in the most secret councils of
                  secession. But so it is. He replied to my importunity:
               "'Heywood, I honor your fidelity to your convictions, and I do not wonder at your
                  opinions respecting the North. Yet, you are Southern, and you will be obliged to
                  join us. Events will prove stronger than men's wills.'
               "'But not, I trust, than men's principles.'
               "'All honest men agree in principles. It is the application of
                  principles that creates a difference of opinion upon public affairs. For instance:
                  You believe in justice, and so do I. But what is just? That is the
                  question between the North and South. We believe in humanity. But
                  which is the surest way of being humane? Sometimes forbearance will constitute
                  humanity. Sometimes aggression is more humane than peace. To fire upon Sumter will
                  prevent a civil war. You think not. It is not a difference of principles, but of
                  judgment. You believe that the happiness of the population will be consulted by
                  unity of national life. We believe that two nations are better than one. We agree
                  as to the principle, viz., the duty of seeking the happiness of the people. We
                  differ as to means only. I say that you are one of us. I mean that your sympathies
                  go with the land of your birth. Events are transpiring that will draw the lines,
                  and all men will have to choose sides. The time is close at hand. It will be
                  impossible for you, when you see that the rupture cannot be prevented, to take
                     sides against your father and
                  kindred, against your State, against all your companions, and against the South
                  and all its glorious future! Your honor and your affection will compel the right
                  course. And it is this certainty which induces me to confide in you.'
               "He then laid open to me the whole inside view, and I confess that my heart sank
                  within me, as he closed, and I felt a gloomy certainty that the nation was rent in
                  twain.'
               "'There are,' said he, 'among the active and influential men in the South three
                  classes. First, are the old politicians, who do not want secession, and threaten
                  it only to secure for the South certain further concessions which shall prolong
                  its political ascendency. They are dull and selfish men. They foresee nothing and
                  plan nothing except the possession of political power.
               "'Next is the great middle class, containing the active young men, and most of the
                  families of wealth throughout the South. They threaten secession, and even welcome
                  it, but with a distinct understanding among themselves that it is the shortest
                  road to a reconstructed Union. They all hold to the antiquated
                  superstition of a single Nation. When once the South is organized, and its
                  government recognized, then, they reason, will begin a process of disintegration
                  of the Northern Union, and of the absorption of its particles by the Southern
                  Union. One by one the Northwestern States will dissolve their connection with
                  their government, and come under our new Constitution. Pennsylvania will not be
                  long in following. New York will not consent to see her commerce pass to Baltimore
                  and Charleston. New England, which has been the firebrand of the continent, may
                  shoulder and go to ashes among her own rocks. We will have none of her. Her young
                  men will emigrate, marry and conform to the customs of the South. In fifty years
                  she will be as little heard of as Nova Scotia or Newfoundland.'
               "'The third class is the only one that has a clear and distinct plan and
                  principle. All the others are drifting and catching at accidents, and hoping for
                  lucky events. But we have a definite end in view. We mean to establish a Southern
                  Confederacy, confined if possible, to latitudes in which Slavery can profitably
                  exist. We shall resist the entrance of Free States. We don't want them. Free and
                  Slave States cannot live together. What is the use of a divorce, if one turns
                  right about and marries the shrew over again? No. We are for immediate separation;
                  for the establishment of a nation whose climate, industries, institutions, and
                  people are homogeneous. We want no war. If let alone we will be peaceful. When it
                  is settled that the South is permanently and forever a separate and independent
                  nation, there may spring up kind relations between it and the North.'
               "I inquired:
               "'How can you speak with such confidence of success when you admit that you are a
                  small minority, and that the two other classes constitute the wealth and the
                  influential men of the South?'
               "'Because, in a revolution, the men who stand still are powerless. Those men who
                  purpose energetic action suit the temper of such times. In peace,
                  conservatives—and, in revolution radicals—will always lead. Hardly one man in
                  Montgomery wanted secession. South Carolina forced them to it. This glorious State
                  is guided by a few men who know what they are aiming at, and who use therefore
                  every opportunity with advantage. All the rest are mere waiters upon time.'
               "'Do you mean that President Davis did not wish Secession?'
               "'He belonged to the second class of whom I spoke. He was opposed to secession. He
                  could have been bribed easily to maintain the Union.'
               "'Bribed?'
               "'Yes, with the offer of the Presidency of it. An ambitious, obstinate man, subtle
                  rather than strong. A wise manager of common affairs, but not large enough for
                  comprehensive and complex matters. He will do very well, however, to pilot us out
                  of the Union. He is proud and persistent, and will not easily be bamboozled.'
               "'How do you regard Stephens?'
               "'A sagacious man, without any belly.'
               "'What do you mean by that?'
               "'He is all brains. But he lacks force for action. He is a good lecturer, but a
                  poor leader. He has gone off with us just as a priest might be imagined to have
                  gone off with the ten tribes, hoping all the time to get back to Jerusalem. He
                  goes with us in hopes, by and by, to have influence to get us back into the Union.
                  That is like a cock-sparrow flying with a storm. Hoping to manage it.'
               
               "'Stephens certainly ranks high among the people.'
               "He ought to. He is honest, and a sagacious critic of historical events. He is
                  wise about things that have already happened. But he has no constructive wisdom.
                  He has neither the imagination, the courage, nor the—well—the fanaticism necessary
                  for founding new States.'
               "By this time we had reached St. Philip's church, and my companion entered a
                  modest burial-ground lying across the way from it. I hesitated at entering. 'Only
                  a few steps,' said he. We came to a grave, upon which stood, in altar-form, a
                  large white slab of marble. By the faint light of the moon, I saw out upon the
                  middle of it—nothing above and nothing beneath it,—alone, simple and large,—the
                  name 
                     CALHOUN!
                  
               
               "For a moment or two there was silence. At length my companion spoke:
               "'Had HE lived, we should have had a leader. He was our Prophet. He brought us to
                  the verge of the Promised Land, but was not himself suffered to go over. He died,
                  and no one is found worthy to bear his mantle! Being dead, he yet speaketh. From
                  this spot goes forth the influence which will found a new nation. Men will come
                  hither in later days upon pilgrimages as they have hitherto to Mount Vernon!'
               "'I have always deemed his ingenuity acute, but impracticable.'
               'Impracticable? Is the Bible an impracticable book because people are not wise
                  enough to practise its truths? All men of seed-thoughts are esteemed impracticable
                  in their own generation. Men want something which they can use
                  now—not something which will feed them by and by. They plant summer
                  crops, not orchards. The popular thinkers are millers and bakers, who grind wheat
                  and bake bread for immediate use.'
               "'Do you regard the present movement in the South as the result of Calhoun's
                  teaching?'
               "'There is not a man under fifty in South Carolina who has not been fashioned by
                  Calhoun's influence. Every Southern college has taught his writings. His views of
                  the sovereignty of the separate States in the Union are the lever by which we
                  shall pry the Union apart. A great man! and wiser than his times!'
               "'It has always seemed to me that he was the apostle of the Retrograde, not of the
                  Advance and your plans seem to me to be based on the philosophy of disintegration.
                  You may hold together for a time by external pressure; but there is no cohesion in
                  Calhoun's State; it is all centrifugal and explosive in its analyses and ultimate
                  tendencies.'
               "The clock in the church opposite struck twelve. I plead my health as a reason for
                  returning. On the way back, the Governor told me that, on the morrow, Sumter would
                  be formally summoned to surrender; that if any thing further were done toward
                  mediation, he would notify me."
               "April 11.—At two o'clock this afternoon, Gen. Beauregard formally
                  demanded the evacuation of Fort Sumter. 'All proper facilities will be afforded,'
                  so the summons ran, 'for the removal of yourself and command, together with
                  company arms and property, and all private property, to any port in the United
                  States which you may elect. The flag which you have upheld so long and with so
                  much fortitude under the most trying circumstances, may be saluted by you on
                  taking it down.' Major Anderson replied: 'My sense of honor and my obligations to
                  my Government prevent my compliance.' He stated incidentally that starvation would
                  soon compel evacuation. I caught at this sentence. It seemed a ray of light and
                  hope. I urged the General to communicate it to his Government. In due time came
                  from Secretary Walker, at Montgomery, the permission, 'We do not desire needlessly
                  to bombard Fort Sumter. If Major Anderson will state the time at which, as
                  indicated by him he will evacuate and agree that in the meantime he will not use
                  his guns against us unless ours should be used against Fort Sumter, you are
                     thus to avoid the effusion of blood. If this or its equivalent be
                  refused reduce the fort as your judgment decides to be most practicable.'
               "I was overjoyed at the response. At the Governor's request I was joined to the
                  gentlemen of Beauregard's staff who were that night to visit the fort. One thing I
                  could not understand. Beauregard expected to open fire before morning! Why should
                  that be? Was there some trick in this message?
               "So confident was I that peace would be preserved, that I inwardly triumphed over
                  the crowds in the streets of Charleston who, aware of the imminent bombardment
                  filled the public ways, as on a
                  holiday, gaily dressed, exuberant in spirits, as if the city were one vast
                  wedding-feast. They were crowding the East and South Battery streets, and the
                  Whitepoint garden, hoping to be spectators of a nation's funeral! The sun was gone
                  down. The reflected light quivered on the waters as if they were stained with
                  blood. I know not why my confident joy was tempered with forebodings. I inwardly
                  said, as I left the chattering crowd, 'Reap all the darkness which the night
                  brings; you shall see no flames to-night!' Yet my heart was heavy. I was
                  experiencing probably the reaction of long excitement. It was past midnight before
                  we set off in the boat, and it was after one o'clock when we reached the fort.
               "On approaching the postern we were challenged, but after a few minutes' delay,
                  permitted to land and enter the fort. The gentlemen of our party were Major Lace,
                  Col. Chism, Roger A. Pryor, Senator Chesnut, and myself.
               "The written message was delivered to Major Anderson:
               "'If you will state the time at which you will evacuate Fort Sumter, and agree
                  that in the meantime you will not use our guns against us, unless ours shall be
                  employed against Fort Sumter, we will abstain from opening fire upon you.'
               "Major Anderson was surrounded by his officers—all of them young men. He seemed
                  about fifty—his hair touched with gray; his stature about five feet eight; his
                  forehead square; his face intelligent, mild, but full of firmness.
               "The interior of the fort, about an acre large, was in much confusion. Unmounted
                  cannon lay upon the ground; material for various purposes was heaped up. It was
                  now the morning of the 12th—Friday. Major Anderson said that on Monday, the 15th,
                  three days hence, he should be obliged to evacuate the fort. He accordingly
                  committed to writing, and delivered to us the promise that, unless meanwhile he
                  should receive controlling instructions from his government, he would, on Monday
                  noon, at twelve o'clock, leave the fort.
               "The gentlemen of my party retired to a corner for consultation. I was overjoyed
                  at the happy termination of this dangerous matter. I congratulated Major Anderson
                  and his officers, and we all hoped that the storm was past, and that better
                  counsels would bring brighter days to the country.
               "After about fifteen minutes, the gentlemen who had been consulting returned, and
                  handed to Major Anderson a paper containing the following message:
               "'By authority of Brig.-Gen. Beauregard, commanding the Provisional Forces of the
                  Confederate States, we have the honor to notify you that he will open the fire of
                  his batteries on Fort Sumter one hour from this time.'
               "I was petrified. I scarcely believed my senses. My first impulse was that of
                  utter indignation at the men who, it was now plain, never meant or desired to
                  avert a conflict. Doubtless they had hoped that the time for evacuation would be
                  put so far off that there would be a decent pretext for refusing to wait.
               "They were caught in their own trap. Only three days were demanded. Every one knew
                  that at the best the fort could not be reduced in less than that time, and
                  possibly not for a week. But blood was wanted. It was necessary to arouse the
                  South.
               "I could not repress the exclamation, "This is shameful! I protest against it! I
                  was on the point of asking leave to remain in the fort, and to take part with its
                  garrison in defending its flag! But what could I do, untrained, and ignorant of
                  war, except to consume provisions already wasted to the minimum? With a heavy
                  heart, bitter and resentful, I turned away and left the postern. My indignation
                  kept me silent. We soon landed. It was already near morning. The east was
                  changing, and a faint twilight came stealing over the harbor, every moment growing
                  brighter. You have noticed that at no moment of the day has light such a virgin
                  effect as between twilight and sunrise. Everything has a freshness, an unworn and
                  pure look, as if it had just been created. I stood alone, for I would not go with
                  the gentlemen of his staff to report to Beauregard. A light film of mist lay along
                  the rim of the harbor; but within that silver setting the water lay dark and
                  palpitating. Out of its bosom rose Sumter—sheer up from the water which lapped its
                  very base on every side. How serene and secure the fort looked! How beautifully
                  the morning brightened around it though as yet the sun was far down below the
                  sea!
               "I was startled by the roar of a mortar a little behind me. Out of its white smoke
                  rose with graceful curve, a bomb that hurtled through the air and burst right
                  above the fort! 'Cursed be the hand
                  that fired that shot! May violence overtake the wretch, and a disgraceful death?'
                  I did not know that it was my own State that broke the peace! Edmund Ruffin it
                  was, an old man with white hair that hung down in profusion over his shoulders,
                  and was now flying wild, his eyes bright with an excitement either of fanaticism
                  or insanity.
               This single shot given, there was a dead pause for a moment or two. A flock of
                  wild ducks, startled from their feeding ground, flew splitting along the face of
                  the water, and were lost behind the fort. The peace was gone! This tranquil harbor
                  was changed to a volcano! Jetting forth from around its sides came tongues of
                  fire, wrapped in smoke, and the air was streaked with missiles converging from
                  every side and meeting at Sumter! Now that the circle was once on fire it flamed
                  incessantly. Gun followed gun—battery answered battery—and the earth fairly
                  trembled with the explosions. I was fascinated. I could not withdraw. I waited to
                  see the fort deliver its fire. It stood silent. Did the giant sleep?
               "As the sun flamed above the horizon and shot its light across the waters, up rose
                  the flag from the fort, gracefully climbing to its topmost height, and rolled out
                  its folds, as if it were sent up to look out over the troubled scene and command
                  peace! Still no gun from the fort replied. Two hours of bombarding, and not a shot
                  in return! But at seven in the morning, a roar from the lower tier of guns gave
                  notice that the fort had roused itself and joined in the affray. Its shot began to
                  fall around me. I retreated within the battery, and then, sick and heart-heavy, I
                  determined to make my way back to the city. My heart was with the seventy men
                  battling for the flag against five thousand.
               "The Confederate flag and the palmetto were flying together over the forts. My
                  soul spurned them! I felt that I was among enemies. The roar went on. As I drew
                  near the city, I began to hear the church bells ringing wild with joy! Crowds
                  everywhere lined the wharves, filled the streets, covered the roofs of the
                  hitherward houses. The people had been out all night! Many, discouraged at the
                  delay, had begun returning to their homes. But the first sound of a gun brought
                  them back with alacrity. One would think that the humbling of the national flag
                  was the most joyous occasion in the world! Worn out with excitement and want of
                  sleep, disgusted and indignant, I spurned all company, and would hide myself from
                  the sight of the people and the sounds of the heavy guns, which in succession, or
                  in salvos, filled the air with their dull, distant thunder. I sought my room, and
                  toward noon fell into a feverish sleep. The noise of the artillery still sounded
                  in my dreams, and, mixed in the phantasms of sleep, helped to disorder my
                  imagination. I dreamed that I was at Norwood, and conversing with Miss Rose, when
                  Doctor Wentworth entered, and his voice broke like a sound of thunder upon me, and
                  the dream, changing, led me now with Cathcart, and now with Wentworth, among
                  sand-batteries and forts. These dissolving views changed, and it was Miss Rose, or
                  Alice that was in distress—the house seemed crumbling and falling, part by part,
                  with terrible crash, and I—utterly unable to stir! I started up from such
                  disturbed visions. All the afternoon the same continuous firing filled every part
                  of the city with its sound. Volumes of black smoke rolled up from the fort. It was
                  on fire! Its guns fired but infrequently. Every time the smoke rolled away I
                  looked anxiously through the glass to see if the flag still waved. The sun went
                  down upon it! All night, but at intervals of fifteen minutes, the bombardment went
                  on. People who had expected to reduce the fort in a few hours seemed discouraged
                  at this protracted defence.
               "The morning came, and with its first full light the forts that lay in a circle
                  round the fort, opened in order, Johnson on the south, Cummings' Point on the
                  east, Moultrie on the north, and the floating battery on the west, together with
                  the smaller intermediate batteries. As far as I could discern the walls of Sumter
                  had suffered little. No breach appeared. The barbette guns were knocked away. But
                  though they were the heaviest, they had never been used. The besiegers aimed to
                  sweep them with such a fire that the men could not work them. Again the smoke
                  rolled up from the fort, and flames could now be seen. Moultrie poured a
                  continuous stream of red-hot shot upon the devoted fort. At last came noon. The
                  firing ceased. Boats were putting off to the fort. By one o'clock it was noised
                  abroad that the garrison had surrendered! It was true. On Sunday noon, they were
                  to salute the flag and evacuate the fort.
               "If the week days were jubilant, how shall I describe the Sabbath bath? The churches were thronged with excited
                  citizens. In many of these all restraint was thrown off, and the thanksgiving and
                  rejoicing for the victory swept every thing like summer winds. I went to my own
                  church, the Episcopal. The decorum of the service, which is a bulwark against
                  irreverent excitements, served, on this occasion, a good purpose. Yet, strange as
                  it may seem, in the lessons for the day occurred a passage that sounded in my ears
                  like a prophecy, and full of warning and doom. It was this: 'Prepare war, wake up
                  the mighty men; let them come up. Beat your ploughshares into swords, and your
                  pruning hooks into spears; let the weak say, I am strong. Multitudes, multitudes
                  in the valley of decision; for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of
                  decision.'
               "As I came from church, a south wind blew, and I heard the sound of cannon. I
                  walked rapidly to the point, and only in time to see through my glass the flag
                  descending from over Sumter! The drama is ended!—or rather opened! Who can tell
                  what shall be the end of this? It may be that all the roar and battle of the two
                  days past is as nothing to that which at some future day shall precede the raising
                  again of this flag over this fallen fortress. The future is in the hand of
                  God!
               "To-morrow I shall bid farewell to these unhappy scenes. I go to Richmond, and
                  thence home. Shall I ever see Norwood again? I know not why my spirits sink so
                  low. I am full of forebodings. Probably weakness and fatigue are reasons enough.
                  But over the future hangs a dark cloud which I would that I might pierce and know
                  what it hides! Should I never see old friends again, I would not willingly be
                  forgotten of them—for I can never forget. And so, farewell.
               
                  TOM HEYWOOD."
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XLIII.
               THE AROUSING.
               THE March winds had blown themselves out. Rainy April had set in. Over all New
                  England, the signs of the new season were thickening. Maple-sap was flowing
                  freely, and the woods and maple orchards were filled with sounds of industry.
               The dull gray of the uppermost twigs in chestnut woods was turning to a ruddy
                  brown. The peach-blossom buds were swelling fast. The willows already shook their
                  tassels in the wind. The air, the earth, the round heaven and every creature
                  beneath it seemed to rejoice in the breaking of winter. Cattle rubbed themselves
                  against fences to free the old coat and give place to the new. The herds owned the
                  fervid impulses of love. The dairy woman cries, "See how yellow the butter is
                  to-day!" "Yes," says the herdsman, "the cows have been down in the moist pasture
                  and found early grass."
               The oxen are yoked and the plough is set going. Blackbirds follow the furrow and
                  pick for fat grubs. The red-winged starling from the swamp sounds its medley—a
                  cross between a cackle and a whistle. No more ice! no more snow! Cold winds yet
                  contend for the mastery, and new-dropped lambs shiver, and frisking calves cuddle
                  in sheltered spots from its rough breath.
               But ah! the south is propitious! The sun is ascending from the south, and bringing
                  with him all treasures. Look! do you not see those low-lying clouds in the south
                  glorious and ruddy? They are harvests which the sun is driving forward—red apples,
                  purple grapes, yellow corn, and wheat. Full of gifts is thy bosom, O south! Listen
                  to the sounds which every wind wafts from the south. It is the bluebird in the
                  orchard, just come from its southern home. Robins have come thence. The South
                  sends sweet songs of birds, and smell of flowers, and the silver haze of showers,
                  every drop of which is like a planted seed. O gorgeous south! whose days are
                  summer round the whole year, to thee fly our birds in autumn; and thence again,
                  tuned and refledged, they come to us in
                  spring! From thee come new life and joy. Peace be on thee, mother of all good! and
                  far from thy fields be harm and sorrow—thou that art full of blessings!
               On the morning of April 12th, there came from the south other gifts. Not sunlight,
                  or the flight of birds, or the flowers of spring; but a lurid cloud, sounding and
                  dreadful, proclaiming to the nation that war had come!
               When the telegraph shot the news of the bombardment of Fort Summer through every
                  State, men held their breath. They could scarcely understand. Like those suddenly
                  overtaken by immeasurable grief, they stood silent, listening, waiting for
                  something to say,—"It is a dream! it is not true! As the day wore on, a sharp
                  curiosity tensely held every mind. How fares the conflict? Will the fort sustain
                  itself and silence the beleaguering guns? For an impression had crept through the
                  public mind that the fort was invincible. We were all children then, and knew
                  nothing of that school in which since the nation has had millions of scholars!
               On Saturday, came contradictory tidings. Rumor was busy. The reality of war was
                  eating slowly into men's consciousness. None had believed it. Such unnatural
                  violence can be possible only to the insane! Was ever nation happier? Was ever
                  prosperity so continuous and its fruits in material wealth so wonderful?
               If war begins, the South is too shrewd to begin it. She has ruled the land for
                  fifty years, and if as wise as the English aristocracy, she will bend for the
                  moment to the political gale which may not be resisted, but making peace with
                  circumstances, she will seize again the helm and guide the ship!
               No one believed war possible. So long had peace brooded that it seemed a destiny.
                  We were used to fiery conflicts of politics, and threats, and predictions of
                  disaster and ruin. In the eyes of a vanquished party the country is always ruined.
                  Intense excitements were characteristic of our national life. But free speech had
                  always proved a safety-valve to men's passions. Men waxed hot, raged and
                  denounced; then, as after a thunder storm, every one went on his way in a clearer
                  sky and purer air!
               Though it had year by year been threatened; though the treats grew sterner as the
                  election of Mr. Lincoln approached; though the act of secession was accomplished,
                  and seven States threw off their allegiance to the Government; though South
                  Carolina day and night was girding Fort Sumter with batteries, and gangs of
                  slaves, by the thousand were heaping up the sands of the shore into vast
                  fortifications, and the lighthouses had been darkened the buoys of Southern
                  harbors removed, judges had resigned, forts had been seized, and sworn public
                  officer after officer had proved treacherous, yet the innate hopefulness of the
                  people and the security bred by long peace, prevailed. Men would not believe that
                  there could be war!
               On Sunday morning, the 14th of April, it was known that Sumter had surrendered.
                  The scales fell from men's eyes!
               THERE WAS WAR!
               The flag of the Nation had been pierced by men who had been taught their fatal
                  skill under its protection! The nation's pride, its love, its honor suffered with
                  that flag, and with it trailed in humiliation!
               Without concert, or council, the whole people rose suddenly with one indignation
                  to vindicate the Nation's honor. It came as night comes, or the morning-broad as a
                  hemisphere. It rose as the tides raise the whole ocean along the whole continent
                  drawn upward by the whole heavens!
               The frivolous became solemn; the wild grew stern; the young felt an instant
                  manhood.
               It was the strangest Sunday that ever dawned on Norwood since the colonial days
                  when, by reason of hostile Indians, the fathers repaired to church with their
                  muskets! All the region round about came forth. Never had such an audience
                  gathered in that house. Every face had in it a new life. Dr. Buell was not wont to
                  introduce into his Sabbath services topics allied to politics, nor did he mean to
                  change his habit to-day.
               His sermon, weighty, and on themes which usually are accounted more solemn than
                  all others, yet sounded light and empty in men's ears. Nor had he ever preached
                  with so much difficulty. He lost the connection hurried passages which should have
                  been deliberate, and afterwards owned that he was never so glad to get through a
                  sermon.
               It was in the prayer following that the stream burst forth. A mighty tide rose
                  within him, and he poured out his soul for the country. He prayed for the Government, for the men
                  in Fort Sumter, who had been like the three children in the fiery furnace, for the
                  flag, and for all in authority that they might have wisdom and courage to
                  vindicate it!
               The house was still—so still that the ear ached between every pause. The word Amen
                  set loose an army of handkerchiefs, and people wiped more eyes than were ever wet
                  at once in that house. Just as Dr. Buell rose to give out the closing hymn, he saw
                  the choir rising as if to give an anthem. The minister sat down; but he quickly
                  rose up again, and every man in the house, as the choir sang the Star
                     Spangled Banner. Such a scene had never been known in sober Norwood!
                  And when the last strain died, it was with difficulty that the minister could
                  repress an open cheer.
               "Why didn't you let 'em?" said Deacon Marble. "It's enough to make the stones cry
                  out. I never felt so sorry before that I hadn't a house full of boys."
               Aunt Polly for once found nothing to rebuke in the Deacon. "This is the Lord's
                  work. Sunday isn't a bit too good to teach men that they ought'er save the
                  country! My grandfather dug the sile out from under this church to git saltpetre,
                  to make powder on, to fight for our liberties! And I guess the old man's bones
                  that's lyin' yonder shook when they heard them cannon jar! Now's the time for
                  folks to show themselves."
               The whole population seemed to be in the street! Men formed groups and discussed
                  the one only topic. Party lines were fast rubbing out. There was an afternoon
                  service, but it was like a dream. As yet, men's feelings had found no channels,
                  and no relief in action. A few discordant notes there were. Tough old Hunt, farmer
                  up in "Hardscrabble," as a poor neighborhood was called, in spite of angry eyes
                  and frowning brows would have his say:—"I allus told you that the Abolitionists
                  would bring blood on us. Now I hope they're satisfied. They've been teasin' and
                  worryin' the South for twenty years, and now the South has turned and gored 'em.
                  Served 'em right!"
               "I tell ye, old leather-skin," said Hiram Beers, "you'd better shut up! The boys
                  ain't in a temper to hear such talk. You'll git hurt afore you git through a
                  hundred speeches like that!"
               Old Hunt was a small wiry man, about sixty years of age, with black hair, and a
                  turbid hazel eye, that looked cruel when he was wrathful. Hiram's words set him
                  aflame.
               "Where's the man that's goin' to stop my tongue? This is a free country, I guess!
                  I shall say what I've a mind to—"
               Just then, Hiram, who saw that trouble was brewing, changed the attack from the
                  old man to his horse, who was as fiery and obstinate as his master, and already
                  had exhausted his patience and fodder in a long Sunday under the horse-shed. While
                  the old man was standing in his wagon bristling all over like a black and tan
                  terrier, and fierce for opposition, Hiram gave his horse a keen cut under his
                  belly, where a horse least likes to be hit. The first thing Hunt knew he was
                  sprawling in his wagon, and the horse was heading for home with a speed unbecoming
                  a Sabbath-day. The old man, nimble and plucky, gathered himself up, utterly at a
                  loss which he was most angry with, the public or the horse,—now giving the animal
                  a rousing pull, and then shaking his left fist back at the crowd he disappeared
                  from the Green in a medley of utterances, which, addressed sometimes to his horse
                  and sometimes to Hiram, and sometimes to the imaginary Abolitionists, formed a
                  grotesque oration.
               "Oh, you won't stop, will ye?—(a jerk)—You d—d Abolitionists—(turning back his
                  head)—Come down, ye beast!—(to his horse)—free country! everybody do as he
                  chooses! Can't stop me, tell ye—why don't you stop—hold up! No! I won't bold my
                  jaw, for none of ye! I'll break your jaw if you don't stop, ye de—
                  beast—Abolitionists—tell ye—!" and with that he was gone.
               "I'm as much of a democrat as he is," said Hiram, "and I've allus gone with my
                  party. But I tell ye boys, this is no party matter. This is a black business, and
                  there ain't but one way to settle it. We've tried the votes, and they won't stand
                  that. Now we'll try the bullets, and the side that can stand that longest is goin'
                  to rule this country, that's all."
               Old Mr. Turfmould ventured to say, without meaning any harm—merely as a moral
                  reflection—"Ah, Mr. Beers, it's awful killin' folks, and huddlin' 'em into holes
                  without funerals and decent fixins of any kind."
               "Shet up, you blasted old owl!" said Hiram. "This thing's goin' to be fought out,
                  that's sartain, and we won't have nobody hangin' back at home. A man that won't fight when his flag's fired on, ain't
                  worth a dead nit."
               Old Deacon Trowbridge was talking with Judge Bacon, to whom he usually deferred
                  with profound respect for his legal learning.
               "I hope," said Judge Bacon, with calm and gentle tones, "that the Government will
                  forbear and not be in haste to strike again. We ought not to think of coercion.
                  Our Southern brethren will come to their reason, if we are patient, and wait for
                  their passions to subside."
               "I tell ye, Judge, we ain't goin' to wait. We've waited long enough, and this is
                  what we've got for it! Secede! rob the Government! shoot our flag! and kill our
                  soldiers, shut up in the fort, like chickens in a coop, and then not fight? You
                  might as well have a Day of Judgment, and nobody hurt. If we aint goin' to fight
                  now, we'd better swap clothes with the women and let them try awhile.
                  I tell ye we will fight!"
               Deacon Trowbridge was like a green hickory fire on a winter's morning. It requires
                  the utmost skill and blowing to get it to burn, but when once it is started, it
                  blazes and crackles with immense heat, and speedily drives all those who were
                  cuddling and shivering about it, far back into the room.
               On he went, indignant at the Judge, and talking to every one he met. "It's come!
                  Ye can't help it. I don't want to help it! It's the Lord's will and
                  I'm desperate willin'. If my boys—some on 'em—don't go, I'll disown 'em. Don't
                  want no cowards on my farm!"
               Home with Dr. Wentworth walked Dr. Buell. He had lately grown even more intimate
                  than during the years before. He was a lone man, subject to those depressions
                  which follow severe study. Such moods in him were relieved by the gentle stimulus
                  of family life. He was so simple and sincere in manners that every one in the
                  house felt it a pleasure to serve him. He thus gathered the fruits of a wise
                  household without either the care or responsibility of maintaining its
                  organization.
               Agate Bissell who was housekeeper, teacher, nurse and companion, doing the work of
                  live ordinary persons, with yet much time and energy to spare, met the doctor and
                  minister at the door. She looked eagerly, but silently, upon them with hungry
                  eyes, as if she besought some word of sympathy. The conversation went on. Instead
                  of giving it in broken fragments, we condense the remarks of Dr. Wentworth, as if
                  it were one speech.
               "It must come! the argument is ended! My judgment has long told me that a conflict
                  of arms must grow out of such radical conflict of principles. But my feelings of
                  hopefulness constantly set aside my political logic, and like others, I did not
                  expect bloodshed. For thirty years, it is now apparent, that the two great halves
                  of this nation were deepening into radically antagonistic convictions—not about
                  politics, in its common sense, but upon the whole question of humanity which
                  underlies and finally controls states, churches, philosophy, and religion itself.
                  The only hope was in localizing these influences and keeping them apart. That
                  could have been done had there not been a central government, which both parts
                  strove to a appropriate and control. We now see that the Federal Government had
                  little power to control and much to divide the nation. That will always be the
                  weak place in our nation. The prodigious power which is generated in wide-lying
                  States absolutely independent and sovereign except in a few arbitrary and
                  artificial arrangements, cannot be controlled by the Federal Government, except by
                  such an increase of its power as would prove fatal to local liberty.
               "Whenever a considerable number of contiguous States shall be united by common
                  interests and passions, in resisting the party that controls the Federal
                  Government, we shall be in danger of rebellion.
               "It is slavery to-day. The next time it may be a commercial influence. But
                  whatever it is, it must be some unifying influence which, like slavery, has
                  educated the community to diverse, strange, and national customs, morals,
                  political principles, and civic feelings, that can secretly organize such a body
                  of States together as to frame a formidable rebellion. Because men now are seeking
                  to pluck the unripe fruit of separation and new nationality, it does not follow
                  that in coming times the ripe fruit may not drop of itself, without opposition,
                  and be gathered up cheerfully and willingly. States will badly be allowed to draw
                  off because they differ. That will make them enemies. But if they are
                  agreed, and divide in some future day simply because the vast bulk of such an
                  Empire of States is too great to be conveniently grouped in one Federal Government, there might be
                  less resistance. Now the tendency is setting toward unity. That may
                  expand itself. The next tide may be to variety. But who can tell? National life
                  allows no prophet to unveil it.
               "Probably if you and I were in the South, we should join with it. This conflict is
                  but opening. It looks now as if all the Southern States must be swept into the
                  movement. The State feeling is stronger than the National. A crushing defeat might
                  destroy the movement; but a Southern victory will sweep the whole South like a
                  flame. In that case all the best men will join it. We should not expect too much
                  from human, nature. Our friend Heywood is honorable, and will resist disunion; but
                  when he sees it accomplished, he will go with his State, and probably join the
                  Southern army."
               Alice Cathcart was one of those whose stillness both in speech and motion was so
                  great that her very presence seemed swallowed up in the personality of others. She
                  sat by the doctor's wife, as if she were only the shadow which Mrs. Wentworth
                  cast. The conversation had reached the doctor's remark about the young Virginian,
                  when suddenly, and with passionate vehemence, she exclaimed:
               "Never! He will never betray his country! It is a shame to slander one who cannot
                  answer for himself!"
               Had a piece of artillery gone off in the room it would hardly have startled the
                  company more than such a speech from the gentle, silent Alice! The doctor smiled
                  and would have replied, but Alice disappeared. Mrs. Wentworth found her in a flood
                  of tears, and folded the dear child to her bosom, without words, comforting her by
                  the sympathy of a loving embrace.
               The sun had gone down. Every household in Norwood and wide about was a scene of
                  excitement. That night prayer was a reality! Never before had the children heard
                  from their fathers' lips such supplications for the country. Never before had the
                  children's hearts been open to join so fervently in prayer themselves. Men seemed
                  to be conscious that they were helpless in the presence of an immeasurable danger!
                  By Faith they laid their hearts upon the bosom of God, till they felt the beatings
                  of that great Heart whose courses give life and law to the Universe!
            
            
               CHAPTER XLIV.
               ECHOES FROM THE NORTH.
               "WHEREAS, The laws of the United States have been for some time past, and now are,
                  opposed, and the execution thereof obstructed in the States of South Carolina,
                  Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, by combinations too
                  powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by
                  the powers vested in the Marshals by law; now, therefore, I, ABRAHAM LINCOLN,
                  President of the United States, in virtue of the power in me, vested by the
                  Constitution and the laws, have thought fit to call forth, and do hereby call
                  forth, the militia of the several States of the Union, to the aggregate number of
                  75,000, in order to suppress said combinations, and to cause the laws to be duly
                  executed."
               This was the answer of the people, speaking by their Government, to the acts of
                  secession, and to the assault upon the nation's flag and fortress at Fort Sumter.
                  Dry words they seem, formal and stately. But there was fire in them to kindle a
                  flame such that all the world paused, as if a continent were on fire!
               Our noblest sentiments, when assailed, never deliberate. A wise man foreseasons
                  his honor, love, purity, patriotism, with reason. When touched with harm they
                  burst forth into action as instantaneously as powder touched with fire into flame!
                  When the flag was abased, the nation shuddered. No one had suspected how deep in
                  the heart of the people was the sentiment of patriotism. For two generations men
                  had been buying and selling, making and distributing, until the dust and shavings
                  of the manufactory seemed to have covered down all heroic sentiments. Long peace
                  and exceeding prosperity had shaped popular politics into a greedy game of policy,
                  and great principles, no longer debated or tolerated, sat in the capitol, like
                  decrepit old men crooning of the golden days of old.
               The lowering of the nation's flag before the guns of South Carolina pierced the pride and honor of the North
                  to the quick. The outburst was universal and unpremeditated. The morning and
                  evening of a single day saw peace utterly laid aside, and twenty millions of
                  people filled with the spirit of war. Men would not tolerate argument, and
                  trampled upon mercenary considerations. Before men had seemed swallowed up in
                  material interests, and dead to heroic sentiments. The trumpet sounded the
                  resurrection, and in an instant they came forth into a life of heroic sentiment,
                  and, placing honor, duty and patriotism high above all sordid interests, they
                  offered up to their country their ease, their wealth, and life itself! Passions
                  there were, but they were auxiliaries of the moral sentiments, lending to them
                  force and fire. For a people's war—a free, intelligent, religious people—is not
                  bred either of a greedy avarice, nor of royal pride and ambition. It was a war for
                  the Commonwealth, nay, more refined yet, a war, unparalleled in magnitude and
                  cost, waged for the Principles on which alone commonwealths can
                  stand! It was kindled not by the young, but by the old and sage as well. It was
                  fed not by the ignorant and violent, but by women, scholars, Christians. The
                  recruiting ground was not in low and dark corners, among the ignorant and roving,
                  nor chiefly among laboring men but preeminently in academies and colleges, in
                  Sabbath schools and churches. No one held himself aloof. There was a generous
                  competition who should go, and men strove for a place in military companies as at
                  other times for honor and wealth. The whole community were moved to the core by
                  the power of the unseen. It was an enthusiasm for an abstract sentiment, for an
                  invisible quality of patriotism—for law, for liberty, for government. This was a
                  sublime spectacle, of the spirit of government rising up in the very sources of
                  all government!
               The same scenes were at the same time occurring in the Southern States. Even more
                  fiery was the outbreak, because the people were of more demonstrative natures.
                  Pity it is that admiration for the uprising of millions of men to found a new
                  State should be stripped of its sublimity by the debasing conceptions of the new
                  civilization which blinded its leaders! Yet our moral disapprobation of the secret
                  and potential causes which were at work need not withhold from the common people
                  the credit of the most earnest sincerity, witnessed by offering up all that man
                  holds dear for the cause which they had been misled to believe was the cause of
                  liberty and of honor!
               And thus it came to pass that thirty millions of men, divided into two bands, went
                  seeking each other through the darkness and mystery of war. Neither party
                  considered or cared to ponder what was before it. Like two warriors standing on
                  the opposite banks of a swollen stream, they went down in the darkness of the
                  night to find and grapple with each other in the turbulent and dangerous ford!
               Toward both parties came travelling great sorrows and disasters. But looking full
                  at the future, neither of them saw aught of that which it contained.
               Already was descending, as in the apocalyptic vision, the mountain of fire which
                  was cast into the sea of blood and no man heard its rush, or knew its dread
                  disasters, until all over the land fire and blood were cast up like a storm spray
                  driven in from the ocean!
               Are men less sensitive than metal? Shall barometers foretell whirlwinds, give
                  alarm of tornadoes half a continent distant, and yet shall a whole hemisphere of
                  storms move in upon society, and no man feel the chill of the shadow which they
                  cast forward? Right before the nation were clouds dripping blood, and full of
                  wasting fire. None saw. Right before them were heaped-up corpses, armies of the
                  dead, suffering, fear, famine and pestilence, but men heeded them not!
               Neither, any more, did they see the new heavens and the new earth that followed
                  the convulsions of the old, a nobler liberty, a purer justice a better friendship,
                  a more lasting brotherhood!
               Fort Sumter was evacuated April 14; the President's proclamation came Monday, the
                  15th; and before sundown of that night, Barton Cathcart's company were on the
                  green, ready to leave on the cars that night. This promptitude was the more
                  remarkable because at least one half of its numbers lived out of the village, and
                  several of them some miles distant. Arthur Wentworth, now twenty years old,
                  fortunately was at home from college, and promptly joined his company.
               There is no one scene which so stirs a country town as the departure from it of
                  the first companies for war. Mothers, sisters, and lovers look upon the men with
                  yearning admiration; and the
                  imagination heightens the sense of mysterious danger into which they are going.
                  But on this day parents were scarcely less eager to send, than were their sons to
                  go. The city of Washington—the capital was threatened!
               'Biah Cathcart came to town, with his wife Rachel. He was calm and stern. She was
                  singularly exalted. Her soul said:
               "What am I that the Lord should permit me to send my son to the defence of his
                  Government? Great are his mercies, O my soul."
               Miss Wentworth was absent from home. She had gone from Boston down to Maine,
                  before the tidings of war broke over the country. Immediately she started for
                  home. But, so promptly had Barton moved that he had been in Boston several days
                  before Rose reached Norwood. But Barton, in the whirl of preparation, had found
                  time to write a few lines to Rose:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "April 15, 1861.
                           
                           "To-day I leave for the field upon a sudden summons. My whole soul
                              consents. I was never more cheerful. But a single shadow lies upon me.
                              At last, let me speak plainly, Rose. I am sad at leaving you, whom I
                              love more than father and mother, or all beside. This will surprise
                              you, but it is no sudden experience. It has been the secret of my
                              life. From my boyhood I have cherished it; whether with more of pain
                              than of cheer I cannot tell. The hunger of the heart in a proud nature
                              sensitive and silent, is hard to bear. And yet I would not have been
                              without this love. It has made so much of my life that if it were
                              taken out scarce any thing would remain worth keeping. It has inspired
                              and cheered it has chidden and restrained. In the fire of this love,
                              whose flame I might not show, every feeling of my life has been
                              tempered.
                           "Only within the year have I been in circumstances to justify me in an
                              honorable solicitation. But a shadow fell upon me. Another came before
                              me. Pardon me. I would not speak of it, but I may never return and for
                              our childhood friendship's sake you will indulge me in the sad
                              pleasure at last of speaking out my heart.
                           "If only I knew that your interest was with another, all struggle
                              would cease. Your happiness would shed some faint joy on my
                              disappointment. I know not whether, even if you were free, you could
                              love me. Have I said too much? It is as nothing to the unsaid. The
                              silence of my heart through years now yearns for an expression. Only
                              let me hear one word from you; if not in Boston then at Washington. I
                              pray you do not send me to the war without a word to say that you are
                              not offended—to say more would be a joy too great to hope! But let me
                              not go in the chill of utter silence.
                           
                              BARTON."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               This letter he hastily did up, and, being obliged to employ other hands, for a
                  hundred errands, he entrusted this to faithful Pete, with instructions to convey
                  it promptly to Dr. Wentworth's and place it in the hands of Dr. Wentworth or of
                  his wife.
               Pete had been on hand all day, executing Barton's orders with remarkable alacrity.
                  It is doubtful whether he knew what all the excitement was about. He had gone
                  post-haste to Riddell's to serve a notice on a member of the company. He had
                  ridden two miles in another direction as only Pete could ride on a like errand. He
                  had been out to Bidwell's and to Carrington's, and to Eaton's, and crossing
                  through the woods, and past the red school-house, he had come down by Marsh's, and
                  Morris', warning one man at each place.
               "What is it, Pete?" said grandma Carrington.
               "You're wanted," said he with a half guzzling laugh. "Captain Cathcart wants Tom
                  right off, with all his regimentals. They're going to-night."
               "Tom is out ploughin'. Here, Roxy! Roxy! Where's that child? When you don't want
                  her, she's right under your feet, and when you do want her you couldn't catch her
                  with a fine tooth comb. I'll go myself. My father was out in Seventy-six, find my
                  boys have got his blood, I guess.
               The old woman was past seventy—white-haired, wrinkled, sharp and nimble. Away she
                  went over fence and field, saying to Pete:
               "You go 'long; the boy'll be there afore you are."
               At Eaton's they were all at home and in the enthusiasm of the moment Pete was
                  offered a little rum. Now Pete had never joined any temperance society, and could
                  not therefore break a pledge. Looking for a second at the glass, as one recognizes
                  a long-absent friend, his lips parted, and the rum disappeared as a drop of water
                  sinks into parched ground.
               
               Thence Pete betook himself, now inwardly comforted, around the Owl Swamp, over on
                  to the turnpike to Belden's; but Belden's son Will had gone into town, partly on
                  an errand, and partly for news so that he would get his warning in Norwood. The
                  old man was one of the hard cases in New England—foul-mouthed, ugly, and regularly
                  soaked with liquor. Yet his head was so solid that he seldom lost his keen
                  judgment in a bargain, or his management of property. His wife was an earnest
                  Christian woman, with the face of a sufferer. Her home was a purgatory. But five
                  children were reared there in virtue and honor, every one abhorring strong drink.
                  The eldest was sergeant in Barton's company. Old Belden liked nothing better than
                  to "season a man," as he called it.
               Poor Pete had lingering about him a bewitching memory of his last glass, and the
                  sight of the decanter put him into a radiant mood. A large glass was poured off,
                  the old man applauding and swearing horribly. But Pete's instinct of obedience was
                  proof against further persuasion. He knew that Barton had ordered him to report to
                  him again in the quickest possible time, and so in spite of the sparkling of the
                  liquor which old Belden held up before his face, and shook it till it foamed, he
                  departed. It was full time.
               On way back he thought of ever so many funny things, and saw ever so many queer
                  sights. At an rate at every other step he sizzled out a laugh.
               At any other time Barton would have perceived Pete's condition; but now amid the
                  excitement which pervaded the town, he scarcely noticed his exhilaration.
               He gave him the letter to Miss Rose, with particular direction not to lose it, and
                  to hand it that night to Dr. Wentworth. One or two other papers, also, Pete was
                  charged to deliver, all of which were duly placed in Pete's hat; where, also were
                  stowed his red cotton handkerchief, two or three snarls of different sized
                  strings, a paper of fish-hooks, and a bit of newspaper over all. Every moment was
                  precious if Pete was to fulfil his errands.
               His senses were fast retiring into obscurity; yet he had retained the impulse to
                  go to Dr. Wentworth's after he had lost all idea of the reason for going. The
                  Doctor was called after tea into the kitchen to see Pete, who at once, giggling
                  and shuffling, made a faint attempt to give him from his hat a paper.
               The doctor read:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "At the last moment, I have got me a few things, as you suggested, at
                              Wadsworth's. Please settle the bill.
                           
                              BARTON."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "What's all this? This must be for Barton's father. I'll give it to him to-morrow.
                  Mrs. Good, you had better let Pete lie down in the out-room."
               What became of Barton's letter to Rose was never certainly known. Pete was up
                  before daylight the next morning, trying to get some water; and then he kindled
                  the kitchen fire, using the scraps of paper in his hat to set it off with. But
                  certain it is that Rose never received it, and wondered and grieved that Barton
                  should again have left town abruptly without a word of farewell.
               For the second day after his departure, came Rose home. Her brother was gone, and
                  she had passed within a few squares of him in Boston, not dreaming that he was in
                  the city.
               "Mother, did Barton call to say good-bye?"
               "He was too busy. We all went out to see him off, and shook hands with him at the
                  cars. I never saw him so radiant. He stood evidently the first man among men in
                  that hour. And his military dress was wonderfully becoming. Really I quite fell in
                  love with him."
               Rose was silent for a time, and then, with enforced naturalness, asked:
               "Did you say that Barton left any word for me?"
               "Nothing that I heard of. There was only half a day to summon his company, and get
                  them away. Our Arthur was in great spirits. He looked like a rose among those
                  tan-faced country-boys. You know that his complexion is beautiful, and his
                  chestnut hair curled out from under his military cap most becomingly!"
               Rose sat silent, buried in thought. Early she plead the fatigue of journeying and
                  retired. It was but masked somnolence. Sleep sometimes courts you till you yield,
                  and then coquettishly flies. So it was with Rose.
               There are many kinds of wakefulness. If trouble be real, if danger be apparent,
                  wakefulness may have a useful end. One may while away the whole night in processes
                  of investigation. All distractions are gone. Neither light nor noise lay any tax
                  upon the senses. They rest. All the vital force is concentrated in the thinking part, and, in the darkness
                  especially following early sleep, and just preceding the morning, the mind easily
                  penetrates things obscure, and disentangles things perplexed, and unrolls things
                  most involved.
               There may be a sleeplessness of pleasurable excitement. And sometimes this is an
                  exquisite pleasure. One has something to learn of luxury who has never lain awake
                  with joy. One then seems to float peacefully in an atmosphere of bliss. Pure,
                  continuous delight flows from every nerve, and from every faculty.
               But there is an excitement of half-born feelings, of evanescent fancies where
                  thoughts but begin, and vanish where feelings start without developing into
                  definite forms, where the whole mind is played over by the checkered light and
                  shade of things illusory and imaginative; when, as it were out of the air the
                  spectres of coming emotions cast pale shadows upon the sensitive brain, which
                  vanish when you would inspect them, and return the moment you cease to analyze
                  them. How welcome is the cool morning after such a night of spirit watching! How
                  good and pleasant is it to come again to things that may be touched, to the dew,
                  to the things it lies upon, to the song of birds and to the companionship of
                  friends! Such as this last excitement filled Rose's night and glad was her
                  morning.
            
            
               CHAPTER XLV.
               FIRST-FRUITS.
               THE most striking trait in camp life to Barton was the facility shown by his men
                  in adapting themselves to entirely new circumstances. It was a complete revolution
                  in their method of life. Many of his men were accustomed to all the refinements of
                  wealth, and all of them had been reared in abundance. There were fifteen graduates
                  of colleges, and five under-graduates. There were, besides several students of
                  medicine and law and five men who were in commercial business. The others were
                  intelligent mechanics, machinists, factory men, young men from the farm, and from
                  that large and peculiar class, in New England, who may be called bargain-makers—men who, without a regular business, are energetic and
                  enterprising in a thousand money-making ways, now dealing in cattle, or buying up
                  in autumn whatever line of produce promises to advance in market; in short, the
                  movable merchants, the cavalry of trade. With one accord they fell into the
                  proprieties of their now life, and in a few days, like a well-made machine, every
                  thing began to move smoothly. By the last of the week the regiment to which they
                  belonged was dispatched to Washington. Young Arthur Wentworth had been elected
                  second lieutenant. He was one of the rare cases in which a robust virility exists
                  in connection with an almost feminine beauty and delicacy of organization. His
                  curling hair was of a rich chestnut color, his completion almost of dazzling
                  whiteness, with a cheek suffused with carmine, blue eyes, features that did not
                  wait for after-life to give them expression, but which from youth were shapely and
                  exquisite. So much beauty is indeed a misfortune in a man who has not a manly
                  force to lift it clear above effeminacy. That force Arthur Wentworth had. None was
                  quicker of foot in all robust games. He had practiced athletic exercises and
                  excelled all his fellows. He could run faster, jump farther, climb with more
                  agility than the best. He was a leader on the base-ball ground—loud and merry in
                  his outcry, intense and impetuous at
                  foot-ball. He lacked something of strength at wrestling, but made it up in deft
                  agility. He was the pride of his class, and so pure and noble in his loving
                  nature, that neither envy nor jealousy, as yet, had been shown by any. All the
                  signs pointed him out as a poet. All the signs, too, pointed him out as an artist.
                  But not less did he promise to become an orator. Fate made him a soldier. To
                  Barton he was dear for doubled reasons—for his own sake and for another's. In the
                  company and regiment he became a universal favorite from his modest fidelity and
                  thoroughness in duty, and for the rare social gifts which he displayed in the
                  social life of the camp.
               To his sister Rose, some months later he wrote:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "WASHINGTON, July 14, 1861.
                           
                           "Ah, Rose, you should be a soldier! or if that is forbidden, come as a
                              fairy vivandière, or even as a
                              fairy, and hover about us, and be to us as the light that flashes upon
                              our cold steel—a flame of beauty around the instruments of death.
                              Camp-life, the more, the drill, is a perpetual dream. I wake into a
                              surprise of pleasure each morning. My enjoyment reminds me of Parson
                              Buell's favorite expression in prayer, 'Thy mercies are new every
                              morning and fresh every moment!' Our Captain Cathcart is a wonder!
                              There was a Barton Cathcart, you will recollect! Do not imagine that
                              your Barton Cathcart and our Captain Cathcart are the same. No more to
                              be compared are they than the seed is to the blossom! Our Cathcart is
                              your Barton developed! He drills the regiment, and, as Harris has gone
                              home, it is feared, to die, Cathcart is to be major. His commission is
                              looked for daily. All the officers come to him on military questions.
                              His reading, really, has been extraordinary. He is always letting out
                              something that no one dreamed was in him. He works at his men all day,
                              and at his books all night. I go to sleep, and he is studying. I wake
                              and lie is still at his books and maps. I infer, therefore, that he
                              never sleeps, and that is the opinion of the camp. 'Yet he is never
                              flagged out, but affable, obliging, and the very life of
                              good-fellowship. His care for me is beyond words. Though he is
                              rigorous toward me more than toward any other officer, yet I feel that
                              there is a tenderness in his, strictness which is very touching. By
                              the way, Barton's advancement will be lack for several of us. I go up
                              a step, and am to be first-lieutenant. That's very well for a
                              beginning. But I'll come home a general! Prepare the ceremonies for my
                              return! I read Major Cathcart your last letter. It was so full of
                              home-news that I knew it would please him. When I finished, he said,
                              'Is that all?' and his voice was so altered that I looked up and saw
                              that he was unwell. He left for the air, and that night did not study
                              at all, but was out most of the night.
                           "'I tell you, Major,' said I, 'by virtue of my authority as a doctor's
                              son, that you shall not tax yourself as you do. You are making
                              yourself sick.'
                           "'In a few days we shall move, and then we shall all have out-door
                              exercise enough, and too much, or I am mistaken.'
                           "'What do you mean? You don't doubt that we shall whip the rebels
                              off-hand. If you do, you are about the only man in camp that thinks
                              so.'
                           "'It will be all luck if we do. Our men are green. The army is no
                              army. They ought to be reduced, for two months more, by the most
                              rigorous discipline. We may win—or lose. The chances are even.
                              Enthusiasm is good to raise men upon, but discipline is the only thing
                              to fight on.'
                           "'But it is the same with the rebels—they are as green as we are.'
                           "'Yes, that is true; and therefore I say that there is no calculation
                              possible. Every thing is contingent. They may fight or run away—who
                              knows? We may stand up well, or a panic may seize our raw troops.'
                           "'Why don't you say so to McDowell?'
                           "'There is no need. He already has exhausted his influence to prevent
                              precipitation. But there is such a clamor for an advance that we shall
                              have to go. Politicians, and editors, and red-faced patriots have it
                              all their own way, and old military men are the only men without
                              controlling influence in this camp.'
                           "'But I have a presentiment of victory; and I told Barton so. He
                              laughed, and looked proudly at me, and said:
                           "'Men with chestnut hair, blue eyes, and sanguine temperament are apt
                              to have hopeful presentiments.'
                           "The signs of a movement increase. I shall write again as soon as it
                              is over.
                           
                              ARTHUR."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
               On the 21st of July was fought the battle of Bull Run,—a most victorious defeat.
                  It ended all over-confidence in the North. It inspired the South with such
                  vain-glorious confidence that it failed, for a year or more, to put forth that
                  power which it had, and then it was too late, It ended all lingering ideas of
                  peace. It ended all further notions of a union party in the South; for, after that
                  battle, those in the South who had held aloof, hoping a peaceful settlement, were
                  swept by the current, and obliged to accept the new government as existing
                     de facto, whatever opinions they yet
                  cherished of it de jure. It cast the most
                  profound gloom upon the loyal States—a night of shame and sorrow. But out of that
                  night there arose a morning of Purpose such as had not dawned before! There was to
                  be a long and thorough war, and preparation must be broad and thorough. The whole
                  after fruit of this defeat upon the North was bitter to the palate, but wholesome
                  to the people and salutary to the Government.
               The battle had begun auspiciously in the morning. McDowell's right wing, crossing
                  Bull Run at Sudley Spring, unperceived and unresisted, had swept down upon the
                  Confederate left, and after various conflicts had driven them step by step back
                  across Young's Branch, across the Warrenton turnpike, and were assailing the
                  centre upon the heights where Beauregard had concentrated his reserves and was
                  making a last stand. But then, between three and four o'clock, one standing at a
                  little distance might have seen the beginnings of one of the most terrible
                  spectacles in war—an army in a panic! For, at this time came in upon the Union
                  right and rear Johnston's forces, just arrived from the Shenandoah Valley. Wearied
                  by long conflict spent with heat, famished and parched, the raw Northern troops
                  gave way, as the leaves of a forest scatter when October winds, on wet days, drive
                  through the forests. At every moment the confusion increased. Men already broken
                  up in organization streamed tumultuously back toward Bull Run. The contagion
                  spread. Fright grew wild. Men rushed over each other, across all obstacles,
                  stumbling, leaping, with wildest terror; muskets were thrown away—knapsacks had
                  long ago been cast aside—and thousands were madly crowding toward the stone
                  bridge. Others sought the ford, and still others, waiting neither for bridge or
                  ford, splashed into the stream to swim across. In vain did a few fragments,
                  cohering, essay to stop the wild flight. They availed nothing, and were themselves
                  entangled and swept away. A handful of regulars evinced the power of discipline,
                  and, without attempting the hopeless task of holding back the rout, sought only to
                  check pursuit until the fugitives could cross the stream. Once across Bull Run,
                  there was hope of some safety. No; confusion grew to a more desperate uproar as
                  the tangled masses receded from the battle field. A few cannon shot thrown across
                  from the Confederate batteries had fallen among the wagons, and the whole corps of
                  teamsters caught the mad infection. They turned and rushed away, many abandoning
                  all at once. Some cut their traces and rode off upon the team horses. Many got
                  their wagons about; but, tangled in the crowd of fugitives, the uproar growing
                  louder and the flight becoming more desperate, wagon locked with wagon, the road
                  became jammed; other wagons coming on, upset the wagons on the road-side, but only
                  to clear a way for a repetition of like scenes. Crowds of citizens, Members of
                  Congress, women and children had come out as to a festive scene, and were caught
                  in the crowd, and went roaring on in the desperate struggle of fright.
               The regiment to which Barton belonged had done good service, and had suffered
                  severely. Many of his own company had fallen. But his men were conspicuous for
                  steadiness. By two o'clock the colonel and lieutenant-colonel had been wounded and
                  the command devolved upon Major Cathcart. When the rout began, he was able to hold
                  his men, and with incredible efforts, to form a sort of rear guard. But his
                  already diminished regiment melted fast. His own Norwood company were firm. But
                  they were only a handful, and the first determined onset of the pursuing enemy
                  scattered them. Then it was that Barton, untired, aroused and glowing, sought no
                  longer how to stay his men, but only how to promote their escape. In all the
                  battle, he had scarcely lost sight of Arthur Wentworth, and now he was convoying
                  him as best he might toward the bridge. Suddenly from his right there swept around
                  a detachment of Confederates that poured their fire upon the spot where Barton
                  stood, and with loud yells rushing in upon them separated Barton from his men, and
                  swept him away a prisoner.
               A shot struck Arthur in the neck. He plunged forward. Sergeant Belden, and two
                  others of his townsmen, caught him and
                  drew him aside, and by singular address, after exceeding exertions, conveyed him,
                  across the street. At Centerville Arthur was placed in an ambulance, and lay as if
                  asleep. Through that sweet moonlight his few men travelled all night—the heavens
                  so pure and calm, the earth so noisy and ramping—and reached Washington in the
                  gray of the morning. Arthur called for no water. He seemed unconscious of pain. He
                     was unconscious, and never suffered more! And so, as a bird flies
                  up out of a storm-shaken forest and seeks more peaceful places, his spirit had
                  lifted itself higher than battle and above its stroke or sound!
               Will Belden it was that said, "Arthur, do you suffer much?" and hearing no answer,
                  he laid his hand upon him as to awake one asleep.
               He touched his face and drew back in awe and silence!
               No blood had issued from his wound, near the base of the brain, and his face was
                  not ghastly, but seemed, in the early twilight as the face of one who sleeps and
                  dreams pleasantly, so sweet was the expression that had spread over it.
               That day the telegraph sped the tidings to Norwood. The message-boy handed the
                  despatch to Agate, saying, as he delivered it—"Arthur is dead."
               Agate stood motionless, without voice, white as alabaster. Hearing the voices,
                  Mrs. Wentworth had come into the hall, and an eager way said:
               "What is it, Agate? Speak!"
               "Arthur—is—dead!" said Agate, slowly—solemnly—sternly.
               Mrs. Wentworth sat down upon a bench and looked at Agate imploringly, as if she
                  had suffered wrong at her hands, and could not understand why.
               "Dead?—dead, Agate? Who's dead?"
               "Arthur Wentworth is dead!"
               "Arthur—Wentworth—dead? How is he dead? Tell me, Agate,—what do you mean? Why did
                  he die? Dead? dead? did you say?"
               Agate caught her falling, fainting form, and summoning help, bore her to her room.
                  Then Agate, unshaken as if her heart had no pang, with a head as clear as if no
                  tidings had rolled darkness over the family, made every arrangement for the
                  household. She ordered for the children what their daily needs required; she had
                  made every arrangement for Dr. Wentworth to go to Washington long before he came
                  in to tea; she ministered to the darkened room; and all quietly, never mistaking,
                  or confusedly giving an order twice but in the stillness of severe
                  self-possession.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLVI.
               CONSOLATION.
               IT was the morning of Sunday, July 28, 1861. Even for that month the morning was
                  singularly glorious. The wind set from the north-west when it breathed at all, and
                  brought the fresh savor of thunder-storms which had played solemn music through
                  the night.
               The air was cool. Its moisture gave to the light a peculiar and palpitating
                  tenderness. Old Holyoke looked over upon Norwood with unwonted beauty, and the
                  jagged peaks that rose eastward, bathed in that flame which never consumes, seemed
                  this morning almost human in their sympathy. So thought Dr. Wentworth, who before
                  sunrise walked with God in his garden. Look far around! On every side the earth
                  glows with marvellous beauty. The Lord is in his Holy Temple, he
                  said, in low tones, to himself. He could not well add, Let all the
                  Earth keep silence; for, out of every tree and bush, from the orchard, from the
                  tops of the elms, from the meadows and fields there went up such an ecstasy of
                  bird songs that it was hardly possible to distinguish the separate songs, each
                  bird, as it were, eagerly casting his notes into a medley chorus of sweet sounds,
                  tangled together and jarring against each other in a pleasing dissonance.
               Dr. Wentworth was intensely calm. It was the calmness of every faculty, keenly
                  alive but in equipoise. The effort of self-restraint had imparted a slight trace
                  of sternness, but it was a mere enamel upon tenderness. He walked quietly from one
                  part to another, sometimes looking upon flowers, and then, while he was yet
                  looking, he would fall into a reverie. He stooped and plucked a handful of leaves
                  and blossoms saying, in a half-whisper and in broken sentences, as if reciting in
                  part, and thinking the rest, "He comet forth as a flower and is cut down: he fleet
                  also a shadow and continued not;" and then, pausing, he added aloud with
                  inexpressible sadness. The eye of him that hath seen him shall see him no more. As
                  the cloud is consumed and vanisheth isheth away, so he that goeth down to the
                  grave shall come up no more, neither shall his place know him any more."
               He laid down the flowers of which his hand was over full, and forgetting them in a
                  moment he began plucking others murmuring, as if to the shrubs, "He hath set
                  darkness in my path, He bath stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my
                  head and my hope bath he removed like a tree."
               He laid down a fresh clump of gathered flowers, and in a gentle, aimless way,
                  straightened out some of the spray and tangled vine work, as if he were putting
                  little children to bed, meanwhile, hardly above his breath reciting:
               "O, the hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldst thou
                  be as a stranger in the land? Why shouldst thou be as a man astonished, as a
                  mighty man that cannot save? Yet thou, O Lord, art in the midst of us, and we are
                  called by thy name. Leave us not!"
               His thoughts had reached their saddest when he broke forth into that most utterly
                  hopeless of all utterances of old: "Are not my days few? cease then, and let me
                  alone, that I may take comfort a little before I go whence I shall not return, to
                  the land of darkness and the shadow of death; a land of darkness, as darkness
                  itself, and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as
                  darkness!" From the gloom of these words his soul after a little seemed to
                  rebound, and clear itself, and his thoughts forsook the inexpressible sadness of
                  the olden day, of which the Old Testament is so full and wailing, and, without
                  uttering them, he repeated in his mind that passage in Hebrews that is like a
                  sunrise: "But ye are come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the living God, the
                  heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,"—and the rest.
               He walked on, seemingly forgetful of his flowers, and looking forth and upward
                  upon the wide arch above full of morning sunlight, he leaned against the
                  summer-house door, long looking up:
               "Therefore they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his
                  temple, and He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall
                  hunger no more, neither thirst any more, neither shall the sun light upon them,
                  nor any heat. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them,
                     and lead them unto living fountains
                  of waters; and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
               As he stood half chanting in a low voice these words, Rose approached him, but
                  stood silent. After a little, she quietly moved past her father and came into the
                  summer-house from the other side. The sight of Rose seemed to open in her father's
                  soul a flood of tender memories. He trembled, and all at once giving over
                  restraint, "he lifted up his voice and wept." There is something terrible in the
                  uncontrolled weeping of a strong man! Rose was appalled. She had never seen her
                  father weep—she had never seen him lose his self-possession.
               When he first learned the fatal tidings of Arthur's death, he only said: "I gave
                  him to the Lord, and He has taken him."
               All the way to Washington, and during the night and day of his ride homeward
                  conveying the beautiful sleeper he had, though silent and deeply thoughtful, shed
                  no tears. But this tension could not last. He was again at home. The Sabbath had
                  come. The boy was lying in the house, his sword wreathed in green oak leaves upon
                  his coffin. The singular charm of the morning, the train of thought in which his
                  mind had run, all had led him to that point where it needed but some touch to
                  bring tears. So a shrub, gathering dew through the night, carries all its leaves
                  edged with drops, losing none, until some gentle wind shakes it, and then all at
                  once rains down a shower from every branch.
               It was while her father was gone to Washington that Rose had tasted the dregs of
                  the cup of grief. But, after a night of suffering and conflict, she came forth
                  strengthened, and from that moment she walked as one who sees the Invisible, in
                  the presence of whom all the earth, is as a shadow, and its noises as silence, and
                  its sorrows, like the sighs of childhood, soon hushed in sleep and forgetfulness!
                  She had formed her purposes, and from that hour without a moment's wavering she
                  devoted her whole soul to her now calling.
               She waited calmly by her father, tears freely falling down her cheeks, but only in
                  sympathy. The tumult and paroxysm of his grief soon passed, and her father,
                  relieved by this long-needed outburst, came after a little to a peace not to be
                  disturbed. Father and daughter communed together of the dead. He spoke of his
                  hopes, his ambition, his joy and affection for his oldest-born son.
               "If he could have been spared to render something more of service to the cause, I
                  could have more willingly yielded him. But to be cut off so early, his powers not
                  put to proof, with so little fruit ripened, and in the hour of defeat—"
               "Father," said Rose, "there is other work to be done in this great hour of God's
                  coming besides that which is done in the field. It has been shown me that
                  thousands are to mourn; the first-born of many families are to be slain. Only sons
                  are to be taken away. Every household in this land is to be pierced. God is
                  beginning at his own house and among those he loves. It is fit that you who have
                  stood foremost in this community should lead, and in this great day of suffering
                  set the example of sacrifice and consecration. What is there worth living for, and
                  even more worth dying for, if it be not our own country?"
               "My daughter, you speak eagerly, enthusiastically. You are excited by what you
                  have passed through."
               "I was excited; but, father, I am calm now, and I shall be to the end—"
               Then hesitating, as if uncertain whether to go on, she said, at length:
               "Father, while you were gone after Arthur, and mother was overwhelmed in such
                  distress, and my own heart seemed giving way, I thought that I could not bear up
                  and sustain myself. For two days, the darkness was dreadful. At length, I could
                  struggle no more. I had slept none for two nights. Mother was sleeping by means of
                  opiates. I went to my room. My thoughts turned to the Saviour. His sufferings for
                  men seemed to rise to my mind. I implored His help. I read the scenes in Bethany,
                  where Lazarus was sick; while the Saviour, though knowing it, delayed to come; and
                  the sisters' anguish at their brother's death! When I came to their reproach,
                  'Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died!' T felt as if I were
                  myself speaking. Then there came to me a sense of the tenderness of Jesus toward
                  them, of His deep sorrow and sympathy with them such as I had not before ever
                  perceived. In this mood I was struck with His declaration, that all this suffering
                  was permitted for the sake of spiritual good, which they did not understand, nor
                  He explain. In some way, that very not explaining seemed to convey to my mind a
                  sense of the wonderful nature of spiritual life which lay so far above human
                     experience or language, that the
                  Saviour made no effort whatever to expound it. My heart yielded. I rested on
                  Christ as a little child."
               Rose paused for a moment and then resumed:
               "Father, what I am going to say you will understand better than I. I do not
                  pretend that it was real. But it produced an impression upon my soul which has not
                  changed. Nor do I desire to shake it off."
               "What was it, Rose? Tell me all."
               "I lay down upon the bed and was asleep. How long I had been asleep I cannot tell.
                  I heard Arthur calling to me, 'Rose! Rose!' I opened my eyes—Arthur was there,
                  though I saw nothing of him but, as it were, the print of his face in the air. As
                  I looked, the room disappeared, and I seemed to be in the air. Before me I saw
                  unfolded in the sky lurid clouds connected and rising in a procession one above
                  another, and each cloud was made up of battling men, and of a mixed multitude of
                  wounded and dying, and each successive cloud advancing, grew larger than the
                  other. I saw flashes of lightning run through them, but heard no sound, though I
                  listened."
               Rose paused again, and looked at her father. Had she seen the slightest smile of
                  incredulity, she would have said no more; but Dr. Wentworth was deeply intent.
               "My daughter, go on. If there is more, let me hear the whole."
               "I saw myself, and you, and others. We moved up and down, relieving the wounded
                  and suffering. Thus far I had not noticed any thing but these lurid clouds, which
                  formed, as it were, steps one above the other. But presently I was moved to look
                  beyond, and I saw what was to the cloud what the second rainbow is to the primary.
                  It was an answering picture, or, as it seemed to my thought, a spiritual
                  translation of the meaning of the cloud scene. I cannot describe it. There was
                  rest, and friendliness, and peace, and gladness, and purity, and joy,—how shall, I
                  say?—there were no figures to my senses, and yet my spirit discerned these
                  representations as clearly as my senses did the other. As I looked, Arthur came
                  again, and all around us there seemed to be an ineffable peace, and his love
                  seemed to fill the air all about us with rosy light, as if it had been a radiancy
                  of some burning lamp. I was inexpressibly happy, and Arthur was about to tell me
                  something thing, saying, in a significant way, 'Rose! Rose!'—when Agate stood by
                  my bedside, and the morning was advanced and my vision was all gone. Now, I know
                  what you will say, father, and I do not doubt that I dreamed; but what I think
                  remarkable is, that whole feeling is changed. I have not had a ripple of trouble
                  since. There is to be great trouble in the land—battles and multitudes of slain
                  and wounded. I am to devote myself to this service, and care for the sick and
                  wounded. I am no longer agitated. I know what that peace is which passes all
                  understanding."
               They were here summoned to breakfast, and all the family seemed to have felt that
                  morning that the Sabbath sun had arisen upon them with healing in its wings.
               "Shall I wind the clock to-day?" asked Agate Bissell of the doctor.
               "No Agate, not to-day. Both ceased to keep time together. Let them stand silent
                  for another day."
               It seems that for the first and only time in her life, on that Sabbath day on
                  which the battle of Bull Run was fought, the great black clock in the wall had
                  been forgotten and had run down. Agate, whose last duty on Saturday night before
                  going to bed was to wind up the clock, had for some unaccountable reason neglected
                  it. The clock, however, had a little time stored up in it for such occasions, and
                  kept on through the night. It was still at its duty in the morning of Sunday for
                  Agate remembered looking, at it and hurrying up the children for Sunday-school. It
                  was some time after noon that its courage began to fail. The ticks had lost their
                  plump sound and grew faint. The right hand swing could hardly be heard, though the
                  left hand was yet decisive. Then it missed the right hand tick altogether, and
                  then the left and then in silent vibration the pendulum, with diminishing arc,
                  swung on for a moment, and halted. On returning from afternoon service it was
                  discovered. But the doctor said:
               "Do not wind it. To-morrow we will have it examined."
               Afterward Agate superstitiously believed that it stopped with the speeding of that
                  ball which struck Arthur. And Doctor Wentworth would not, on this funeral day,
                  allow it to be set agoing.
               "Let it be for to-day. They ceased to keep time together. Let both be silent
                  together."
               
               With this day ended all struggle. It was the day of life from the dead. It was the
                  Lord's day,—pledge of resurrection and immortality. Bent down and obscured by the
                  physical shock and aspects of death, father and mother had at first spoken of
                  their child as dead, as early lost. But now came brighter and brighter every hour
                  the certainty of his living. Their thoughts went upward, along that very path by
                  which the ascending Saviour moved; and their faith sought the child among the ever
                  living and the forever joyful, where sorrow and sighing has passed away!
               And when the day was ended, and the thousands who had thronged Norwood to follow
                  this young martyr to the grave had dispersed, and the sun was gone down, and
                  twilight softened the landscape, no one unaccustomed to Christian faith could have
                  believed that the happy household which gathered that night, calm, tender,
                  cheerful, had that day parted from the form of one so loved as was this early
                  victim of war.
               "Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when
                  the doors were shut, * * came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them,
                  Peace be unto you."
            
            
               CHAPTER XLVII.
               AFTER-FRUITS.
               HAD an entire stranger entered Dr. Wentworth's family he would scarcely have
                  suspected that a great sorrow had befallen it. He might remark a tenderness
                  manifested by one toward another, unusual even in the circle of affectionate
                  people. The voice of singing was there, but the music flowed deep, carrying few
                  bubbles upon its surface. Even mirth re-asserted its wholesome sway, but it was
                  manifested more by the dewy freshness given to conversation than by a positive
                  efflorescence of its own. In this case, happily, sorrow worked upon the moral
                  sentiments and developed a serene and high joy! There was no drug in it deadening
                  to the sensibility. All of life had become richer by what it had lost. The heavens
                  seemed nearer. The lightest duties and most trivial offices of daily life seemed
                  colored with celestial hues. When Death is interpreted it means Life. Its ministry
                  is to enrich life, not to rob it. It takes away the flesh, but pours back along
                  the way upon which the departing spirit went a flood of light and influence which
                  heightens the colors and doubles the value of all that remains behind. The worth
                  of common things depends upon the sentiments which we have twined around them.
                  Sorrows are gardeners; they plant flowers along waste places, and teach vines to
                  cover barren heaps. The common duties of life, unblessed, are but as fences of
                  stone, or timber; but blessed with sorrow, each stake carries its twining
                  morning-glory, and mosses picture the stones, and glowing ampelopsis tufts the
                  walls with its autumnal red.
               Rose and her mother were conferring in whispers.
               "Ask him," said Mrs. Wentworth.
               "Father, what is your feeling about—about—our going into mourning?"
               A grave smile barely tinged the doctor's face as he replied, lifting his face from
                  the book which he read:
               "It is proper, my daughter, that we should mourn when we are afflicted."
               
               "Father!—You know I did not mean that. Shall we put on the customary mourning
                  clothes?"
               "If it is indispensable to your comfort. Do not do it to please me—unless you
                  follow the Scriptural example."
               "What example is there, father?" said Rose.
               "Read in the twentieth chapter of John," replied the doctor, "and about the middle
                  of the chapter;—let me see—there it is—the eleventh and twelfth."
               Rose read aloud—"But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept
                  she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre—"
               "Yes," interrupted her father, "that is too often our way in grief—we stoop down
                  and we 'look into the sepulchre.' Except by a miracle they that look into the
                  grave for their dead will find darkness, and gloom, and decay. But I interrupted
                  you—the part that I meant is yet to come."
               Rose resumed—"And saw two angels in white sitting, the one at the head and the
                  other at the feet where the body of Jesus had lain—"
               "Old Francia, before Raphael's day," said Dr. Wentworth, "in a noble Pietà, which
                  is now in the National Gallery in London, represents an angel at the head of
                  Christ, with the expression of hope, as one who was looking forward
                  into the future, while the other angel at the feet wears the sorrowful look of one
                  who remembers the past. The idea is very beautiful. Since I first saw
                  it I have always interpreted this passage in John's gospel in the same way. Two
                  angels, Hope and Memory, but both in shining white, sat in Christ's sepulchre. The
                  angel of sorrow wore white as much as his fellow. Demonic sorrow should wear
                  black; but Christian faith shows us angels yet hovering at the grave's mouth. Our
                  Arthur is not sleeping there. He is awake, and in Heaven. Why should I wear black
                  for him? His life was Christian and beautiful. He died as a pure offering to Duty
                  and Patriotism—why should I wear black? I thank God for giving me that child. His
                  life was a prolonged mercy to me. I thank God that he has so taken him from me
                  that he is more present than ever, present in every thing, and everywhere, pure,
                  sainted, most beautiful.—Why should I put on black?"
               "I think," said Mrs. Wentworth, "that one is shielded by mourning costume from
                  careless inquiries, and from unfeeling intrusion of people."
               "No doubt," said her husband, "in a few instances this may be true. But the
                  advantage at best is slight. Well-meaning blunderers are not to be cured so
                  easily."
               "But I think, my dear," replied Mrs. Wentworth, "that it is congenial to one's
                  feelings, in a great sorrow to avoid bright colors and to be clothed in darker
                  ones."
               "That is a matter of education. In so far as high colors have come to signify
                  gayety and pleasure, there may be a good reason for dismissing them. If one would
                  mark one's grief, why not by the color chosen by the Bible to express spiritual
                  things? White signifies purity, triumph, spiritual gladness, and this ought not to
                  be uncongenial to the moods of Christian grief."
               "And yet, in the public mind," said his daughter, "there is a seeming want of
                  respect to the memory of the departed, if we make no difference in our ways."
               "It is not the custom of our people to symbolize their feeling by a change of
                  dress, with this solitary exception. If a man becomes bankrupt, or has his house
                  burned down, or loses heavily in commercial operations, or has a son in disgrace,
                  or a child misled by evil company, or any other experience of grief, he does not
                  change his garb. The one solitary and exceptional case is bereavement! But there
                  is in domestic sorrow a delicacy, or ought to be, which should shrink from an
                  ostentatiousness such as mourning apparel cannot fail to have. No one has a right
                  so to express his sorrows as to intrude them upon every eye wherever he goes.
                  Custom has long justified it; otherwise, it would be esteemed an indelicacy for
                  one to be a walking advertisement of one's own private griefs. But, even if one
                  were permitted to announce this one side of domestic experience by change of garb,
                  the question still remains, whether expression should be given to the weakness of
                  natural feeling, or the triumph of Christian faith? Whether we should symbolize
                  the darkness of the grave as unenlightened nature shows it or the grave made
                  luminous by the triumph of our Saviour and the glories of immortality beyond it?
                  We may be sure there is something wrong, in a Christian community where death is
                  surrounded with associations of terror, where the young are reared to a horror of
                  the sepulchre, where present grief
                  rises up like a dark cloud and shuts out the heaven, where—in sermon, services,
                  conversation, and dress—every thing conspires to shroud death and the grave with
                  darkness. Has sorrow a right to be selfish? May it bear false witness against
                  immortality? Has a Christian under bereavement a right to declare by his conduct,
                  'There is no light in the grave, none beyond it, and no comfort for the bereaved
                  but only black, black, black sorrow!' I never met one muffled in black from head
                  to foot without a certain horror. The smell of crape is to me like the smell of a
                  charnel-house!
               "Did it ever occur to mourners to ask, what, if those for whom I grieve were to
                  speak to me out of their blissful rest in heaven, would be their choice—that I
                  should be shrouded like one in despair, or robed as one who mourns, but with
                  Christian hope?"
               Nothing further was replied, and the subject dropped.
               A great change had taken place in Rose. At length she had an object in life, which
                  was of sufficient magnitude and interest to develop and occupy all her powers.
                  Hitherto her life had been bright, tranquil, and happy. Yet, at times, there had
                  crept upon her a deep sense of dissatisfaction with herself. What was she
                  accomplishing? To wait in elegant idleness for some domestic settlement violated
                  both her moral sense and her delicacy. And yet, what was she doing commensurate
                  with the powers which had been entrusted to her and the culture which they had
                  received?
               She had revolved in her mind many projects without settling upon any. At one time
                  she was seriously bent upon leaving home and seeking a place in the South or West
                  as a teacher, and desisted from the purpose only on seeing how much pain it would
                  give her parents. She also revolved plans of teaching at or near home, but found
                  that she could do it only by dispossessing others who depended upon teaching for
                  their bread. Sometimes she thought of art as a field of usefulness, but was
                  convinced that in no other department of life was usefulness so dependent upon the
                  very highest talents as in the ministry of the beautiful.
               But the war, which was now disclosed, opened a field for every power which she
                  possessed. Her brother's early fall seemed to be a call to her to enlist in the
                  same cause, and make his place good. And though, at first, she did not see the
                  particular way in which she could enter this field of humanity, yet she never for
                  a moment doubted that she was called of God, and that He would, in His own time
                  and manner, open her path before her.
               With her mother she did not speak of her intentions. To her father she disclosed
                  her wishes and when his natural shrinking from the thought of the toil and
                  exposure were overcome he began to aid Rose in her preparation. He placed in her
                  hands works or parts of works that would give her such general knowledge of
                  physiology and of therapeutics as would furnish a proper basis for right nursing.
                  In conversations, he gave her also much information upon gunshot wounds, surgery,
                  and particularly on military surgery. He enlarged upon hospital treatment—air,
                  cleanliness, and the medicinal effect of cheerfulness and moral sentiments. Rose's
                  industry was most unremitting. Her power of acquisition, always remarkable, was
                  stimulated to the highest degree. She soon conceived a love of the study for its
                  intrinsic interest, and brought to the study of medicine an enthusiasm, an
                  apprehensiveness, a tact and delicacy which few medical students possess.
               Not content with books she insisted upon riding with her father, at least enough
                  to wear off that shrinking from suffering so natural to a sensitive nature.
               "Remember, Rose," her father would say, "that you are to be a nurse, not a
                  surgeon. For the active practice of medicine, or the performance of surgery, you
                  know enough to be only a good charlatan! But with modesty and your good sense, you
                  know enough to aid you materially in nursing."
               During the summer, Norwood, in common with every town and village in the North was
                  filled with zeal, both in raising the quota, required of Massachusetts by the call
                  for a half-million of men, and in providing for the soldiers' comfort in the camp
                  and for necessaries for sickness and wounds. Old linen came to a good market!
                  Bandages of all widths, and in endless quantities, were provided. Lint was scraped
                  in every house. Sick dresses, drawers, shirts and stockings, held high jubilee,
                  and round themselves in great honor. Sewing circles in every church! sewing
                  circles in almost every other house! sewing circles on every day of the week,
                  except Sunday; and even then there was unrebuked talk about sewing circles!
               About the middle of this summer was organized the most magnificent voluntary
                  charity ever recorded. Experience had found, in every nation, that the Medical Department of the
                  army, however thoroughly organized and faithfully served, had, by virtue of its
                  connection with the machinery of the army, a certain formality and precision which
                  was inconsistent with elasticity and suppleness. It was a wheel in a complicated
                  machine, and its revolutions must be determined by its relations to its fellow
                  wheels.
               The SANITARY COMMISSION undertook not to supersede, but to supplement and assist,
                  the Medical Department of the army. Its career is as notable as any single feature
                  of the war. In no other nation has the compassion of the people for their soldiers
                  resulted in so wonderful an organization, which, by voluntary contributions from
                  citizens, disbursed during for years, of money and material, between twenty and
                  thirty millions of dollars!
               It was October before Rose let her mother know of her intentions. She had prepared
                  herself to meet any objection, and adduce any persuasion necessary to overcome
                  maternal reluctance, inspired by love. To her surprise, the announcement of her
                  purpose was received with prompt favor, and a vehement opposition was raised in an
                  unexpected quarter.
               "Rose," said her mother, "I am glad you are going. You are the very one to go. I
                  wish I could go too."
               "Well," said Agate Bissell with a look of unfeigned amazement, "I have heard a
                  good deal about the singularities of the Wentworths, but this beats them all. I
                  wonder what will come next!"
               "Why, Agate? What is there so remarkable or eccentric in a woman's going to
                  hospitals to nurse wounded soldiers?"
               "Of course women ought to go," said Agate. "But I don't think it the place for
                  young and pretty girls! I guess you've little idea of what soldiers are, or what
                  camp life is!"
               "But somebody must go," said Rose, smiling at Agate's earnestness.
               "To be sure there must. But homely folks aren't all dead yet, nor old folks, nor
                  middle-aged folks. When all these are used up it will be time to try the young and
                  handsome ones!"
               "Really, Agate," said Rose, very much amused. "I never knew you so complimentary
                  before. I think I shall have to go, even if I wear a veil to save the young
                  soldiers' hearts while I dress their wounds. It would be sad indeed to make worse
                  wounds than one cures!"
               "Do you mean to say, Miss Rose that you are going?—or only that you are thinking
                  about it?
               "As sure as my life is spared, Agate, I shall go and that before many days."
               "Then as sure as my life is spared, you won't go alone!"
               "What, Agate," said Mrs. Wentworth, "you don't mean to go yourself?"
               "I do mean to go myself! If Rose will venture on so rash a business it's high time
                  for somebody to go along and take care of her."
               Without more ado Agate turned and went to her room, selected the few things which
                  she needed, finished all her packing within an hour, except a few articles yet to
                  be made, and came down to see to the tea, as if she had merely been getting ready
                  to go to the prayer-meeting. She said nothing further on the subject of the
                  conversation, except to Rose:
               "I am all ready. You can start when you please."
               It was Wednesday on which this scene occurred. The next Monday was fixed as the
                  day for departure. Agate, though ready, night or day, to leave, was yet glad of
                  the respite, chiefly because on the next afternoon she would have one more
                  opportunity of attending the female prayer-meeting.
               Let us look in on the meeting.
               In a small room, about three in the afternoon were gathered nine women, every one
                  of them mothers, except Agate Bissell.
               Polly Marble was there, with her great spectacles mounted up on her withered face
                  as if the sun had used them as lenses and dried every particle of moisture out of
                  the features behind them. One or two others were melancholy and silent women,
                  plain farmers' or mechanics' wives who had evidently struggled much with sorrow.
                  Miss Pifkins was there—a sharp saint, who ferreted out people's sins with a zeal
                  and assiduity which rendered her grace most savory. In action she was really kind.
                  Her hand was bountiful. In sickness she knew no limit to service. No one in
                  trouble had ever a better friend. It was her tongue that played the part of Law,
                  while her heart acted the Gospel. Her prayers were often but salutary lectures.
                  When any wickedness had disturbed the
                  town she was apt to have great liberty in prayer at the next meeting. "There is no
                  use in mincing matters. Sin is exceedingly sinful, and we may as well out with it,
                  as to smother it all up with excuses and mercy and all that sort of thing."
               Good Mrs. Taft was there, as sweet as twilight in June. So was Mrs. Goodhue, who
                  never failed to go to sleep. She was round, rosy, good-natured. There was a smile
                  spread out under her very skin, which nothing could rub out. Trouble had tried it,
                  but failed. Stern religious views had tried it, but her round, rosy face smiled
                  on. Age now was trying it; but though it could dry up the hair, change its color,
                  convex the eye-ball and disturb its functions, it did not get on with the face.
                     That shone and smiled at fifty very much as it did at
                  twenty-five.
               Mrs. Goodhue came unfailingly to prayer-meeting—I could never tell why; for, as
                  soon as the preliminary talking was over and business began, she dropped asleep.
                  She waked easily—waked to kneel down and waked to rise up again. She was always
                  asked to pray, and always said, in a sweet voice, "No, I thank you." So much for
                  externals. There is another side.
               A mother is praying. Before her is opened the other world and the listening
                  Saviour. She is praying for children, meaning her own. Her heart is deep. Her love
                  is the whole treasure of her life. She believes her children in danger of eternal
                  ruin. She is imploring succor. Listen, as her voice, low and tremulous, rises with
                  the intensity of feeling, and grows musical. Listen! as her emotions swell, how
                  sentences dissolve in passionate feeling, tears fill, and sobs are uttered, and
                  low sighs on every side attest the sympathy. Respect such a scene! Respect is a
                  poor and barren word for such fervor of faith and fidelity of love.
               And now Agate prays. She has imparted to her friends her impending journey and
                  errand. Her heart is full. There is not a word for herself. She prays for the
                  country, for the church and for the cause of God. She prays for the afflicted
                  family in which she lives; for the one who is going to minister to the sick and
                  dying and all her petition is that Rose may be wise in directing dying sinners to
                  the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world. As she proceeds, all
                  formality of tone is gone. At last Agate is free, when she can, without let or
                  hindrance, pour forth that silent soul in full utterance before God. Her words
                  rise in power and dignity. She falls into the language of the Old Testament. She
                  seems greater than woman—some prophetess returned to our days—with wealth of
                  affection and chastened familiarity! She pours out her innermost feelings before
                  her Redeemer; and so real is it, that, standing, as I do and listening, I half
                  expect to see the clouds part and the celestial vision appear. Ah! when women's
                  hearts are unfolded in the presence of their God, we must be base-minded indeed
                  who remembers their pinched faces, their angular forms, their ungraceful ways,
                  while their kindled souls are giving utterance to the very passionateness of love
                  and worship! Few places on earth are so near to heaven as where Christian wives
                  and mothers pray for their families.
               When Agate returned home there was nothing unusual in her look or manner. It was
                  no unusual feeling she had experienced. The hidden life was mightier and nobler in
                  Agate than the revealed one. Her faith was not only a tabernacle of joy in times
                  of sorrow but a pavilion where she was hidden till the storm was overpass.
               There were two surprises in reserve for Rose before she left. Alice Cathcart came
                  on Saturday night, as she often did, to pass the Sabbath day in town and on this
                  night, she was radiant with joy. Barton had been exchanged, and was now in
                  Washington with his regiment. He expected, however, to be at home the next week to
                  take the colonelcy of one of the new regiments. Frank Esel was to be his
                  lieutenant-colonel!
               "Then you have had letters?" said Rose.
               "Yes. Do you know that until he reached Washington, he knew nothing of Arthur's
                  death? His letter is very full of Arthur. He loved him, he says, more than if he
                  were a brother. How strange it seems when you have had a great sorrow, and months
                  have passed until you begin to grow used to it to see it break upon some one, as
                  this news did on Barton, as if it had just happened, and all the freshness and
                  particularity of your sorrow comes back to you in an echo from another heart!"
               While they thus sat in the open door talking of the loved and absent, and both of
                  them thinking, down deeply in the silence of the heart of other things, which
                  their lips would not reveal, a robin flew into one of the trees in the meadow and
                  began singing that plaintive call for its mate which one hears so often in
                     summer mer. It is the robin's
                  sweetest and most spirited song, and few strains there are that surpass it in
                  tenderness, clearness and brilliancy. Rose had always associated this evening
                  robin-song with the idea of a love-call to one absent. To-night it seemed more
                  yearning and passionate than usual. She followed the bird with her eye. At first
                  he sat patiently and sang. Then, as if surprised that no response followed, it
                  gave new force to its call. Now, growing restless, it changed place singing in
                  turn from several trees, and jerking itself nervously, as if really alarmed at
                  last lest it were forsaken. It seemed to Rose to say, "The night is coming on.
                  Where is my love? Oh! is he harmed? Am I forsaken?" It grew dark rapidly; the song
                  ceased; the bird flew silently away as if there was nothing left to sing for.
                  There was silence in the air and among the trees. Rose too became silent and
                  thoughtful. At length she said, abruptly:
               "Colonel Cathcart! Who would have dreamed in the old happy days, when
                  we were all children, and he was so shy and yet so bold, that we should grow to
                  this?—he in the army, and I in the army hospitals! I did not see him, Alice,
                  before he left. You will meet him next week, but I shall be in Washington. This is
                  playing at cross-purposes."
               Alice had something else to tell; but, as if there was a pleasure in keeping it
                  back she waited till the evening was spent, and they were preparing for sleep,
                  when she said, looking at Rose earnestly, and yet mirthfully, with her great black
                  eyes:
               "Rose, won't you tell any body if I will tell you something?"
               "Of course not, if it is a secret."
               "Well, I too am going with you and Agate. Father has consented; mother always
                  wanted me to go. But I am to wait till next Spring. Then, if the war is not over,
                  father says I may go out in the service of the Sanitary Commission and join you.
                  And Hiram Beers says he's too old to go a soldiering, but that if Agate can find
                  out that he can do any thing to help in the hospitals, he'll wind up this Winter
                  and come out in the Spring with me."
               Joined as their lives had ever been, it was a joy to Rose that they were to be
                  inseparable still; and though some months were to elapse before Alice would come
                  to her, yet by that time Rose would have become used to the work, and could smooth
                  the way for Alice.
               The seed sown by Florence Nightingale brought forth a plentiful harvest in
                  America. Wherever hospitals were established were found women of energy and
                  devotion who gave their time to ministrations of mercy. They came from every
                  position in society; yet to the honor of true culture be it said that women from
                  circles of wealth and refinement led in this merciful crusade.
               Mrs. Wentworth, with maternal anxiety, would have overloaded our pilgrims with
                  preparatives. Agate Bissell, however, refused all help.
               "Why, Mrs. Wentworth, we are not going where fine clothes will do us any good. Few
                  things and strong, are all we want. When they are used up we'll send for
                  more."
               "She is right," said Dr. Wentworth. "A life among field hospitals is as near a
                  total revolution of ordinary experience as can be conceived. It will be a
                  spectacle of Christian refinement going down to the very border of savage life on
                  an errand of love. Now, Rose, you are walking in His very footsteps, 'who, though
                  rich, for our sakes became poor that we through his poverty might become rich.'
                  Great joy is before you if you go in that spirit. But it is a joy unknown to
                  common life,—the very joy of self-sacrificing Benevolence.—But what
                     is Agate building up with her needle, Rose?"
               "Well, father, it may be called a Paradise of Pockets; otherwise, nursing
                  aprons."
               "You may laugh now," said Agate, very composedly, "but when we go into the field
                  and follow the march, with men every other step faint or wounded, you will find
                  these aprons better than lugging a carpet-bag."
               There were pockets on the sides and pockets on the front, pockets low down and
                  pockets high up, pockets for thread and needles Pockets for buttons, tape, and
                  small things, pockets for small rolls of bandages and lint-pockets for knives,
                  scissors, and comb and brushes, a pocket for vials and one for a good brandy
                  flask.
               The cloak may be described as a congeries of small bags so arranged that the
                  wearer, if strong enough to stand up under the load could carry in it a reasonable
                  supply of comforts and restoratives for a small household.
               Although the doctor made merry over Agate's contrivances, he admired her sagacity
                  in foreseeing the nature of her work.
               
               "It is not every one who has served in a campaign that is as well instructed as
                  Agate seems to be before she has seen a single wounded man."
               "Any body that ever did any nursing," said Agate, "can imagine pretty much what
                  they've got to do. In the hospitals I expect we shall have every thing provided.
                  But in the fields I guess we shall have to provide for ourselves—at any rate a
                  good part of the time. It's better to have these things and not want them, than to
                  want them when you get there and not have them."
               Dr. Buell, on the last Sunday before the little party started, bore them in
                  memory, and the fervor and tenderness with which he prayed for all who went forth
                  to succor the needy, manifestly showed that his thoughts were with Agate and Rose.
                  Indeed, though not his custom, he spent the Sabbath evening with the Wentworths.
                  Although they were to leave on Monday, there was nothing to tempt Agate to the
                  least work on Sunday. She was twice at church, and with her Sunday-school class as
                  well prepared as if there had been no unusual outfit going on, and by ten o'clock
                  on Saturday night the last stitch had been fastened the last string tied,
                  everything was packed and laid ready for early departure on Monday.
               "Why, Agate," said Mrs. Wentworth, "you will work on Sundays, will you not, when
                  you are in the field?"
               "Of course I shall. Works of necessity and of mercy are proper on Sunday. When
                  folks live at home and have the whole week to themselves there need not be many
                  such works left for Sunday—not if they have any conscience about it. But I think
                  nowadays folks make Sunday a kind of rubbish-day. They save up all the little odds
                  and ends through the week, that won't pay, and then on Sunday call 'em works of
                  necessity and mercy. I call 'em works of laziness. Any body that
                     wants to keep Sunday to the Lord, will keep an eye to it all the
                  week. My opinion is, that the reason why folks don't like Sunday is, that they
                  don't know what it is to have day full of real peace, up to the brim from morning
                  to night, and sweet as milk."
               "She'll do," said Dr. Wentworth to his wife, in an undertone, and in an amused
                  way. "Before Agate gets back she will have learned something about the world; but
                  I'm mistaken if other people don't learn something about a real plain New England
                  woman! It's a pity that some man had not the good sense to win so much sense and
                  goodness."
               "Perhaps," said Mrs. Wentworth with a slight cast of her eye at the other side of
                  the room, "some other people are of your mind."
               "What?" said the doctor, "you don't mean—"
               "I don't mean—but I think Dr. Buell does."
               Why will people pry into other people's business? There sat Dr. Buell
                  properly enough, neither saying soft things to Agate nor exchanging glances. All
                  that he had ever done was to consult Agate, within the last six months, respecting
                  the religious interests of the parish; and any minister might have done that with
                  profit. Her judgment was worth any wise man's consideration. Dr. Buell was
                  grateful for it, and expressed his sense of thanks by the cordiality with which he
                  shook Agate's hand; and if it lingered in his it was because the good man was
                  growing absent-minded.
               When Mrs. Wentworth had slyly hinted to Agate that Dr. Buell would lack for
                  counsel when she was gone, Agate's manner showed that there was no foundation
                  whatever for Mrs. Wentworth's sly humor. Her cheek flushed slightly, and her eye,
                  with resentful good nature flashed a little, but did not turn away; she looked the
                  doctor's wife full in the face while she said:
               "I know what you mean. It's no such thing. The doctor has never said a word to me
                  that any body might not hear, and he's no ideas about it anyhow."
               "About what, Agate?" said Mrs. Wentworth in the most innocent manner, "ideas about
                  what?"
               Agate walked out of the room with some emphasis in her movement; yet her
                  principles enabled her to keep good-natured.
               On Monday they left for Washington, to enter upon their new and strange
                  duties.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLVIII.
               A NEW LIFE.
               IT was indeed a new life to Rose more than to Agate; for Rose's life had dealt
                  less with business and more with sentiment while Agate's had been trained to
                  practical affairs. There was a hospital in Washington which had suffered from the
                  incompetence both of nurses and surgeons. After a few weeks the medical director
                  of the Department was glad to place Agate Bissell there as superintendent and
                  matron, while Rose became her assistant.
               Agate's entrance upon her duties was the signal of alarm among a multitude of
                  unworthy attendants. It can be likened to nothing better than the entrance of a
                  conscientious cat into a house where rats and mice have had unmolested liberty.
                  There was racing and scampering, hiding and peeping out of holes, alarm and
                  cunning;—but, one by one, each culprit was surprised and despatched, to the great
                  comfort and stillness of the household.
               Hospital stores were no longer squandered nor consumed by nurses and attendants.
                  Wines and brandies now found their way oftener to the wounded than to those who
                  waited on them. The special diet suddenly improved in quality, in regularity, and
                  in a certain feminine neatness and refinement.
               "I say, Jim, there's a new hand at the bellows in this shop—we never had things
                  afore like this!"
               "That's so; the old 'un is a cap'n. I tell ye she drills 'em, she does. When she
                  fust came and I heerd her dressin' down some of the nurses, I thought we'd got a
                  tartar. Lord bless her, though, when she comes to the sick 'uns—you'd think she's
                  ten mothers rolled into one!"
               "This is the first time," weakly sighed a mere skeleton of a man, on the next
                  couch, "that any thing has tasted good since I got here."
               Agate's zeal of neatness had the eagerness of the hunting instinct. She brought
                  every thing to order. She established a method for all things, and compelled its
                  observance, or dismissed the refractory. She stood very little upon ceremony. She
                  expressed her opinion upon persons just as unhesitatingly as upon things. Every
                  day her heart yearned more and more for "her boys," as she called the patients. In
                  a month's time a perfect revolution had taken place. The hospital, which was the
                  very worst, had risen to become a model. She did not confine her labors to her
                  subordinates. She had lived too long with Dr. Wentworth not to know what
                  conscientious medical practice was. She rebuked the assistant surgeons when they
                  neglected their proper duties, and became such a thorn in their sides that they
                  determined to oust her. She helped on that purpose. One morning she found out
                  that, though it was eleven o'clock, no special diet list had been made out for one
                  of the wards the assistant surgeon in charge having been on a "spree" the night
                  before. He was sleeping off his drunkenness. When at length he came, Agate
                  confronted him with an eye that did not seem pleasant for him to look upon. With a
                  few cold but terrible sentences, she brought the blood to his cheeks.
               "Well, well," said the surgeon, with ill concealed annoyance, "what's the matter
                  now?"
               "Matter enough, as you shall soon find out. All these sick men left without
                  attention or food, that you might indulge a brutal appetite! And then do you dare,
                  sir, attempt to face me down with your impudence? You'd better pull off those
                  shoulder-straps and resign."
               "This a great fuss over a little matter," said the surgeon, who was more alarmed
                  than he was willing to show. "I know my own business and I shan't tolerate your
                  meddling."
               I know my business, too," replied Agate, fiercely, "and you shall find it out.
                  I'll pull off that shoulder-strap before you're a week older."
               When he was gone, some of the attendants were greatly alarmed, dreading his
                  influence with his superiors.
               "Oh, ma'am, he'll have it jest his own way. He'll get up a report, and them's
                  above him will think it all right, and first thing we know, you'll be sent off to
                  some other work. I've seen how things go here."
               "Don't you be troubled," said Agate, quietly, and went on with her work.
               
               Sure enough, within a week came a new matron with an order superseding Agate
                  Bissell. As the woman seemed to be both sensible and kindly, Agate said:
               "I wish you would withhold this matter till afternoon."
               "Certainly, madam, if it will make a difference with you."
               "It may make a good deal—with some other folks."
               Agate immediately gave things in charge to Rose, put on her bonnet and shawl and
                  started for the White House. She had never been used to riding in hacks; and,
                  although the distance was great and the walking very bad, she bravely sped her way
                  to the President's mansion.
               The waiting-man at the door looked at her very much as a dog looks at a stranger,
                  to see whether it is worth his while to bark or not. The inspection, however,
                  seemed favorable. He pointed to the stairs and said:
               "Go up."
               Not knowing whither, Agate obeyed and went up. Landing in a wide hall, a folding
                  door stood open, in which she saw some fifteen or twenty people waiting. A
                  door-keeper stood at the first door on the right as she entered, receiving cards,
                  which he carried into the President's reception-room, and then, from time to time,
                  as parties came out, he called to one and another to enter. Agate approached him
                  and said:
               "Is the President in?"
               "Yes Ma'am. Let me have your card if you please."
               "Tell him that Agate Bissell wants to see him."
               "Let me write your name. Perhaps you'll do it yourself, on this card!"
               Within half an hour she was admitted. The room was large, and furnished scarcely
                  better than a country lawyer's office. A large open fire-place was on the right
                  side of the room as she entered. On the left hand wall hung many maps. One also
                  there was over the mantelpiece, apparently just drawn in ink, and giving the
                  country between the Potomac and Richmond. A large, long table covered with green
                  baize stood in the middle of the room, and beyond it, near to the windows on the
                  side opposite the door, was a similar table at which sat a long, lean,
                  grandfatherish man. He was running his left hand through stiff and long black
                  hair, now beginning to be struck through with gray. His features were large, and
                  seemed, like chance travellers at an inn, to have put up together for a night,
                  rather than to have been a family of relations.
               "Well, ma'am," said he, in a broad country accent, his voice somewhat drawling and
                  shrill, "this is Agate Bissell, I s'pose. What can I do for you?"
               "You can do nothing for me," said Agate Bissell, firmly, but with
                  great respect; for she had a profound New England reverence for a chief magistrate
                  of the nation, queer as she thought the specimen now before her—"you can do
                  nothing for me, but you can do a good deal for the soldiers."
               "Well, what is it?"
               Agate briefly narrated her experience, to which the President listened gravely,
                  and she ended by saying:
               "I wish, Mr. President, that you would ask the chief medical director here, to
                  look into this matter with his own eyes, and not to take his opinion from drunken
                  underlings, who, while soldiers shot down in battle are lingering and dying before
                  him, is lying beastly drunk, and then would turn out of charge those who rebuke
                  him. Oh! Mr. President, how can any body doubt the doctrine of total depravity
                  when they see the wretches robbing wounded soldiers eating the delicacies sent to
                  them, and drinking their cordials, and letting their wounds stink and rot, from
                  carelessness? It's enough to touch a stone's heart."
               Mr. Lincoln's heart was no stone.
               "Madam, I will give you a note to the doctor, and do you go and talk to him jest
                  as you have to me."
               He sat down and took an unglazed visiting card, and wrote with a pencil:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Dr. —. Please hear this woman's statement, and make inquiry in
                              person, and if it is true, put her back, and pray for twenty more such
                              women.
                           
                              A. LINCOLN."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "There—do you go yourself. If anything turns up, and it don't go right, you come
                  to me again. Let me see. Agate Bissell—Agate Bissell—yes, I'll remember your name
                  and sometime I'll come down and see how you're getting along."
               Armed with this, Agate soon found the medical director. It required but little
                  time to satisfy him. She was reinstated, the assistant surgeon was dismissed the service, and
                  great fear fell upon all who had to do with Agate!
               That evening Rose said—"What kind of a man did you find the President to be?"
               "A very good man," said Agate—"but I didn't see much President about
                  him. But I s'pose he had not got his official clothes on, and so he did not rumple
                  up his feathers much."
               While Agate played the General, Rose, in her own way, was quite as efficient. She
                  had, what many noble fellows in this labor of love had not, ample command of
                  money. She sought to cheer the sick and wounded, by relieving the barren wards of
                  their cold and forlorn appearance. She procured cheerful engravings, suited to the
                  tastes of the men, and hung them where they could easily see them. She went daily
                  to the green-houses for flowers, and distributed them through the wards. "It does
                  not require masses of flowers," she would say. "A single bud with a leaf, by a
                  cot, is is often far more prized than a large bouquet would be." In this way, the
                  convalescents had each some token, and many of the men begged leave to send home
                  these offerings to their mothers or sisters.
               Rose showed great skill in conversation with the men, and imparted to them much
                  religious truth. He must have been a hardened man indeed who could not listen to
                  her sweet voice, reading in low tones by his bedside the psalms of David, or the
                  Evangelists.
               "Why, Tom," said a wounded man to an Irish soldier, who lay next him, "I thought
                  you was a Catholic? How dare you let a heretic read the Bible to you?"
               "She's no hiritic, I tell ye. D'ye think they make hiritics of such as thim? Ye
                  couldn't keep her out of hiven, more'n you can keep the birds out of the gardens.
                  If you druv 'em away iver so many times, they'll fly back agin, sure!"
               The experience gained in Washington was such that when, in the spring and summer
                  of 1862, McClellan made his ill-fated campaign of the Peninsula, Agate, Rose, and
                  Alice, who had joined them, followed the army, and served in the brigade and
                  regimental hospitals. During battles, they hovered upon the edge of the conflict,
                  preparing food for the wounded, aiding in binding up their wounds, furnishing them
                  with stimulants, and comforting the dying. Now it was that Rose found her whole
                  soul drawn forth. Every power was taxed. She rose to the necessities of the hour
                  in a manner which made her the admiration of all. Perhaps she could not surpass
                  Agate in the methodical administration of business, in the routine of wards in
                  hospital, although she equalled her, and grew every day in strength and endurance.
                  But she surpassed Agate in medical sense. She had evidently inherited
                  her father's medical tact and insight; and, though she avoided taking the
                  surgeons' work out of their hands, her quickness and aptitude were of continual
                  service even to medical men.
               But far more than these things was Rose noticed for her courage and her power of
                  inspiring men with hope, and cheer, and courage. Her resources of thought, her
                  wealth of feeling, her great power of expression her imagination and humor seemed
                  endless. Indeed Alice wrote truly when she said to her parents that Rose had
                  broken forth into a new life. All those resources which lay untaxed in her former
                  quiet life, were now developed into an even and steady enthusiasm. Her pity and
                  tenderness made her presence to the sick and wounded like a light shining upon
                  them from their own home. In different places, she earned for herself among the
                  soldiers pet names. They played upon her name and styled her the "Ever-blooming
                  Rose." And when she brought coffee, or fragrant tea, made as no one else knew how
                  to suit it to their taste they naturally called her the "Tea-Rose." In other camps
                  she was known as the "Norwood Beauty,"—and she was beautiful! The
                  constant play of courage, pity, benevolence, and the enthusiasm of patriotism had
                  given to her face a radiant outlook peculiarly charming.
               She accompanied the troops and returned with them from the Peninsula. She returned
                  to Washington to care for the multitudes of wounded that came in from Pope's
                  disastrous campaign. She went with the wagons of the Commission to Antietam, and
                  hovered along that field wherever were wounded and suffering. It was here that she
                  was inspired by danger and desperate necessity to take the surgeon's knife.
               In a small house so near to the battle that shot were flying around it in every
                  direction, were collected multitudes of the wounded. The surgeon was in the act of
                  amputating a shattered leg. Rose stood near, his only assistant. The saw had
                     half-severed ered the bone, when a
                  cannon-shot struck him dead. The patient was left bleeding. Seized with an
                  inspiration, Rose, without an instant's hesitation, put her hand to the saw,
                  completed the severing, tied the arteries, joined the flaps, and bound up the
                  wound. The man recovered. She had often been called the "Surgeon's Daughter;" but
                  now the men changed it, and called her the "Daughter-surgeon."
               Alice was never separated from Rose. They worked together rode and travelled
                  together, slept together. Scarcely less than Rose was Alice admired and beloved by
                  the common soldiers. She often sang to them in the hospitals, wrote their letters
                  home, received dying messages and faithfully transmitted them to friends at
                  home.
               The heroism of the war received its highest illustration in that band of noble
                  women who followed the flag through darkness and blood, toiling as no soldiers on
                  the march toiled, enduring hardships which none surpassed, facing all the dangers
                  of the battlefield and many others in hospitals even more perilous than bullet or
                  shell, and in many instances offering their lives as a sacrifice to humanity and
                  religion! The evangelists of a true gospel were they, sowing the good seeds of
                  peace in the furrows of war!
               Alice Cathcart was not less patriotic in her feelings than Rose. But for some
                  reason, she added to these generous impulses a peculiar pity and tenderness toward
                  the sick and wounded rebel prisoners. This disposition drew forth from Hiram Beers
                  many criticisms and discussions.
               "I think you might use your time better'n to be curin' up the fellows that fought
                  us, so's to fight agin."
               "Why, Hiram," said Alice imploringly, "they are not our enemies now that they are
                  sick and helpless. The poor and sick the world over should be like their own
                  children to the well and the merciful."
               "You may have 'em, if you want. But you won't catch me adoptin' sech a scaly set
                  o' children. I'll tell ye, you're fattenin' em up agin to shoot down our boys.
                  It's like geese and chickens goin' round to cure up all the sick foxes."
               "Would you let them suffer, Hiram? would you see them die without a crumb from our
                  stores?" said Alice in a plaintive way.
               "Wal, mebbe I'd give 'em the crumbs, but I wouldn't give 'em a slice round the
                  whole loaf. The fact is, you give 'em cakes and gingerbread, and that's running
                  kindness into the ground, I'm thinkin'." said Hiram.
               Agate Bissell came to the rescue.
               "Hiram Beers, you old hypocrite, what do you want to tease that child for? You
                  know you don't believe a word you're saying. I should like to know who 'twas that
                  ran about last week for clothes and stockings for the shivering prisoners; and who
                  'twas that looked after those two boys in ward ten when we were in the hospital?
                  You know you're just plaguing Alice. Alice, don't mind a word he says. His tongue
                  is of no more account than the shaking of the leaves on the trees."
               It fell out that after the battle of Antietam there fell to Alice's care, among
                  others, a young rebel officer, evidently a person of refinement and position. He
                  entered into no conversation. His wounds were severe, and probably fatal. For
                  several days he maintained a proud and almost defiant reserve. His face wore the
                  expression of suffering, though he carefully avoided all tokens of pain.
               He seemed reluctant to get well at the hands of Northerners. Alice hovered about
                  him as if there was some fascination which wrought upon her. Nor was her labor of
                  love unrewarded. Little by little the young officer showed pleasure in her
                  presence, and a docility which he manifested to no one else. That pride and
                  repugnance which sickness and suffering could not break, began sensibly to yield
                  to kindness.
               As he grew weaker, his large eyes, set in an emaciated face-frame, followed Alice
                  as she came or left, as a child's eyes follow a mother. As he declined, Alice as
                  often as she could snatch time read to him the Word of God, or sang hymns in a
                  low, sweet voice.
               "I know not what it is," said she to Rose, "but I seem to have met this gentleman
                  before. Of course I do not suppose that I have; but there is something in his
                  voice at times that startles me. I can hardly help saying, 'Where
                     have we met before?' Last evening, when I sung to him, a tear ran
                  down his cheek and he said, 'That's my brother's favorite hymn.' He turned his
                  face to me and said:
               "'Will you be kind enough to tell me your name?'
               
               "I repeated that it was Alice Cathcart, of Norwood, in Massachusetts."
               "He seemed agitated, and looked intently at me, and repeated it several times—'Ah!
                  Alice—Cathcart.' Then, pausing as if his mind ran back over some memory, he said
                  musingly,—'Alice Cathcart! That is very singular, that both of us should have
                  fallen under your care.'
               "'Both of us?' I asked, inquiringly. 'Have I ever met you before?'
               "I was just then called away. But to-morrow, if he seems disposed to conversation,
                  I mean to find out more about him."
               Very early in the morning, before the sun was up—before it was fairly light—Alice
                  was summoned to her patient. Mid-September fogs clouded the air and drenched the
                  grass and leaves with wet. She felt a chill shivering as she hastened to meet the
                  call. He was fast sinking. It was evident that death was upon him. He revived a
                  little. Looking upon her, he said:
               "Alice, don't leave me. I have much to say."
               Then, his voice sinking to an inaudible whisper, his lips moved for a minute or
                  more. A little stimulant was given him, and for a second he revived, as a fire on
                  which a handful of shavings is thrown.
               "Tell my mother, Alice"—and his voice died away, though still his lips moved.
               Once or twice Alice could distinguish names but all the rest was
                  undistinguishable. He lay for a few moments in perfect stillness. Suddenly the
                  light came to his eyes, and he looked around eagerly as if following a vision. It
                  was but a flash. The flame went out and all was still.
               Alice, although familiar with every form of suffering, was so much affected by the
                  death of the young rebel officer that Agate Bissell insisted upon her
                  retiring.
               Agate herself gave orders for his burial. His few effects were gathered up. His
                  watch and a pocket-book were the only valuables. On examining them, there were
                  found several letters from his home—one from his brother, a colonel in the rebel
                  army—and his own name, 
                     HENRY C. HEYWOOD,
                        Lynchburg, Va.
                  
               
               Agate called Rose to her.
               "This young man is your friend Tom Heywood's brother—the brother Hal
                  he used to mention so often."
               Rose was scarcely less affected than Alice had been. For a moment she was
                  overcome; but, quickly recovering herself, she enjoined upon Agate the most
                  profound secrecy.
               "For reasons which I cannot tell, you must not mention this name to Alice. It will
                  do no good, and will do much harm."
               Agate's sharp sagacity needed no further help. She had her own thoughts, but was
                  satisfied to leave Rose to manage the matter as it pleased her.
               At the evening twilight young Heywood was quietly buried, and the place marked
                  securely. As soon as the opportunity could be found his few effects were sent to
                  his friends and with them a note to his mother.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "MY DEAR MADAM:—After your son was wounded and captured on the second
                              day of the battle of Antietam, he came to the hospital of which I have
                              charge. Every attention was paid to him. A faithful friend ministered
                              to his religious wants with the fidelity and tenderness of a sister.
                              His last thoughts rested upon his home. He called by name his various
                              relatives, and would have sent messages, had not his death been more
                              sudden than he anticipated. I pray you to allow me, as a friend of Mr.
                              Thomas Heywood to express my deep sympathy with you.
                           
                              ROSE WENTWORTH."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XLIX.
               THANKSGIVING.
               WHEN November came in 1862, came also in Norwood the renowned Thanksgiving Day,
                  the holiday of old New England from its founding. The Pilgrims found it written,
                  "They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth,
                  bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his
                  sheaves with him." This beautiful poetry was translated into the policy of the
                  Pilgrims by establishing a Fast-day, in March or April, and a Day of Thanksgiving
                  in November. Thus the whole people were to pass through the two gates of the year,
                  Tears and Smiles, and observe them as Holy Days, all other profane and misleading
                  festivities—Christmas, New Year's, and Saints' days without number, being laid
                  aside. Both days, the Day of Fasting and the Day of Thanksgiving, were to be
                  esteemed religious days, and so kept. On the forenoon of each the people were to
                  assemble in their churches for religious services and a sermon. On these days good
                  ministers were allowed a wider pasture than was befitting the Sabbath Day, and
                  were expected to discourse upon public affairs. So that the pulpit had two safety
                  valves, and the Minister could give vent to his opinions upon matters and things
                  in general twice a year without danger of being unsettled, on the one side, or, on
                  the other, of exploding from pent-up fire.
               If any where, a Fast Day ought to flourish in New England. Not that its people
                  were acerb and superstitious but they derived their tendencies from fathers who
                  had suffered prosecutions and to whom "strong crying and tears" were familiar; and
                  as the religious convictions of its people are deep, and their views of duty
                  stern, one day in three hundred and sixty-five for public fasting could not seem
                  unreasonable.
               In the beginning, it was a day of fasting. The steps of decline are
                  melancholy and instructive. "Nothing should be eaten between the rising and the
                  setting of the sun," would seem a plain rule. But many people refused such rigor,
                  and ate their breakfast with the foresight that it must last till supper, leaving
                  out dinner by way of fasting.
               But soon, while breakfast and supper were left as abutments on each side, the span
                  was so long that a pier of crackers and cheese was built up in the middle to carry
                  the fasting safely over. Now all engineers know that a crib sunken in a stream or
                  a pier is apt to become a point around which a deposit is soon formed, and even
                  islands have thus grown up from a stake driven down or a mere lodgment of brush.
                  And so it was with Fast-day. Crackers and cheese became premises of an argument.
                  If crackers may be eaten without violation of fast, why not gingerbread? As the
                  court before which these questions were brought often held its sessions in the
                  stomach the case was decided in favor of gingerbread.
               Thus, with lamentable blindness doughnuts were added; and to doughnuts (with
                  astonishing infatuation) dried smoked-beef; though with a latent sense of the
                  danger, it was shaved exceedingly thin; to dried beef was added cold
                  chicken—small, but young and tender; and to this, cold corned-beef. A plain
                  apple-pie also got foot-hold. But, at this point, devotion made a stand against
                  luxury, and conquered. The worldliness of eating hot dishes was
                  happily eschewed. Cold victuals often require, and so minister to the gracious
                  feelings, if partaken of with patience and an uncomplaining spirit.
               In the early day, fasting was the very spirit of abstinence; then, the spirit of
                  moderation in eating; and finally, the spirit of abundance, making a judicious
                  selection. At first, all intelligent creatures fasted. Then servants began to be
                  excused; then delicate women; and then robustious children, that ran roaring round
                  the house on fast days as if it were an exceeding Sunday; and finally, Fasting was
                  itself the only thing that fasted on Fast-day.
               Meantime, while the starved Fast-day, like a consumptive moon, grew pale, and thin
                  and wasted away, every year dying, and yet clinging tenaciously to life, the
                  well-fed Thanksgiving-day, like a new moon, grew bright and round, and lay upon
                  the year's horizon like a joyful pumpkin upon the ridges of a Yankee corn field;
                  the pumpkin! sign and symbol in the calendar of New England of jovial festivity!
                  And now, Thanksgiving may be seen any
                  year, in the mellow days of November, round and jolly, with all the air of a fat
                  old English Christmas; while in April, amidst blustering winds and pinching
                  frosts, its defrauded and bankrupt brother, very poor and thin, shambles along,
                  wishing it were dead, among millions of hard-hearted people who wish so too. And
                  so Self-gratulation flourishes in New England, while Humiliation loses popularity
                  every year.
               Rose Wentworth and Alice Cathcart returned home after the great labors of summer
                  and autumn, to recruit and to spend the Thanksgiving. Agate Bissell peremptorily
                  refused.
               "Why should I go home? I have enough to do and I love to do it. Nobody can take as
                  good care of my boys as I can. And as for rest, I was never so little tired in my
                  life."
               In fact, Agate was living in an undreamed of glory. With such tender duties, so
                  important; with such scope, and so many instruments; the love of activity which
                  had all her life, like a subterranean river, flowed darkly and hidden within now
                  came to the surface and sparkled in the light without hindrance or bound.
               "There can't be any thanksgiving to me like taking care of four hundred men that
                  have been wounded for their country. But then, you girls ought to go. You have
                  fathers and mothers that have a right to you. I have none," said Agate somewhat
                  sadly.
               "Well, Agate," said Rose, a little slyly, "you may have others who would like to
                  see you, quite as near as if they were fathers?"
               Whereat Agate's eye twinkled just a little, and she bent over, to put up the
                  bandages again which had tumbled out of a box.
               Rose and Alice meant to slip away without notice; but in some way it was known,
                  and they had to pass the ordeal of gratitude. Next to ingratitude the most painful
                  thing to bear is gratitude. A sensitive nature is glad to know that one is
                  grateful and that one longs to show it. But to stand in the focus of an
                  enthusiastic thanksgiving is awkward enough.
               Few can express thanks gracefully, and fewer yet are those who can gracefully
                  receive them. Both Rose and Alice found this out when rough men thanked them for
                  their very lives, and others professed that they had been more than mothers to
                  them, and some craved them to accept a button or some token of their prowess
                  captured in battle. Amidst cheers, and some tears, too, on hard cheeks the girls
                  got away; and though their facets were homeward and their hearts eager, there was
                  a heavy feeling that they had turned their backs upon that which had taken hold
                  even deeper than Home!
               After the natural overflow of gladness at being once more at home had somewhat
                  subsided, Rose was conscious of a dull disquiet, a sense of the emptiness of
                  former pleasure. Common duties and the ordinary flow of village life were tame and
                  flavorless. It seemed to her that people were living for trifles and wasting the
                  noblest powers upon matters scarcely worth a thought. Indeed she chid herself for
                  wanting natural affection inasmuch as her own home failed to furnish that deep
                  content which she formerly knew. So long had she been engaged in the profoundest
                  tragedies of heroic life, that the simple duties of peaceful domestic circles
                  palled upon her taste. She grew restless, and longed to return to the exposures,
                  the fatigues, and the sufferings even, of the hospital, the march and the
                  battlefield. There was too, a strange uneasiness of conscience. Her judgment told
                  her that she had a right to rest and to recreation. Yet she started when persons
                  came in as if they would reproach her for indolence.
               But the winter soon wore away, and in March both Alice and Rose returned to their
                  labors again, and prepared to enter the campaign of Chancellorsville with that
                  glorious army whose only fault was, that it was too large for its commander, a
                  noble soldier, within a circle not too large.
               Before March had done blustering, but not before the birds had come, our two brave
                  women, glad to depart, though it was from homes as well loved as any for which
                  mortal heart ever yearned, turned their dear faces southward.
               Agate Bissell greeted them with a most motherly welcome. She seemed as fresh and
                  unworn as if the winter had been a long vacation.
               "Why, Agate," said Rose "I never saw you look so well! A little pale,—just a
                  little. But I suppose that is because you have been all winter under a roof. Field
                  work will revive your color."
               Rose handed her a package of letters, and among them one from Dr. Buell, saying
                  archly, as she saw the color come to Agate's cheek:
               
               "On second thought, I do not know but you leave as much color in your cheek as
                  ever."
               "Rose, you think that you know a good deal. But I tell you, if you do, then you
                  know more than I do! You may read the letter and welcome," said Agate, extending
                  the open letter to her. It ran:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "NORWOOD, March 14, 1863.
                           
                           "MISS AGATE BISSELL—Dear Madam: At Miss Rose's
                              suggestion, I write you a line, lest under the accumulation of labors,
                              and in hours of weariness, you may be in danger of believing yourself
                              forgotten. Truly, every pious and patriotic heart here at home thanks
                              you for your excellent and most praiseworthy labors in behalf of our
                              sick and wounded soldiers. Doubt not that many prayers ascend for you
                              daily, mine among the number. The Lord is preparing you, it may be,
                              for future important labors, in a school where so much of patience and
                              of wisdom are required, and whatever may be the divine counsels which
                              respect the future, may He overrule all to his own honor and
                              glory.
                           "The meetings are well attended. A gracious spirit is found in the
                              female prayer-meeting. Polly Marble is dead, and the deacon is very
                              much afflicted. She was very faithful to him, and her last breath was
                              spent in exhorting him, in an edifying manner. It's a great loss,
                              indeed, to him, and to all of us, but a gain to her.
                           "There has been an interest in the church this winter, and several
                              persons give pleasing evidence of a saving change. May they run well!
                              All your friends will rejoice when your duties shall allow you to
                              return home, and none more than your friend and affectionate

               The campaign of Chancellorsville opened in May, 1863. General Barton Cathcart—for
                  he had been advanced in rank,—learning of his sister's presence sought her out
                  immediately after the withdrawal of his brigade to the north side of the Rapidan.
                  Rose Wentworth was engaged in the hospital transport service, and spent most of
                  her time, for weeks, upon the steamboats that conveyed the wounded from the depots
                  along the Potomac to Washington. Barton failed to see her. But Agate Bissell and
                  his sister Alice, as soon as the army settled again in its former camps, he found.
                  The movements of the army to the west and north soon separated them again, nor did
                  they approach each other afterwards till the great battle of GETTYSBURG toward
                  which we will now wend our way.
               Early in June, 1863, Lee began, with great skill of secrecy, to transfer the bulk
                  of his army from before Hooker's line to the Shenandoah valley, preparatory to a
                  sudden invasion of Maryland and Pennsylvania, by which masterly movement he had
                  good reason to hope that the war would be removed from Virginia, which had already
                  suffered incredible ills, as the chief battleground, to Pennsylvania, where an
                  army might be easily sustained; and if Hooker's army were defeated Baltimore and
                  Philadelphia would become prizes. Washington, cut off from the north must then
                  fall; and not far off from such an event must come peace, with the recognition of
                  Southern independence.
               Nor can one now, after the event standing in General Lee's place, and reasoning
                  upon the facts as they then appeared, and as we now know them to have actually
                  been, charge him with unsobriety of expectation. There were good and sound
                  military reasons for expecting success, and success would, in all likelihood have
                  been decisive of the results of the war.
               After the battle of Chancellorsville, in May, the army under Lee had, in numbers,
                  equipment, but above all in the confidence of its own irresistibleness, reached
                  the highest point of its history. It certainly had cause for self-confidence.
               It had resisted the whole power of the Union for two years with but one grand
                  defeat, while it wrote upon its banners the great victories of the Seven Days of
                  the Peninsula, of Fredericksburg, of Second Bull's Run, and of
                  Chancellorsville.
               One general only had that army had, or desired, after it was fairly organized.
                  Both the North and the South bore witness to his ability—the South by an
                  enthusiastic admiration and confidence; the North by four times changing the
                  general of the Army of the Potomac opposed to him.
               On the third year of the war with an army invincible thus far, and a commander
                  whose name had gone out into all the world, it is not strange that they should be
                  resolved to transfer the field of battle from Virginia, which was but one great
                  mountain-clad fort, long enough besieged and seared with fire, and let the
                  northern fields take their turn of blasting, blood and flame!
               
               With their faces aglow with the victory of Chancellorsville, Lee's army skilfully
                  glided past Hooker, entered the valley of the Shenandoah, drove out or consumed
                  the loyal forces and in the last days of June, burst into the Cumberland valley,
                  in Pennsylvania. Their cavalry, like the biting scud of a storm, spread instantly,
                  and scoured all the defenseless region to the banks of the Susquehanna. With
                  promptness and admirable decision, Lee stretched out Ewell's corps and dividing
                  it, as with his right hand seized York, thus threatening Baltimore and Washington;
                  with his left hand he seized Carlisle, aiming at Harrisburg and Philadelphia;
                  while his main body lay at Chambersburg, near the head of the valley of the
                  Cumberland.
               Then it was that he learned that Hooker, moving in pursuit, had crossed the
                  Potomac, concentrated at Frederick, with his face as though determined to strike
                  across the foot of the Cumberland valley and out off his line of communication
                  with Virginia. To compel Hooker to let this enterprise alone, Lee drew back his
                  advanced corps from York to Carlisle, with orders to concentrate with the centre,
                  which poured through a pass in the South Mountain, upon Gettysburg, a small
                  village in the eastern skirts of the mounted range; and so, Lee said, in effect,
                  if you touch my line of communication I will seize Washington.
               But, before this movement was known, or even half-way developed, Hooker retired
                  from command, and the fifth commander in order came to the head of the Army of the
                  Potomac. Ignorant of Lee's purposes, and knowing in general only that he was
                  advancing to the centre of Pennsylvania, Meade, abandoning Hooker's plan, spread
                  his army along the eastern side of the South Mountain, parallel to Lee's line,
                  determined to follow him to the Susquehanna and bring him to battle.
               But two marches had Meade made bringing his army up nearly abreast of Gettysburg,
                  somewhat to the east and south, east of it, when he had reason to believe that Lee
                  was concentrating on the east of South Mountain. Meade's left wing, three corps,
                  under Reynolds, advanced upon Gettysburg to discover the enemy, as well as to hide
                  the operations of the centre and right wing. While Buford was pricking and probing
                  the country with his cavalry, on the 29th of June, he rode into Gettysburg, and
                  was there stumbled upon the next day, June 30, by the advanced guard of the
                  Southern army. Thus the two armies approached each other, big with terrific
                  battle, as unconscious of the imminent shock as are two summer clouds, charged
                  with storms and moving upon opposite winds silently toward each other.
               Three days of battle there were;—one on the outlying hills beyond the town, and
                  two along the slopes and rocky crests south and east of Gettysburg;—three days, on
                  which the Southern army rolled in and broke upon the rock ridges of the North, as
                  spring tides moving with the power of the ocean behind them beat high and fierce
                  upon a rocky coast, and retreat again to the dark caves of the sea!
               This was a battle between the men of the tropics and the men of the temperate
                  zones. It was to be decided whether the gods of the valleys or the gods of the
                  hills were the mightier. The fat Southern soils, tilled by enforced labor, made
                  war on the rocks of the North, where men by hard labor had learned patience and
                  skill. Two battles there were waged in one. Principles were contending in the air,
                  while men were fighting on the ground. And when on the night of the fourth of
                  July, the army of the South sullenly and in the dark drew back from the farms of
                  Pennsylvania and retreated southward it was not alone the defeat of the army, but
                  far more of the political economy, the genius of government and the evil spirit of
                  a perverted religion, that had inspired the conflict and given moral significance
                  to the Rebellion.
               But we have overrun our story, or, rather, gone before to prepare a way for the
                  maiden's feet to tread.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER L.
               ON THE MARCH.
               A GREAT excitement filled Washington when it was known that Lee had entered
                  Pennsylvania. The darkness which had hung painfully over his movements was cleared
                  away. The sweep of Jenkins' cavalry, the rapid movement of Ewell upon the
                  Susquehanna, the opening of the rebel general's plans with such decision as
                  indicated his sense of power and confidence of victory were enough to account for
                  excitement. But an invasion was something new. The intrusion of Lee the year
                  before into Maryland scarcely punctured the rind of the Free States. But now it
                  was reaching at the core. Such an uproar was never known among the farmers of
                  Pennsylvania. The old Dutch settlers at last experienced a thrill Three years had
                  they probably been in doubt whether hostilities had broken out or not. They were
                  conservative men. They would not be carried away with rumors. Newspapers they
                  rarely saw, and then only to doubt them. But the cavalry raids, the sweeping up of
                  their stock the sudden departure of horses from the plough and wagon, and the
                  farewell cackles of expiring hens, were things to be believed. In fine, eighty
                  thousand men, with Lee at their head had power to drive a new idea into the heads
                  of the Pennsylvania Dutch around Gettysburg. But once in that idea of war wrought
                  mightily. They raised a clamor that filled the State. Like Munchausen's horn,
                  which, when hung near the fire, played all the tunes which had been frozen up in
                  it through the winter, so all those hopes and fears, doubts and 
                     enthusiams
                     enthusiasms
                  , which play out of common people's lives, but freeze up in the Dutch
                  mind of Southern Pennsylvania, were now thawed out by the fire of war into
                  clamorous racket, which went echoing through the cities of the country as if the
                  Last Day had indeed come!
               All manner of wild rumors filled Baltimore and Washington. As soon as Hooker's
                  army had crossed the Potomac, it was known to the Sanitary Commission that a great
                  battle must soon be fought. Energetic measures were taken to prepare succor for
                  the wounded. Wagons were loaded with clothing, food, cordials, blankets, tents,
                  and with all those numberless delicacies often so much better to the sick and
                  wounded than medicine. Nurses and ladies were summoned. It 
                     behoved
                     behooved
                   the Sanitary Commission to be on the ground as soon as a blow was
                  struck. This was its golden opportunity. Its mission was not to supersede the
                  Medical Department of the army, but, being more lithe and nimble, to anticipate
                  the regular unfolding of organized succor; to meet exigencies not otherwise
                  provided for; to fill up gaps and intervals, and to perform by the presence of
                  women as noble as ever ministered in temple or sanctuary, those offices of
                  consolation and Christian instruction to the dying, or desperately wounded which
                  transcended the functions of the Medical Department.
               Signs multiplied of urgent danger and impetuous haste. The great hour of Destiny
                  was advancing. The Departments of Government, the city of Washington and the whole
                  region round about were like a boiling caldron. As if more fuel was needed, Stuart
                  and his large body of cavalry sought to regain Lee's army, and, crossing the
                  Potomac at Seneca Creek, swept up through Maryland, flirting their wings in the
                  face of Washington and Baltimore as they passed, and stirring up all the region as
                  if they had been flying dragons.
               No wonder, when on the 28th of June the sentinels and citizens saw mounted men
                  looking right into the city of Washington, and then scuds of cavalry whirling
                  around Baltimore, that troops were on foot citizens armed and hastily rushed to
                  the lines of defence, and that a thousand rumors, mixing truth and the fictions of
                  fear, filled the air.
               Hiram Beers started forth with a line of eight wagons, to overtake the army.
                  Others were speedily to follow, while the railroads were to be employed, so soon
                  as the battle-field was determined, for the bulk of transportation. He took the
                  Rockville road aiming at Frederick, where in a conveyance of their own, Agate
                  Bissell was to meet him, with Rose and Alice. At Rockville he was warned to turn
                  back—the enemy filled the country. A train had just been seized and burnt.
               "That's lucky for me," said Hiram. "You don't see a cannon ball go through the
                  same hole twice. I guess the enemy hasn't made up his mind to stop, yet a while,
                  and if he's gobbled up trains ahead of
                  me, it stands to reason that he'll be gone afore I git there."
               "There's no tellin' stranger," said the old man who was informing him, "how many
                  there is of 'em. I hearn tell that the country's full on 'em. Jake Armistead has
                  been out, you know in the rebel army, though he's home now, and Union too, till
                  his wounds get well, and he sez, there must be nigh about ten
                  thousand, and that they cover the hull country thick as pigeons in acorn time. I
                  reckon stranger, that they'd like to take a look at your wagons."
               Hiram pushed his hat up a trifle, on his forehead, and drawing a knife out of his
                  pocket, as if utterly at ease, said, as he began slowly and smoothly to curl the
                  shavings off the edge of a white pine stick:
               "Thank'ee sir. I guess they've got something else to look after by this time. Why,
                  sir, there's twenty thousand troopers gone up after 'em from Washington, and
                  Hooker, he's got a hundred thousand men at Frederick, and there's a hundred
                  thousand more in Washington and Baltimore, and more comin' from the North every
                  hour."
               "More comin'?"
               "More? Why, you hain't begun to see yet. Fact is, the North is just wakin' up. We
                  ain't done nothing' yet but cut out the work. There's nobody gone hardly. You
                  wouldn't think there was a man missin'. But, now we see what's to do we are goin'
                  to send down a million men, right off."
               There had collected, by this time, quite a crowd around Hiram's teams and he was
                  improving the time while his horses ate oats to make a salutary impression on the
                  Maryland mind.
               An ex-rebel soldier seemed somewhat better informed:
               "Lee has got York, and Carlisle, and, in a day or two, he'll have Harrisburg, and
                  then look out for fun!"
               Hiram looked at him fixedly, as one who is in doubt whether he will impart a
                  secret:
               "Well, I guess it won't do no hurt to tell out now. But our folks jest left
                  Carlisle on purpose to tempt 'em—like toasted cheese in a trap; if Lee's nibblin',
                  you may depend on't, he'll find that he's caught."
               "Ah, old Yank, you can't come that over me. Lee's used to nibblin' Yankee cheese.
                  He ate some at Fredericksburg, and he's jest been nibblin' a pretty large cheese,
                  at Chancellorsville, and, by the time you'll get there I guess you'll find the old
                  rat has gnawed his way out."
               Nothing daunted by the laugh, Hiram, with a look of undisturbed confidence, just
                  little touched with pity for their ignorance, walked away toward his wagons.
               "Do you really think," said one of his drivers, in an anxious tone, "that it's
                  safe, to go on?"
               "Safe? what are you 'feard of? Lee is jest like a walnut in a nutcracker. They'll
                  smash him, sure."
               "I shouldn't care about bein' caught. A prisoner on foot trottin' along with
                  cavalry, don't feel as comfortable as if he was to hum!"
               "Is that so?" said Hiram very soberly.
               "Wal, it is. I tell ye—mebbe you hadn't tried it? I've travelled ye see, and don't
                  want to do it any more. The fust time—Mosby's men, they tuck me. Wal, one on 'em
                  took a fancy to my cap, and swapped. I got something to boot though," said the
                  driver beginning to scratch his head, "every time I think of that old felt hat
                  that he guv' me, somehow I feel like scratchin'. Another man, he wanted my shoes,
                  and I lent 'em. to him. They never cum back. Then one of the officers took a
                  likin' to my coat; and, at last, a darned rascal made me get out of my britches.
                  In less than five minutes I didn't know myself, and kept lookin' 'round to see
                  where I was. But I found out afore they'd done with me."
               "Wal," said Hiram, "drive on; I don't expect any body to catch me."
               "Nobody expects to be caught. You see, a feller is goin' along, drivin' his horses
                  and chawin' his tobacker thinkin' about the home folks, touchin' up fust one horse
                  and then another, when right ahead—fizz! bang! whang! bang! and then, behind in
                  the line, you hear it again—whang! bang!—and a hundred horsemen whirl in on you
                  cut out your wagons, and afore the soldiers can get up, twenty wagons are driving'
                  off like mad, and rebel soldiers a-prickin' the mules with bayonets, and afore you
                  fairly know which eend you stand on they're all in the mountains and you're
                  dividin' your clothes with the ragamuffins."
               
               Hiram laughed at the descriptive misery, but ordered forward the teams.
               "I've no idea of lettin' them Southern fellers have the handlin' of these goods.
                  Pretty business for our folks to set up nights to knit stockin's, and then have
                  the rebels put 'em on to fight our boys with! They didn't have an apple-parin' at
                  our town to make apple-sarse for Lee's army, I guess! Golly! what would Marm
                  Marble say if she should hear that the rebs had got her dried apples and punkins?
                  No, no; they shan't poke their nasty fingers into my sweetmeats. I didn't fetch
                  these nice liquors for their accommodation. Liquors is a good thing in its place.
                  But, as a general thing, I'm of opinion that the very worst place you can put good
                  liquors into is a fuller's stomach! If a feller's been tapped with a bullet that
                  may make a difference. But I don't believe the Lord ever made that hole in a man's
                  face to pour liquor through."
               "Wal," said one of his men, "then there's been an amazin' oversight somewhere.
                  There's been a sight of liquor got through the wrong place, then!"
               Hiram got safely to Frederick, and met there the agents and ladies of the
                  Commission. But Meade had been gone a day. The order then was to follow up the
                  army and to keep within easy reach of it.
               The next morning the whole party were on the road. Hiram expressed himself on the
                  subject of armies:
               "If there ever was any thing that beat all creation in bein' expensive, it's an
                  army. It runs off property as fast as a river does water. It's waste, waste,
                  waste! Enough is trod under foot every day to feed a town, and when they're
                  marchin', they're wuss than buffaloes in a corn-field. But the hind end of an army
                  is about the most disagreeable place that I know on. The stragglers, and traders,
                  and rascals, strain through, and leave a welt of dirt for miles and miles behind.
                  I couldn't sleep a wink last night. Frederick was chuck-full of roarin', drinkin'
                  fellers, fightin' and yellin'. I think the hind-end of an army is more dangerous
                  than its fore-end. It's like Gran'ther Morse's old musket, that would tear you to
                  pieces if you were before it, and kick you to pieces if you stood behind it. The
                  only place where it was safe was hangin' up over the fire-place to bum. An army is
                  a very dangerous gerous thing, anyhow, and awful extravagant. I s'pose we must
                  fight it through now, though. Don't see no other way. But if ever this war's over
                  I'm goin' to jine an Everlastin' Peace Society."
               As the party journeyed on, at every mile evidences multiplied that the army was
                  not far away. Stragglers abounded. The main army seemed to have done no damage.
                  One would not, except for the beaten roads, and some little invasion of fields the
                  breaking here and there of a cherry branch whose luscious fruit tempted its own
                  fate, have dreamed that eighty thousand men had passed; but, after the army came
                  the herd of stragglers. They robbed houses stole horses from the stables, and in
                  drunken knots caroused or threatened those who were weak.
               Rose looked out upon the wondrous brightness of those June days—no it was the
                  first of July—marvelling in her thoughts—how the engineer of death could be moving
                  through all this peace and beauty to its dreaded work. The sky was deep. Drifting
                  through it in profound leisure drifting so slowly and gently that they hardly
                  seemed to move, were soft and small clouds. So long had Rose now been trained in
                  scenes of pain and terror that her heart knew its own courage; and though there
                  was in the very air, and through all its brightness, a certain sadness, as if
                  already she felt the horrors of that distant battle whose sounds, though it was
                  already begun were not heard, Rose's thoughts floated peacefully as those flecks
                  of brilliant cloud, dazzling white, mixed with shades and shadows.
               "Rootless and stemless, ye grow, O clouds! The winds that roar upon forests shake
                  no sounds out of your silent forms. Without seed or sowing, ye grow. Ye wither
                  without frost, or the axe and pass away in an hour. Ye grow alike in winter as in
                  summer, and shake down from your boughs drops or flakes in both seasons. Yet no
                  man may plant you, nor till you, nor play husbandry in the realm where ye
                  dwell."
               "I s'pose you're thinkin', Miss Rose," said Hiram, "that it's time to have
                  something to eat. Well, I shouldn't wonder if 'twas."
               "Yes, Hiram, I was thinking of harvests but not exactly such as could be
                  eaten."
               "Well, I'll see what can be done. The fact is the soldiers are yonder fillin' all the road, and I don't believe we
                  can git along much further. You wait a bit and I'll go and see."
               In a moment Rose was dreaming again, with her face turned toward the clouds.
               "Out of such stillness of white come storms! Ye are the mothers of thunder! Hidden
                  there is the lightning! Now Ye are palaces of silence but to-morrow all the sounds
                  of storm shall resound among you! And so out of men's loving hearts comes hatred
                  and out of men's consciences comes war, and all that makes peace beautiful changes
                  in battle to mighty wrath, to awful cruelty, to remorseless slaughter. Even
                  now—who knows?—while I look upon this serene heaven, Barton, perhaps, is in the
                  heat of fight; it may be he lies wounded or dying, because no one binds up his
                  wounds—"
               "What on earth's the matter, Miss Rose—are ye cryin'?" said Hiram, and without
                  waiting for an answer he went on—"It's no time for cryin' now—the battle is goin'
                  on. We've heerd from Gettysburg—some say it's all on our side, and some say
                  t'other way, and nobody knows any thing about it. But the headquarters is movin',
                  and the whole army is goin' ahead. If you mean to get there tonight we must be
                  stirring, I can tell ye."
               Rose consulted with the agents of the Commission in charge of the company, and it
                  was considered useless to attempt to force their way along the roads by which the
                  army was moving, already choked up with artillery, supply trains, and the troops.
                  In their perplexity Hiram started out to explore. He soon returned. With him came
                  also a military man of distinguished bearing. A staff officer rode by his side,
                  and a colored man stood at a little distance grinning and looking at Rose in the
                  most extraordinary manner.
               An outcry from Alice was Barton Cathcart's introduction. She sprung out of the
                  carriage and threw herself into his arms with impassioned fondness. He looked down
                  upon his sister with a look of the proudest love. For a moment the blood left
                  Rose's cheek, but then came again with a rebound.
               "Oh! Barton," said Alice "to see you here in this strange place, is like a breath
                  from home. But there is Rose coming to you."
               Rose's first impulse was not to intrude upon him. Her next and better thought was,
                  "It is Barton, my childhood friend," and in a moment every other thought was gone,
                  and with a gladness scarcely less demonstrative than Alice's, Rose reached both
                  her hands to Barton. But he was more embarrassed. Rose's warmth of manner seemed
                  to touch him. He had prepared for a more formal meeting.
               "This is very kind, Miss Wentworth."
               "No, no, Barton—I am not Miss Wentworth—to you—I am Rose; the same names which we
                  used in childhood, if you please."
               A throng of memories crowded his mind. His heart was like a vortex in which strong
                  feelings whirled. He would have spoken, but seemed like one who hesitates which of
                  many things to say first. He fixed upon Rose a look so full of inquiry, and yet so
                  imploring and hungry, a look full of eagerness and helplessness, that Rose to her
                  dying day never forgot it. Words are of the flesh, opaque. Looks are of the
                  spirit, luminous.
               The pause was embarrassing. Rose first plucked up her voice and said:
               "Barton, we are going with you. Can we get along in time, on this route or shall
                  we be delayed? The roads are choked up with the army."
               "You had better keep with my Division. We are pushing on with all our might. The
                  day has gone wrong, and we must all be up to-night."
               There was time but for a few words hurried and almost incoherent. In a moment
                  Barton was gone. It was a dream! They awake to see him disappear among the throngs
                  beyond!
               It was late before they reached the vicinity of Gettysburg. All the way Barton's
                  look dwelt with Rose. The most emphatic revelations of the soul are made through
                  glances of the eye. By the looks only can the soul signify complex
                  experiences—hope, fear, yearning, love, sad and sorrowful—and all in an instant.
                  These revelations of the soul's inmost life will not be incarnated in the rude
                  materials of common language. But a look is almost as immaterial as a thought. A
                  glance is a fit incarnation of a thing so tender as love. Not what they say do we
                  remember of absent friends; but how they looked while saying it. We live upon the
                  media of the expressions of the face more than of the tongue. The silences which speech carries along
                  with it are often more emphatic than the words.
               By a side road Hiram had got his party out from the tangle of the Taneytown road,
                  and was making his way over to the Baltimore turnpike. Although the moon was of
                  some slight help, yet, by eight o'clock, the jaded horses and scarcely less jaded
                  company were glad to find a farm-house where they might sleep. By the faint
                  moonlight Hiram described a palace of a barn near at hand.
               "Aha!" said Hiram, "there is a Dutch barn. Now we shall stumble over the hovel
                  pretty soon."
               "Why, what do you mean?" said Agate.
               "I mean," replied Hiram, "that them Pennsylvania Dutch think more of their horses
                  than they do of themselves. A feller travelling round here awhile almost wishes he
                  was a horse. The houses are mean; the barns are magnificent."
               Hiram, for once, had to take back his words, for they approached a large and
                  comely farm-house, which would have done no discredit to the elm homes of Now
                  England. Every thing about it was still. Though it was not yet nine o'clock, not a
                  light was burning.
               "I guess," said Hiram "that they're gone out to see the sights. 'Tain't every day
                  that a Dutchman sees an army. I guess they think the day of judgment is come. They
                  will if there's much fightin' to-morrow."
               He was again mistaken. The family were abed and soundly asleep. A rap at the door
                  brought the owner out of bed, and his honest face to the door.
               "Can we git leave to stay here tonight?" said Hiram.
               "'Why, of course you can. Come right in! Women?—why, women?—out this time o'
                  night? That's too bad. Mary! Mary, I say!"
               By this time his good wife Mary came forth, the smiles endeavoring to chase the
                  sleepiness off from her face as she was tying a string here, or buttoning there,
                  or hooking up her dress behind.
               "Seems to me your abed early, uncle, aren't ye?" said Hiram.
               "Wal—pretty. But we go to bed early; we get up early, too."
               "Liked to have got up this time 'fore you got to bed," said Hiram, winking.
               "Yes, yes, yes," said the honest old farmer, with an unmeaning laugh.
               "Don't you know the army's all round you?"
               "Yes; but they don't touch nuthin'. They're welcome to't if they do."
               "How far is it to town?"
               "Wal—'bout three miles; three and a half—say four miles. Depends a little on which
                  way you go."
               After Hiram had seen to the horses he followed the sounds, and soon came upon the
                  wagon trains parked for the night. The rumbling of artillery still was heard in
                  the roads near by. Reserve artillery and ammunition trains had turned into fields
                  on either side of the road. Soldiers were still crowding onward. They moved
                  silently, as men who were tired with long and rapid marching.
               He came across a part of the cavalry that had that morning been engaged, and
                  picked up, some scraps of the fight as they had seen it. He inquired for the
                  hospitals, toward which in the morning, he was to go. An officer with his head
                  bandaged, gave him the information.
               Buford's Cavalry and Wadsworth's Division of Reynolds' corps had held the heads of
                  Hill and Longstreet's corps, coming from Chambersburgh, in check, and gained some
                  advantage. But about noon Ewell's corps coming in on the Union right, brought
                  great disaster and even rout upon them. The whole left wing had barely saved
                  itself, but now was holding the high ground south and east of Gettysburg. This was
                  the first day's fight. Hiram returned to the house, and after a generous supper
                  the party were glad to retire. The day had been fatiguing enough. The morrow would
                  try them yet more.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LI.
               GETTYSBURG.
               LONG before sunrise on the Wednesday morning of the second of July, our party were
                  astir. Early as they were, the good housewife was before them, and a bountiful
                  breakfast awaited them. After the farmer's wife had learned from Agate the
                  business which took such beautiful ladies, as Rose and Alice seemed to her eyes,
                  to the battle-field, she could not do enough for them; and as they parted from
                  her, the good old farmer said to them:
               "We live some ways from Gettysburg; but if any of your friends are wounded, or you
                  want to send any body else here, it's a quiet place, and we've got enough, and
                  we'll take the best care we can of them. So, remember, if you can't do any better,
                  won't you?"
               Thanking them heartily for their kindness which was in marked contrast with the
                  brutal demeanor of the Dutch farmers around Gettysburg on those awful days, they
                  were leaving, when, having talked a moment with his wife, he came back and
                  said:
               "I reckon I'd better go 'long with you a spell. I know some crooks and turns that
                  may better your road. By what my men say, the main roads have been full all night,
                  and soldiers are still crowdin' up to the front. I expect there will be powerful
                  fightin' to-day, and I'll go up. Maybe I can help the wounded folks, if I don't
                  fight myself. That ain't my trade."
               Sure enough, the roads were blocked; but their honest farmer friend, by lanes, and
                  through cart roads in the wood, and by crossing sown fields, brought them, at
                  last, to the rear of that long line of rocky hills, whose crest and westward slope
                  was already crowded with soldiers.
               Not a syllable of disrespect did they receive from soldiers or camp followers. In
                  many instances cheers were raised for them, and "God bless you" was showered upon
                  them by regiments and brigades who had seen them on other battle-fields. Indeed,
                  there were few regiments in the army of the Potomac where Agate Bissell's name was
                  not known and honored. At certain points, where bodies of soldiers were at rest,
                  the men flocked around them and shook bands with them as old friends.
               "What's all that?" said a soldier of the — Pennsylvania to one of his comrades who
                  saw the stir and heard some cheering around their carriage.
               "What is it? Why, it's the old one with her two doves. There ain't many boys in
                  this regiment that don't know Mother Bissell and the Rose of Norwood!
               With that a bright, lithe young fellow sprung toward the party with all the
                  eagerness of a child. But, as he came up and was not recognized, he almost sulked
                  like a pouting boy:
               "Why, don't you know me, Aunty Bissell? I'm your Willie?"
               Agate turned upon him a quick look.
               "Take off your cap! Why, Willie Woolsy! I never should have known you!"
               And then, patting his head and smiling proudly on him, she said:
               "Why, Willie how you have improved! how fat and rosy you are! I never should
                  imagine that you were that poor, pale boy that I snatched from the very hands of
                  death, I do believe!"
               And so, one by one, scores of men came in for a word, whom these women had
                  succored on the battle-field, or nursed in the hospitals, or transported on
                  steamers on the Potomac to Washington, or fed and clothed at various times and
                  different places. This did not seem like the greetings of a field of carnage; it
                  was more like a home-greeting.
               The forenoon wore rapidly away. The hospital camps were selected. The Sanitary
                  Commission had been able to secure no transportation on the railroad; and
                  fortunate it was that—thanks to Hiram Beers' enterprise—so many wagons had been
                  got through. and so large a store of articles was on hand.
               All through the forenoon, the distant sound of skirmish-firing was faintly heard.
                  It rose and rippled on the air, and died away. Again, from another quarter, it
                  pattered for a half hour, and gradually died out like an expiring drum-beat. Noon
                  came; and no battle. All was suspense. No one that they could reach could give the
                  information. Would Lee retreat? or was not Meade willing to give battle?
               
               The afternoon wore on. The wounded of the day before were in Gettysburg or beyond,
                  or, if brought behind the Northern lines, it was three miles to the north of the
                  position chosen by the Commission for the first station.
               It was after two o'clock. They were resting. Suddenly the great hulking body of
                  Pete Sawmill rose up before them; and Pete, gurgling and laughing, seemed
                  overjoyed to see his old friends.
               "Well done! as sure as soot," said Agate, "here's our Pete! I'm as glad to see
                  your homely black face, Pete, as if you was as white as snow!"
               Pete reached out his great hand to each of them, giving to each of them in turn
                  one down motion that seemed likely to take their arms out of the socket, and
                  giggling and laughing, in a way more silly than usual. He sidled up to Rose, with
                  the most foolish look of affection, and began to move his hands in the air, as if
                  he was taking up a child, or patting and playing with some invisible dog.
               "Why, you poor old soul," said Agate, "we are all as glad to see you Pete, as if
                  you belonged to us."
               "He, he, he! I guess I do. I don't b'long to nobody else, except the gin'ral."
               "Where is Barton?" said Alice and Rose almost in the same breath.
               "You see them woody hummocks yonder?"
               "Yes."
               "Well, the general he's along beyond them, furder up, up toward that way, and a
                  leetle over."
               This very luminous description was given with a serious, solemn air, for Pete's
                  heart in every battle was much moved at the danger into which Barton Cathcart
                     would throw himself.
               "He's allers runnin' to find it and fetch it. He might jest as well wait. Ye see,
                  danger will come itself when they're fightin' such allfired battles."
               "Pete," said Rose, "do you think we could see Barton's position if we were to go
                  on to that hill?"
               "Sartain; I'll take you." Pete seemed as if he were literally about to take Rose
                  as in the old days when she rode upon his shoulder.
               Rose laughed and dashed past him nimbly, on her way to the edge of Little Round
                  Top. As she ascended the ridge the scene began to open upon her.
               On reaching the summit, the view was obstructed by the fringe of woods through
                  which the road passed. But by climbing a little to the south of the road, Rose
                  obtained a clear view of the ridge on whose slopes lay the Northern army,
                  extending from where she stood two miles north toward Gettysburg, which, from this
                  point, was tucked up so close to the northern head of the ridge that only the
                  western skirts of the village could be Seen, fringing out into the valley. A mile
                  and more across from where she stood looking west, was a range of low and rounded
                  hills forest-clad in spots, or dotted with orchards. On the southern half of the
                  line they were so carved out by the wear of waters for ages, that they seemed like
                  huge beads half buried in the ground; but further north, and over against
                  Gettysburg, the terrace was less scarped and ran with an easier slope. Above and
                  beyond these hills, to the westward, rose others, and wide strips of forest, and
                  ten miles away the blue mass of the South Mountains banked up against the
                  horizon.
               Between the two low-lying ridges on which the armies lay was a mile-wide valley,
                  its southern half much filled up with rolling hills, and cut into with dells and
                  tangles of wood and rock. The upper half, or that nearest Gettysburg, was scooped
                  out and smoother. Along the line of swells between these two sorts of valley had
                  been placed the left wing of Meade's army, forming an angle of about 45 degrees
                  with the ridge on which the rest of the army lay.
               To crush this leg thrust out from the body, as it were, and to seize the lower
                  part of the ridge which the left should have occupied, was Lee's whole aim in the
                  second day's battle. For four hours the fight here raged with excessive violence.
                  The best troops of both armies were in the struggle. Neither before or since has
                  there been more thorough fighting, of all arms, with heroic tenacity and an
                  indomitable will that did not know how to let go. And when darkness ended the
                  conflict, the Northern troops, though on the whole worsted, had been only pushed
                  back to their true position along the ridge, with the natural fortresses of Great
                  Round Top and Little Round Top inexpugnably guarding the left of their line. But
                  this is in anticipation.
               Pete had followed Rose with more than usual gravity. He seemed like an uneasy hound that smells something
                  in the distance that disquiets him. It is true that Pete had no conception of the
                  construction of an army, nor is it probable that he could have been made to
                  understand strategy, or tactics, in any proper and scientific way of stating them.
                  But Pete was an innate hunter. He had all the intuitions and inspirations which
                  belong to the venatorial art. In their ground forms these are not far from the
                  science of warfare.
               What are two armies but two huge animals that are hunting each other?—each,
                  concealing its own movements and spying out the other's—creeping, watching,
                  feigning, waiting for some unguarded moment, or indefensible posture, to spring
                  with concentrated strength and loud roar upon the other! In a vague and rude, way
                  Pete felt some such battle instinct. He watched the hills opposite.
               "There they are!"
               "Who?"
               "Why the Rebs—don't you see 'em?"
               "Where do you mean?" said Rose, shading her eyes with her hand.
               "Right over in the edge of them woods—don't you see the light flash? That's the
                  sun shinin' on their guns. There 'tis ag'in! Them woods is jest full. Don't you
                  see, clear away there, on the left—them lines like? that's them too. I don't like
                  it."
               "Well Pete, are not our soldiers there too?"
               "Don't you see? there's our boys eight across yonder. Them d— rebels!" said Pete,
                  waxing irreverently warm, "will be creepin' round behind 'em. I don't like it! I
                  don't like it!"
               And then Pete, uneasily, like a hound, again changed his position and, posting his
                  muzzle out toward the scene of impending conflict, looked intently upon the
                  fields.
               "Pete, what ought they to do?" said Rose innocently, to her humble companion, and
                  with as much faith in his judgment as if he were some black Napoleon.
               "I dun know. I expect they better come back here."
               The scuds of white cloud that held their indolent course through the air early in
                  the morning were now all gone away, and had left the heavens unscarred and
                  unfurrowed. The sun now, half way down from the meridian, shot back floods of
                  light along the path it had just travelled, but could not change its blue. Far up,
                  the vault was paled a little, but blue it was—clear, tender blue. But, nearer the
                  ground and along the horizon, the ruddy sunlight flooded all things with a
                  peculiar golden hue. The air seemed rich, the earth dreamy, and the landscape that
                  lay before Rose's eye seemed to her imagination as if in a tranquil meditation.
                  The distant jets of white smoke, the faint reports of sharpshooters' rifles, or
                  occasional ripples of skirmishers' firing seemed only like the pleasing of a
                  tranquil sea upon the shore—sound just enough to make stillness palpable. Every
                  thing conspired to fill Rose with imaginations contrasting with the impending
                  scenes. A wood-thrush not far from her, in a solitary clump of trees, was singling
                  in a plaintive way to an answering thrush beyond. An oriole flew into a near tree,
                  and sang shrill as a clarionet. Flowers were thick among the stones. A bush of
                  sassafras stood just at her hand, and she was almost unconsciously breaking off
                  the tender and fragrant tips to refresh her mouth.
               Rose had risen into that state of imagination in which outward things begin to
                  take on the colors of one's own thoughts, and to stand dressed in human feelings.
                  The whole heavens above her head said to her, "There is no war in me!" the whole
                  valley answered "It is peace with me!" the woods about her—the fragrant smell of
                  pine and spicy bushes,—the birds singing, and squirrels running nimbly across her
                  path or jerking their tails on the safe edges of rocks,—all were so many tokens of
                  peace!
               Suddenly, right over against her, came a peal of thunder! Up rose a curling wreath
                  of smoke. Quickly, through it flashed fierce forks of flame; loud and
                  earth-shaking roars came like the rolls of surf upon the shore, in quick
                  succession. The battle had begun! It opened with no spattering shots, bringing out
                  gradually growling volleys. It struck a deep note of thunder at first, and then
                  kept to that awful pitch through four murderous hours!
               Rose was fixed and fascinated. She could not withdraw her eyes from that which she
                  dreaded to see. Lines of men came forth from the woods. They were met with sheeted
                  flame, and withered and shrunk back. They were but the first line. Right on behind
                  them came Longstreet's masses, that were not to be daunted—fire-proved, annealed
                  in scores of battles! Little could Rose see but the general aspect. The loyal
                  lines bore up stoutly and well. They
                  were pushed and bent; but, like a trusty bow, sprung back again. The conflict
                  became many-sided. Far onward to the left of the Union lines emerged the
                  Confederate troops. New batteries seemed to spring up every where; and battle,
                  like forks of flame in a burning town, kindling wherever a spark fell, flashed
                  forth, from point to point, on every swell of land—in the groves—through wheat
                  fields—but, more than all, right over against her, where the heaven was ablaze
                  with artillery, and irresistible masses of Confederate soldiers broke down
                  Sickles' centre and drove back his men from Sherfy's peach-orchard. For an hour,
                  which seemed an age, she gazed. Troops were hastening from Hancock and from
                  Slocum, drawn from the centre and right, to brace up the broken lines. The fight
                  was creeping up from below to the very hill where she stood.
               A division of Northern troops was passing the very road on which she had come.
                  Suddenly a brigade was swung off from it and began to ascend Little Round Top. She
                  hasted down. It was a new sight that she had beheld.
               She was used to every form of wounds in men brought off from the field. She had
                  even been along the edge of fights, but it was when the combats raged in muffling
                  woods and thickets. She had never stood where the whole field lay open, where the
                  two armies stretched out their masses in visible opposition and the whole work of
                  destruction could be seen. She turned away, and hastened by the road, which
                  running from the very ground of conflict, hugged Little Round Top where she had
                  been standing; and moved toward the hospital ground of the corps. Within a half
                  hour, men began to come over the ridge wounded, but yet able to get out of the
                  battle. Their numbers increased.
               Who shall describe the roar of battle? If one will know the mechanism and anatomy
                  of battle, let him read our American Napier.*
                   If he would see a gorgeous picture of the out-playing of this anatomy, the
                  army charge, the tough and tugging flight the swirl and hurricane, let him read
                  the brilliant picture-writing of the military Doré of America.†
                   But who shall describe the shadow of the battle? Who shall picture the
                  battle of the hospital? Who shall make into history what passes before the nurses
                  and surgeons?
               
                  
                  *William Swinton.
               
               
                  
                  †G. A. Townsend.
               
               The place chosen for the hospital proved to be in the line of fire and shot and
                  shell soon came down into the very tents, and men who had escaped the battle and
                  cleared its skirts were reached and slain under the surgeon's hands. Another place
                  was chosen. But scarcely had the surgeon's tables been set before whistling balls
                  drove them thence. A third place, nearly astride of Rock Creek was finally
                  established. The wounded men were now pouring in in fearful numbers. Long lines of
                  men lying on the ground covered the space. No tents were spread. The field
                  hospital was literally but a field. A thousand men, in less than an hour and a
                  half! and more streaming in from every direction.
               One of the chief needs of wounded men is drink and sustenance. Along the roads by
                  which they came in the Commission had stationed women and men to supply to the
                  fainting and overspent, as they passed, both nourishment and stimulants. Rose
                  suggested to Agate that the point which she had that afternoon visited would be
                  well situated for a station. Fires were built, hot tea and coffee were kept in
                  full supply, milk punch, wines, and other stimulants were at hand. Many who had
                  climbed thus far, but were exhausted, were here revived by welcome nourishment and
                  shuffled over the hill to the hospital fields.
               No sooner had Rose found some active work to do than all her fancies fled and she
                  settled back into a stern, practical woman, who could look upon wounds, wash and
                  cleanse therm, bind them up, cheer the desperately wounded and suffering. She had
                  that happiest of constitutions one which generated an endless supply of nervous
                  force. With danger she grew calm, and her spirits rose with every perilous
                  exigency. And after days and nights of almost continual service, Rose's body, fed
                  by some inward supply, seemed as fresh and nimble as at the beginning.
               "How can you endure so much and hold out so long?" was often asked.
               But she could never reply, except to say:
               "God gives me strength according to my need."
               While Rose was engrossed in supplying the suffering, Hiram appeared from over the
                  hill with the ambulance corps, aiding the wounded but chiefly engaged in scolding
                  Alice. Rose had, for an hour or two, missed her, and supposed that she had gone
                  back over the bill toward the corps hospital. Instead of that, Alice had quietly ventured forward. Pete carried
                  her effects, and acted as her body-guard; and, lured by some fascination, Alice
                  had ventured down almost upon the edge of battle—outrunning, at last, the boldest
                  of the ambulance corps, encouraging the stretcher-bearers to come on; for, so
                  terrible had been the fire here that the men whose duty it was to succor and bear
                  away the wounded, shrank from the spot. All the stores which Pete could carry were
                  soon consumed, Alice was urging the attendants to more venturesomeness, when the
                  cloud of battle, which had bent and moved outward, suddenly came raining back. A
                  large body of Virginia troops were pressing back our lines. Just then, speeding to
                  the succor of our men, came a division of the Second Corps. It was at the moment
                  of onset that Alice liked to have been swept into the battle, whose bloody spray
                  dashed up to her very feet. Just then some one snatched her by the arm and
                  violently dragged her back.
               "What on airth ails ye? Do you want to be killed? What sort of a
                  place do you call this for a handsome woman? Come out o' this! Come, come, I say!
                  If this ain't craziness! Never mind, I swow you're a brave girl! By jimminy, I
                  never thought ye had so much in you!"
               Just then the spiteful whirl of bullets over their heads renewed Hiram's
                  alarm.
               "For God's sake duck!—duck your head!—get in behind here! What a fool you be. No
                  need on't. What business had you out there?"
               "What business had the soldiers there Hiram?" said Alice with an intense
                  solemnity.
               "It's their business to fight; that's their place."
               "It's my business to relieve the wounded men who have been fighting for you and
                  for me."
               "Well, you might wait till the men fetched 'em out."
               "Hiram, the ambulance men shrunk; their very officers hid. I saw them run away. If
                  they had had a brother there, and—and—a brother there—they would have been
                  bolder."
               As soon as the danger lulled, Hiram could not refuse his admiration; but the
                  moment shot began to whiz and swirl about her, he fell to scolding Alice
                  again:
               "You are a brave girl, anyhow. You ought to have been a soldier. I'm proud of your
                  pluck. Gosh! look out—there come shells and shot—a pretty place for a woman! You
                  want a gardeen over you. I wonder you'd be such a fool. There, then, now we're
                  kind o' behind this swell they won't hit us. I vow, Alice, but you've arnt an
                  epilet to-day."
               When Alice saw Rose, she ran to her with a piercing cry:
               "Oh, oh, oh Rose! I have seen him. I have seen —!"
               "Who? Barton?"
               "Yes; but not him. I've seen Heywood. He was rushing in at the head of his men
                  just as Barton came up. Oh, it is dreadful that he is fighting on the rebel side!
                  But, oh, how noble he looked! In that awful whirlpool of war he looked as
                  beautiful as when he sat in our blue-room!"
               "But did you see Barton?" said Rose, almost in a terror. "Was he there?"
               "Yes—he was rushing right against them. There was an awful crash. Oh God! I hope
                  Heywood is safe."
               Rose, trembling, could scarcely sustain herself but in a moment her courage came
                  again.
               "Alice, think only of Barton. He is your brother! May God preserve those who are
                  defending the right, and send speedy overthrow to those who would destroy their
                  Government!"
               Alice only shuddered, but made no reply.
               The sun went down, but still the battle raced in the twilight. The left of the
                  Union army, much twisted and bruised, had been shoved back and sadly rent, but, on
                  the whole, had secured a better ground than it had lost; and at eight o'clock the
                  sounds of battle died away on this part of the field; though far away, to the
                  Union right, for a half hour longer the conflict sounded on. But by nine o'clock
                  there was silence. Yes, with more than four thousand men a silence which should
                  not be broken till the last trump!
               In the two days, the Union army had lost, in killed, wounded, and missing, nearly
                  twenty thousand men. An equal loss, doubtless the enemy had sustained. And the
                  third great day was yet to come.
               That night, within a circle of five miles diameter there were from both armies
                  together between twenty and thirty thousand wounded men! All farmhouses and barns
                  were filled. Every sheltered field was covered with sufferers. Hospital touched hospital. If one had come from the
                  north behind Round Top, the first field hospital would have seemed to contain the
                  wounded of the whole battle; but at every mile, round toward Gettysburg, he would
                  meet another, and another, until he would wonder what could be left of the
                  fighting army which had shaken off from its boughs such another arm of withered
                  men! And if the circuit were continued, Gettysburg was full; and, moving over upon
                  the western ridges, where the Confederate army lay, the same mighty trail of blood
                  held on its way. And thus some thirty thousand men welded together by blood,
                  twined around the great central armies like a gory belt!
               The fighting was ended. The great toil of mercy was but just begun. All night
                  long, men were brought in. Parties scoured the fields hunting for the wounded.
                  Many had crept out of the storm of battle and hidden under fences, or among rocks
                  or in thickets, and their strength failing, they could neither come forth or make
                  known their presence. Hundreds died whom prompt succor might have saved. When the
                  moon rose and threw its faint light through the moving scuds of cloud, there might
                  have been seen many a stalwart fellow fast fainting unto death. Some clasped in
                  their hands the photograph of wife and children, some of lover; and they were
                  found dead in the morning, the last smile yet lingering on their manly
                  features.
               The hospitals enlarged their bounds through all the adjacent fields. The barns in
                  the neighborhood had been taxed for straw; but he was fortunate who had under him
                  any thing but the fresh grass half covered with a blanket.
               Hundreds of wounded rebels had been captured, and lay among our men, subject to
                  the same kindness. In the hospital there was peace. Wounds were counted as
                  amicable settlements.
               The South, impulsive and unrestrained in the expression of feeling, the North,
                  grave and self-contained, more apt to repress than to show feeling—both carried
                  into battle and into the hospital their peculiarities. The Southern brigades,
                  impetuous and fiery, charged yelling and noisy. The Northern men, sometimes
                  hurrahing, yet oftener sternly silent, put their feelings into blows.
               The Rebel wounded groaned and cried out. The surgeon's knife let loose their
                  tongues. The Northern wounded lay quiet, suppressed the groans, fighting their
                  pains as stubbornly and silently as they had fought the rebels.
               Yet it was not all sad in the field hospitals. The slightly wounded kept up
                  excellent spirits. After their hurts were dressed and they were washed and
                  refreshed with food and cordials, they became cheerful and chatty. One might have
                  heard in the early night hundreds of narratives which they were recounting to each
                  other some sad and some grotesque, and some even gay.
               Poor Agate for once quite lost her self-possession and burst into tears like a
                  child when towards sundown, an ambulance brought in that fair Willie, who that
                  morning had so joyously greeted her. A ball cutting across his face had put out
                  both his eyes. But he was going on in a path where one needs no eyesight!
               "Aunty Bissell—is this you?" he said in a gentle,
                  plaintive voice.
               "Yes, Willie, it is. God bless you, poor child; and as Agate stooped to kiss his
                  pale face, her tears dropped upon his cheeks. He could shed no more tears.
               "Oh, don't leave me! Stay with me won't you? Do take hold of my hand. Say
                  something to me. I shall die! Oh mother, mother, mother! Aunty, don't leave me. Do
                  say something to me!"
               Agate bowed down by his side and while the cannon were yet sounding in the
                  distance and the air filled with departing souls, she sent up a fervent prayer for
                  the lad.
               But others needed care. She hurried from one to another, returning often to speak
                  to Willie, finding him each time weaker, and always whispering either a petition
                  or his mother's name. At the very last, as it grew dark his mind flickered and
                  seemed working at some childhood remembrance.
               "Now I lay me down," said he, in a whisper—"now I lay me—what? mother? now I—now
                  I—."
               Then for a little while he only whispered; and when Agate next came to him, all
                  his battles were ended in an eternal victory.
               Rose was struck with one man's experience. A bluff and brawny man he looked.
               "Wal," said he to some who had been asking him about the conflict, "I remember while we was in Sharfy's
                  peach-orchard, and the firin' was just beginnin', that a sparrow was singin' in a
                  peach-tree. R-r-rip went the rifles. That shet him up. But he began agin. Wh—ang!
                  went the cannon, and for about five minutes they fired and he fired, they fired
                  and he fired back again. But I b'lieve at last they got the upperhand of that
                  sparrow! Queer wasn't it? I don't remember nothin' else—only it seems as if I had
                  been squirmin' about in a whirlwind of red-hot rain for about a couple of
                  hours."
               Hiram reappeared after an hour's absence, about ten o'clock at night. He had been
                  hunting for Pete, he said.
               "For Pete?" said Alice. "Why didn't you hunt for Barton?
               "That's the way to hunt for Barton! If any body'd know
                  where Barton was, Pete would."
               "Well, did you find Pete?" said Alice.
               "Yes I did."
               "Hiram, why don't you tell me if you saw Barton?"
               "Cos you didn't ask me," said Hiram. "Of course I saw him. Do you s'pose I should
                  have been grinnin' about here if Barton was missin'?"
               "Has he escaped—and not been hurt?"
               "Sound as a nut—pretty well tired though. I guess he's blue too. Sent his love to
                  you, Alice, and good-bye to all the rest, if he never sees you again; would come
                  over, but has jest got word that he may have to move over to the eight wing there
                  by daylight to-morrow morning, to drive out a parcel of rebs that's crept in
                  unawares like."
               "Thank God, he is safe," said Rose.
               Alice seemed lost in thought.
               Meanwhile, though greatly tired out, Hiram said he would take a little turn around
                  among the men—which meant to keep on his feet till past midnight, in various
                  helpful offices. It was about midnight when he lay down near a fire, around which
                  sat or lay a score or two of wounded men. He heard them talking of their day's
                  work. A sergeant in the 146th New York was talking:
               "I had 'nuff on't too. 'Twas my regiment that was in the brigade that charged in
                  to support Sickles. And we did support him too. And we hadn't more'n time to turn
                  round after that charge before they told us to go at Little Round Top, and we did
                  go at it, and we took that too. Charged bayonets twice within fifteen minutes. And
                  what was the queerest thing, out of that regiment of 800 men we didn't lose but
                  thirty-three in them two charges. But most o'them was officers. In that charge up
                  Little Round Top there happened to be one platoon of rebel sharpshooters in the
                  place, and jest in them two or three minits they picked off our colonel, our
                  leftenant-colonel three cap'ns—the cap'n o' my comp'ny 'n both leftenants, 'n I
                  do' no how many more. I found myself in command o' that comp'ny pretty sudden.
               "Well, after the hottest o' that fightin' was over, I lay down behind a rock and
                  went to sleep; told my second-sargeant to wake me up if there was any thing. Well,
                  pretty soon somebody came 'n waked me up, 'n said Gen. Warren wanted to see
                  me.
               "You see, where we was was jest before brigade-headquarters; and, right on top of
                  the position there was a great big high rock that had a view all over the whole
                  field. 'Way down in front o' that, there was a kind of a valley like, all full o'
                  rough ground. There was one place in it they called the Devil's Den. 'Twan't
                  nothin' but rocks,—a reg'lar nest on 'em—big boulders standin' up endways, ledges,
                  and all sorts o' things. Now a lot o' rebel sharpshooters they'd got into them
                  rocks, and the was awaiting. There couldn't a hat a ben showed on top o' that rock
                  on Little Round Top 'thout it had a ball slap through it, and them generals they
                  wanted to git up on there'n reconnoitre.
               "So I went up in the tent. Warren he knowd me; I'd bin under him before, in the
                  old Fifth New York. And there was Gen. Kilpatrick, and Gen. Pleasonton, and Gen.
                  This, and That, and so on. So Warren he says to me, 'Leftenant, can't you take
                  some skirmishers, and go down in there, and clean out them sharpshooters?' Well,
                  that was a command, you know, jest as much as if he'd said I must go
                  and do it. So I said, 'Yes; I want sixty men, and I don't want nobody but
                  volunteers neither.' So he said I might go and git 'em. So I went down to my
                  regiment, 'n I picked out forty old Fifth New York men—the 146th was a new
                  regiment, 'n the'd put these old veterans in to give em a mow-rail.
                  Then I went to another regiment, 'n got twenty-five more; that was sixty-five, all
                  told. So I got 'em all ready, and I arranged with Warren that when I'd got down in
                  the valley and got things all straight, I'd wave a handkerchief, 'n then they
                  could git up on the rock. Then I told
                  my men, 'Now,' says I, 'we must break down this slope jest like dust till we git
                  into them rocks down there, and then we must scatter and take cover, pretty much
                  every man for himself. But, one thing—don't you none on you fire till you see me
                  do it. I'm agoin' to git a good place, and blaze away jest as fast as I can so's
                  to make 'em think there's a whole party o' men jest behind that one rock where I
                  am. Then you wait for 'em to reply. There ain't but about twenty on 'em, all down
                  in that nest o' rocks there in the Devil's Den. When they fire at me, you watch
                  and fire at the place, and there'll be eight or ten on ye firin' at every one on
                  'em, and somebody'll hit him.' So we got all ready, and away we went tearin' down
                  the hill like mad. They giv' us a volley or two when they saw us a-comin', and
                  picked off about a dozen killed and wounded; so when we got down among them ledges
                  and boulders, about two hundred yards away from where the sharpshooters was, I had
                  'bout fifty-five men. So I went to work a-blazin' away, and the boys they got down
                  behind the stones, and, amongst us, we kept up a hell of a fire; for every one o'
                  my men had a hundred rounds of ammunition. And every once in a while we'd see one
                  o' them sharpshooters jump up and fling up his hands.
               "Then they began to slacken their fire, and my boys had been kinder drawin' up
                  towards me; so says I, 'Now, boys, we'll make a little charge over in there, 'n
                  see if we can't find some o' them fellers.' So we charged over in there, and we
                  thought we'd got pretty near where they was, and we couldn't see nothin' on 'em.
                  You see, 'twas all full o' nothin' but rocks, and they was hid. So I was satisfied
                  that we'd pretty much silenced their fire anyhow, and so I out with my
                  handkerchief and waved it, and the officers they hopt up on the rock. So the
                  rebels, when they saw that, they got mad, and they went to firin' agin, and we
                  began too. So there was a feller a layin' alongside o' me, Sargeant Weaver his
                  name was, and he see a place where one o' the rebels was a firin' out of. So I
                  looked, and there the teller had built up a little place between two rocks with
                  loose stone, and he'd put's big rock across on top, and there he was, a firin'
                  through a porthole at us. So Weaver he wanted to fire at him, and says I, go
                  ahead. So Weaver fired, but he didn't hit him. Well, I had my gun all ready, and I
                  watched close, and when this here feller drew back to load up again, (here the
                  speaker imitated the movements of one ramming down a bullet,) I could jest see the
                  back of his head one side of that are rock. So I let him have it, and the bullet
                  struck him right in the middle of his neck right here, (touching the base of the
                  skull behind.) I should think he jumped up in the air about four feet. Well, when
                  we seen that, we all gave a hurraw, and we charged right over in there and we
                  gobbled up every one o' them fellers, all except two.
               "Well, as soon as the rest on 'em saw what we was up to a regiment on 'em came
                  down to try and git them sharpshooters back agin. So then our regiment had to come
                  down in bodily to support us. Then a rebel brigade came in, and then our brigade
                  came down too, and we drove 'em back after a little while, and advanced our line
                  the whole of that are two hundred yards, and kept it too.
               "When I went up to see Warren, he said all sorts o' things to me, and promised to
                  give me a medal and a commission, and all that. But I don' 'spect to git 'em.
                  Folks forgit easy."
               By four o'clock on Friday morning, July 3, the sounds of battle were heard far
                  away on the right wing, on the eastern slopes of Culp's Hill. But before this,
                  before the birds sang, while the very twilight hesitated in uncertainty, Alice was
                  up and out. Nor was it long before the ambulances were moving to explore the
                  remotest parts of the battle-field. Alice sought to retrace again the path of her
                  yesterday's excursion. But scarcely could she recognize a feature in the cold gray
                  of morning, of that scene which she had seen late the afternoon in the lurid light
                  of the sun lying low, and in the smoke and wild confusion of battle.
               She was alone. She carried, besides a flask and roll of bandages, nothing.
                  Following the road, over the northern edge of Little Round Top, down into the dell
                  below then inclining to the left, she began to recognize the place where she had
                  seen Barton in the very thick of battle. With trembling eagerness she looked on
                  every hand. The wounded had mostly been removed. Heaps of dead showed where the
                  weight of battle had fallen. Suddenly, and like an arrow shot from a bow, she
                  sprang from the path to the edge of a low forest or thicket, where an officer,
                  half reclining, half sitting, either was asleep, or was dead. It was Tom
                  Heywood.
               
               Alice paused at a few steps; then, venturing nearer-pale, very pale—spoke as if
                  she would waken him from sleep.
               "Mr. Heywood! Mr. Heywood!"
               Timidly, yet eagerly, she came close to him, laid her hand upon his arm; it fell
                  heavily as she pressed it. She touched his hand and the truth flashed upon her,—he
                  was dead! As one bewildered, and even yet uncertain but that he slept, she gazed
                  upon his calm and noble face.
               "Speak to me! Do wake! It is Alice—Alice Cathcart! Oh! Heywood, I would speak to
                  you if it were I lying so! He is not dead! It cannot be death!"
               Then looking and wildly, as a child looks shudderingly into some dark room at
                  night, she lowered her voice and said, in a hoarse whisper:
               "He is dead! O God, take me!"
               Already the light seemed vanishing, and Alice fell fainting upon Heywood's breast.
                  At last she had found upon his bosom a brief rest of love!
               A man living in the edge of the thicket called out to Hiram, who soon after was
                  coming that way:
               "I say! I say, stranger!"
               "Well, what's up? Where are ye? Oh, there you are. Are you hurt badly?"
               "No matter 'bout me jest yet. I kin wait. But I reckon somebody oughter take care
                  of that gal yonder. She's got a fit o' faintin'. That man there is Col. Heywood.
                  He commanded our boys. He was shot yisterday about the time I was. He lived an
                  hour or two, but never spoke."
               Hiram needed no quickening as soon as he saw Alice. Lifting her tenderly in his
                  arms, he carried her back to the edge of a small stream that crossed the road but
                  a little back, and then he bathed her face freely.
               "Poor child, I guess you've got about the worst wound yit. Alice! Alice! Poor
                  thing, her heart's broke. I allus suspected how 'twas. There—there—that's right;
                  open your eyes. Gracious! don't groan so—don't, child! It'll all be right, poor
                  little thing!"
               As she revived, Alice looked at Hiram in a seared and bewildered way. Little by
                  little her memory came with consciousness.
               "Hiram, let me go back."
               "Why, Alice don't," said Hiram in a coaxing way, at the same time drawing her
                  gently by the hand.
               "Hiram, I must go to him. He is not dead! If we only go
                  quick he will come to. Do go, Hiram—do go!"
               It was not in human nature to resist. A short walk brought them again to Heywood.
                  The moment they reached his feet with sudden revulsion of feeling, Alice stopped
                  short.
               "Hiram, he is dead! He will never speak again! Oh, how noble! Is he
                  not beautiful?"
               "Why, Alice, I didn't know as he was in love with you!"
               Had he pierced her with a sword she could not have shown a face of anguish such as
                  she instantly exhibited. Then, in a low and half-whispered tone she said—a slight
                  color coming to her pale cheek:
               "No—he did not love me. But I loved him. And now he never will know it. Oh! Hiram,
                  he was good and noble!"
               After a moment's pause she said artlessly:
               "You don't think it was wrong, do you, Hiram? I am not sorry. I am not ashamed of
                  it. He was very noble!"
               Lord bless you, child, it was all right, poor thing—it was jest as right as it
                  could be."
               Hiram pulled out a cotton handkerchief, which he carried in his hat, and after
                  hemming and coughing a little, and dabbing it first to one eye and then to the
                  other he began, he did not exactly know why, to wipe his hat; an operation less
                  needful, as it was a straw hat.
               Alice sat down by Heywood, apparently unconscious that any one was present. Her
                  thoughts were like an unloosed boat, with no one at the rudder which turns round
                  and round in the tide, and drifts just as the wind or under currents impel it—a
                  boat upon a troubled water and under a dark sky.
               "Oh, cruel, cruel! to pick the fairest and noblest! The wicked and ugly have
                  escaped and he is gone so good! so good!—Eyes that shall never see again—lips that
                  shall never speak—hands that are death cold! So true—so beautiful—so good! He
                     was good! Hush! he stirred! Hiram?"
               Hiram had tact enough not to oppose Alice, and humoring her idea that Heywood was
                  only in a swoon, he said:
               
               "I guess, Miss Cathcart, we better take him over, and let the doctors see if any
                  thing can be done for him. Mebbe he'll come to."
               "Oh, yes! Hiram, dear Hiram, do take him to the camp."
               "Well, if you'll go back, I'll see to it. You can't be no help here, and you may
                  be, over there."
               Directing some of the ambulance men to remove the body, he led Alice away to
                  Rose.
               In a sunny field close up under the edge of a grove and about half way between
                  Little Round Top and the bridge across the Rock Creek, of the Baltimore turnpike,
                  a grave was prepared. A chaplain from the sixth corps, of his own church, read the
                  solemn burial service. Three women, half a dozen men, stood around. The roar of
                  distant cannon was the only response.
               The sun fell warm in the very grave. Rose had plucked from the near trees some
                  burnished oak-leaves; and hastily plaiting them to a wreath, laid them on
                  Heywood's breast. Thus fell one who hated the war, but was swept into it by the
                  turbulent tide of revolution which he had not strength to resist.
               Agate Bissell proposed to Rose that they should send Alice to the farm-house of
                  old father Lobdell, where they had spent Wednesday night. But all thoughts of
                  planning for her comfort were laid aside when they saw Alice's conduct.
               After she returned to the hospital, she arranged her apparel with more than common
                  care, stepped forth calmly, but firmly to her merciful duties. Her face was serene
                  but without smiles. Her care and pity, always striking had in them now an austere
                  tenderness that struck the rudest men with awe and admiration, as if an inspired
                  priestess were among them. Nor, to the end, did Alice ever mention Heywood's name,
                  nor for one waking hour, did she ever forget it!
            
            
               CHAPTER LII.
               THE LAST ENDEAVOR.
               ON the third day of July, and the third of the complex battle of Gettysburg, Lee,
                  having in vain assaulted the left of the Union line on the day before, determined
                  to break through the centre, and at the same time to enlarge the hold which he had
                  secured upon the extreme Union right, on the eastern slope of Culp's Hill. But by
                  four in the morning Meade attacked the intrusive forces which had thus, while
                  yesterday's battle raged on the extreme left, as it were stolen in on the right,
                  and by eleven o'clock they were driven out, thus anticipating and defeating Lee's
                  intention of turning the Union right.
               A wonderful silence now came over the vast battlefield and brooded for the space
                  of two hours. Birds sang again though the ground beneath them was covered with
                  unburied men. The rustling of leaves could be heard once more by the men who lay
                  resting under the trees. But the very silence that usually brings all thoughts of
                  peace, now sharpened men's fears. It was like that dreadful calm which precedes
                  the burst of storms. Just such it was. At one o'clock it was broken by an uproar
                  as wonderful as had been the silence. Two hundred and thirty-five cannon joined in
                  a clangor of death such as had never been heard upon this continent. Lee had
                  concentrated a hundred and forty-five guns over against the centre of Cemetery
                  Ridge, and Meade replied with eighty guns—all that could be well placed in his
                  narrower space. The other battle before seemed noiseless compared with this
                  immense cannonading. The slopes of Oak Ridge and the swells upon the further side
                  of the valley seemed on fire. Each little hill-top became a volcano. From the
                  right, from the left, from the centre, battery upon battery, and parks of
                  batteries flailed and thundered. The smoke rolled up white and bluish-gray, as
                  storm-clouds lift and roll up the sides of mountains. From every direction came
                  the flying missiles—cross-ploughing Cemetery Hill with hideous furrows in which to
                  plant dead men. Shot flew clear over the ridge—caissons sheltered behind the
                     hill were reached and blown up.
                  Horses standing harnessed to reserved artillery, in places before secure, were
                  smitten down. Strange was the discordant music of the missile sounds for which
                  there were no pauses, that filled the air. Some went hissing, some flew with
                  muffled growl, some shook out a gushing sound like the rush of waters; some
                  carried with them an intense and malignant howl; some spit and sputtered in a
                  spiteful manner; others whirred, or whistled, or spun threads of tenor or treble
                  sounds. But whatever the variety in this awful aerial music all meant death. If a
                  thousand meteors had burst, and each one flung down shattered masses of meteoric
                  stone, it would have scarcely seemed more like a deluge of iron rain than now it
                  did. Orderlies and aids found the roads and fields on the far side of the hill,
                  safe before, now raining with bullets. Meade's head-quarters were riddled and his
                  staff driven to another quarter. In half an hour all the fields were cleared and
                  the men were under cover. Fortunately, the enemy's artillery was elevated too
                  much. The Union soldiers escaped with comparatively little harm while the reverse
                  of the hill was excoriated with shot and shell. In the burial-ground on the head
                  of Cemetery Ridge, projecting toward the village of Gettysburg, fell the iron hall
                  rending the graves and splintering the monuments. Flowers growing on graves were
                  rudely picked by hurtling iron. Soldiers who had fallen at Fair Oaks, and had been
                  brought here for burial, far away from all thought of battle, in this quiet
                  Pennsylvania vale, were still pursued by war, which rudely tore up their graves;
                  and they heard again the thunder of battle swelling above these resting-places,
                  where it would seem they should have found quiet.
               When it had thundered and rained iron for more than two hours, there came moving
                  across the valley fifteen thousand men to take possession of that ridge! As they
                  moved from afar the Union artillery smote them; but they did not heed it. As they
                  drew near, still rent by shot and shell,—earnest, eager, brave—there burst upon
                  their right flank a fire of musketry and artillery that quite crumpled up and
                  swung back their men upon their centre. Next, their left wing was utterly riddled
                  and routed by the sharpness of the musketry; and what part was not captured fled
                  and escaped. But the massive centre with men as brave as ever faced death, stern,
                  headlong, pushed right up to Hancock's lines, and across them but could come no
                  further! Like a ship whose impetus carried it far up upon a shoal, from which it
                  cannot recede when it would several brigades had shot, by the terrible momentum,
                  so far up, that when from the slopes of the cemetery, and, from the artillery on
                  Meade's left wing, they were enfiladed while Hancock with fresh brigades drawn
                  from his left, met them in front with a fire that pierced like a flame, they
                  yielded themselves up. They had gotten the hill for which they came, but not as
                  victors. The rest shrunk, driven backward, sharply raked with artillery and
                  scorched with sheets of musketry, got them out of the battle, and fled across the
                  valley to their lines, whence they should come no more out hitherward. Many that
                  longed to go with them lay with pitiful wounds. A thousand that an hour before
                  were fierce in ambitious expectations, now and never more cared what befell them,
                  nor what happened under the sun! When the sun went down on that 3d of July, the
                  Union army, a mighty sufferer in more than twenty thousand slain and wounded men,
                  yet had never such cause of rejoicing for the coming anniversary day as now when
                  all those thousands of men joyfully had died or suffered wounds to preserve that
                  nation's life whose birthday is celebrated on the Fourth of July!
               The morning of Saturday, the 4th of July, rose fair over Gettysburg. Ewell's corps
                  of Lee's army withdrew from the town and Howard's troops immediately took
                  possession.
               There was great joy throughout the Union army. Officers congratulated each other;
                  the men were raised to the proudest exultation. The army of the Potomac, the
                  victim of misfortunes, but always a model of indomitable patience, had at length
                  met their great antagonist in a long and severe fight, and thoroughly defeated
                  him. While all were exhilarated with the immediate victory, the thoughtful men of
                  the army experienced a deeper gladness in their prescience of the scope of this
                  victory in its relation to public affairs. The climax was reached. Henceforward
                  the Confederate cause was subject to decline, weakness and extinction.
               The work of burying the dead engaged large details of soldiers. The wounded were
                  sought out more assiduously. Lee having withdrawn his right wing from before Round
                  Top and concentrated his whole force on the hills over against Gettysburg, there
                  could be no danger in going over on the field of battle. Relief parties were busy. Among the rocks of Round Top
                  and Devil's Den wounded men were found in fissures, slid down into gaping chasms,
                  and in the black seams, pits and caves which abounded in that savage tangle of
                  giant rocks. But it is probable that many wounded died unsuccored in those dark
                  spaces, and that the bones. of many yet lie buried but unsepulchred, with the huge
                  rocks around them as stones of hiding rather than of memorial.
               The farm-houses were filled with wounded; barns were filled; the fields were as
                  full as, in a few days, they would have been of sheaves of the wheat which had
                  been so strangely threshed by the feet of wounded men. The town was full; all the
                  sheltered spots and nooks were full. A large number of the enemy's wounded
                  particularly of the last day's battle remained upon the field; the total was
                  swelled to an extraordinary aggregate. This little hamlet of a few hundred people
                  had become a great city of wounded men.
               The tidings of the battle spreading through the land had begun already to bring
                  hither those who had sons in the fight. As fast as trains could be dispatched,
                  those of the wounded who could be transported were sent away to various cities for
                  better care. The horror of the scene was much alleviated by the cheerfulness of
                  the wounded. As soon as their wounds had been dressed, and they were placed in
                  comfortable circumstances, those not desperately hurt grew quite talkative and
                  even merry. The women of Gettysburg, and the wives of the farmers living in the
                  region, devoted themselves to the care of the sufferers with heroic devotion. But
                  the stolid farmers and men of the district round about the town, manifested
                  neither patriotism nor humanity, practising every extortion, and wringing out
                  money for a drop of water given to the wounded men who had fallen in the defence
                  of their homes and lives!
               There are no contrasts more striking than those between human feeling and the
                  moods of the atmosphere. On this fourth day of July a joyous sun arose over the
                  most sorrowful scene that it could well look upon. Three days had converted a
                  peaceful valley into a Golgotha. No form of injury which the human body can
                  receive was wanting. The ingenuity of nature in the production of life is not
                  greater than the ingenuity of death in the destruction of life. Leaves and flowers
                  are not more varied in form than were wounds. From the crown of the head to the
                  sole of the feet there was not a point in the human body which had not been
                  pierced. The wildest caprice had revelled in singularities of effects. Men
                  received a mere scratch of a glancing ball, and the shock overthrew their nervous
                  system. Another, with wounds on every limb, the lungs pierced, bones broken, the
                  head torn, trampled on by men, run over by artillery, stabbed, shot, hacked,
                  bruised, given up by surgeons, still clung to life and climbed back again to
                  health! The fields bore ghastly harvests of suffering men. The sun came up and
                  shined upon them as if they were but heads of yellow wheat. Their trembling and
                  shrinking were to nature only as the quivering of leaves in the frolicsome wind;
                  their groans and sighs passed for no more than the singing of birds or the low
                  moaning of the pines.
               The morning seemed an emblem of victory to the unwounded and exultant soldiers.
                  They said: "The sun triumphs! Nature exults! The heavens and the earth rejoice
                  with us!"—But how was it to the wounded man—too weak to turn away his face from
                  the sun which shone full upon it with blistering heat? How was it with hundreds of
                  parents and friends, wandering up and down through all the vast field in search of
                  some child, brother, lover? What mockery of grief was it, as the mother sat down
                  by the corpse of her only son, that the heavens cared not that it spread its
                  brilliant arch without sympathy for aught below it, and that the heartless sun
                  marched on over anguish desolation and despair, as if this had been not a battle
                  but a banquet.
               Could a pitiful God look down through the air on such a scene and not fill it with
                  his sympathy, and change it to a soberer hue? Alas! this great field of war was
                  but a point, a mere punctuation mark of blood in the history of that world which
                  groans and travails in pain until now! As the midwife in the throes and groans of
                  the mother, heeds not the pain, but watts for the child that shall bring joy out
                  of woe, so we must needs think the Merciful heeds not the forms of suffering, but
                  looks beyond, at the blessings wrought by them! When at last account shall be
                  taken of all the blood that has been shed and of all the tears that have fallen,
                  then the most wonderful name of God will be, THE LONG SUFFERING!
               And God has taught the Sun to see beyond and through the beginnings of things to
                  their ends.
               
               For the Sun forever sees life and not death. It beholds in the revolution of the
                  sod, not the roots that die, but the harvests which shall spring from their death.
                  Death is but the prophet of life. The evil is but for a moment. The benefit runs
                  through the whole season. What if twenty thousand wounded men lie groaning here?
                  It is the price of a nation's life! The instruments of their great conflict were
                  carnal, but its fruits spiritual.
               War ploughed the fields of Gettysburg, and planted its furrows with men. But
                  though the seed was blood the harvest shall be peace, concord, liberty, and
                  universal intelligence. For every groan here a hundred elsewhere ceased. For every
                  death now, a thousand lives shall be happier. Individuals suffered; the nation
                  revived!
               Shine on, O Sun! that beholdest evermore the future! Thou wilt not, glorious Eye
                  of Hope,—ever looking at the ends,—be veiled or mourn because the ways are rough
                  through which God sends universal blessings!
               I cannot say that such thoughts as these passed through the mind of Rose Wentworth
                  on this glorious morning after victory. But had some one thought aloud such
                  thoughts, she would have been in full and instant sympathy with them. There was a
                  latent sense of the great mercy to the nation of this victory which lifted her
                  above the mere sight of the eyes, and instead of being depressed with the vast
                  sacrifice spread around her, she had an instinct of its meaning, and a calm and
                  peaceful gladness. She had need to have it.
               "I wonder where Pete is?" said Agate Bissell, as it drew toward noon. "I have not
                  seen him this morning. He ought to be here and tell us about Barton."
               "There comes Hiram," said Rose; "he will do as well. What a brave fellow Hiram is!
                  He has shown more courage, and performed more work, too, in scoring the wounded,
                  than if he had carried a musket. All the brave men are not in the ranks."
               Something disquieted Hiram Beers this morning. He had little to say and seemed
                  fidgety. He picked up things only to lay them down, and worked without any
                  purpose. At last he gave way:
               "'Tain't no use, Rose; you may's well know it fust as last. I've got a letter for
                  you from Barton, and I expect it's the last one you'll ever git from him."
               Rose stopped, and, raising herself to her full height, looked fixedly and even
                  commandingly upon Hiram.
               "Hiram, has Barton fallen?"
               "I don't know; I'm afraid so. I can't find nothin' of him. Pete's gone; nobody's
                  seen him to-day. Barton's officers say they saw him fall in a charge yesterday,
                  and that he didn't come back with his men, and that he must be dead. But we've
                  hunted every where for his body and can't find it. I was up there the night before
                  the last battle. He said something would happen to him in that fight. He felt it.
                  He told me to wait till he wrote this letter. If he got out safe I was to bring it
                  back to him; but if he was killed, I was to give it to you."
               Rose took the letter, and read:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "I have a presentiment, Rose, that something will befall me to-morrow.
                              If you receive these lines I shall have fallen, and my words will be
                              forgiven as of one dead. Rose, I have vainly tried to conquer that
                              love which has so taken possession of my life as to overcome all other
                              feelings. As early as I can remember, I loved you. It has grown with
                              my manhood. It is a part of my being! Not to love you would be not to
                              be myself. When I told you all this on leaving home, I had hoped for
                              some sympathy; I plead for only a word. My letter was not answered or
                              noticed. Perhaps your silence was best. It was hard to bear. If I
                              could have ceased loving, I could have conquered the pain of that
                              refusal which you gave by silence. It will not be a trouble to you any
                              longer to know that a heart has loved you beyond every other thing. My
                              latest strongest feeling, Rose, is love for you! My last wishes and
                              prayers invoke blessings on you! I go toward darkness; but there is a
                              light beyond. In Heaven, O Rose, in Heaven I shall meet you, and say,
                              I love you, without fear or repulse.
                           
                              BARTON CATHCART."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Rose stood silent and motionless. Amazement, sorrow and joy filled her heart. She
                  whispered to herself:
               "He loved me! He loved me always!—best!—to the last! He told me of it! When?
                     what letter? There has been some dreadful mistake! This is his
                  writing—this is Barton's writing!—and here it is written down: 'My
                  latest, strongest feeling, Rose, is love, for you!' And he will never know that I
                  loved him more! Noble soul, if thou art
                  in heaven, God will tell thee how thou art loved!—And he wrote to me! wrote to
                  tell me all this when first leaving Norwood? Where is that treacherous letter that
                  did not fulfil its message?"
               Rose called to Alice. There was something in her manner so high and commanding,
                  that Alice scarcely believed that this was Rose. She had never seen her in a mood
                  of such exaltation.
               "Alice, my sister, Barton has left us!" Alice could not look paler than she
                  already was, but a ghostly, ashen hue came over the white of her fair face. "Read
                  this, Alice.—Can you not? Let me read it to you."
               With a firm low voice Rose read every word without faltering. Barton's words of
                  love seemed to inspire her soul. There was a triumph in the gentlest of her tones
                  that showed that sorrow had in it an overmastering joy.
               Alice looked upon Rose with wonder.
               In a low and solemn way, with a wondering, inquiring look she said:
               "I cannot understand you! It all seems dreadful to me! God is full of anger toward
                  us both."
               "Alice, God loves us both! Oh! I know not what joy that would have been of loving,
                  had Barton lived and loved me, since even in death his love is so full of joy and
                  thrilling. I am more glad than sorrowful. He loved me! loved me always! loved me
                  to the end! My heart sings; only my eyes weep! Come, Alice, let not people see
                  us."
               They walked along the edges of the woods. Again the little birds were singing,—the
                  melancholy pee-wee, the pine-warbler, the vireo. They came to Heywood's grave. The
                  sun shone brightly upon it. Already some one had transplanted from the edges of
                  the wood clumps of flowers.
               Poor Alice, tears running down her cheeks, turned to Rose:
               "Oh, Rose, tell me how to feel as you do! My heart was sunk down so low that there
                  is no more light for me! I have envied the dead around me. I want to go. God does
                  not love me enough to let me die!"
               "Alas, Alice, grief poisons you! me it cheers. I am glad that I suffer. Death has
                  divided you from your lover; but has given mine to me. Barton's death has made him
                  mine. Oh, noble soul! oh, heavenly hero! oh, spirit walking free in glory!—death,
                  that separates others, unites us! I am thine! I am henceforth wedded till thou
                  come for me! Oh, Alice, why should I be sad? My heart is with him. My thoughts
                  walk with him. My life is lifted up higher than sorrows ever fly!"
               "Oh, Rose! you make me feel worse than ever. You seem gone away from me. I cannot
                  follow you. When he fell, the whole world fell too to me. I cannot see any thing
                  that is bright. I do not love any body now—nor you nor father nor mother, nor
                  myself. Oh! my heart is very angry. God is cruel, Rose!—I will speak it. God is
                  cruel to me—very cruel. I don't want to live; and if I were to die,
                     he would not love me there!"
               Rose was drawn down from her own high thoughts by Alice's childlike outburst of
                  sorrow.
               "My sister, I am sorry. I am more sorry for you than for myself. You
                  do not know what you say, that you love nothing. Your heart is like a bird driven
                  into the woods by a thunder storm. By and by it will sing again. But I know that
                  God loves you, or he would not so afflict you. All this black will be white by and
                  by. Be brave, and resist the selfishness of sorrow."
               "Rose, I am not selfish. I shall give my whole life away for others. I was not
                  selfish. I did not ask great happiness for myself. I only wanted him to love me
                  enough to let me love him. I would not have troubled him. I could have kept
                  trouble from him and helped him a little and loved when I could stand a little way
                  off and look at him. He would never love me as Barton loved you, Rose. Oh, you
                  will never know all of that! But if after a great while he should say, 'Alice, I
                  am always happier when you are by me,' oh, Rose, the angels in the resurrection
                  will say nothing so sweet as that would be! But he will never say it now!"
               Rose caught at Barton's name.
               "Did Barton confide his feelings to you, Alice?"
               "Yes, he did. No, he did not. I mean I knew them without his saying any thing. And
                  I am sure he knew mine. And we both knew that the other knew all; and so, when he
                  would say a few words and stop, I knew all the rest."
               "It is strange—very strange—that Barton did not speak."
               "It is stranger that you should have needed to have him. If he had
                  been near me as Barton was near you, and felt as Barton did, I should have known it,—just as I know the
                  morning is come when it floods my window with light."
               Rose mused a moment:
               "My time had not come. I was like one who hears sounds in his sleep and turns them
                  all into the fabric of his dream. Surely I knew! and yet I knew not. It was like
                  seed sown before the ground is warm. But the summer floods me now. Ever seed is a
                  blossom!"
               They sat for a while, silent and thoughtful; then Alice pointed to a clump of
                  columbines that had blossomed by the edge of a rock.
               "Rose, you are like those flowers, and trouble seems to move you as the wind does
                  them, only to show the sparkle of the sunlight with every motion. I am like the
                  shadow which they cast upon the rock, that perishes by night, and is but a shadow
                  all day."
               Rose still fell off into musing—often talking to herself in a low tone, or half
                  whisper, as one who chants a forming poem to weigh its words.
               "O my soul, thou art crowned to-day! O death, that hast taken his presence from
                  me, thou hast given me his heart! In one moment I am bereaved and wedded,—I am
                  cast down and exalted! Barton, thou didst all thy life love me—without response! I
                  too, all my life will love thee, alone and unrequited!"
               Rose took Alice to her bosom and kissed her, with a strange and solemn tenderness
                  which brought tears from her eyes. But Rose neither wept nor was sad.
               "Alice, did you know that Barton had written me?"
               "I did."
               "Why did you never mention it? Was it sisterly? I knew not of it. No letter has
                  ever come to me from Barton. I was sad and dark that he went away forgetting or
                  caring little for his childhood friend."
               "I was not permitted, Rose. Barton solemnly enjoined silence; upon my honor I was
                  not to mention his secret."
               "Oh, Alice! this is a day of great joy, and sorrow cannot reach to it nor pluck it
                  down."
               "I can only see grief upon grief. He is gone, and Barton is gone. I
                  would that I, too, were gone."
               "Poor Alice—dear Alice—if only Heywood would speak to you out of the air, or
                  coming in the vision of the night, saying, 'I do wholly love thee, Alice,' would
                  you not triumph over grief?"
               Alice shuddered with intensity of feeling.
               "Yes!—if I might know that he loved me and would always love me, I would go
                  through a thousand years of sorrow and be glad all the way. But, oh! Rose, Rose,
                  he did not love me. It was you—not me."
               And Alice wept like a little child. Rose comforted her as a mother comforts her
                  child, and, withdrawing her from thoughts of herself, Rose, half to Alice and half
                  to herself, went on:
               "At last I am free. No more checking! No more self-deceiving! No more suffering
                  and misnaming of one's deepest life! No more shame for the heart's best fruit! I
                  am beloved and I love! I almost wish it were known. I would that men could see it
                  on my brow and read it in my eyes. I would that all that knew him, when they
                  behold me might say, 'See how his love covers her as with a queen's garment!' I
                  would have such gladness in my eyes that men should say, 'His love is like a
                  crowning flame about her head!'"
               "O Rose! I do not understand you! I cannot rise as you do. My heart is heavy, my
                  soul is dark, my life is gone out. I dare not murmur, but I cannot submit. I was
                  not called, and yet I loved, Great is my punishment."
               "Mourn not, Alice! It is noble to love with an unsullied love! Not those who love
                  are poor, but those who do not. He was poorer that knew not how to love you than
                  you, whom God made wise to love greatly and divinely. As for me this is the day of
                  my espousals. I will sing of sorrow now all the days of my life. Since God has
                  taken him into heaven, he will send over all things that the heavens cover,
                  something of his nobleness and honor. The sun shall be brighter to me for his
                  sake; the earth, and all that grows upon it shall have new meaning now; and every
                  sound that the ear loves to hear shall be to me a part of his voice, saying,
                  'Rose, I love thee!'"
               The clouds had been silently gathering in the sky. First a haze, then films that
                  grew thicker and a gray tint in the sunlight that changed rapidly toward dark,
                  until soon the whole heaven was sheeted, and rain began to fall; at first gently,
                  but with increasing quantity, until it poured abundantly.
               
               Great battles are said to bring on rain storms. A great rain certainly set in on
                  Saturday after the battle. Rock Creek, that had been so shallow that it was easily
                  crossed by the men upon the stones, without wetting their feet, began now to show
                  signs of uneasiness. The water grew discolored. It began to gather volume. One
                  familiar stone after another silently disappeared. It grew more restless, and
                  began to send down flecks of foam. It filled up the edges, clear up to the banks.
                  It still rose as evening came on. That modest little stream had became surly and
                  despotic. With headlong will it swept all before it and its usual gentleness was
                  lost in its turbulent rush and roar. But the hospital lay upon both banks of this
                  stream. As the darkness came on, it was plain that the men must be removed. No
                  time was to be lost. Already the stream had reached the wounded. Those who could
                  help themselves climbed the steep slope a little further inland, to which the
                  surgeons began to remove the men. All was haste. Whatever help could he got was
                  impressed. Men with stretchers were busy carrying the badly wounded. With all
                  their effort, two or three, overtaken by the merciless water, were swept away and
                  drowned. When morning came, a raging torrent divided the surgeons, some upon the
                  further bank being unable for hours to cross to the hospital field. The bridge on
                  the Baltimore pike was overflowed, its planks lifted and floated away. The whole
                  night was one of toil and anxiety.
               With the morning came joy to Rose. On the second day of the battle, word had been
                  telegraphed to the Northern cities for surgical aid. The enormous accumulation of
                  wounded men, Union and rebels, overtaxed the exertions the medical corps. At this
                  summons speedily came many scores of men eminent in their profession for a short
                  service in the field and among them Dr. Wentworth. Although he arrived on
                  Saturday, it was not until Sunday afternoon that Rose met her father—and then she
                  had to search for him. For, not wailing even to brush the dust from his clothes,
                  nor for food, Dr. Wentworth, within half an hour after reaching Gettysburg, was
                  established and at work. Nor for two days and two nights did he rest for an hour.
                  Such were the necessities of the occasion that with the most heroic energy and
                  perseverance of the regular surgeons of the army, working night and day, and with
                  all the help which they received from volunteers from the profession abroad, it
                  was three or four days before the first round was completed. In some of the field
                  hospitals the wounded were treated as they came, without regard to the side to
                  which they belonged. In other hospitals the Union soldiers were treated first and
                  in one case three or four hundred rebel wounded waited in a barn some three days
                  before our surgeons could reach their cases. But then the reaction had set in
                  their nervous systems were prostrated, and they could not endure the operations
                  necessary. Almost every man died. A strange fatality attended some hospitals. In
                  some places almost every wound led to lockjaw, and every attack proved fatal. Some
                  hospitals were more deadly than the battlefield. Of seven hundred men, in one
                  case, who bid fair at first to recover, scarcely a hundred survived. The poison
                  generated by sickness and wounds when vast numbers of men are clustered closely in
                  disadvantageous circumstances is of frightful malignancy. Men fall away like
                  leaves in an October day when east winds strike the trees!
               Among the memorials and monuments the eulogies and honors so deservedly bestowed
                  upon the soldiers and officers of the army, some place should be found, not
                  second, for the medical gentlemen who, as a body, illustrated the highest virtues
                  of patriotism and humanity in their extraordinary zeal and labor. Often much
                  exposed to fire, conversant with fatigue as great as could be endured, brought
                  face to face with all that is horrible and depressing in war, working against
                  insuperable obstacles maintaining a desperate fight against death, without those
                  almost supernatural excitements which carry men through battles, the surgeons of
                  the army deserve to be ranked with the foremost soldiers. Not a whit less is due
                  to that noble arm of nurses who without fee or reward devoted themselves
                  unweariedly, from the beginning of the war to the end, to the sick and wounded
                  soldiers, and to the social and moral improvement of those that were well. It is
                  computed that first and last two thousand women during the war, left homes of
                  refinement and comfort accepted every hardship of the field and the march, of the
                  camp and of the hospital, with a heroism not surpassed by the soldiers. Women
                  carried with them the inspiration of love and duty, and brought to the camp the
                  remembrances of home, to the hospital the softer graces of humanity, and
                     everywhere where a spirit of
                  self-sacrifice and fidelity, that shone like a rainbow upon a scowling cloud of
                  war.
               It seems fit, therefore, that among the testimonies of a nation's gratitude some
                  recognition should be given to this rear-guard of humanity! At least it would be a
                  wise and comely act for the Government of this Nation, in the Capital, to rear a
                  monument, and inscribe it 
                     TO THE HEROIC SURGEONS AND THE NOBLE WOMEN WHO LAID DOWN
                        THEIR LIVES FOR THE NATION!
                  
               
            
            
               CHAPTER LIII.
               THE MOUNTAIN COVERT.
               THE tidings which Hiram Beers brought to Barton's friends will require us to go
                  back a day or two and to trace the events connected with Barton Cathcart's
                  fate.
               No one who saw the calmness and cheerfulness with which Barton awaited the famous
                  charge of Pickett upon the left centre of the Union lines, on Friday afternoon,
                  would dream that he was sad or foreboding. It was not the darkness of despondency
                  or pain. Coming events seemed to him to cast their shadows over him. But there was
                  in this very premonition a cordial. The settled certainty gave calmness, and his
                  Christian hope gave him cheerfulness.
               The night before he had, as we have already learned, entrusted Hiram with a
                  message, and he also had made every arrangement with Pete, to secure to his
                  friends the few effects which might become precious in their sight. Pete, though
                  not a fighting character, was made brave in exigencies by his fidelity. He took
                  good care of his own person unless General Cathcart was in danger; then he almost
                  lost sense of his own peril in his anxiety for his master.
               When the grand charge of Pickett's corps had almost expended its force, there was
                  concentrated upon its overtasked ranks such a fire, on either flank and in the
                  front as no mortal men might endure. Hundreds dropped their muskets and fell flat
                  upon the ground to escape the sweep of fire. A thousand men were captured. The
                  enemy retired sullenly, fighting from point to point, broken up into small bodies.
                  The utter destruction of this the flower of Lee's army, might have been
                  accomplished had Meade possessed reserves of fresh troops. As it was, several
                  brilliant charges were made, and in all several thousand prisoners captured. It
                  was such a charge that Barton Cathcart was first severely wounded in the thigh,
                  and then, separated from his men, he found himself surrounded with Confederate
                  soldiers, and borne away in the whirl of the retreating masses. At first, he
                  sought to break through and regain his
                  own side, but a bayonet thrust through the right arm still further disabled him,
                  and he was swept away across the valley, and in half an hour, was within Lee's
                  lines. He was speedily sent to the rear. He lay all night in the open fields,
                  suffering much from his wounds, and musing with some surprise upon his case. Was
                  this, then, all that the presentiment meant? Was it only wounds and captivity, and
                  not death?
               But, though at first he felt this relief, every hour of the night, while he
                  pictured to himself the fate of prisoners in Southern prisons, increased the
                  feeling that he had escaped death for a worse fate.
               When the morning dawned on Saturday, July 4, his spirits had fallen low. The
                  excitement of battle was over. Just before the dawn came that utter sinking of the
                  spirits which those in trouble so well know. It would seem as if between dark and
                  dawn there was a space, measured by an hour of time, through which the globe
                  moved, infested with malign spirits, that jibe and tempt the weary heart and ride
                  it to the uttermost.
               He could not sleep. He could not keep awake. He vibrated wretchedly between waking
                  and sleeping. His head was enough unsettled to make his sleep seem spectral and
                  his waking ghastly. It was out of one of his painful moments of delirious sleep
                  that he woke thinking he heard his name called. There by his side stood Pete.
                  Barton thought at first that it was only another vision of dreams. He looked at
                  him without speaking. But he was not long left in doubt. Pete was overjoyed to be
                  again at his side.
               "Why, Pete—is it really you?" said Barton, putting his hands upon his
                  brawny arm, to make sure.
               "Yes, sir, it's me—'taint nobody else. I guess I owns them feet," said Pete,
                  extending a foot, which would answer for a small boat; the shoe at any rate,
                  suggesting some such idea.
               "How in the world did you get here? did you drop down? thought it was a dream.
                  I've had a good many this morning—but this is the best dream yet."
               "Wal, as soon as you didn't come back, I thought somethin' had to be done, and I
                  kind o' went down to look arter ye, and they cotched me, and then they axed me who
                  I was, and I told 'em my name was Pete. And they said who did I belong to, and I
                  told 'em I was a free nigger, and took care of Gineral Cathcart, and they larfed
                  considerable, and so they brought me to jest the right place, for the very fust
                  thing I seed this mornin' was you."
               All day Lee was sending back his trains, his wounded and prisoners. Cathcart was
                  dispatched about noon. It soon began raining. Pete was never a moment away from
                  Barton's side. As the ambulance in which he was conveyed approached the pass
                  through the South Mountain, Pete grew cheerful. It was evident that he purposed
                  something unusual. He said in a low tone to Barton, at a time when the guards were
                  a little in advance—"Gineral, I s'pose you'd jest as lieve git away from these
                  fellers if you could?"
               "There's no chance, Pete. Don't you see the guards on every side?"
               "But I want you to be ready, and if I see a chance, you must be spry as you kin
                  with that leg."
               A heavy rain was now descending. The road was much choked up, and the trains moved
                  with difficulty. It grew rapidly dark. Either side of the pass was rugged and
                  wild. Pete carried himself in a dull and plodding way, as if he had not a thought
                  in his head. Yet he was watching sharply the soldiers, the character of the
                  ground, where it rose steeply, where ravines on the right or left showed openings.
                  About eight o'clock some interruption at the front caused a halt and a little
                  confusion. One or two shots were heard in the distance. Some one said that the
                  pass, ahead, was in possession of the Union troops. The guards near the ambulance
                  stepped forward for a moment to speak with their commander. Pete looked cautiously
                  about without turning his head. There were no soldiers within several rods.
               To the right, as nearly as he could discover the rocks did not rise precipitously;
                  but there seemed some kind of opening. In fact, a small stream descended and
                  crossed the road not far below them, and it was some damage to the rude bridge
                  that had checked the column.
               Seizing the favorable moment Pete came to the rear of the ambulance, silently, and
                  reached in his long arm. He gave Barton one or two emphatic twitches as much as to
                  say:
               "Now is your time."
               As fast as his wounded leg would allow, Barton worked his body toward the back of
                  the vehicle. No sooner had his legs
                  hung down from it than Pete, turning his back to his master, took Barton on his
                  shoulders and darted instantly into the thicket. His movement was not a moment too
                  soon. The driver, seeing his prisoner gone, cried out. The soldiers, catching a
                  glimpse of Pete, fired upon him, and several of them dashed after him. But at each
                  step the thicket became so difficult that pursuit was soon given up, and the
                  prisoners escaped. But a shot had reached its mark. Entering Barton's side just
                  above his loins, the bullet had traversed the inner walls of the abdomen and came
                  out at the front.
               Every step now grew more difficult. The mountain laurel in spots formed such
                  barriers that it could not well be penetrated. The sound of the stream drew Pete
                  toward it, and he groped his way, sometimes in it, sometimes along its rough and
                  rocky edge; at other times turned away from the stream by some insuperable
                  obstacle, he plunged again into the thicket. Barton grew faint, and would fain
                  have stopped; but Pete determined to reach some retreat that was at once safe and
                  of better accommodations. The chances seemed poor. The heavy spruce boughs swept
                  in their faces, shaking off showers of drops, which could scarcely add to their
                  discomfort, for they were drenched to the skin already. None but Pete could have
                  proceeded a step in such gloom of night, dark by reason of clouds, and still
                  darker by the overshading trees of this mountain forest. But, though Pete often
                  stumbled, was frequently stopped, and with incredible labor, got along but a
                  little way, yet his great strength enabled him to hold out as few but he could
                  have done, and by some instinct he contrived to keep his direction. For an hour he
                  had toiled on. At length the side of the brook seemed smoother. But it ended
                  suddenly against almost precipitous rocks. The way seemed effectually shut up,
                  unless he could find a path by the channel of the brook itself. Carefully laying
                  his burden down, Pete descended to the stream and followed it up. He found that it
                  now issued from a sort of gateway, by a series of cascades which were quite
                  shallow, and that the ascent was an inclination which made it scarcely more
                  difficult than a pair of stairs. Returning to Barton, he bore him carefully up the
                  steep channel; and, at its top, finding the brook more level, he judged that he
                  had reached nearly to the summit of the hills, and that he might find a more
                  accessible path on its banks. There seemed no forest on either hand. Moving away
                  from the stream, and groping along a kind of gravelly bed in search of higher
                  ground that should not be affected by the overflow of the stream that might be
                  expected, should the rain continue all night, Pete, at length, reached some
                  shelving rocks, which furnished not only an elevation above the stream but a
                  partial shelter also. Here he gladly laid Barton down. Finding that hemlock boughs
                  were hanging over him Pete broke off an armful of them to furnish his master with
                  something softer than a rock.
               The hours passed slowly and gloomily. Barton could not sleep from the pain of his
                  wounds. Pete was sleepless from anxiety about his charge. The rain at times
                  slackened. Once Pete could discern the clouds above growing thinner and letting
                  through a faint light from the moon. Midnight passed although they could not
                  determine the time. The rains redoubled their violence. Little rills, formed above
                  them trickled down from the rocks. The stream began to sound angrily. Pete's ear,
                  alive to every sound, noticed with alarm the change from the shrill sound of
                  shallow water rushing over rocks to a deeper tone as if the stream were growing to
                  a torrent. The roar became more portentous. Pete peered anxiously from his lurking
                  place into the darkness. Nothing could he see. Another hour passed, another hour
                  of pain to Barton but of alarm to Pete. The faithful soul would not impart his
                  alarm to his master. He said to himself, "Gosh-a-beely! don't I wish it was light!
                  I don't like this place—I don't now. May be we've got trapped! His thoughts
                  reverted to the ravine at Norwood where Heywood had received his fall. Should this
                  be such another, a mere chamber in the rocks it might suddenly be filled by the
                  rising torrent and become a rockbound reservoir. He listened! Could it be that he
                  was hearing the water just beneath him? It seemed so. Yet the roar of the stream
                  had risen to such a pitch of sound as well nigh to drown all other sounds. He
                  reached down his foot and drew it up again quickly. The stream was
                  rushing along swiftly by the very rocks on which the lay! He waited a half hour
                  and sounded again. The distance was lessening! The water was rising! He moved
                  cautiously—first in one direction and then in another—to find on every side that
                  they were shut in! A horror began to fill Pete's soul. He had brought Barton
                  hither to be drowned! Once alarmed, he had no resource in reflection to restrain
                  and moderate it. The poor fellow wept.
                  Speak he would not, for fear of alarming Barton, though he might have shouted
                  without danger of being heard in the thunder of the cataract!
               He reached his hand over to see if the water was rising, and to his horror it was
                  even then lapping the very edge of the rock. The foam flitted past him, like
                  specks of faint light. It struck him that he had seen no foam before! It must be
                  growing toward morning! Oh, if it were but light! To be drowned in darkness, to be
                  caught like rats in a trap, and made way with, when, perhaps, if one could only
                  see, there might be away of escape hardly a step off! Poor Pete gained a slight
                  hope from the sight of the waters. But the morning rose slowly and the waters rose
                  fast. It must be soon or never.
               The light dawned at length. Pete began to see the walls of rock on either side.
                  About two hundred yards up, the stream came pelting down with a tremendous plunge,
                  and with that massive movement that indicates great depth of water. Across, from
                  side to side, the chamber of rocks was filled by the stream, which was still
                  hastening wildly, madly, toward the ledge over which Pete had ascended.
               The rocks on which they were perched had fallen out of the walls on that side,
                  being sprung from their original place by the frosts. The place was visible from
                  which they had been moved. It was like a huge step in the side of the cliff, about
                  six feet above their heads. Could that be reached immediate danger at least would
                  be over. From the crevices of the rock grew some shrubs but an old hemlock that
                  seemed as if it had once had the rheumatism, which left all its joints swollen and
                  twisted, projected from the sides of the rocks almost at right angles. To catch
                  the boughs and swing himself into the tree to sprung from it upon the rocks where
                  the block upon which Barton lay had once been, was but the work of a moment. But
                  how to get Barton there? He could help himself but very little.
               The need was pressing. The water was running clear over the surface of the rock.
                  Pete descended, helped Barton to his feet, placed him in a selected spot, then
                  springing again into the hemlock, and reaching down, he took Barton under the
                  armpits and drew him up upon the trunk. The tree quivered. Should its roots give
                  way it was all over with them! Pete did not wait for inspection tion. It was this
                  or nothing. The hardest feat, yet to do. Moving back along the trunk, he came to
                  the point least distant from the rock. Seizing Barton with his left arm he made
                  one bound into Which he put every particle of his strength, reached the edge of
                  the rock, wavered, reeled, and fell, but fell forward, and was safe at last!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LIV.
               A NIGHT AND A DAY IN THE MOUNTAINS.
               THE first step had been taken. But it might be called a step away from danger,
                  rather than a step toward safety. They were safe at least from the peril of
                  waters. On looking back one now could by the morning light see into what a
                  dangerous position they had wandered. It was a narrow ravine, cloven through solid
                  rock apparently by some convulsive agency rather than by the slow wearing of
                  waters. When the stream was low it occupied but a small space. But heavy rains
                  brought down from the mountain sides such sheets of water as had the power
                  suddenly to swell the rill to a torrent, and as the exit was quite narrow, the
                  waters, if rains were violent or continued, set back and filled up the whole
                  space.
               The place on which Pete now stood with his almost helpless burden, was situated at
                  the mouth of what in a thousand years might become a lateral ravine, sloping
                  toward the gulf from which they had just escaped. There was a depression in the
                  rocks, a kind of rude channel that fortunately did not pursue a straight, steep
                  course but zigzagged in such a manner that a very strong and agile man might climb
                  to the summit. Had Pete only himself to rescue he would have gone up almost as
                  quickly as a crow could. But his own safety without the rescue of Barton, would
                  have been a great disaster to his simple, faithful soul.
               Laying his burden carefully down, Pete began to explore the way. He soon ascended
                  to the summit. But there were points where even Pete Sawmill, with the strength of
                  three men, could not have conveyed himself and Barton too. In so far as mere
                  lifting was concerned, Pete could have carried Barton up as easily as a bear could
                  carry her cub in her mouth. But to lift and spring at the same time, with the dead
                  weight of a sick man upon him, transcended even Pete's power. Could Barton have
                  helped himself enough to cling around Pete, it would have bettered matters. But
                  the severe strain of battle for two days and two nights his wounds and the
                  exposure to cold and rain among the rocks that night, had now rendered Barton
                  quite helpless, and Pete was even afraid that he might die on his hands.
               After surveying the several sides and selecting the most feasible, Pete returned
                  to Barton and slowly and with extreme difficulty conveyed him, little by little,
                  to a point more than half-way to the summit. Here he was confronted by an obstacle
                  that seemed likely to stop him. On every side but one the rocks were insuperable.
                  But on the right a perpendicular-faced rock was laced with roots and overhung with
                  the branches of some stunted trees in a way that, if Pete could but have the use
                  of both arms and feet, he could easily ascend. But how to hold on to Barton and
                  climb with but one hand!
               At length, Pete's ingenuity vanquished that difficulty. Barton seemed like a dying
                  man. He moaned when any violent exertion stirred up his pains. He was quite
                  helpless. Pete first tried by passing his sash about him to lash Barton to his own
                  breast. That would not do. He then attempted to loop the sash under Barton's arms
                  and to pass the other part over his own neck. Both endeavors failed for the same
                  reason. Barton hung down so low that he was quite unmanageable. At length, an idea
                  struck Pete. Whether it was an instinct derived from his pre-existent state
                  wherein Pete must have been a stalwart bear, or whether he remembered that animals
                  carry their young in their mouths, or whether, still more probably, he remembered
                  the pennies which he had earned (and drank up) in Norwood for lifting men off from
                  the ground with his teeth, he determined to bring a new force into play that
                  should still leave him the full use of his hands and feet. Winding the sash
                  tightly round and round Barton, close under his arms, he seized it with his mouth,
                  and, straightening himself up, he found that Cathcart's feet fairly cleared the
                  ground. He now, with his arms and legs free, could without difficulty climb the
                  rock. While Pete was thus occupied, two pair of eyes were peering out front above
                  upon him, with an expression that boded no good.
               "What dat, Sam? Look a dar—what dat, I say?"
               "Oh, Lord, I tink he be bar!"
               "Dat bar's got a big cub, den—dat's what I say! Mighty strong mouf!"
               
               "Oh, lord, lord! I tink it be debbil—cotcht a sinner—gwine to eat him up—oh,
                  lord-a-marcy!"
               "Shut up nigger! I know what ee be! it's a reb. Don't you see his clo's? He's reb
                  ossifer! Git me some rocks, nigger! If he tote dat fuller under here, I smash 'im
                  head!"
               Pete had come to the very place designated, and our story would have had an abrupt
                  termination, had not the more intelligent of the two negroes above observed
                  something in the uniform, as Pete laid down his burden, that looked less like a
                  rebel than he at first supposed. Whereupon, a parley ensued.
               "I say, dar, you better stop!"
               Pete much surprised, looked in every direction, at this summons; but could see no
                  one.
               "Who's that?" he said; and instantly imagining help at hand, he added: "Where are
                  you? Jist come and give us a lift, will ye? I'm afeered the general will die."
               Two woolly heads protruded from the bushes, on the summit above him, the one
                  looking cautiously and the other timidly down upon him.
               "Who be dat? W'at you got dar? Rebel?"
               "No, it is Gineral Cathcart of the Union army. We got away from the rebs last
                  night. He's badly wounded. Can't ye give a fellow a lift now?"
               "You wait now, I tell ye! Sam, you go for Massa Jacob, quick."
               It was not more than ten minutes, though to Pete it seemed hours, before Jacob
                  appeared, in the form of a comely young man of about twenty-two years of age. His
                  hair was long; his hat something wide of brim, though rather rough; but his speech
                  at once bespoke him of the excellent and honorable family of Friends, or, as the
                  world will have it, Quakers.
               He needed no explanations. Union or rebel, a wounded man must not die unhelped.
                  Despatching one of his men for some halters, he soon had made a line long enough
                  and strong enough to lift Barton up. Pete was at the summit quite as soon. A walk
                  of about five minutes conveyed them to a rude hut, built originally by charcoal
                  burners, but now patched a little and made tenantable. Pete speedily told his
                  story, and learned, on the other hand, that he had stumbled upon a hiding place of
                  cattle and horses. Within a stone's throw there were a hundred and more cows and
                  oxen and some three score fine horses, the half of the neat stock and two-thirds
                  of the horses belonging to Paul Hetherington, the father of the comely youth who
                  had rescued them. Several contrabands, who during the war had escaped from
                  Virginia, and who had found employment on Hetherington's farm, were more than
                  willing to retreat into the mountains with the cattle, for reasons of their own
                  safety, while the rebel army remained in the valley.
               Jacob Hetherington, fortunately, had some little medical knowledge. He had been
                  much among the wounded at the battle of Antietam. He had already conveyed to
                  Gettysburg, on two several days, a load of various comforts for the wounded. But
                  sorely to his regret, he could not devote himself to the work of humanity, being
                  needed at home to superintend this new department in the mountains.
               Barton's wounds were at once cleansed and bound afresh. Spirits he had none; but
                  hot coffee was soon prepared. The young Friend put his own coat on Barton,
                  wrapping himself in a blanket.
               It was full time for Barton Cathcart to receive some succor. Wounded twice upon
                  Friday afternoon, his weary progress on. Saturday, the additional wound on making
                  his escape, the cold rains the rude kindness of Pete by which he was dragged
                  through bushes and over rocks, without nourishment, and without stimulants, all
                  this had brought him down to such weakness that he seemed likely to sink away of
                  mere exhaustion. His pulse was very feeble, his skin cold, and his whole system
                  very low. Jacob Hetherington was alarmed. The wound upon his abdomen was likely to
                  be mortal. If the ball had sunk deep within, he would die within a few hours, and
                  all his appearance indicated the approach of this catastrophe. Even if no interior
                  part had been sundered, much was to be feared from inflammation, and he was no
                  state to bear a peritoneal fever.
               Jacob Hetherington was a rigid temperance man, as also was his father, and the
                  young man presented such a wholesome cheek, a skin so pure, an eye so unstained
                  with morbid blood, that he was a walking commendation of abstemiousness. Albeit
                  not given to violence, yet, if any one had doubted whether a "total abstainer" could be strong, he had only to repair
                  to some green and grassy spot for a wrestling bout, and every doubt would
                  disappear! Jacob was well satisfied with his own principles and practice; and yet,
                  when he saw Barton's condition he sorely regretted that some body of an opposite
                  view was not in his camp. He had strictly forbidden the use of intoxicating drinks
                  among his father's hired men, and now, when he would have given a river full of
                  cold water for a pint of whiskey, not a drop was to be had. Jacob questioned Pete
                  on the subject.
               "Wal, I brought a flask along, but when I got in the rebel camp the fellers went
                  through me mighty quick, and one on 'em, pulled out my flask, and sez he, 'Ah,
                  nigger, this pocket pistol is very dangerous—might go off.' I never seed it
                  agin."
               "I am afraid that your master will suffer for want of stimulants. He may die for
                  want of a gill of brandy."
               Pete was a good deal troubled.
               "Brandy? Why don't you give 'im whiskey? Our folks give 'em whiskey when the
                  brandy gives out."
               "But I have no whiskey. There is none 'in camp. None of my men ever touch it."
               "S'pose you jest ask 'em. Mebbe some on 'em got it accidental like."
               Jacob had no hope in the matter. His orders had been peremptory. He knew that his
                  men would obey. Besides he did not believe that they could use whiskey and he not
                  perceive it. Yet he called his men.
               "Have any of you got a little whiskey?"
               They all looked horror-struck!—No, none of them!
               "This gentleman will die on our hands, I fear, unless I can procure some immediate
                  relief. Sam, I think you had better go down to the settlement—you might, even take
                  one of the colts—and get a flask of whiskey. I will give you a dollar for it."
               Great as was Sam's aversion to whiskey, he had a yet more terrible dread of rebel
                  soldiers. Any thing rather than venture down where he might be caught. Indeed, the
                  urgency of the case awoke in Sam's memory something which he had entirely
                  forgotten.
               "Why, sah, I jis 'member dat Dutchman, las' night, had a bottle. I see him drink
                  suthin', and den he hide 'em in de rock. He wanted me to drink—'course I wouldn't,
                  'case I knew 'twas, whiskey."
               Pete was impatient.
               "What's the use, you nigger, in lyin' so? If you've got a bottle, you go git
                  it—pretty quick, I say!"
               Pete's words were far more efficacious than Jacob's. For Pete had had a pull at
                  that bottle already, and knew its quality. His only doubt respected the amount of
                  contents left. All three of the colored men had tasted it and none of them hurried
                  themselves.
               Sam soon appeared bearing a junk bottle in which a cob served as a cork. He seemed
                  to be an entire stranger to it. He took out the stopper, and looked in to see if
                  there was any thing there. He held it up to the sky for the same purpose. He smelt
                  of it.
               "I guess um whiskey—spects so! mighty bad stuff," said Sam, with the most virtuous
                  look of disgust at this dangerous substance. "Massa nebber let a nigga have um—put
                  de debbil in de nigga."
               The grave smile that lay upon Jacob's face indicated that he had his own opinion
                  of this new miracle of whiskey from the rocks, and of the story about the Dutchman
                  hiding it there, but he eagerly took it, turned out its contents—alas! but
                  slender—into a tin cup of coffee.
               "Better than none, but far from sufficient. I would give thee another dollar for a
                  bottle full."
               His master's wishes were a law to Sam—with such sanction appended; he renewed his
                  search and faith and diligence were rewarded. That Dutchman had hid another bottle
                  in the same place! but, cunningly as he had secreted them, Sam found them, showing
                  that he had the natural gifts for a detective under the excise law.
               As soon as Barton had been attended to, Pete left him in charge of Jacob
                  Hetherington, while he himself went with the plantation negroes to view the
                  cattle. Pete's great size, his lofty manners toward his humble attendants, the
                  awfulness of that knowledge which they thought he possessed, served to make him an
                  object of hardly less than reverence.
               Descending rapidly from the point where the cabin was, they came to a kind of
                  basin, sheltered on all sides by ridges. It might once have been a lake. From springs breaking out
                  here, ran that stream which had nearly swallowed up Pete during the night. And the
                  reason of its sudden rise was soon apparent. All the rain falling on these slopes
                  was conveyed as by a tunnel to one outlet, and an hour's hard rain was enough to
                  set the brook a roaring; while a half day's rain sent down through the narrow
                  defile such torrents of waters stirred it to a rage and a violence awful to
                  behold!
               In this mountain basin were collected about a hundred head of cattle, Paul
                  Hetherington's and his neighbors. Rude divisions were attempted to keep them
                  somewhat separate, lest being strangers they should punish each other. For, cattle
                  partake of human feelings in this respect, and they quarrel with all that do not
                  belong to their barnyard. In spite of short commons they looked remarkably well. A
                  rebel quartermaster would have blessed his luck could he have plumped down on this
                  mountain nest!
               But it was the horses that gave to Pete his chief delight. They were hitched
                  singly or in pairs along every little level spot, on terraces, and in snug coves.
                  Two teams of huge gray Conestoga horses; a span of sorrels, with light manes and
                  tails, with a brown stripe along from withers to rump; a pair of blood-bay mares,
                  daintily built, and yet strong and serviceable; a score of brawny, hard-features
                  work horses, eight fine brood mares, a pen with five or six fine colts, two
                  full-blood Messenger mares, and a full-blood stallion, between chestnut and
                  sorrel, with white feet, and with a disposition not the most amiable. He seemed
                  angry at his rude quarters. He was savage as a Roman exile. As Pete came toward
                  him, Old Duke lashed out at him in a style that Pete regarded as an invitation to
                  a funeral, and which would have led to one if Pete had not been on his guard.
               But that horse was never foaled that Pete feared. He passed toward his head, and
                  though the vicious beauty laid back his ears till they seemed to sink into his
                  head, and showed an ugly muzzle, Pete fixed his eye full on him, spoke in low,
                  decided tones, moved quietly but firmly right up to him, and in a minute the
                  stallion ate out of his hand, and whinnied when Pete left him. If his companions
                  had reverenced Pete before, the worshipped him now. This fascination which he
                  seemed to exercise over the animal kingdom addressed itself to Sam's understanding
                  far more effectively than if Pete had spoken ten modern languages and built St.
                  Peter's church.
               The mountain air was peculiarly exhilarating to Pete. The longer he stayed with
                  these contrabands the more amiable he became, and when he returned to the cabin
                  after an hour's absence he was extremely gracious; he laughed, and chuckled, and
                  sputtered by turns, in a manner which, in any other person, would have indicated
                  an over dose of whiskey. It could not be, however, that Tom had secreted any more
                  mountain dew; for Jacob said that his men were all of them temperate, except, of
                  course, that unlucky Dutchman, who had gone down to prepare fodder and grain to be
                  brought up in the night, and on whose shoulders Sam put all the blame of
                  concealing whiskey! At any rate Pete fell asleep, as well he might, after the
                  toils of the two days and nights which he had borne in so stalwart a manner.
               Jacob Hetherington had grave anxieties. He appreciated Barton's critical
                  condition. It was not possible in this place to render him such service as be
                  instantly needed. He determined, therefore to get him down to his father's house
                  as soon as possible. As a first step, he set to work to learn whether the rebel
                  army had left the neighborhood and cleared the pass. It was but a mile across from
                  his cattle camp to the pass through which Lee's army were retreating. The stream
                  whose course Pete had followed did not run at right angles with the pass, but,
                  after being followed a half mile back, it came from the right and ran nearly
                  parallel with the road, so that, though Pete had travelled several miles, the
                  point which he reached was not more than a mile from the road. On a careful
                  reconnaissance, Jacob concluded that it would not be safe to venture down much
                  before sundown. As Ewell did not leave the lines before Gettysburg till about noon
                  of that day, his corps still stretched along the roads and were now entering the
                  defile.
               A little before sundown, Pete was roused from sleep into a state of waking
                  bewilderment. He seemed to have forgot every thing and every body, and was in a
                  maze of wonder at his strange surroundings.
               The sight of Barton restored his consciousness, and he gradually came to his
                  recollections. A rude litter had been constructed. Halter ropes and odd straps
                  were woven back and forth as a substitute statute for a canvas bottom. A rough blanket was laid upon it, and Barton laid
                  thereon. The two black servants carried him the first part of the descent, and
                  then they returning to their charge, Jacob and Pete took their places. When they
                  reached the cleared fields it was dusk. Avoiding the roads, Jacob, who knew the
                  whole region familiarly, moved across lots, by ways both nearer and more obscure.
                  It was full dark when they entered the avenue leading up to the wide-faced stone
                  house where Paul Hetherington lived. As they entered the dwelling, the change
                  seemed to Pete like a translation from purgatory to heaven. Paul Hetherington
                  stepped forward,—a tall man, strongly built, with a large face long between the
                  mouth and eyebrows, (as every grand face must be,) a high and wide brow but wider
                  than high hair—now changing color—worn long, an eye that was blue when he was
                  calm, but gray when it kindled; and, altogether, such a fine, large man as would,
                  in any company, excite admiration and respect.
               His face testified by its texture to right living; by its whole frame and shape to
                  largeness of nature; by its eye and brow to sagacity and thoughtfulness; by its
                  mouth to a suppressed humorousness. Here was stuff for a statesman. He might have
                  been an archbishop. Had he been a general, his very presence would have been worth
                  half an army. He might have made any thing. He was only a Quaker. Yet one could
                  not help saying:
               "What a pity that such a man should have no sphere worthy of his nature!"
               The proper reply would have been:
               "What a happy land that can afford to have such men for private citizens!"
               Martha Hetherington, his wife, about fifty-five years of age, was the very and
                  proper wife for Paul Hetherington. She was of rather full habit; yet her face was
                  pale, but not cadaverous. Every feature was shaped finely, and yet the whole face
                  conveyed the impression of largeness rather than fineness.
               She was not handsome, though every feature was good. There was a sort of
                  independence in the members of her face. Each feature, as it were, kept house for
                  itself. But that harmony and sympathy which was originally denied to the physical
                  form of her countenance had gradually been supplied by the expression which, year
                  by year, crept over it. One would be apt to say, "That is the handsomest homely
                  face that I ever saw." Three children blessed their household. Jacob was the
                  youngest, and the only son. The eldest daughter was like her mother, and had
                  married and settled in life; the other, resembling her father, was living at home.
                  Two other daughters there had been, but they were no longer living.
               While we are telling you all these things, you may be sure they were not standing
                  still, listening to their own praises. The best room was always prepared. Into a
                  bed, whose linen shone like snow Barton was laid by the strong arms of Paul the
                  father and Jacob the son.
               The room opened out of the family room, and so was the very room for sickness
                  which loves to be cheered by hearing the soft sounds of family life without being
                  in their very midst.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LV.
               THE SURPRISE.
               IT is not given to all birds alike to soar high, or to continue long upon the
                  wing. The wing must be shapely, the muscle must be ample, the nerve strong, if a
                  bird is to hang long in the air without weariness. Small birds, with short and
                  blunt wings, are always near the ground. Quails and partridges, grouse and
                  woodcock love the earth, and run upon the ground with more delight than they fly
                  in the air. Therefore their enemies easily find them and their nests—the rat, the
                  weasel, the polecat, and the swine, and other hunters many. Small birds,
                  seed-eating,—finches, sparrows, thrushes,—build low and fly low. Their courses are
                  neither wide nor daring. They hop along the twigs in hedges or hover giggling and
                  simple-hearted, in low-branched trees. In fence-rows, cats lurk for them. In the
                  woods small hawks, blue-jays, and strikes devour them. Even darkness does not
                  cover them from the goggle-eyed owl, whose soft wings areas noiseless as death.
                  Then come bolder birds, that seldom descend below the tops of forests, that live
                  high up above mousing enemies and are more familiar with the sun than with the
                  shade. And hither than all are the long-winged birds, that hang over the ocean,
                  that beat about in storms,—gulls; petrels. Or, still higher, falcons, condors,
                  eagles,—that brood upon the sunlight and lie upon the mere air as if it were water
                  under their breasts and they were fowl swinging on the sea. In these glorious
                  solitudes they live secure. Noises never rise so high; storms and thunder sound
                  below them. The sun comes earlier to them, and lingers later. Their days are
                  longer. There are no fences there parcelling out the great domain. No trees or
                  forests shadow the empyrean; no mountains divide it, nor rivers water it. Only the
                  Sun himself inhabits there—solitary, though the father of multitudes,—dropping
                  down showers of light, which he does not see, and giving life to infinite broods
                  that never knew, nor are known of their father, who through ages is giving and
                  forgetting, begetting and forsake, creating and devouring. And yet no wing was
                  ever framed that could soar forever. The gull at last alights. The falcon builds a
                  nest, and seeks it. The eagle has a home among the rocks. Only man's thoughts rise
                  higher than the eagle's wing, higher than the sun, and walk in the celestial city,
                  where is no night, nor weariness, nor sorrow. But even Faith itself may not always
                  abide in these high delights. The heart must come back to its nest.
               Through all of Sunday, Rose Wentworth soared up above all trouble. The sun went
                  down without bringing darkness to her. But on the sixth while the camps were
                  waking up, and Meade's dilatory army began to creep out in pursuit, Rose chanced,
                  somewhat after mid-day, to meet Col. Frank Esel, who was hurrying forward to
                  overtake his regiment.
               "Miss Wentworth—a thousand blessings on you! I knew that you hovered somewhere
                  about here. General Cathcart told me of your presence. By the way, you have heard
                  that he was wounded and taken?"
               "I heard that he had fallen—that he was dead!"
               "Dead, Miss Wentworth? dead? Upon my word, you're mistaken! it must be a false
                  report. I was not far from him in the fight. I saw him go in, and he and a dozen
                  more men were gobbled up. But he was alive, and wounded, and a prisoner—I know;
                  for several of the men escaped during the night, who saw him within Lee's lines,
                  and though little able to walk, yet he was not ardently wounded dangerously."
               If Rose had been caught up by a whirlwind, or swept down in the current of the
                  over-full Rock creek she could not have been more whirled about and helpless than
                  she was at this astounding news.
               "Not dead!—not dead!—alive?—a prisoner?—alive! Oh, do not say such things. It
                  cannot be! Alive?—alive? O my soul, be still! Do not believe it!"
               "Cousin Rose," said Esel, moved by the intensity of her manner, "I do truly assure
                  you that Barton is alive, unless something has befallen him since he reached the
                  enemy's lines. He was alive and not dangerously wounded on Saturday, that I
                  certainly know; and there is no reason to think that harm has befallen him since.
                  I truly wish you joy, and am heartily glad to surprise you with such good news.
                  God bless you, my dear cousin," and with that he put spurs to his horse and
                  disappeared.
               
               Rose stood like one dreaming. Then she started, as if to go to her patients.
                  Suddenly she stopped and turned to go after Agate. Then, with another sudden
                  change, she started to find her father. All her settledness of heart was gone. She
                  had fallen down out of the clouds to her nest quite near to the ground, and began
                  to experience those gusts and whirls of feeling which sweep the lower levels of
                  human life. While she was thus going first to the right and then to the left,
                  Hiram Beers met her.
               "Well, Miss Rose, what's up? You look flustered like. I hope you ain't takin' on
                  'bout Barton, 'cause that won't do no good. We must all die. You know what the
                  catechism says—'Xerxes did die, and so must you and I.' It's a fact, and can't be
                  helped. But I dew feel bad, after all. I tell you Rose, there ain't many left
                  that's equal to Barton."
               "Hiram, Barton is not dead! Col. Esel says that he was seen in Lee's camp, wounded
                  and a prisoner."
               "Well now, that's wuth hearin'," said Hiram, greatly excited but holding in every
                  sign of it, as if it was a sin to show his feelings. "But it's a pity to feel bad
                  for nothing, I swow; if I ain't cried every time I've thought on't, and now it's
                  just so many tears throwed away! Well, well, I vum, but it's jolly! that is,
                  supposin' it's true."
               "Hiram, you must go with me to Agate Bissell. Barton must not be left thus.
                  Something must be done immediately for his release."
               The glad tidings spread joy in the little band. Agate spoke not a word. She stood
                  firmly, listened to every syllable, her face shining brighter with each
                  confirmation and then stepping aside, with her face toward the woods, she stood
                  for a while in prayer of thanksgiving. At length, lifting her apron for a
                  handkerchief and wiping her eyes, she came back to Rose, with an intensity of
                  feeling that seldom escaped her, and put her arms about her and kissed her
                  forehead—"Rose, it is the Lord that slayeth, and the Lord marketh alive. Blessed
                  be the name of the Lord!"
               Alice was certainly glad, but joy had but poor chance in her heart. Like plants
                  that grow under shade trees, it came up pale and feeble, and could not blossom
                  into laughter.
               "Agate," said Rose, "what shall be done Will you look after my men? I can do
                  nothing further until I have released Barton?"
               "Child, what can you do? You must wait."
               "What will waiting do? Is he not even now moving down towards those hideous
                  Southern prisons? It were better to have died outright, under the bright sun, than
                  to mould, and decay, and die piecemeal, in those dens of cruelty. No, I will this
                  instant find General Meade."
               "Headquarters is moved," said one of the men; "the general has gone."
               "But I can overtake him."
               "Rose," said Agate, "you are wild. What could General Meade do, if you did see
                  him? Can he stop his army to go after one man? I guess he's got something else to
                  think of."
               "But I could get a pass to the enemy's lines—I could see General Lee!"
               "Why, Rose," said Agate, rebukingly, "this is downright craziness." And then in a
                  pitying tone—"I don't blame you, though; and if any thing could be done, I'd
                  encourage it."
               "Standing here, and seeing all the difficulties but none of the favorable chances,
                  will not help Barton. It is no common case, and will admit of no common action. I
                  will go to him. There is not storm enough in the sky, nor water enough in the
                  river," said Rose, looking on the turbulent stream below her, "to hinder me. Every
                  thing will help me; every thing will give way to that courage which fills my soul.
                  God is in me. I know that this purpose is not of man! He who kept Barton in the
                  battle will keep me."
               Agate was more convinced by Rose's appeal to God and her declaration of her trust
                  in him than by any thing presented to her reason. The evidences of piety were more
                  to her than the evidences of her own judgment.
               "Rose, if God has called you to this work I don't doubt that he will open the way.
                  But you ought to examine your heart and know whether you are following your own
                  affections! And though we trust to Providence it should always be in the use of
                  means. Now let us sit down and see what can be done."
               "I can go to General Meade's headquarters, and procure a letter which will give me
                  access to General Lee."
               "Tut, tut—that won't do—never in the world. Barton is in Virginia before this
                  time, and Lee can't help him if he wants to ever so much."
               
               "Then I will go to Virginia. I will find his prison."
               "Suppose you did—you could not storm the prison. They wouldn't let you in nor
                  Barton out. It's pretty much as they say in Richmond about such things, I
                  guess."
               "Then I'll go to Richmond. I will see every man in authority. Agate, you need not
                  discourage me. There is that within my heart that will make my way. I will rescue
                  Barton, or I will die in the endeavor! I can do any thing but stay here!"
               It was now about the middle of the afternoon. The conference was broken up by an
                  unexpected event. Just as Agate was about to reply to Rose, in came Pete Sawmill,
                  making two or three jumps which a deer might envy, and then, in a transport of
                  rude delight, he tumbled over and over, and rolled on the ground, as an extremely
                  merry and jolly dog will do who finds his feelings far too great to be expressed
                  by the mere wagging of his tongue at one end or his tail at the other.
               When at last he had reduced his superabundant excitement to a more governable
                  state Pete informed the party that Barton had escaped; that he had got him safely
                  into good quarters; that he had come over in a wagon after a surgeon; that he had
                  luckily stumbled on Dr. Wentworth, who was promptly going back with him; and that
                  the doctor thought a nurse had better go out too.
               Rose said to Agate:
               "Do you not see that I was led? The Lord's hand has been all this strange
                  work."
               "His name be praised!" said Agate, whisperingly.
               Paul Hetherington had brought Pete over, taking care at the same time to fill his
                  wagon with such comforts for the wounded as he could provide. Jacob Hetherington
                  remained at home to superintend the descent of the cattle and horses from the
                  mountain fastnesses. Paul excused the indifferent quality of his team by
                  explaining that his best horses were hidden away. They rode briskly away from
                  Gettysburgh, and across the very ground which was yesterday held by Lee's rear
                  guard. As they proceeded, Pete pointed them to a field with scattering shade tree
                  in it.
               "There 'twas. There's where I found the general, under that tree, fast
                  asleep."
               Along the road were marks of the haste with which Ewell had retreated. Broken
                  wagons, dead animals, muskets, knapsacks, were strewn along the ways.
               The sixth corps of Meade's army had closely followed, and were yet lying near
                  Fairfield, somewhat impeding the journey to Hetherington's house. When once fairly
                  on the road, Dr. Wentworth, who had not before seen Rose for more than a few
                  moments, said:
               "I thought it likely that Agate Bissell would come; but I am glad that she sent
                  you, Rose. I have hardly seen you for a moment."
               "I needed no sending, father. No one would have been permitted to go to Barton but
                  me. It is my errand."
               And with that she drew from her bosom Barton's letter, and gave it to her father
                  to read.
               Dr. Wentworth read it through—read it a second time. In spite of himself the tears
                  came to his eyes. He put his arm gently and fondly round his daughter, and said,
                  in a whisper:
               "I suppose you go to answer this, Rose?"
               "Father, if he only lives—if God will but spare us—"
               And with that she laid her head upon her father's breast and burst into tears, and
                  wept violently, and almost convulsively. It was well. After such high and
                  long-continued strain nature demanded relief. Rose had come down out of the high
                  and bright, clouds and walked upon the ground again, a woman full of hopes and
                  fears of weakness and tears.
               Paul Hetherington sat with Pete on the front seat. I do not believe he looked
                  around once. If one had watched it might, possibly, have been seen that his large
                  and grave face was slightly inclined so that the merest glance of Rose's
                  agitation, and her father's protecting caress, might have entered his eye; but he
                  turned his face square towards his horses, and sat immovable till they drove up
                  the avenue of venerable old cherry trees which lined the way from the road to the
                  house, trees that now hung full of ripe cherries and red robins. The fruit was
                  over abundant. The sun lying low, was shining aslant through the trees, and
                  filling them with a kind of golden vapor. They seemed to be tabernacles for birds.
                  Catbirds miawed and jerked their tails nervously; robins breathed a low pympf, or were wholly silent; cedar birds, jays, brown thrushes, and
                  numberless other fruit-loving loving
                  birds, fluttered and flew as the wagon went on coming back again the instant it
                  had passed as water open and shut to the passage of a ship.
               "I think, sir," said Dr. Wentworth, "that the boys don't stone the birds in these
                  grounds."
               "Nay; the only stones which I allow to be thrown are cherrystones. Thou art aware,
                  doubtless, that music hath little place among Friends; but it is brought to us
                  even as the prophet's food was, upon wings."
               The dwelling-house, of dark gray stone, now stood out plainly. It did not stretch
                  up ambitiously, but lay broad upon the ground, having the expression, not only of
                  roominess, but of hospitality. Every door had a coaxing look, and each window
                  said, Come in. One might search in vain for a stick a chip, a shaving, or a straw
                  all around the house. Absolute order and neatness was written upon the face of
                  things. Every gate stood up straight. Every stone in ever wall was true to a line.
                  Nothing seemed to have ever fallen down; nothing was ever dropped. The very winds
                  did not dare to send the leaves upon the grass. The garden on the right held out
                  its bright blossoms, and marshalled its rows of culinary vegetables, without a
                  weed or a withered stalk.
               To Rose, who had so long been used to the rudest scenes, and to the very paradise
                  of disorder, the excessive neatness on every hand produced something of the
                  impression of fine art. But little time they had for outward observations.
               Martha Hetherington stood in the open porch, the door wide open behind her.
               "Thee is welcome home, Paul. The young man needs thy friends. I fear, Doctor, thee
                  has come on a poor errand. Alight! Is this his sister?" said Martha, turning to
                  Rose.
               "It is my daughter," said Dr. Wentworth.
               Paul, however, explained it with his eye. One look sufficed; and Martha tenderly
                  helped Rose from the wagon and gave her in charge to her comely daughter.
               "Rose?" said Martha.
               Two voices answered, one saying:
               "What ma?" and the other "What ma'am?"
               Martha Hetherington smiled. "Is thy name Rose?"
               "Rose Wentworth!"
               "And this is Rose Hetherington. Surely ye should like each other?"
               Dr. Wentworth went at once to Barton's bedside. He found him in a low and sinking
                  condition. Before making more close examination, he gave him more ample
                  stimulants, together, also with opium, which had not been administered; and the
                  stimulants only in a gradual manner.
               "For fear," Martha said, "of producing fever."
               "That is the only way to attack fever—such fever as he is liable to," said the
                  doctor.
               Strong beef-tea was prepared for him, and every means of restoring his ebbing
                  strength was used.
               "Had this wound upon the abdomen been deep, he would have died before this,—let's
                  see: Saturday night, Sunday night, Monday night,—forty-eight hours. Had the
                  intestines been sundered, he would have died within twenty-four hours. Should
                  there be an inflammation of the peritoneum, I should fear, in his exhausted
                  condition, that he could not stand up under it. Should there be only a local
                  inflammation and the suppuration of the wound itself, there will be hope."
               It was uncertain whether Barton was conscious of the presence of his friends or
                  not. He lay with half-closed eyes, either dreaming or carrying on a fevered
                  process of thought. No groans escaped him, but sometimes sighs. Rose stood by him,
                  outwardly calm. But who shall unroll that which filled her heart, as she gazed
                  upon Barton's bloodless face and his brow whiter than show, from which fell back
                  his black hair? His face was thin. His features were sharp. The whole face looked
                  old. As Rose gazed upon him, she momently expected him to speak. She wondered how
                  they could be so near and yet so utterly separated. She would have given worlds
                  for one look, for one word of recognition. After all this history of his love for
                  her, should be now at length die, knowing nothing of that deep treasure of her
                  heart!—die by her very side, and know it not!—die while her words were in his
                  ears, and his hand in hers, and yet not know their meaning!
               How terrible is the thunder—how more terrible is the crash of battle! Yet neither
                  of them is so awful as the measured cadence of one who tells us that our beloved
                  are walking away from us, along the road of the dying!
               
               Dark is the night; but what night so dark as that of love hopelessly watching? How
                  deep is the unexplorable sea! But far deeper is that night which Hope sounds with
                  line of fear—sounds, but can find no bottom!
            
            
               CHAPTER LVI.
               THE QUAKER HOME.
               COMPARED with the labors of the past two days, the anxieties and excitement of
                  Barton's case, brought home so closely to him by the knowledge of Rose's feelings,
                  seemed to Dr. Wentworth like rest. But in a perfectly healthy constitution food
                  may become a partial substitute for sleep, and enable one to go for many days in
                  continuous activity. It was not poetical, under all the circumstances, for Dr.
                  Wentworth to go out to Martha Hetherington's table that evening with a supreme
                  appetite. It was, however, a fact. Nor was the proverbial good housewifery of the
                  Friends put to shame by the ample supper, by the glowing neatness, the exquisite
                  simplicity of every arrangement. After somewhat satisfying the more urgent craving
                  of appetite, Dr. Wentworth could not help saying:
               "I am trying to see what it is that renders your table so beautiful, without
                  ornament. I have always esteemed the family table to be a kind of altar, a place
                  sacred and so to be made as complete in its finishings as may be. The act of
                  eating is itself one of the lowest. But society has thrown around it such thorough
                  associations of affection and social enjoyment that we scarcely perceive the going
                  on of the very thing for which the table was spread. That a refined and delicate
                  person has been talking, or sympathetically changing countenance while others
                  talk, we remember, but not that she has been eating. But, if you will excuse the
                  remark, something in your table strikes me most agreeably. There are, I perceive,
                  degrees in neatness."
               His host replied:
               "Our customs disallow ostentatiousness, but enjoin order and neatness. That is the
                  one channel through which the imagination has play. Music is not in vogue with us.
                  Our amusements are grave and frugal. We do not choose to expose our young people
                  to dangerous vanities by the use of colors, that so largely enter into the
                  fascinations of the world's people. It is not strange that neatness should become
                  much in our hands, since we are obliged
                  to express by it all that the world's people do by forms and colors and
                  sounds."
               "Ah, I see;—like the blind man, whose ears make up by acuteness something of the
                  lost sense. One might expect far more to be made of neatness when the whole
                  imagination is concentrated upon it, than if the taste were distributed through
                  many channels."
               "High colors and brilliant garments," said Hetherington, "do not harmonize with
                  spiritual states. Colors bring the mind down toward matter. As our thoughts reach
                  into the realm of holiness, they instinctively dispossess all objects of color. We
                  never imagine angels in blue, or red, or yellow but always in white."
               "But God made flowers," said Wentworth; "he colored the woods, he fashioned
                  clouds, and spanned the rainbow, and made gorgeous sunsets."
               "True; all these are of the earth—earthly. They are not to be disesteemed, since
                  the Creator's hand hath fashioned them. But they are not the symbols of holiness,
                  or of spiritual elevation. Useful things are not alike good for all things. Colors
                  are for the world and its objects, but pure white for the saints."
               "Since you and your Children are in the world and not in the spirit-land, colors,
                  methinks, might be suffered," replied the doctor.
               "Nay. They who aim at the estate of the just and the blessed are much helped by
                  keeping before them evermore the emblems of purity. There is need in this world of
                  every help. Simplicity, silence, and a soul open to the invisible light, are
                  chiefest means of grace. Some seek religion through gorgeous ceremonies by which
                  the senses are made drunk, and the conscience stumbles into idolatry; some by
                  ordinances that usurp the place of God and truth, and become a snare; some by
                  forms of worship, and noisy services of music and ritual. All these rouse up the
                  sensuous nature. The spirit is veiled by them. They binder and exclude the pure
                  light of divine truth, even as upon windows the fantastic forms and colors which
                  men's hands have printed there throw back upon their makers their own fancies, but
                  keep out the light of God's sun."
               "I conceive your view to be largely true," said Dr. Wentworth, "and important. But
                  it is partial, in that such abstraction is possible only to highly-organized
                  minds. In your way, you fall into the same error, methinks, that the greatest
                  thinkers in my own church have. That conception of holiness which was easy to
                  Jonathan Edwards because he was a poet and an ethical genius was impossible to men
                  of slender intellect, of no imagination, and of a penurious moral sense. In this
                  unconscious way great natures oppress the weak. It is putting children to the
                  stride of the giant. It is like tearing conic sections and the calculus in primary
                  schools. Men are taught to feel guilt for not possessing religious experiences
                  which they are no more capable of than Mrs. Hemans was of Milton's poetry, or
                  Tupper of Homer's epics."
               Hetherington paused, as if considering the matter, and after a little resumed:
               "There is much to be considered in thy words. Nevertheless, the things which men
                  cannot perform teach them far more than the things which they can easily do. The
                  whole world pulls at the body, and will have it an animal. Therefore the heavens
                  must draw upon the spirit. What if Jacob could not climb the ladder whose top was
                  in heaven? It taught him a lesson. It connected the very stones under his head
                  with the clouds above him, and taught him that there was a way, unseen by mortal
                  eyes, from the lowest thing to the highest."
               At last Dr. Wentworth had found his man! Of a nature as large as his own, reared
                  from a standpoint half round the circle from his, and so antipodal; sympathetic
                  and hospitable to others' thoughts, loving rather to think with and compare
                  thoughts than to dispute; capable of seeing things from other people's grounds,
                  and of suspecting what was the absolute truth whose partial revelations organized
                  sects in the world; sincere, earnest, deep, patient, not anxious to parade his
                  thoughts; sensitive to any confidence which might, subject to controversy and
                  defilement the silent sanctuary of the soul where God revealed, if not the truth,
                  yet mighty premonitions of it; carrying an undisclosed life of meditation
                  concerning the whole mystery of human life, and the hope of the life to come;
                  heartily in sympathy with his own sect, yet not believing it to be more than a
                  sect; a repressed, loving nature, but loving goodness and nobleness rather than
                  the common things in human nature; and, above all, believing in God, and therefore
                  not accepting the golden dust-specks of the sects as the whole mine, but grandly
                  waiting, and willing, with large content, to wait the day when death should spring up into Being,
                  Power, Purity, Knowledge.
               Both of these men were loyal to their sect, but larger. Like vines planted in a
                  garden, they covered the walls, overtopped them, and climbed into the neighboring
                  trees, bearing as much fruit in the great common highway as in the garden. Such
                  men are sometimes called unbelievers, because they believe so much more than
                  others.
               Great souls know each other. Years are the servitors of slower natures, and nurse
                  them into mutual confidence. There are certain touches that fine natures know
                  instantly, conclusive of all the rest the free-masonry of the son of God!
               What was sleep compared with such communion? It was long past midnight before they
                  separated, who never separated in all their after lives! And in those hours,
                  alone, in confidence, unobstructed by a fear, they spoke of the deep things of
                  life, and moved together over realms and royalties of meditation where each had so
                  often passed, a solitary traveller!
               Rose Wentworth would fain have watched by Barton's side all night, but her father
                  forbade, and enjoined sleep.
               "I am not weary, father: I cannot sleep if I lie down."
               "That is the very reason why you should not watch any longer. The long tension of
                  care, and your deep anxiety concerning Barton, have wrought a super-excitement,
                  which, if it goes on, will be dangerous. You must sleep, and here are
                  the means of procuring it," at the same time preparing for her an opiate. "Your
                  hands are cold, your head hot; you should put your feet into hot water for ten
                  minutes, and then take this."
               In the morning Barton was no worse; and "That is a gain," said the doctor. "If
                  when I return to-night there is no sign of peritoneal excitement, and his strength
                  is kept up, I shall have hope. But he will graze so near, that if he would only
                  look over he might see death."
               The sun was rising when Pete appeared with a stylish mare, to take the doctor back
                  to Gettysburg. Rose still slept. It was ten o'clock before she appeared, and even
                  then, for a while, the lethargic cloud hung over her.
               If Paul Hetherington had found a friend in Dr. Wentworth, so his wife had found a
                  favorite in his daughter. Martha seldom mistook took in judging people whom she
                  met. If any thing, she was slightly inclined to judge less favorably than her
                  husband; but, then, on that account she was oftener right. People helped her, and
                  made her abated judgments true. When, therefore, she took Rose at once to her
                  heart, it was a compliment which Rose did not as well understand as did Martha's
                  own family.
               Little could be done for Barton. He was either unconscious or wandering in mind.
                  Martha drew Rose from him. as much as possible. She must show her the
                  spring-house.
               "What is that?" said Rose, pointing to a queer stack of bricks under a the shed
                  close by the house.
               "That is our oven," said Martha.
               "What—out of doors? We build ours into the kitchen chimney."
               "It is the way of our fathers. The other perhaps is more convenient."
               They walked a few rods upon a path of flat stones, carefully laid down, and kept
                  free from weeds and grass. Indeed they were more like the pavement of a hall than
                  an out-of-doors walk. It led to a low stone house, on the edge of a slight dell.
                  The gables of the roof came over so far as to form a cover to the door. A small
                  room full of the smell of butter and milk first met them. If the house had seemed
                  clean to Rose, what should she think of this work-room in the spring-house? Its
                  maple-wood bowls, the white-wood dishes the beech-wood ladles and scoops, the pine
                  tables and benches, the blue ash floor, seemed to live in an intense rivalry with
                  each other which should be cleanest. The tubs dreaded lest the pails should get an
                  extra scour; the wooden spoons bellied up with all the conscious pride of the
                  spoon family, thanking God that they were red and not white, being made of the
                  heart-wood of the beech. The oak bench looked steadily over every day in hopes of
                  spying a speck on the white pine table, and the table was tickled whenever it
                  could spill something on the floor that would spoil its ridiculous conceit of its
                  own exceeding whiteness.
               "What is that?" said Martha Hetherington, with more animation than belonged to
                  that enforced tranquillity which she usually bore—"What is that? Verily it is a
                  fly! That silly girl, Polly, has left the door ajar, or some of these nettings are
                  moved in the windows."
               
               The fly buzzed and bolted out of the opened door as suddenly as a heretic from
                  before a bench of bishops, or a thief from the face of a magistrate.
               "He knew that he had no business here, the guilty thing! That fly lies in wait, I
                  sometimes think, and when I come he always disappears; but when Polly comes, he
                  presumes on her heedlessness. Twice before, this summer, Polly left the door open,
                  and I found that fly here."
               Rose was delighted with this excessive neatness, the very brilliance of
                  cleanness.
               "How can you contrive to be so remarkably neat? I never saw any thing like it in
                  my life."
               "Ah, child, I wish thee might have seen my mother's spring-house! That
                     was clean. But she was naturally neat. It is but an
                  acquired virtue with me!"
               A door opened out of this room into the spring-chamber. The cool air and the
                  creamy smell came up out of it, to Rose's great delight. Descending a few stone
                  steps, Rose saw, laid in solid cement, stone canals or troughs running around the
                  whole base; and, at about three feet above them, another series of
                  like-construction supported upon iron brackets let into the side walls. Into these
                  spring-water, gushing up from the rock within the chamber itself (which had been
                  built over a strong and unfailing spring), flowed with a gentle motion through all
                  the troughs, and made its exit on the farther side. Into this living water the
                  pans of milk were set. A part of the pans were glass, and a part silver. At any
                  rate, if they were not silver, they were tin polished to such brightness as Rose
                  never saw before. The names of twenty-five cows hung above their respective
                  contributions. Here were "Crumple," "Brindle," "Queen," "Violet," "Daisy,"
                  "Sukey," "Blackface," "Fawn," "Cherry," and all the other honored names of the
                  barn-yard.
               Next, they went to the barn. Such a sight Rose had never seen. It seemed to her
                  eyes more like a vast mansion. It was built of stone, three stories, besides the
                  cellars. Built upon a side-hill, the topmost story was on the level of the upper
                  ground; while side-hill roads, at different elevations, led into each lower story.
                  The mows for hay, now well nigh empty, made Rose, dizzy to look down into. They
                  were vast enough to hold hay for the "cattle on a thousand hills." The grain-room,
                  the root-cellars the straw-sheds, the mill-room—where, by water-power, roots and
                  hay were cut and grains ground; the harness, and wagon and tool rooms—seemed like
                  parts of a city rather than of a barn, to her eye, accustomed only to the snug and
                  small barns of New England. Every where, glass windows, with external shutters,
                  were provided. The wood-work was painted as in a dwelling-house. Besides the barn
                  proper, there were lean-tos, sheds, sheep-barns, straw-barns, cattle-sheds, a
                  horse-barn, and colt-pens,—until Rose was fairly bewildered! Water flowed
                  everywhere, spilt over nowhere. In one corner, the water spurted from no one could
                  tell where, into a stone tank; and, overflowing, disappeared—no one could see how.
                  There was water for each cattle-yard, for the sheep-yard, for the colt-yard. No
                  half-rotten barrels, nor leaking wooden troughs were seen up to their knees in
                  puddles of their own making. Every thing was stone. The water came in an orderly
                  manner, sparkled and dimpled in a quiet and orderly way, gravely moved off again,
                  and decorously disappeared. It was good Quaker water, and neither sung, nor
                  danced, nor wore profane bubbles.
               Nothing could have been more soothing and restful to Rose. Nor was the excitement
                  suffered to slacken. All day long, were coming down from the mountains the
                  returning horses, cows, and oxen. They were overjoyed to be released. They showed
                  as much excitement in returning to their homes as if they were children just
                  coming home in vacation. They ran around the yards, they drank at the stone tanks,
                  or horned each other away; they smelt of the walls and gates, and moved about with
                  a curious excitement, which surely must have answered in them—in a low and
                  rudimentary way—to the affections, and domestic local attachments of human
                  creatures.
               Even more exhilarated were the horses. It was deemed best to bring both cattle and
                  horses into yards and barns, for a few days, before giving them their old pasture
                  grounds. To be sure, the rebel army was gone, but the loyal army were not wholly
                  unversed in the distributive duties of the quartermaster's department. The day
                  passed slowly away. Rose anxiously waited her father's return.
               He came at about dark, but could give little comfort.
               
               "It is well, thus far. But we are in the dark reflecting this last wound. It is
                  not safe to probe it. We cannot know the extent of the injury internally. It may
                  be trifling. It may be serious to the last degree. We can only wait the
                  development of the case. If, in a week's time, no other dangerous symptoms occur,
                  Barton is safe. Meanwhile, it is necessary that his system should be held firmly
                  under the influence of opium, and his strength be kept up with nourishment and
                  stimulants."
               These were days of weariness and of trial far more severe to Rose than all the
                  watching and service of the hospital. All sweet excitements nourish the body, and
                  increase the strength upon which they draw. But acerb excitements, in which
                  half-hopeless fear plays at battledore and shuttlecock with courage, soon fever
                  the soul with anxious suspense; and suspense above all other elements is the very
                  poison of the mind. Rose would gladly have stayed by Barton's side every moment.
                  But Martha Hetherington would not suffer it. The watch was divided between the
                  three. Little there was to be done.
               Barton remained quite unconscious of what was going on. Whether it was the
                  disturbance of the brain by the inflammation of his wounds or whether it was the
                  opium, or, more probably both conjoined,—he gave no sign of recognition. Sometimes
                  he would lie with wide open eye and mutter half-audible sentences which seemed to
                  be fragmentary orders to his men. But it was like a trance or sleepwalking. He
                  took notice of no questions—he seemed looking into some distant place, and to be
                  separated wholly from the persons and events around him.
               The two Roses—Rose Wentworth and Rose Hetherington—came together as naturally as
                  two drops of dew. They had the true conditions of friendship. They were unlike,
                  and yet both were true-hearted and deeply imbued with moral sentiment. Love, whose
                  roots do not reach down to the religious feeling, can not be rich or enduring. It
                  is a summer herb—not a shrub or tree able to seek its many summers through many
                  winters. They wandered together talked much communed much and began, before they
                  separated, to love much. The Quaker woman had looked at life from a side so new to
                  Rose that she attributed the freshness and novelty to some originality of
                  disposition in her friend. On the other hand, the Yankee woman amazed her more
                  simple friend by her knowledge of literature, of art, and of the great outside
                  world.
               With true delicacy, all questions were forborne in regard to Rose's relations to
                  Barton. Every one in the household, of course, knew that there was love between
                  them. But the mother, the daughter, the father left Rose to her own liberty of
                  silence or speech, just as it should please her. Rose loved to go at evening, when
                  the cows were brought from pasture and the men or women milked them. One must have
                  been little conversant with country life, or very deficient in sentiment, who does
                  not know the enjoyments which may found in barns and their surroundings,—among
                  them is the smell of grain or hay, the pleasure of watching the faces and manners
                  of spirited horses, the peculiar restlessness and almost motherliness belonging to
                  the large-eyed, good-natured, cud-chewing cow. Then there were wrens chattering in
                  the most vixenish way, and swallows gliding in and out, like snatches of black
                  sunbeams—if there were such things,—and doves that went flapping up from the
                  ground to the roof, and then, from some invisible impulse, discharged themselves
                  into the air, and flew headlong toward some distant field; then, changing their
                  minds, wheeled about—some bolting right up in the air, some dividing to the right
                  or to the left; and then, all of them streaming headlong back to the roof again,
                  circling round and round, as if it were hot—a dozen dropping down, and the rest
                  swinging once more round the barn, where at last all alight, save one, which flies
                  off to another building; the rest won't go to him—and so, after a little, he comes
                  to them, and then they run after each other—crooning and strutting, for all the
                  world, as if they were human beings, in gay society, instead of being the simple,
                  innocent doves that they are. One could find simple delight in watching such
                  scenes for hours. Rose found them tranquillizing, too, from the contrast with the
                  cruel scenes to which she had so long been used. She compared the doves to cavalry
                  and laughed at the ludicrous dissemblance.
               But, with all that was winning in nature, and all that was delightful to Rose in
                  this great Quaker farm, so utterly unlike any that she had ever seen, the time
                  hung heavily upon her hands, and anxiety wore upon her heart.
               At length, upon Sunday, Dr. Wentworth, after considering Barton's whole condition, pronounced him decidedly
                  convalescent. The opiates were no longer needed. It was a day of intense
                  excitement to Rose. When will the stupor pass away? Will his mind come out of this
                  eclipse? Oh! what will he think when he first recognizes me? The hours passed on.
                  Rose would not leave the room. It was noon, and Barton was very quiet. The middle
                  of the afternoon came. A mortal fear stole over her. His mind may be permanently
                  affected! His sufferings and hardships may have overstrained his brain! Hours
                  passed on. Rose stood by the window. The sun was descending behind the mountain.
                  It poured down a flood of light over all the fields near and far. Long shadows
                  mimicked the shapes of all things and turned them into burlesque. Through the
                  half-opened shutters the light streamed into the room. It fell across the bed, and
                  flashed upon the pale face of the sick man, who stirred, opened his eyes, that no
                  longer stared, but seemed full of meaning. Rose came instantly to his side. She
                  sat silently gazing. Barton turned his eyes upon her in a wondering, troubled way.
                  Rose kneeled by his side, every feeling retreating to her heart, as if to stop its
                  beating. Barton closed his eyes, as if to shut out a phantom.
               "Barton, do you know me? Do you know your Rose?"
               He unclosed his eyes, and in a weak and feeble manner put his bands to his eyes,
                  as if to brush away films that were misleading his sight.
               He put his hand timidly out, to touch her, as if to make sure whether it was an
                  illusion or a reality. His hand was clasped in both of hers. She leaned toward
                  him. He felt her kiss upon his brow. Slowly and with difficulty he spoke:
               "Is—this—Rose?—my Rose?—I mean—"
               "Yes, Barton,—your own Rose; you will live, Barton—oh, Barton, live!
                  live!" She spoke with an intensity full of anguish, for a moment letting go
                  restraint.
               He lay silent. His eyes were closed. In his weakness he could not keep the tears
                  back that would break from under his eyelids. After a moment's pause, Barton
                  raised his eyes to Rose with a look of utter imploring, as if he would say,—"Do
                  not let me be deceived nor send me back again to hopelessness."
               Her eyes were full of gladness and love, if one could have seen them behind Rose's
                  tears.
               "God has been very gracious to us both, Barton. He has brought us together, and
                  nothing shall ever divide us again."
               Seeing how greatly he was agitated, though with joy, Rose, though her soul longed
                  for utterance and would have poured a tide of golden sentences into his willing
                  ear, refrained, from fear of injury, saying:
               "Barton! my own, and forever my own! you are too weak—we must neither of us speak
                  more now."
               He strove to lift his head—he would have put his arm about her. His languid eyes
                  were yet full of wonder and joy. With an ineffable smile Rose restrained him.
               "No, Barton, you must mind me a little while;" and then, in a tone yet lower and
                  sweeter, "If you love me, Barton—if still you love me—" She had no need to finish
                  the sentence, and did not, for some puff of wind threw back the shutter, and the
                  whole tide of sunlight streamed across the bed and fell upon Barton and upon Rose,
                  with so sudden an illumination that Rose, in her high-wrought joy, looking full
                  into the sun, said—"It is the blessing of God! We are accepted of Him, Barton! and
                  nothing shall put us asunder!"
               But why need we linger with these lovers through the long weeks of Barton's
                  recovery, made short by the joys of love?
               Oh, those mountain hours! those days of July! From morning to evening, moments
                  sped as bubbles on a mountain stream, that come, reflect all the light of heaven,
                  burst with ecstasy, and are followed by other bubbles, gaily dancing to the music
                  of the stream. Little medicine do they need whose souls are radiant with joy! Love
                  was more than medicine and better than food!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER LVII.
               THE ELM TREE.
               TWO years went by. The war had ended. Lee had laid down his arms, and Johnston had
                  capitulated. One by one, the scattered fragments of the Confederate army had
                  surrendered, or dispersed. Barton Cathcart had returned home and laid aside his
                  stars and sword. He had, after the wounds healed and his strength returned, joined
                  his corps again. He had fought through the murderous tangle of the Wilderness,
                  hammered at the entrenchments of Spottsylvania, flanked the dangerous works upon
                  the North Anna, plunged into the butchery of Cold Harbor, and lay through the
                  sickly autumn and the long winter in the trenches before Petersburg. He had had
                  part in the last grand battles, stormed Lee's lines, earned every step by
                  desperate endeavor, and after every advantage, found Lee still firm, defiant,
                  desperate. No one so well knew the incomparable skill and bravery of that now
                  waning army of Northern Virginia as they who for four years had fought it, and
                  now, in the hour of its supreme disaster, were grinding it to powder rather than
                  forcing its surrender; and when at length, cut off from its lines of retreat by
                  that lion of the battle-field, whose ramping cavalry lay crouched across his only
                  path, his artillery gone, his trains taken or destroyed, his ammunition expended,
                  his chief officers slain, or wounded, or captured, his men reduced to a handful,
                  overwearied by nights without sleep, and days taxed to the uttermost, Lee's army
                  yielded, General Cathcart, and every other brave man in their admiration felt that
                  the heroism of Lee's army was the only worthy measure of the perseverance and
                  bravery of the army of the Potomac. In every generous bosom rose the
                  thought—"These are not of another nation, but our citizens." Their mistakes, their
                  evil cause, belonged to the system under which they were reared, but their
                  military skill and heroic bravery belong to the nation, that will never cease to
                  mourn that such valor had not been expended in a better cause and that the iron
                  pen must write: "The utmost valor misdirected and wasted."
               But all this had passed away, and another year besides. It was in October that all
                  Norwood rejoiced in the marriage of Rose and Barton. That wedding shall not be
                  lightly dismissed. After so long and patiently following their history, it would
                  be a slight, indeed, if every one of our readers should not be invited to their
                  wedding! The town made this its own wedding. Every motherly heart in Norwood felt
                  that she had a part in marrying Rose to Barton.
               The morning Of the 15th of October rose over old Holyoke, not with the fierce fire
                  of July shot straight upon its stony top and woody sides, flushing hot, but the
                  sun came up tempered and genial. It had finished the chase of summer. It had
                  triumphed. All the fields of corn yet ungathered, whose loose rows were punctuated
                  with yellow pumpkins; all the reaped fields, all the withered stalks even, bore
                  witness to the sun's victory. October is the month that crowns the sun. Then, he
                  moves through the gorgeous apparel which nature wears, no longer a warrior fierce
                  in battle, but a victor, content with his victories, and every where shedding
                  abroad the tokens of his royal complacency. The days were soft and hazy. Even at
                  noon the lenient sun would not suffer his heat to go forth. Not even frosts
                  excited his displeasure, slyly creeping after his footsteps at night. The sun
                  reposed all day upon the gorgeous hills, spread with sumptuous apparel. Trees made
                  love to each other. The chestnut glowed benignantly at the yellow-bronzed hickory.
                  The old oaks stood yet in deep green, unchanged. Something made the yellow maples
                  laugh, and something made the scarlet maples blush. The brilliant ampelopsis had
                  climbed into the cedars and was peeping out to see what it was that nature was
                  whispering and the trees were blushing at. The dew this morning magnified itself,
                  and showed and shook the jewels with which the sun pledged its love. A few birds
                  only showed themselves. They were travelling to a Southern land. They had in mind
                  another summer far away. They tried a single note, but would not sing their
                  ringing love-songs in the broken notes of autumn voices.
               But not the hills or mountains purple with color, nor the warm-leaved trees, nor 
                     the the
                     the
                   winking dew, nor summer-seeking birds, nor the soft and silvery haze
                  that hung upon the morning like a bride's veil, nor the late-coming asters, that
                  would whisper of summer to the very
                  snow, nor the great elm that stood drooping its branches, but lifting high its top
                  in a mighty meditation of grace and beauty—not these, or whatever else glorifies
                  this bridal wreath of nature, seemed half so sweet to Rose and Barton as did the
                  looks which they gave and took, the low-toned words linked together by silence
                  more full than words.
               On the night before this morning so glorious Rose had said:
               "Come early to-morrow, Barton—come very early. I shall walk once more in my
                  favorite paths in the garden before breakfast."
               Rose slightly blushed as she added smiling:
               "When the golden gate has once shut upon us, Barton, Rose Wentworth will never be
                  seen on earth again; so you must be with me in my last minutes."
               Barton was silent. After a moment, Rose doubled up her little soft hand and slowly
                  knocking Barton's brow three times said, demurely:
               "Open sesame—let me in."
               "My own!" said Barton, "I was wishing a wish that I am not ashamed to have, but am
                  almost ashamed to tell."
               "Ah, Barton, the time has come when silence is treason. The thoughts which you
                  hide are the most precious. The shells which the sea rolls out on shore are not
                  its best. The pearls have to be dived for. Better pause while you can! After
                  to-morrow your life is mine. I will be a naiad to every rill in your soul; and if
                  your heart were deep as the ocean, I will be a sea-nymph, and gather white corals
                  from the very depths, and bring out hidden treasures from its caves! Begin, then!
                  Tell me!"
               "O Rose, mine!—the lips are the key of the mouth, and I pledge you now, for my
                  whole life that yours shall unlock my soul of every secret thought whenever you
                  shall press mine and demand it in love's name."
               It was evening twilight. They sat alone in the porch. A few late blossoms of the
                  Chinese honeysuckle shed down a trace of perfume through the air. There were no
                  locusts singing, no katy-dids, nor gurgling crickets, and yet some soft sounds I
                  certainly heard? Not birds, surely! I think it must have been the plash of one
                  honeysuckle blown against another. Yet there is no wind to move them! I hear it
                  again! Listen! It is like the falling of a drop of dew into the silver lake from
                  some birchen leaf! No, that is rude. It is as if two dreams floating in the night
                  had clashed; or like the joining of two prayers of love on their way upward;
                  or—nay, it was a kiss!—pure, sacred, holy! It is the soul's symbol, when words
                  fail it. It is the heart's sigh, or interjection when it has a feeling for which
                  there is no expression!
               A soft cloud had hid the moon. It began to move away. The light shone out
                  again.
               "Barton, I do believe you mean not to tell me after all. What is that shame-faced
                  secret!"
               "You will smile, I know. But I feel it. I want every one that has been with me in
                  danger and trouble to be present in my great joy to-morrow. Colonel Stanton, who
                  befriended me when I was a prisoner after Bull Run, has come. By the way, the war
                  has well nigh ruined his property, and I have been of help to him in saving a
                  part. The Hetheringtons are all in your house. Rose, my horse, that carries a
                  man's heart in him, that never flinched under fire, that was wounded as well as I,
                  that carried me along the hardest journeys unflagging, and saved me several times
                  from captivity,—I want him near me when I am married. I know that it would to many
                  sound foolish. But no one but a soldier can know a soldier's feeling for a
                  faithful horse!"
               "No one but a soldier and a soldier's wife," replied Rose. "You ought to be
                  ashamed of being ashamed of such a feeling. He shall stand in golden shoes, and
                  eat the plumpest oats out of a china vase, if it will please you, Barton!"
               "It is only a feeling, but it is as strong as superstition. Of course it is not
                  for his sake, but my own. I shall feel better if he stand in front of the yard
                  where I can see him."
               It was time to separate.
               "Come early, Barton. I shall take my favorite walk in the morning for the last
                  time, and I would not be alone."
               The day broke over the hills, bent evidently on being present at the wedding. It
                  came in golden stresses and in silver vapors, and infinite jewelry of dew, and it
                  lit up all the world with joy as it came; but Rose and Barton forgot, as they
                  stood in the arbor, that there was any body happy but themselves. Could it be
                  possible that there was any joy left?
               Dr. Wentworth was as calm, outwardly, as if only the usual business was going on. His face shone. His voice
                  was lower and richer than usual. His eye carried in it a perpetual
                  benediction.
               The great invasion was vocal in every room. Guests were present from the east and
                  west and south. The town swarmed with friends come to the wedding. 'Biah Cathcart
                  renewed his youth and Rachel's face shone with unexpressed thanksgiving. Hiram
                  Beers was glorious. Why not? As he had gone to Dr. Wentworth's to live in a neat
                  cottage built expressly for him and to have full charge of the doctor's stables,
                  barn, and place, why should he not consider this occasion as a family matter?
               Pete Sawmill was triumphant. Great was the honor and glory that came back with him
                  to Norwood! The story of his simple affection and fidelity was known to all and
                  all agreed with Deacon Trowbridge, "that Pete ain't much in the intellects, but
                  he's got a heart as big as an ox." And nobody was surprised to learn that Pete was
                  to live with Barton Cathcart for life; nor that he appeared on this morning with a
                  bran new suit of broadcloth and that he had a red cord sewed the whole length of
                  the side seams of his pantaloons, and that he wore military buttons on his coat
                  and vest. Pete hankered after these vanities, and it was not believed that, if he
                  was pleased, any body else would be hurt.
               Rose had labored long and often with Pete about his besetting sin, with slight
                  amendment of it. His army life had not developed his temperance principles. He was
                  always penitent on such occasions; always promised to do so no more; and he never
                  did—until the next temptation. But one day Pete fairly got it into his head or
                  heart rather that his conduct was a grief to Rose—a real sorrow. Instead of
                  expostulating and reasoning with him, as heretofore, Rose on the last occasion had
                  burst into tears.
               "Oh, Pete! you behave as if you cared for none of your friends. I am ashamed and
                  grieved to the heart. You have been so long with us and served the country so
                  nobly, and saved Barton's life, and kept a great grief from us all and now you
                  have come back to disgrace us. I can't bear it, Pete; I can't bear it;" and Rose's
                  tears fell fast.
               Poor Pete was never before conscious of being an object of such special regard
                  that any human being would cry for him. He was very awkwardly distressed for
                  himself. He shuffled his feet and fumbled with his hands, and felt deeply in his
                  pockets for something thing that was not there—a good resolution, probably—and
                  blubbered and sputtered in the most distressing manner, till the whole contrast
                  was too inexpressibly ludicrous for Rose, who covered her face, with her
                  handkerchief, and bit her lips to keep from audible laughter. But to Pete this
                  covering, of Rose's face was the last affliction. He thought that he had done some
                  great damage to her, and he exploded in an extraordinary mixture of crying,
                  confession and howling, with promises, which astounded Rose. The poor fellow shook
                  all over, and wrangled his hands and arms about in the air in the most aimless and
                  awkward manner possible, and finally bolted for the door and disappeared. He
                  brought up at Parson Buell's, and stumbled headlong into his study, just as the
                  doctor was writing out his fifthly, in the coming sermon.
               "I dew wish you'd giv' me somethin'. Dew! if you please! I want to take
                  somethin'."
               The doctor thought that he must have taken something too much already. But, after
                  some questioning, Pete broke out in a medley of grief again—quite like that in
                  Rose's presence, but not so excessive.
               "I ain't goin' to have no more rum; it's making her cry; and I ain't
                  goin' to drink any more rum; and I want you to give me somethin'."
               It was evident that Pete was inquiring after the temperance pledge, and the doctor
                  at length became satisfied of the fact. Accordingly, he drew up a pledge, on the
                  largest sheet of paper that he had in his study; and thinking that it might be
                  more striking to Pete's simple eyes, he ruled a band of red ink about the whole,
                  upon which Pete looked much as the Israelites did upon the Red sea, when they
                  first reached it. But it answered the purpose. Pete made his mark, and was
                  faithful to his new promise. A few tears did more for him than much
                  exhortation.
               Throughout the great wedding-day, Pete carried himself most becomingly, dividing
                  his attention during the ceremony between Barton and Barton's war-horse. He was
                  much disappointed when Barton, after the ceremony, did not mount and repeat some
                  of the brilliant feats of horsemanship which he had seen him perform. But
                  supposing that, for some good reason, Barton had changed his mind be led the
                  scarred horse back to his oats.
               At noon, when all the company were assembled, and every body was merry, chatting and chattering, all at
                  once the church-bell broke out into the most musical of invitations. To be sure,
                  its duty was to ring at twelve, every day. But any one could tell that there was
                  more than that in it to-day. Its paternal soul had a wedding thought in it. It was
                  no measured doctrinal ring, fit for Sunday. It was no fearful funeral ring, thick
                  and heavy. It was a real out-springing, merry ring, as of a bell that would like
                  to kick up its heels and dance on the green with the best of them.
               Before the bell had done ringing, a movement was seen about Dr. Wentworth's
                  mansion. From the front door issued first Dr. Buell and a brother clergyman, then
                  came Dr. and Mrs. Wentworth, and then came Rose and Barton; (while the boys that
                  were peeping into the gate nodded to each other and said, "By George, jest look at
                  that! ain't they bunkum?") and then came Agate Bissell, and all the other members
                  of the family; and after them flocks and crowds of friends. They moved down to the
                  great elm tree, which hung down its paternal arms about them and filled all its
                  top with blessings! There, at length, stood Rose and her husband under the very
                  flickering shadows and checkered golden light that had amused her when a babe.
                  While Parson Buell prayed, all the birds in the tree-top made responses and said
                  amen! Then there was a moment's pause. There stood the noble pair. By Barton's
                  side, stood Will Belden, on one leg and a crutch. On Rose's side stood Rose
                  Hetherington, "too pretty for any thing," said several young gentlemen near by.
                  Then, in the simple forms of the good old times, the ceremony proceeded, and
                  Parson Buell, at its close, laid his hands upon their heads bowed to his touch and
                  blessed them! And they were blessed!
               No salutation of mere ceremony followed. Barton turned to Rose with an embrace
                  that seemed like to have merged her into himself. Rose put her arms with full love
                  about her husband. For a second they stood folded some words they whispered, and
                  there were few dry eyes that looked on them. Even Judge Bacon wiped his eyes, and
                  declared that "it was remarkably good, positively affecting, and so unexpected,
                  too."
               There was but one event that befell the party which filled them with astonishment,
                  and that was the sudden and unexpected decease of Agate Bissell. None out of Dr.
                  Wentworth's family even knew that she was ailing, that under a fair appearance a
                  hidden fire was in her heart, that would surely take away her name from among
                  those who had so long known it and loved it.
               She had manifested, while Rose's wedding service proceeded, a tremulousness, as of
                  one consciously weak, but who had determined not to give way till Rose was
                  married. But Agate could hold out no longer. Scarcely had Rose received the
                  salutations of her own kindred before her father called her aside and her husband
                  also and quite a stir and excitement arose among the crowd as Dr. Buell, with some
                  dignity and firmness, as if repressing a nervous tremble, approached Agate
                  Bissell, and taking her by the hand walked to the very place where Rose and Barton
                  had been standing, and stood before the excited crowd, who wondered that even at a
                  wedding Parson Buell should venture on such a bold jest! Then came forth Parson
                  Edwards Dwight Bigelow, with whom Buell had many a night held glorious wassail of
                  theology, discussing till after midnight, whether sin was born in the nature of a
                  child or began only when developed by action; what was the nature of generous and
                  right actions anterior to a saving change; whether conversion stood in the act of
                  choice on the sinner's part, or was an irresistible and efficacious influence
                  exerted upon him ab extra. Over these and
                  kindred savory delights they had dissipated many a night.
               There stood Parson Buell and Agate Bissell, and made answer to the solemn
                  interrogatories, and she gave away her name, and with a blush as tender and
                  beautiful as if she were just seventeen, she accepted her bridal kiss from Dr.
                  Buell.
               Deacon Marble was all a-tremble. The tears ran down his cheeks. "I wonder what
                  Polly would have given to have seen this day. I guess she thinks that she died too
                  soon. Howsomever, she couldn't help it. Well, well, well—Agate, you've took us in
                  this time. This is the best one yit! I dew say, when I saw Parson Buell a-kissin'
                  you, I sort of shivered all over. But you stood it beautiful. But no merit, you
                  know, no merit, cos I s'pose you're used to it, eh?"
               Agate, who really looked queenly, replied:
               "Why, Deacon Marble, my husband never kissed me before in his life."
               "You don't, now! I can't hardly believe that. Dr. Buell is a nice and strict man.
                  But courtin', you know, and engaged, why kissin' is accordin' to natur, and grace too. I kissed Polly a hundred times
                  afore I married her and you say that Buell never kissed Agate Bissell before?"
               "Yes; I believe he kissed Agate Bissell; but he never kissed Agate
                     Buell before!"
               This quite overthrew the good deacon—he laughed immoderately, and repeated the
                  story to every one on the ground as an instance of remarkable wit.
               "Fact is, I meant to have Agate myself;—wasn't spry enough—lived too far out of
                  town. Ministers get the fust pick among the gals, any how. Polly would have liked
                  it amazin'."
               "Which?" said Hiram, giving him a nudge with his elbow.
               "Which what?"
               "Which of you two would Polly been glad for Agate to marry?"
               "Good-good," said the deacon all in a twinkle; "if't had been me was marryin'
                  Agate, and Polly had been here, wouldn't she have had enough to say? Why, she
                  would have said 'my husband;'—why, stop—if Polly'd been here she'd been my wife,
                  and I couldn't a married Agate, could I? Well, that's a good one!" said the deacon
                  quite exhilarated with his mistake—which he endeavored to explain to several but
                  somehow failed to make it as fresh as when it happened of itself.
               Col. Esel seemed to have charge of Rose Hetherington, and not to be displeased
                  with the fair Quakeress. Gallant Will Belden, who had borne Arthur out of Bull
                  Run, hobbled about as if he were one of the family. There were stories about, that
                  he meant to be a member of it one of these days. In a moment's pause, Mrs.
                  Wentworth turned to her husband.
               "Ah, Reuben, if Arthur could only have been spared to see this! I should have been
                  too happy."
               Tears ran down her cheeks. Dr. Wentworth stood silent a moment and then, with a
                  deep sigh, replied:
               "Arthur is here—sees all, knows all and is happier than all. Nature
                  in us yearns for his bodily presence, his noble sunny face, his ineffable smile,
                  the bold, tender eye; but grace teaches us to think of him," said Wentworth,
                  wiping his eyes, "without sorrow or tears my dear; that is,"—beginning to be
                  conscious of the tears running down his cheeks,—"without any except the tears of
                  affection—and fond memory—"
               The rest of his exposition he made to his pocket-handkerchief.
               Mother Taft was grown very feeble. But she was like a winter apple that grows
                  sweeter the longer it is kept. She seemed like an overjoyed child.
               "If Taft had a-lived to see this! Rose married to Barton—and then Agate Bissell
                  married a minister, too—that's almost like goin' to heaven! To think that I
                  carried Rose 'round in my arms the minute she was born—and a sweet child she was!
                  I didn't dream I should be here and see her standin' up with Barton! May be I
                  shall 'tend her babies jest as I did her. But I don't believe I shall ever live to
                  see them married off. I am getting old; but somebody will see it. I hope they will
                  be kind to them. Kindness goes a good ways, you know. You can coax a dog with
                  meat, you know, when you can't drive him with the bone."
               And so the kind old soul went on talking, without caring whether any body heard or
                  not—her own voice seeming to be a comfort to her.
               Every one was joyful; yet it was a joy strangely mixed. There were some absent who
                  might have been there, and some dead who would never return! But it was a grief
                  that fitted well with joy, and deepened it. Tears smiled, and smiles wept.
               As the evening came on and Mrs. Wentworth walked toward the mansion with Rachel
                  Cathcart she said:
               "Only Alice's presence was wanting to make the day perfectly happy."
               "Alice," said her mother, "is very heart-sore. Life goes wearily with her. But she
                  has determined to give her life to the instruction of the poor black children. She
                  has gone to Lynchburg, where his parents lived, you know, and I hope
                  she is happier now."
               But the people are dispersing. The sun is just setting. Some linger, and seem
                  reluctant to leave. If you too, reader, linger and feel reluctant to leave
                  Norwood, I shall be rejoiced and repaid for the long way over which I have led
                  you.
            
            THE END.
         
      
      
         
            
               
               THE NEW YORK LEDGER.
               The Great Family Paper.—All the Greatest Writers write for
                  it.
               The reason that the NEW YORK LEDGER has the largest circulation is, that it is the
                  BEST PAPER. Why should it not have the largest circulation? More labor more talent
                  more money, are bestowed upon it than upon any other paper. Its moral tone is
                  always pure and elevated. The leading Clergymen of the United States, the
                  Presidents of the principal Colleges, the greatest Poets, Wits, and Statesmen of
                  the country, are among the contributors to its columns. The reader always gets
                  more than his money's worth in the Ledger. We have always had the
                  BEST WRITERS, and always shall have them, cost what it may. Whatever we have
                  promised in our advertisements heretofore, our readers will bear us witness that
                  we have always performed; and not only that, but a great deal more. For instance,
                  in our last prospectus we announced a story by HENRY WARD BEECHER which we gave;
                  but we did not announce HORACE GREELEY's AUTOBIOGRAPHY, which we are now
                  publishing; nor did we announce the series of Articles, entitled, ADVICE TO YOUNG
                  MEN, by the Twelve College Presidents. The rule on which the LEDGER is conducted
                  is to get the best of everything, whether it has been promised or not. The public
                  recognize this fact, and it is from their desire to obtain the very best paper
                  that they give the LEDGER the preference; hence its unparalleled and approached
                  circulation, which is over three hundred thousand copies.
               Now, for the New Year: All our present corps of popular authors will continue to
                  write for the LEDGER; we shall begin the new year with a new story by MRS.
                  SOUTHWORTH; the HON. HORACE GREELEY will continue his Autobiography; FANNY FERN
                  her sparkling Sketches; JOHN G. SAXE his humorous Poems; SYLVANUS COBB, JR., his
                  entertaining Stories; HENRY WARD BEECHER his original Papers; JAMES PARTON his
                  instructive Biographical Sketches; Miss DUPUY her Dramatic Narratives; MARY KYLE
                  DALLAS, AMY RANDOLPH, CAROLINE CONRAD, MRS. VAUGHAN, their delightful short
                  Stories; WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT, GEO. D. PRENTICE, FRED. S. COZZENS, ALICE CARY,
                  DR. CHAS. D. GARDETTE, N. G. SHEPHERD, EMMA ALICE BROWNE, MRS. SCHULTZ, WM. ROSS
                  WALLACE, their Poems.
               A new feature of the LEDGER, in the beginning of the year, will be a series of
                  Twelve Papers intended especially for YOUNG LADIES, by Twelve of the most
                  distinguished Women in the United States.

               INTERESTING ITEMS ABOUT THE NEW YORK LEDGER.
               [From the Spirit of the Times.] THE NEW LEDGER BUILDING.—Just a
                  block from our office a spacious and imposing fire-proof building has been erected
                  by Mr. Bonner, for the future business place of his great paper, the New York
                     Ledger, at a cost of over two hundred thousand dollars. It is
                  upon the corner of Spruce and William Streets, and is not only a fine ornament to
                  the neighborhood, but a model of what a business structure ought to be. It is
                  composed of iron and white marble, and the proportions are so massive and solid,
                  as well as chaste and graceful, that it is calculated to endure for ages. Deep
                  down into the ground, high up towards the sky, and all over substantial, this
                  structure is very characteristic of the able man who designed and compassed its
                  erection. It will shortly be completed, and we recommend those of our readers who
                  can conveniently do so, to see it.
               A NEW FEATURE OF THE LEDGER.—Advice to Young Women.—A new Feature of
                  the Ledger, in the beginning of the year, will be a series of
                  Twelve Articles, written expressly for Young Ladies, by twelve of the most
                  distinguished Women of the United States, including Mrs. HORACE MANN, Mrs. LYDIA
                  MARIA CHILD, Mrs. GENERAL BANKS, Mrs. HORACE GREELEY, and Madame LE VERT.
               HENRY WARD BEECHER is to write regularly for the Ledger hereafter.
                  He says in a note to Mr. Bonner:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "I have got so used to the Ledger that I seem to fit
                              into its columns more naturally than anywhere else. I am, truly
                              yours,
                           
                              HENRY WARD BEECHER."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               WM. CULLEN BRYANT, who is universally ranked first of American poets, is one of
                  our contributors.
               [From the Du Page County (Iowa) Herald.] We will say what every one
                  knows to be a truth, that the Ledger is the best publication in the United States.
                  When we speak this, we but echo the sentiments of the world at large. All the
                  religious newspapers of the land hesitate not in praising its moral and
                  instructive tone.
               [From the Arcola (Ill.) Record.] THE NEW YORK LEDGER.—All that mind
                  could conceive, or money purchase, has been brought into requisition to beautify
                  and adorn its columns. Its circulation is immense, but its popularity is
                  greater.
               [From the Virginia Herald.] We advise all persons who wish to
                  obtain a splendid literary paper, to subscribe for the Ledger, as there is no
                  paper in the United States that can boast of as good authors as it can.
               We are certain that our readers will be glad to learn that Mr. PARTON will
                  continue to contribute to the Ledger, during the coming year, his
                  admirable Biographical Sketches. They are both entertaining and instructive.
               Mrs. SOUTHWORTH's NEW STORY, written expressly for the New Year, is now being
                  published in 
                     the the
                     the
                  
                  Ledger. It is entitled The Malediction, and
                  surpasses in interest any story she has previously written.
               FANNY FERN, who has been with us from the start, will continue to write for the
                  Ledger during the coming year. She writes for no other paper.
               JOHN G. SAXE, the most popular humorous poet in the country, writes only for the
                     Ledger.

               PRAYERS FROM PLYMOUTH PULPIT.
               BY Rev. HENRY WARD BEECHER.
               One volume, 12mo. cloth, $1.75.
               Mr. BEECHER'S Prayers have always been recognized as the most earnest, effective
                  and forcible part of his public exercises. In this volume there are permanently
                  preserved a large number of these prayers, selected from those offered in the
                  course of his regular ministrations during the last ten or twelve years, and they
                  are given precisely as they were made, each one being complete in itself, and all
                  forming a collection which has no equal, and hardly a parallel in our
                  literature.

                  No one can fail to be struck with their devotional inspiration and the

                        thought.—Boston Transcript.
                  
                  They bear the marks of their author's vigor of thought and richness and

                  KATHRINA. Her Life and Mine: in a Poem. By J. G. HOLLAND, Author of
                  "Bitter Sweet." One vol. 12mo, about 300 pages. Price $1.50.
               KATHRINA may be pronounced the most successful Poem ever published In America.
                  During the first three months succeeding its publication the actual sales averaged
                  nearly Five Hundred Copies for Every Working Day, making a total for
                  that time of FORTY THOUSAND COPIES.
               [From the New York Independent.] "We have criticised the faults of
                  the book unsparingly, because therein we pay it the high compliment of declaring
                  that it can bear criticism. It is a genuine outgrowth of the author's poetic
                  instincts and moral convictions. It is sweet with purity and noble with
                  aspiration. It is thoughtful, and earnest, and most sincere. Its reverence for
                  woman is religious. Less delightful and rare than 'Bitter Sweet,' it is perhaps
                  more even and assured. Dr. Holland will be numbered with Hawthorne and Judd, as
                  one who saw the soul of beauty under the sordid guise of New England life and
                  character."

                  SHORT STUDIES ON GREAT SUBJECTS. BY JAS. ANTHONY FROUDE, M.A. Third edition.
                     1 vol., crown 8vo, uniform with the History of England. Cloth $3 00. 
                        The essays collected in this volume comprise all Mr. Froude's
                           contributions to current periodical literature during the last few years.
                           They are marked by that great originality and independence of thought,
                           joined with stirring eloquence of expression, which have secured him such
                           wide and enduring reputation as an historian.
                     
                  
                  LANGUAGE, AND THE STUDY OF LANGUAGE. By WILLIAM DWIGHT WHITNEY. Third
                     edition. 1 vol., crown 8vo, cloth 2 50 
                        Prof. Whitney's aim in these lectures is to place in a clearly
                           comprehensible form, before the English reader and student, all the
                           principal facts regarding language—its nature and origin, its growth, its
                           classifications, its ethnological bearing, its value to man. Technical
                           and metaphysical phraseology is avoided as much as possible, and the
                           progress of the argument is always from that which is well known, or
                           obvious, to that which is more obscure or difficult. It is believed that
                           the work will be widely adopted as a text-book for instruction.

                        In this work Dr. Lord describes, in his peculiarly graphic and nervous
                           style, "the greatness and misery of the old Roman world." The volume will
                           be found entertaining, instructive and profitable in the highest degree,
                           while it will be specially useful as a text-book for higher schools and
                           colleges.

                           leaders of fashion, from the early days of the Republic to the present
                           time, and full space is also assigned to the ladies of our own day who
                           have been and are most conspicuous in our first social circles.
