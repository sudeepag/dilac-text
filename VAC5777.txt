            PREFACE.
            THERE is little to be said of the purpose and object of this book. It is not
               addressed to any distinct, individual end, that I know of. It does not aim to
               demolish any particular institution, to correct any special social evil, to aid any
               great reform, or to discuss any of the leading questions of the times. These are
               legitimate and proper objects for a story, but neither of them has been the aim of
               this one. My simple purpose has been to narrate one of those episodes of individual
               life which not unfrequently occur under the complex social relations of the present
               time, and in which, an unusual combination of circumstances very simple and natural
               in themselves, exhibits the play of human thought and feeling in a striking manner.
               My hope is chiefly that this narrative will give the reader wholesome recreation, but
               also that in a subordinate way it may do him good by introducing him to personages from whose imaginary
               conduct he may derive some example or warning.
            But I am well aware that if these purposes are not to some extent accomplished as one
               reads the book, no expression of my desire in a preface can retrieve the failure.

               THE SEPARATION.—A PROLOGUE.
               THE shades of a December twilight gather over an utterly desolate landscape. This
                  landscape is a landscape of Canada.
               Far as the eye can see, Earth lies sullen, laden with the snows of a Canadian
                  winter. They are the snows of 1828.
               The dense clouds of an impending storm thicken in the atmosphere. The North Wind,
                  risen among distant mountains, sweeps down, and drives across a small lake which
                  lies in the bosom of a valley. On the South this lake stretches away and loses
                  itself in obscurity. On the North it is bounded by a dark and desolate forest. The
                  road which winds through this forest, skirting the shore of the lake on the North
                  East, is now packed thick with snow drifts. The few travelers through these wilds
                  have therefore taken course upon the solid surface of the lake itself. The runners
                  of their vehicles have cut a track on the face of the snow-incrusted ice. This
                  track, lightly marked, but not as yet quite obscured by the fresh falling snow,
                  departs at a sharp angle from the easterly coast of the lake, and proceeds
                  diagonally across, leaving that coast
                  further and further distant, until at length it strikes the coast upon the North,
                  and rejoins the shore road.
               The shades of twilight gather thicker over this landscape, and the snow falls
                  steadily and rapidly.
               At this time two travelers—a man in the flush of early manhood, a woman young and
                  beautiful—emerge from the woods upon the eastern shore, and are about to drive
                  upon the ice. Their horse steps carefully down upon it; urged by the lash he
                  breaks into a heavy trot; and following the faint track, he takes course
                  diagonally across the lake.
               But before the trees on the right have faded out of sight in the darkening
                  distance, the horse trips—stumbles—falls;—he screams with agony and fear;—he
                  plunges and struggles to rise, but in vain.
               The driver leaps from the sleigh to give the poor creature aid, but in vain. The
                  horse's fore leg has been caught in a concealed crevice of the ice; he has fallen
                  forward upon it and broken it; broken it so cruelly that the jagged end of the
                  bone protrudes through the skin, and the blood drips down upon the snow. After a
                  few struggles to rise, the animal lies submissive, quivering with pain, whining
                  and moaning.
               In a few words the husband—for these travelers are husband and wife—explains to
                  his companion that he must go back on foot to seek help. He wraps the buffalo
                  robes more closely around her. It will be but an hour, he says, before his return.
                  One warm embrace, one affectionate kiss, and the resolute man trudges toward the
                  shore.
               Who would dream, seeing the parting of these two, what future was before this
                  husband, or that her name should one day come to be the terror of his life?
               The twilight grows still darker over this landscape. The snow still falls.
               A few moments only have passed when the attention of the wife is arrested by a cry
                  rising in the woods upon her right;—a long drawn, piercing cry;—a cry for help it
                  seems, uttered bewailingly by some one lost and perishing.
               Surprised—she listens for its renewal.
               A moment—and it rises again upon the air.
               Alarmed—she turns toward the sound; and raising her voice to the utmost she shouts
                  in response.
               A moment—and the cry is heard again.
               Affrighted—she rises from her seat, disclosing now the form of a sleeping infant
                  cradled in her arms. She steps resolutely from the sleigh. That cry is, to her
                  ear, the voice of a husband lost in the forest, entangled in some snow drift, or
                  fallen into some pitfall, whose only hope is in her feminine strength and love.
                  She folds her infant closely in her arms. The falling snow has well nigh obscured
                  the track behind the sleigh; but on the right hand the trees of the forest on the
                  eastern shore of the lake rise in gloomy outline against the sky, a few rods
                  distant only. And with slow and unsteady, but resolute steps, she makes her way
                  toward the shore, whither the cry calls her.
               
               From moment to moment, again and again, the cry rises from the forest.
               Again and again that faithful voice responds, those faithful steps still turn
                  toward the shore; until at length this woman, so resolute, so young and beautiful,
                  gains the land, and with all her strength pushes into the dense forest, hoping to
                  be yet in time to aid, to comfort or to die with her perishing husband.
               Vain hope! Her husband is quietly pressing forward on his backward road. The cry
                  she follows is the delusive howl of the Loup-cervier.
               The darkness of a December night gathers thick over this landscape, now so utterly
                  desolate. The snow falls noiselessly, steadily, rapidly. The wild cry dies
                  away.
               An hour passes, and the absent traveler returns, driving a fresh horse and sleigh,
                  borrowed from some dweller in the forest. He drives down upon the ice; and now
                  walking at his horse's head, he searches out the scarce distinguishable track,
                  until it guides him to the spot so lately left. A dying horse!—an empty
                  sleigh!—these are all that remain.
               The terrified traveler shouts for his companion; but no voice responds. He
                  searches the fresh snow for traces of her departure; but not a solitary footstep
                  remains.
               The voices of Nature strive to reveal to this man the secret of his loss. The
                  tree-tops on the shore wave in the wind, beckoning him to the forest; but he
                  understands them not. The wind draws near him and fawns upon him. It raises its
                  inarticulate voice in his ear, and strives to whisper to him. But he hears not, he
                  heeds not. The moan of the North Wind has no meaning to him. The wolf in the
                  distant forest, penitent, raises his wild cry again, and calls the distracted man
                  to the Woods;—to the Woods!—where even now she whom he seeks lies down, weary,
                  chilled and helpless, to die. But the wild voice speaks in a foreign tongue to the
                  Alone. He does not comprehend it. All these voices of Nature are powerless to
                  reach his understanding.
               Only the Divine Voice can reveal to him this secret.
               But the Divine Voice keeps silence.
               The Alone, desolate and heart-broken, throws himself upon his knees to beseech
                  explanation of this mystery. Prayer is an unaccustomed language to his lips; yet
                  in this affliction he prays. His is not the prayer of a submissive heart; not the
                  prayer of one who is wont to seek aid and guidance and support from above; but it
                  is that inconsiderate cry which is wrung from the most thoughtless and even
                  hardened hearts, by the sheer pressure of an overwhelming danger or
                  affliction.
               "Oh Lord! restore her to me. I beseech thee, Lord! My wife! My child! Take
                     them not from me thus!"
               Again the tree-tops beckon, and the winds sigh; the wolf raises his regretful
                  voice again; but in vain.
               The Divine Voice makes no answer.
               "Oh! Good Lord! Dear, Kind Lord! If I must lose them, let me at least know
                     where they lie. Let me see their faces once more, even in death. Let me give
                     them at least a grave."
               
               Again the voices of Nature struggle for utterance in vain.
               The Divine Voice still keeps stern silence.
               "God! If thou art not wholly cruel and pitiless. If thou dost not willfully
                     torture thy creatures. At least destroy me also. A wild beast would not kill
                     them and leave me alive."
               And the Alone, with an inarticulate cry of agony, falls forward senseless,
                  prostrate, in the snow.
               Again the secret trembles in the tree-tops, flutters in the breeze, vibrates in
                  the howl of the distant wolf.
               But the Divine Voice still keeps silence.
               Yes; and for years and years It shall keep silence;—stern, unbroken silence.
            
            
               CHAPTER I.
               SUDDEN WINDS BRING BAD WEATHER.
               WHOSOEVER was in the little Down-Eastern village of Harsford's Mills on the 12th
                  day of October, 1848, will bear me witness that the 12th day of October, 1848, was
                  a very breezy day at the little Down-Eastern village of Harsford's Mills.
               Harsford's Mills is a small town for houses, but it is a great town for winds. The
                  mills of Harsford's Mills might all be windmills, and never lack a full supply of
                  motive power, fresh from the northeast, for there is a long valley between the
                  mountains, with steep sides, and this valley has a sharp, well-defined
                  termination, opening out upon the village, and forming what the country people of
                  that region call "The Gap." Down this valley, from miles and miles up country,
                  runs a fresh and sparkling stream, much too small to be a river, much too large to
                  be a brook, which rolls out through the Gap into the open country, and after half
                  a mile of windings and turnings through the meadows, trips and falls over a
                  concealed ledge, and then springs up and runs away—I do n't know where.
               Right by the ledge stand those mills which give the town of Harsford's Mills its
                  surname.
               
               The long and winding valley down which the millstream flows, is the favorite
                  playground of certain winds, some of which are potent, all of which are active,
                  none of which are easily fatigued. They pour up and down this valley for days at a
                  time. They run races together till they are entirely blown. When the cold winter
                  nights come, oh, how they do roll down through the Gap, and bring the chill and
                  tingle of the far northeast home to the very firesides of the Harsford's Millers.
                  I have known winter winds to blow in Harsford's Mills which I verily believe to
                  have been the spirits of departed icebergs.
               So habituated are the inhabitants of Harsford's Mills to this peculiarity of the
                  atmosphere of their village, that when, on the morning of October 12th, 1848, Mr.
                  Richard Gault hurried past Sackett's store, on his way to business, holding his
                  hat on his head with one hand, and keeping the lapels of his coat together as well
                  as, with two heavy books under his arm, it was possible that he should, it never
                  occurred to the worthy storekeeper to style the gentle zephyr which was filling
                  the streets with dust, and slamming the blinds on half the windows within sight, a
                     wind; but he only said, in response to Mr. Gault's nod of
                  greeting:
               "A sharp breeze, Mr. Gault."
               Of course, it was only a breeze. It never blows a wind at Harsford's Mills as long
                  as a man can hold a beaver hat on with his left hand.
               The two heavy books which Mr. Richard Gault carried under his arm, were account
                  books; heavy folios. They were lettered respectively "Ledger" and "Cash Book," and
                  each bore, in addition, the conspicuous label, "Iroquois Bank." The Iroquois bank
                  was Mr. Gault's place of business. He was the cashier of that institution. And
                  now, although it was nearly an hour earlier than his usual time of going to
                  business, he was on his way—or at least to the observant eye of Mr. Sackett he
                  seemed to be so—to the bank.
               On the sidewalk, a couple of rods beyond Mr. Sackett's store, in the direction of
                  Mr. Gault's walk, there lay an old hoop, dropped from some cask. Mr. Gault,
                  overlooking it, either from haste or from shutting his eyes, in exclusion of the
                  wind and the dust, too closely, stepped upon one side of this hoop in such manner
                  as to bring the other side up with a smart blow against his knees. And this hoop
                  did so entangle and trip up Mr. Gault that he only saved himself from falling by
                  dropping both his books in catching at a post near by. As the account books fell
                  from under his arm, the breeze passing at the moment snatched a loose sheet of
                  paper which was lying between the pages of the ledger, and whisked it away behind
                  the confused pedestrian.
               Mr. Gault, not noticing his loss, rubbed his knee, picked up his books, expressed
                  some sentiments of enlarged and liberal philanthropy respecting homeless hoops in
                  general, and the offending individual before him in particular, and passed on. Mr.
                  Sackett, who, from his store door, had witnessed this prank of the light-fingered
                  breeze, called out to Mr. Gault; but the breeze instanter caught up his words, and
                  hurrying along down the street, delivered
                  ered them at the Post office, a few doors off, for the benefit of whom they might
                  concern, and they may lie in the Dead Letter office to this day for aught I know.
                  Mr. Gault hurried on, taking no benefit from Mr. Sackett's intended warning.
               Mr. Sackett, actuated partly by curiosity, partly by the willingness to do the
                  cashier a service, when he had nothing special to do for himself, stepped out to
                  pick up the paper, with which the breeze was now waltzing down the street, about
                  opposite the store. The breeze waited until the paper was almost within Mr.
                  Sackett's grasp, then abandoning its partner, it seized upon the hat of the
                  benevolent gentleman, and tore away with it, through the gutter and down a bank
                  upon the opposite side of the street. Mr. Sackett, unable to secure both hat and
                  paper, chose to follow his hat, which, after some running, he overtook, and
                  picking it up and brushing it carefully with his handkerchief, he went back to his
                  store. The breeze, meantime, catching up the paper again, danced away with it down
                  the street, past the Post office and the village green, and finally stuck it
                  fantastically upon a rose-bush in the corner of old Squire Harsford's front yard.
                  Then catching up a handful of dust, and throwing it in Miss Charlotte Harsford's
                  eyes, as she stood on the steps of her grandfather's house, the fractious breeze
                  wheeled around, and sprang away over the house into the back yard, where Mrs.
                  Harsford found it a few minutes afterwards endeavoring to steal one of her
                  pocket-handkerchiefs from the clothes-line.
               Miss Harsford winked the dust out of her eyes as she best could, and casting her
                  glance down the street, observed Mr. Matthew Caraby coming up.
               Mr. Matthew Caraby is a young man of whom I am about to say so much that it would
                  be necessary for me to introduce him formally, were it not that his face and
                  personal bearing are the best letter of introduction you can have. In your first
                  glance at him you discern that he is tall and well formed, prompt and graceful in
                  his movements, that he is good looking, perhaps handsome. You read at once in his
                  countenance, that he is "presented to your better acquaintance as a gentleman in
                  every respect deserving of your favorable regard, and any attentions you may be
                  disposed to show him will be cheerfully reciprocated, by;—yours very
                  respectfully." With his most cheerful smile, with his promptest and most spirited
                  step, Mr. Matthew Caraby is now approaching Squire Harsford's house; and with his
                  most courteous bow he is now bowing to Miss Charlotte Harsford.
               If Miss Harsford had seen Mr. Caraby approaching before she came out upon the
                  doorstep, it would have been her clear and well defined duty to have remained
                  within doors in the parlor until he had absolutely passed; for when a maiden of
                  eighteen or thereabouts comes, knowingly and intentionally, out upon a doorstep
                  fronting on a public street, at a time when a good looking and popular young man
                  is approaching, this, by the established canons of female conduct and its
                  interpretation, is as much as to say to the Misses Spy and Pry and other middle
                  aged maiden neighbors—"I desire to marry that young man;"—a sentiment which no young lady of well
                  regulated feelings will express; at least not upon front-doorsteps and in the
                  day-time.
               Or if Miss Harsford had from the doorstep seen Mr. Caraby coming in sufficient
                  season for retreat before she was herself seen by him, it would then have been her
                  undoubted duty to have retired within the house, and there peeping in obscurity
                  from behind the window curtain to have awaited while he passed. For it was now but
                  about eight o'clock A. M., and Miss Harsford was attired in a morning dress—a mere
                  calico dress—and was not Miss Harsford at all in any strict sense of the name, but
                  only Miss Harsford in a morning dress; who is, as all the world that makes calls
                  knows, a very different person. And for Miss Harsford in a morning dress, to await
                  on a public doorstep the approach of a young unmarried man, would be to inform
                  him, and through him to inform his young companions at large, that there existed
                  not only the Miss Harsford whom he had met at parties, taken upon sleigh rides,
                  and called on in summer afternoons, but another Miss Harsford; a Miss Harsford in
                  a calico morning dress; a girl of no pretensions whatsoever to good looks or
                  gentility, and only qualified to dust a room or perform like menial labor; yet who
                  was so mysteriously Siamese twinned to the Miss Harsford of his genteel
                  acquaintance that whosoever should take to wife Miss Harsford the well dressed and
                  beautiful, would find himself also wedded to Miss Harsford of calico, and—yes it
                  might be so—curl papers. It is impossible to conceive the disastrous results which
                  would ensue, were such information mation to be given by young ladies to the young
                  gentlemen of their acquaintance.
               But Miss Harsford, either because through an ungenteel education she was lacking
                  in a high sense of feminine dignity and delicacy of conduct, or because through
                  accident she did not see Mr. Caraby in season to avoid an interview in the ways I
                  have described, and therefore thought it best to meet the unpleasant contre-temps boldly; Miss Harsford, I say, stepped
                  from the doorstep upon the path, and walked straightforward down the path to the
                  gate.
               "Good morning! Miss Harsford," said Mr. Caraby, repeating his bow.
               "Good morning! Mr. Caraby," replied Miss Harsford. "Grandpa wanted me to ask you
                  if you had received that plow for him. He says he saw your team go up last
                  night."
               "We have n't unpacked yet," said Mr. Caraby, "so I do n't know."
               "I'm afraid your rose-bushes have done flowering," he continued, contemplating one
                  of the bushes which grew by the gate. And Mr. Caraby thereupon plucked a half
                  withered rose from the bush and presented it to Miss Harsford with some
                  appropriate remark touching "The Last Rose of Summer."
               "Yes," said Miss Harsford, accepting the offering and smiling in acknowledgment of
                  the wit and graceful fitness of the quotation, "yes, I'm afraid it is the last
                  this season; but we had, oh you can't think how many last summer, and such
                  beauties."
               
               "What's this? A grafting?" inquired Mr. Caraby, picking off the truant paper from
                  the bush, as he spoke.
               "Oh, it's all the time catching some such fly-aways. I wish it was n't so near the
                  road. It makes me laugh to see the horses. I believe the farmers around here do
                  n't know what posts are made for. They all tie their horses to the fence; and it's
                  the funniest thing to see them try to eat the tops of the rose-bush. They make
                  such funny faces. Did you ever— Why! what's the matter, Mr. Caraby? That paper is
                  n't any thing very terrible I hope."
               This exclamation was called forth by a long-drawn whispered whistle of surprise,—a
                  "wh-e-u!" issuing from the lips of Mr. Caraby.
               "Eh! Oh! no,—no," responded that gentleman, emerging from an abstracted study of
                  the loose sheet of paper in his hand, in time to save his hat from an unexpected
                  attack by the breeze; "it's a memorandum—a—or something—a—of that sort,—I should
                  say,—of Gault's. Perhaps he would n't like to lose it. It seems to be something
                  about Bank business. Any way, I'll keep it and give it to him.
               "And as to the plow," continued Mr. Caraby, folding up the paper and tucking it
                  into his vest pocket, "I'll see. I do n't know whether it's come yet. But I'll
                  tell you what. I shall have the team unloaded this afternoon, and I'll stop as I
                  come down to-night and leave word."
               From Squire Harsford's front gate, and his conversation with Miss Charlotte, Mr.
                  Caraby proceeded towards his place of business, Mr. Sackett's store. Reverting to
                  the paper he had plucked from Miss Harsford's rose-bush, he drew it from his
                  pocket for a fuller examination.
               "Well," said he to himself, after a few moments' studying of the words and figures
                  upon the hastily written memorandum in his hand, "if I understand this, it's a
                  sort of a draft of a private circular to the stockholders, or some of the favored
                  ones. 'Mem. priv. circ.' stands for 'memorandum for private circular,' I rather
                  imagine. And the news to be circulated is that if Gault can have thirty-two
                  hundred dollars within ten days, he can keep along till January 17th, and then the
                  Bank must swamp any way. Gault must let me have my three hundred and sixty, and
                  send for thirty-five hundred. That'll be better."
               So soliloquizing, Mr. Caraby returned the document to his pocket, and entered the
                  store. For certain reasons of his own he was glad to find his employer alone, and
                  to perceive signs of a dull day, in the business sense of that expression.
               "Mr. Sackett," said he, "I want to go up street a few minutes."
               "Certainly," replied the proprietor of the establishment. "But be back as soon as
                  you can. Business before pleasure, you know."
               Mr. Caraby looked at his senior, who was sitting in a chair, tipped back against
                  the counter, smoking. He thought that if Business must come before Pleasure, it
                  would be a good while, judging from present appearances, before they could expect
                  Pleasure to arrive.
               
               "Matt," said Mr. Sackett, breaking the silence which permitted these reflections,
                  "are you going by the Bank?"
               "Yes," replied Caraby, "I am going in there."
               "Going there, hey! Well, ask old Gault if he lost any bills receivable this
                  morning. You'd have laughed if you 'd seen his hat go in the wind, and one of his
                  papers flew away. It went down street somewhere."
               "Yes, I—I—"
               "Well, what?"
               "I'll tell him, sir."
               "I called after him, but he did n't hear."
               "Was it a valuable paper?"
               "Well, how should I know? Like as not, but I did n't go after it."
               "Well, Mr. Sackett," continued the younger man, speaking after a short pause, and
                  in another tone, as if to change the subject, "I think I shall want to go away
                  this afternoon, if you can spare me."
               "Humph! and where now? To Enneton, as usual, I suppose?"
               The young man nodded assent.
               "You'll make your fortune in a hurry, you will," said Mr. Sackett, speaking with
                  some sharpness, yet good humoredly, "unless you injure your health by over
                  application to business in early life. You were there last week, were n't you?
                  What do you want to go again now for? Are you aware that we've got that unpacking
                  to do this afternoon?"
               "I expect to do that before dinner."
               "Pshaw! It can't be done."
               "Well, but supposing I do it?"
               "Well, supposing you do; what then? I've hired you to attend to my business, have
                  n't I?"
               "Yes."
               I have already said that the sharpness of the storekeeper's share of this
                  conversation was tempered with a certain good humor. The acidity of his words I
                  can preserve in this record. But the twinkle of his eyes, and the comical twist
                  just perceptible in the corners of his mouth, are things less easy to be
                  transferred to these pages.
               "And I pay you for it, do n't I?" continued the merchant. "Then attend to it, and
                  do n't make a merit of doing it. What do you want to go to Enneton for?"
               "I have n't hired you to attend to my business," said Matthew.
               "Pretty good," said Mr. Sackett; "you had me there, Matt."
               There was a short pause. Mr. Sackett employed it in industrious and energetic
                  smoking.
               "Mr. Sackett," said Mr. Caraby, "you say you pay me for attending to your
                  business. I do attend to your business, do n't I?"
               "Well, yes."
               "And attend to it well, do n't I?"
               "W-well, perhaps. I do n't find any fault as to that."
               "So well that if I were to ask a rise of a dollar a week, to-morrow, you'd give it
                  rather than have me quit."
               
               "No sir."
               "Perhaps. It's possible we shall see about that. So well, at any rate, that—"
               "Oh well; you know, Matt," interrupted Mr. Sackett, "that I did n't mean to find
                  any fault with you. You do very well. Very well, indeed. But it is n't a good plan
                  to be running after the girls all the time. That's all."
               "You would take two days to unpack that load," continued Matthew. "You know you
                  would. If I do it to-day, and get the goods all put away this afternoon, and go at
                  four o'clock, what's the objection? If I do two days' work in three quarters of a
                  day, you can't talk to me about not attending to your business because I'm off the
                  other quarter. I do twice as much about your business now as you do."
               "Oh, it's all right, Matt. It's all right," interposed Mr. Sackett. "I do n't find
                  any fault with you. You 're too quick by half."
               Mr. Matthew Caraby turned towards the door,—went out,—closed the door behind
                  him,—stopped upon the threshold,—cogitated a moment,—turned back,—opened the door
                  again,—looked in,—and said:—
               "I shall go about four. Probably I'll be back tonight."
               And with this he closed the door, and hastened towards the Bank.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               WHEN THE BANK BREAKS, THE BANKER MAKES.
               WHY there should be a Bank at Harsford's Mills, passed the comprehension of many
                  to whom its brick front and its one iron shutter were sights of every day
                  familiarity. The institution, however, existed; and the discussion which its
                  establishment had caused among the citizens having once subsided, the majority of
                  them forgot all about it.
               Internally, the Iroquois Bank, meaning now the building so named, presented the
                  appearance of a cold room,—a sort of financial ice-house,—floored with square
                  bricks, and divided by a counter, the two divisions being balanced by a large
                  stove on the one side, over against a small safe on the other. On one end of the
                  counter was a high desk, on the outer edge of which was a high railing, which
                  served to keep nobody from stealing nothing. In the window were a small pair of
                  specie scales. And when any one in town had a piece of suspicious coin to be
                  tested, the fact becoming noised abroad, there was always within the room a small
                  crowd of privileged persons leaning over the cashier's shoulders, and counseling
                  him in his attempts to test the doubted coins, and outside upon the sidewalk a
                  large crowd of the non-privileged ileged,
                  looking in at the window, and deeply impressed with the wisdom of the old cashier.
                  He, meanwhile, with his spectacles on the end of his nose, tried the various
                  weights which pertained to his apparatus, and finally "hefted" the
                  coin in his hands, to satisfy himself of the accuracy of his standard.
               These and similar occasions were the only ones which brought up a throng to the
                  Bank.
               Mr. Gault was this morning in a state of considerable anxiety. He was by no means
                  the impassable old man that he usually seemed. He was engaged in anxious search
                  for something. He turned rapidly over the leaves of his great account books. He
                  lifted them up. He looked under them. He scrutinized the floor. He peered under
                  the desk. Now he would dive to the bottom of every pocket, bringing out every
                  thing except the article sought for. Now he would rummage among the papers in his
                  desk, mixing them up inextricably, pulling open drawers in nervous haste, and
                  shutting them up again half examined. Now he would shuffle the papers in his
                  pocket-book, examining them one by one from beginning to end, and then beginning
                  anew, and going over the same task again. In the midst of such employments, on
                  rising from the third search which he had made in the little iron safe, and
                  turning towards the high desk again, he uttered an exclamation,
               "Well, young man!"
               The reader will no doubt suppose from this language that Mr. Gault has in some way
                  become possessed of the suspicion of a thievishly-disposed boy secreted in some
                  hiding-place within the apartment, with intent to possess himself surreptitiously
                  of those pecuniary treasures which the very existence of a Bank necessarily
                  presupposes;—that he has discovered this individual concealed in the very
                  safe;—and that it is to him that he now addresses these words of combined inquiry
                  and reproof. If Mr. Gault were an elderly lady, and particularly if he were an
                  unmarried lady, and the apartments of the Iroquois Bank were a suite of chambers
                  in some strange hotel, and nine o'clock in the morning were nine o'clock at night,
                  the notion of searching for a concealed man in a safe, or a stand-up desk, or even
                  in a pocket-book,—so corpulent a pocket-book as Mr. Gault's,—would not be untrue
                  to nature. But under the circumstances it is clearly inadmissible. As the
                  sagacious reader will already have surmised, Mr. Gault's exclamation was addressed
                  to none other than Mr. Caraby, who had entered a moment before, unnoticed by the
                  cashier, and now stood warming his back by the glowing Franklin stove.
               "How do you do, sir?" said Mr. Caraby, nodding politely in response to the
                  searching glance bent upon him by the old cashier. "A cool morning."
               Mr. Gault muttered somewhat to the effect that the coolness of the weather formed
                  no reason why Mr. Caraby should come to warm himself at the stove of the Iroquois
                  Bank, but made no other answer to the salutation. Taking a pen from behind his
                  ear, he assumed the appearance of a diligent accountant.
               "What's the matter?" asked Mr. Caraby. "Lost any thing?"
               
               Mr. Gault made no reply. It does not comport with the dignity of a Bank officer to
                  answer questions.
               "Have you lost any thing?"
               "No sir!" said Mr. Gault.
               "Oh!" said Matthew. "Because, coming up this morning, I found a paper which I
                  supposed belonged to you."
               Mr. Gault dropped the appearance of a diligent accountant, and looked up at his
                  visitor.
               "It had no address or title," continued the young man, "but as it appeared to be a
                  memorandum of the affairs of the —"
               "Won't you shut the door?" interrupted Mr. Gault. "It really is quite cool," he
                  added, explanatorily, and also, it would seem, by way of polite confirmation of
                  Mr. Caraby's remark some moments previous.
               Mr. Caraby complied.
               "—of the condition of the Bank affairs," he continued, "I judged that it was a
                  private —"
               "Won't you walk round and take a seat, Mr. Caraby?" interrupted the cashier.
               "—that it was a private document, and perhaps one of some importance," added Mr.
                  Caraby, in conclusion of his sentence, as he walked around within the counter.
               Behind the counter the cashier received him with distinction, and begged him to be
                  seated.
               Mr. Caraby complied.
               "Now you speak of it, sir," said the old gentleman, after some hesitation, "I have
                  lost a paper, and a very important one, too;—that is to say, a mere memorandum I
                  mean, nothing more."
               "Well, sir, I suppose I have found it."
               "Ah! and you've read it, eh! Well, sir, I am quite surprised that a young man of
                  your honesty, as I supposed, should peer into private papers. It is not
                  creditable. I had not expected it. I am quite surprised."
               "Your surprise is quite unnecessary," said the young man. "If I had not read it I
                  should n't have known it's owner. It might have fallen into other hands. I have
                  come to return it. You will feel easier when I assure you that no one else has
                  seen it."
               "Quite right. Quite right, sir," said the cashier, perceiving that his irritation
                  had carried him too far, and reflecting now for the first time that something
                  might depend upon the good will of the young man. "I am very glad it fell into
                  your hands and no other. And although it is a mere memorandum, and of no value,
                  yet I am very happy to receive it again from you."
               And the cashier extended an expectant hand towards Mr. Caraby.
               "One moment, sir," said Mr. Caraby, looking down at the paper in his hand in a
                  manner calculated at once to stimulate and to disappoint the expectations of the
                  cashier's right hand, "there is one thing I should like to say first. And at the
                  outset let me say that I do not ask for any further information. I do not ask you
                  to confirm my conjectures. And I have no intention of using what I have learned,
                  to your prejudice."
               "My dear sir," said Mr. Gault, "I beseech you not to say any thing about it. It is a great misfortune,
                  but we have met with some severe losses in exchange, and I am sure it will be
                  perfectly confidential if I say to you that we may be temporarily embarrassed. But
                  it will only be temporary, unless the public get frightened, and if we have a run
                  we may have trouble. That 's all."
               "Excuse me, sir," interrupted his visitor. "I am going to return your memorandum,
                  and to say not a word of my ideas on the subject to any body. But I make this
                  promise on two conditions. The first is, I should like to draw now what balance I
                  have in the Bank."
               "But," said the cashier, "that 's on interest, and at five days."
               "Very true," said Mr. Caraby, in response to the interruption; "but I expect you
                  will give it to me now. The other is, that it is understood that I shall advise
                  one of my friends to sell out his stock."
               "I do not consider," said the cashier, "that such a course on your part is
                  justifiable. Accident places the Bank in your power, and it is not honorable in
                  you to take advantage of it."
               "On the contrary," returned the other, "accident places the Bank, as you say, in
                  my power,—I do n't know in what way, or how far,—and I come to restore what you
                  call the accident, and to assure you that if you agree, the knowledge which has
                  come to me shall go no further."
               "How much is your deposit?" asked the cashier.
               "Three hundred and sixty something, and interest, I believe, sir."
               "And who do you intend to give to understand that the Bank will—is—?"
               "Nobody. I expect you will pay me my deposit; and the only thing I shall say about
                  the Bank will be to say to one person, 'I advise you to sell your stock in the
                  Iroquois Bank.'"
               The cashier rose and went to his big ledger; figured on a scrap of paper and
                  returned, saying, as he handed the memorandum of his calculation to his visitor
                  for inspection, "three hundred sixty-seven forty-nine, I make it."
               "Three sixty-seven fifty, I make it," replied the other, after a
                  short examination of the figures. "There 's one to carry that you overlooked; that
                  makes the difference."
               "Well," said the cashier, "you 're right. But I do n't count the mills. It is n't
                  my fashion."
               "It is n't my fashion," retorted the young man, "it 's the
                     right way. There 's only one right way to do business, and that is
                  the exact way. At least that 's my faith."
               "That 's so, I suppose," said the cashier. "Well, I will pay that next week."
               "I expect it to-day," returned the young man, briefly.
               "Mr. Caraby," said the cashier, "I understand you to say, that if I settle your
                  little account, you are not to mention this matter until the last of next
                  week."
               "Mr. Gault," replied the visitor, "I have assured you once, I shall say nothing
                  about it, next week or any other time, until it is otherwise made public, except
                     to advise one friend as I have said;
                  and that I shall do at the first possible opportunity."
               "Well," said the cashier, "I will settle your account now, and I rely on your
                  word. Time, Mr. Caraby, is of great importance to me—to the Bank I mean."
               With these words Mr. Gault went to the drawer in the desk, and after some
                  fumbling, and much whispered counting, he brought a little file of bills and a
                  bright half dollar to Mr. Caraby.
               "Thank you, Mr. Gault," said he, smiling, but not extending his hand to receive
                  the money; "are those Iroquois bills?"
               "Yes," said the cashier, "they 're the new issue."
               "Ah! very handsome bills, but—"
               "Perhaps you 'd prefer the old. They are better known."
               "Oh! I do n't doubt these are quite as good as the old. But I am sorry to have
                  given you the trouble. I should just as lief have gold. It 's not a large amount,
                  and it won't be heavy."
               "Oh! well, Mr. Caraby, you will take part bills, you will have something to pay
                  out in the next few days, and—"
               "Mr. Gault," returned Mr. Caraby, "I do n't say any thing about the condition of
                  the Bank, because you assure me that this embarrassment is only temporary, and
                  every thing will be right again soon. If so, you ought to have a fair chance. But
                  meantime I do n't mean to take any of your money, much less pass it."
               The cashier replaced the bills in the drawer, and after resorting to the safe,
                  counted thirty-eight gold pieces into the hand of Mr. Caraby, whereupon that
                  gentleman produced a little pass-book, and the proper entries were therein made,
                  to balance the account.
               With the amount thus paid him safely deposited in his pocket, Mr. Caraby handed
                  the lost memorandum to the cashier, bade him good morning, bowed, and left the
                  room.
               Five minutes afterwards Mr. Sackett inquired of Mr. Caraby what Mr. Gault said
                  about his paper.
               "Oh, he has got it again," replied Caraby. "Some body found it in the road, and
                  brought it back to him this morning.
               What further conversation thereupon ensued between Mr. Caraby and his
                  employer,—what progress and accomplishment the younger man attained that day in
                  the labor of unpacking the new stock,—whether Esquire Harsford's plow came to
                  light in the course of his researches or not,—whether Business arrived at
                  Sackett's store in good season, and Pleasure followed in due course of
                  time,—whether Mr. Gault's operations on behalf of the Iroquois Bank that day, were
                  profitable to the stockholders, or to himself,—whether Matthew fulfilled his
                  promise of calling at the Harsford homestead on his return,—and whether he saw
                  Miss Charlotte—these are matters of which I shall not now speak. It is quite
                  enough to say that at four o'clock or thereabouts of that afternoon, Mr. Caraby
                  drove up to the store, and reining ing in
                  his horse opposite the door, called out to Mr. Sackett.
               "Well," said Mr. Sackett, coming to the door.
               "I'm off," said the young man. "I sha'n't be back tonight. The key is in the cash
                  drawer."
               And he touched the horse gently with his whip, and was off on the road to
                  Enneton.
               The road lay right up the Gap. It was the very road down which the autumnal breeze
                  had been a brisk traveler all the morning. Matthew had anticipated a sturdy
                  contest with it; but it quite died down in the afternoon, and he had not gone half
                  a mile before he threw off his overcoat. He half regretted not to meet it. He
                  liked to face its opposition. His face always glowed and his smile brightened
                  under the stimulus of such futile hostility.
               The wind was not the only thing in whose ineffectual opposition he took pleasure.
                  He always worked better against a current. Matthew was one of those men who, like
                  clipper-schooners, sail better on a wind than dead before it. If obstacles did not
                  stop him they were sure to expedite him. As it was, he laid off his
                  overcoat—pocketed the gloves which—unsophisticated youth—he had provided for the
                  sake of comfort and not for appearances, and addressed himself to a brisker speed
                  by way of making an artificial breeze.
               The season was fast advancing. The face of the country was grown sober. Nature was
                  turning Quaker. She was going into drab garments and was dropping carelessly on
                  every hand the gay colors she had until so lately worn. The valleys alone retained
                  any brilliancy, and that only a fading fringe of foliage along the stream edges.
                  The mountains which lifted the Harsford horizon so high, had become monochromatic
                  pictures of desolate grandeur. Their gray and bald heads, long time revealing such
                  vast phrenological developments of Granite, now stripped of their hoods and vails
                  of verdure, stood up larger and more rugged than ever. And far up upon their tops
                  among the very rocks, standing sharp and stiff against the sky, bristled the
                  weather-whitened, sapless stems of ancient pines. The mountains near at hand
                  looked cold and magnificently desolate. Those far before him seemed to Matthew to
                  be soft-hued and warm under the slanting western sunlight, and in the
                  blue-and-purple-colored distance. So Matthew with the assistance of Mr. Sackett's
                  horse made speed towards them.
               I never could learn, with accuracy, how far it was from Harsford's Mills to
                  Enneton. The teamsters call it twenty-five miles; the stage-driver says it is
                  twenty-two; the aged guide-boards indicate that the ancestral selectmen of the
                  town considered it twenty-three. Mr. Caraby justified driving there in two hours
                  and a half by calling it twenty.
               But then Mr. Caraby usually drove Mr. Sackett's horse.
               I do not suppose that Mr. Sackett's horse was in the confidence of Mr. Caraby,
                  respecting the nature of the errand which required such haste; for although
                  Matthew took frequent occasion to speak to him, the appeals he made were not
                  exactly to the sympathies of that friendly animal. But I have no doubt that if Mr.
                  Sackett's horse had known sentimentally
                  what it was that he was carrying to the house of Mr. Reuben Mayes, that
                  intelligent animal would have laughed a horse-laugh to think how Matthew Caraby
                  drove,—for all the world like a sporting gentleman,—or a physician on an errand of
                  life and death,—or a city undertaker driving home from a funeral.
               Moreover if Mr. Sackett's horse had known the errand,—if he had known what he was
                  going for—what he was to bring back; if he had only known—
               But then he did not know.
               Nor, yet, do you.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               HARDLY BRED IS NOT ALWAYS ILL BRED.
               THE sagacious reader, who doubtless anticipates that Mr. Caraby is destined to
                  bear an important part in this history, may feel some desire to learn, by way of
                  preliminary, some of the previous events of his life. Twenty years is not, in the
                  early chapters of a history, a long period; and a few paragraphs will satisfy the
                  sagacious reader's curiosity.
               
                  THE EARLY LIFE OF MATTHEW CARABY.
                  Matthew Caraby was born of moderately respectable parents, in the year
                     1827.
                  His father was living until quite lately. I wish he had lived to read this
                     chapter. His mother died while Matthew was yet too young to retain any very
                     vivid personal recollections of her. Upon her death, Matthew, with two brothers
                     older than himself, but separated, as to their birthdays, by comparatively
                     short periods, together with one sister, an equal degree younger than himself,
                     composed the surviving family of his father.
                  Mr. Caraby the elder, being a man of deep affections and very remarkable warmth
                     of heart, was desirous to pay, with
                     cordiality, to his departed spouse, the compliment implied in a prompt and
                     public acknowledgment that it was not good for man to be alone, and that it was
                     particularly bad for a Caraby so to be. The affection which he bore his wife,
                     and which, during the heyday of her life and health, had burned modestly within
                     his own bosom, never displaying itself obtrusively in the public gaze, nor very
                     often thrusting itself even upon his wife's attention, now in the darkness and
                     sorrow of his bereavement, rose up as the flame of true affection always
                     does,—we have it upon the authority of the motto candies,—with a clear,
                     powerful warmth and light. And it now appeared, the wick of Mr. Caraby's
                     heart,—for he had a wicked heart, although he was a moderately respectable
                     man,—being, as it were, picked up by the sharp thrust of affliction, that his
                     first wife had become to him so much a part of himself, that it was essential
                     to his existence to replace her loss immediately. Still he was, in the
                     refreshed and rekindled warmth of parental affection, unwilling to bring his
                     four children under the authority—so generally supposed to be tyrannical—of a
                     step-mother. In this dilemma he contrived, by a generous sacrifice of his own
                     tenderest feelings, and, in some degree, of his pecuniary interests, to consult
                     the welfare of all dependent upon him, as well as the memory of his decidedly
                     better half.
                  In heaviness of heart, and with great tenderness of parental feeling, he called
                     in, separately and successively, several of his nearest neighbors, and laid his
                     case before them; that is to say, a part of his case before each one of them.
                     But, after canvassing the village, and his whole list of available friends, he
                     could complete his arrangements for the disposal of only half of his jewels;
                     for he found that the supply of jewels of that description was greater than the
                     demand, and, in accordance with the great law of trade, the market was nearly
                     closed against him.
                  Therefore, after he had, with much rending of the fondest ties of his heart,
                     and at some expense to his pocket, disposed of:—
                  Charles, aged fifteen, as apprentice to a neighboring blacksmith; and,
                  George Washington, aged twelve, name changed for the purpose to Arthur
                     Wellington, sent per packet, at a considerable expense of passage money, as a
                     gift to a maternal grandfather, a sturdy old Englishman residing near
                     London,
                  There still remained to be provided for, Matthew, aged nine, and Roselle, aged
                     six.
                  Roselle was a very expensive child, her father said, for she was sickly, and
                     required much medical attendance and nursing. He finally, however, succeeded in
                     securing an excellent place for her and her brother Matthew, by engaging board
                     for them in the family of Mrs. Bridget McCartney, a lady of Irish extraction,
                     resident in the precincts of a neighboring town. Her own large family was
                     undoubtedly a guarantee of a rich experience in the training of children. Under
                     her roof Master Matthew would be in no danger of forming those expensive habits which are so pernicious to a
                     young man who, in future life, must rely upon himself. And there was good
                     reason to trust, judging from the countenances of her intended foster brothers
                     and sisters, that little Roselle would enjoy freely the wholesome liberty of
                     playing in the dirt.
                  Having consummated these most considerate domestic arrangements, Mr. Caraby
                     gathered together such of his effects as remained to him after discharging the
                     large advances required to carry them into effect, and paying such of his debts
                     as the circumstances of the case seemed to render it necessary that he should
                     pay, and bidding adieu to his little ones, he unostentatiously withdrew himself
                     from the home of his happiness, and from the community where his tenderest
                     feelings centered, and went out West. In a young and thriving city near the
                     Lakes he devoted the energies of his lacerated mind to business, and cleared
                     forty thousand dollars in the first six months, by marrying a wealthy spinster
                     to whom the delicacy of his gentlemanly attentions, and the warmth of his share
                     of the tenderest feelings of our nature, endeared him upon short
                     acquaintance.
                  Thus at least Rumor reported concerning him, for out of the considerate
                     tenderness of his paternal feelings he scrupulously forbore to communicate to
                     his children any intelligence of himself, or of their new but unknown
                     mother.
                  The boys grew up thus separated from each other, and were therefore fortunately
                     prevented from falling into any of those bickerings and childish quarrels which
                     are sure to mar the happiness of brothers who are brought up together. The
                     sequel of their life therefore forms an encouraging illustration of the
                     favorite theory of modern educational philosophers.
                  In course of time, Charles, the blacksmith's apprentice, finding that his
                     employer spent more time in teaching him how to bear blows than how to give
                     them, desperately resolved to follow the example of his father, and
                     accordingly, one moonlight night, he unobtrusively and unostentatiously
                     withdrew himself from the home of his childhood, and disappeared from the
                     community where his tenderest feelings might have been supposed to center; if
                     indeed we may so far contravene the public opinion of that community as to
                     imagine that such a bad boy possessed any of those tender feelings which
                     characterize respectable humanity.
                  From the time of this disappearance, Master Charles was no more heard of in the
                     town except in the conversation of remonstrating parents and teachers, who
                     instinctively represented him to the remaining youth of the village as going to
                     and fro in the earth (in his small way), hungry, and seeking what he might
                     devour.
                  As for Master Matthew, under the maternal supervision of the amiable Mrs.
                     McCartney, and under the keen and noble emulation and high-spirited rivalry
                     that united him to the junior McCartneys, he flourished and was happy—of
                     course. The matron's system of government was a very simple and beautiful
                     application of two of the fundamental doctrines of political philosophy: first,
                     "Might makes Right;" second, "To the Victors belong the Spoils." These two principles formed
                     an exceedingly convenient system, not only because they were easy to enforce
                     when their operation required the assistance of parental monitions, but also
                     because they were maxims which were readily appreciated by those of the family
                     who were old enough to see the necessity and the admirable utility of such
                     system, and who were stout enough to aid the mother in carrying them into
                     effect.
                  As respected his father, Matthew observed outwardly a circumspect silence;
                     inwardly he entertained for him a profound and filial contempt. Towards his
                     mother, of whom his recollection was very vague, and of whose former existence
                     he was assured more by the philosophical reflection that he must once have had
                     a mother, than otherwise,—towards her he was simply indifferent; except that he
                     felt occasionally, in times of solitude and weariness of life, a half grudge
                     against her for having brought him into the world; such a world as it was to
                     him.
                  The world of a child embraces merely its home, its associates, and the simple
                     scenes which its observation can grasp. Beyond this, it knows no more of the
                     world than perhaps to say, by the dictation of the school geographies, that it
                     is "an oblate spheroid, flattened at the poles." Of the great world of life,
                     with its whirl of excitements, temptations, joys and sorrows, with its vast
                     variety of happy homes and miserable homelessnesses, with its immense ebb and
                     flow of common human hope and feeling, and its powerless little eddies of
                     individual sentiment and opinion, with its millions of foot-holds for human
                     effort and usefulness, the child knows nothing. His personal experience of the
                     developments of human nature immediately around him is the world, to him.
                  Thus Matthew's world was at first composed of a hard bed in a dark garret,
                     coarse and stinted food, the irascible supervision of Mrs. McCartney, and the
                     domineering companionship of the eight juvenile McCartneys. His only happiness
                     was the care he felt for his sister, and her sympathy for him.
                  The children did not long remain in this poor shelter. Their stay, however, was
                     too long. While kindness might cure it, misery often escapes notice. It is not
                     until too late, when affliction has become hopeless, that it gains sufficient
                     importance to be cared for. Little Roselle, with her brother, was removed from
                     the rude home of Mrs. McCartney when the advanced progress of scarlet fever
                     seemed about to conquer her life. Under the nursing of the charitable widow who
                     had taken the children to her own home, Roselle gradually became convalescent;
                     but returning strength did not bring joy to her heart, for her beautiful eyes
                     were filled with darkness, and the visible world was thenceforward but a
                     reminiscence in her mind. Thereafter the children were inseparable, and their
                     orphanage seemed now complete, for if Matthew was a half orphan, certainly
                     Roselle was the other half.
                  Educated by these experiences Matthew had become at twelve years old, a
                     diminutive young man; long-headed, sober and calculating. This new affliction
                        was almost too much for his
                     philosophy. It made his already comfortless world darker than ever to his
                     thoughts; though one who saw him leading his sister to and fro in the village
                     or guarding her through such gentle sports as she could venture to join, might
                     well have thought that notwithstanding all the untoward circumstances of his
                     life, there was hope for the full growth and development of his heart, so long
                     as Roselle depended upon him.
                  Roselle's blindness opened a new problem to Matthew's mind. Before, he had
                     wondered how they should live. Vague plans of earning his own livelihood and
                     maintaining his sister, had floated in his mind. Now came the wonder if her
                     sight could be restored. And when the village physician shook his head at the
                     question, and said, sadly smiling down upon his little interrogator—"No, my
                     boy, I am afraid it is a hopeless case"—little Matthew looked up to him,
                     venerable and gray in wisdom as he seemed, with half-formed doubts whether
                     there might not be in some great city, doctors wiser, more learned, more
                     skillful, who knew better and could do more than Dr. Cram. All such thoughts,
                     however, Matthew preserved as his private property. Under the pressure of his
                     many solicitudes, he accumulated much property of this kind, beginning in
                     wonderings which gradually became positive ideas, which in turn evolved vague
                     hopes and crude and fragmentary plans, out of which from time to time he framed
                     some impracticable resolution.
                  Matthew was naturally cordial, open-hearted, generous, trustful, sympathetic;
                     but the untoward circumstances of his early life checked somewhat the
                     development of these qualities, while they could not wholly conquer them.
                     Everybody would have liked him if it had not been that he did not like
                     everybody. The more his world enlarged the less faith he had in it; and he came
                     at length, long before he was enough of a thinker to entertain an intellectual
                     comprehension of the distinction, to calculate almost wholly on people's
                     interested motives, and not at all upon their generous impulses. He began
                     instinctively to attach himself to the interests of those around him, and to
                     shrink from appealing in any way to their generosity or sympathy.
                  He knew he was not very old, and was conscious that he did not know a great
                     deal; but at thirteen he believed himself big enough to work, and resolved to
                     get a place in a store and earn his living. It was partly bashfulness perhaps,
                     but it was also in great part his little headful of knowledge of human nature
                     that counseled the course he took. For several weeks, he spent all the time he
                     could spare from Roselle in visiting the village stores. At first he aspired
                     only to keep out of the way, and to listen and look on, to all that was said
                     and done. He grew familiar with the various establishments of trade, and their
                     different branches of business, and choosing from among them one or two which
                     best suited him, he began in little and unostentatious ways to make himself
                     useful to the proprietors and those who dealt with them.
                  It was not a long time before his disposition to be useful was approvingly
                     noticed by the frequenters of these places, nor a much longer time before he
                     received an offer from the landlord of
                     the Cromwell House, the hotel in the village, of an engagement as errand boy to
                     that establishment for public entertainment. That offer he accepted, and from
                     that position, and a salary of five dollars per month and found, his rise was
                     gradual but steady.
                  To trace in detail Matthew's progress during these years of his life, does not
                     fall within the intended scope of this narrative. But by way of instance or
                     sample of the sort of character which he possessed and which qualified him for
                     the rise in life which he accomplished, it may be well to mention an incident
                     of the 11th day of January, 1841.
                  The 11th day of January, 1841, followed very closely that upon which Matthew
                     entered upon his duties at the Cromwell House; and it was upon that day that
                     Matthew was introduced to a long row of boots and shoes collected from the
                     various chamber-doors of the hotel, and directed to "black 'em."
                  "To what, sir?"
                  "Black 'em."
                  What operation it was to black boots and shoes Matthew knew not, and could not
                     guess. There was a brush upon a bench near by, and a round tin box;—but what
                     were they for? His own well-worn cow-skins were innocent of any such
                     refinements. In the winter weather of the years he passed in the bosom of Mrs.
                     McCartney's family, he had been sometimes permitted to grease his
                     boots, as a special preservative of their fabrics; but he was shrewd enough to
                     feel very sure that that was not a process cess through which the guests of the
                     Cromwell House would desire that the garments of their feet should pass. He was
                     however too shrewd to disclose his ignorance to his employer, so with the
                     utmost alacrity he undertook the task. His first step was to go in search of
                     John, the colored man employed as cook to the establishment. John he found
                     occupied in some trifling labors in the kitchen.
                  "John," said he, "I'll bet you a fo' pence you can't black a boot as quick as I
                     can."
                  "Done," said John, with great promptness, dropping his work, and rolling up his
                     sleeves in preparation for a trial of skill. "Whar 's yer boot?"
                  "Out on the back porch," said Matthew. "Come along as soon as you 're a mind
                     to."
                  "I'm on hand," said John, and he followed Matthew to the back porch.
                  "You begin," said Matthew.
                  And he selected, as the subjects of the experiment, the muddiest pair of boots
                     in the row.
                  John mixed a modicum of blacking upon the bench, with all the air of conscious
                     skill that was ever exhibited by a master artist blending upon his pallet the
                     colors with which he was about to depict some divine conception.
                  A new light dawned upon Matthew's mind.
                  John seized a boot with one hand, and a brush with the other, and in less than
                     three minutes of vigorous brushing the boot was a black looking-glass.
                  "I give up beat, John," said Matthew, drawing a fo' pence from his pocket. "Here 's your fo'
                     pence. I can't quite come up to that."
                  The victorious John smiled a smile of conquest, pocketed the fourpence, and
                     becoming conscious that he would not receive the commendations of his employer,
                     if he were caught neglecting his proper duties, to win fourpences of Matthew at
                     the game of boot blacks, hurried back to his work in the kitchen.
                  Matthew, waiting till his exemplar was quite out of sight, commenced upon the
                     other boot a laborious imitation of John's manipulations. After a tedious half
                     hour of scrubbing, the subject of his efforts exhibited a dull, leaden polish
                     with which he was forced to be content. He carried the boots up to the room of
                     their proprietor, and putting John's boot foremost, was fortunate enough to
                     receive back his fourpence.
                  The fourpence thus repaid was invested in the purchase of a tin Savings Bank,
                     in which the gratuities thereafter received in the conduct of the boot and shoe
                     department, were regularly deposited. At the end of six months there was a run
                     upon the bank by the depositor, the entire deposits were withdrawn, and their
                     aggregate amount proved to be somewhat over twenty dollars.
                  This sum put out at interest and increased by subsequent additions, formed the
                     nucleus of that which Mr. Caraby subsequently deposited in the Iroquois Bank,
                     and which was now about to be the subject of another run.
                  For some years Matthew remained in the employ of the landlord of the Cromwell
                     House; meanwhile steadily enlarging his acquaintance with both men and things,
                     and winning good opinions for his capacity and fidelity from all who had to do
                     with him. Time rolling on, at length opened the way for him to leave the
                     Cromwell House and connect himself with the academy of the village, the
                     preceptor of which interested himself in Matthew as a lad who deserved
                     encouragement, and procured him a place where he could earn his board by
                     services rendered out of school hours, while he himself gave him clothing and
                     tuition for his aid and assistance about the school; not as a teacher, for
                     Matthew had as yet hardly got upon the threshold of learning, and neither his
                     taste nor his attainments ever qualified him well for usefulness in that
                     character; but in those numerous services which the conduct of a large school
                     requires. In this position Matthew remained for a year or two longer, making
                     rapid improvement in learning, and acquiring also growth and development of
                     character. The death of the preceptor, however, brought his privilege of free
                     school attendance to a close, and he now began to look about for a place
                     wherein he could render a more valuable service, and command a better pecuniary
                     reward; to the end that he might not only be able to take care of himself, but
                     also to render a more substantial aid to his young and almost helpless sister.
                     He was well known not only in the village where he had thus grown up, but also,
                     to a considerable extent, in the neighboring towns. He had made himself a
                     general favorite among the business men of the region round about, and whoever had had need at that time of
                     the services of a young man in any capacity for which Matthew was qualified,
                     would have thought it a good thing to have secured the services of Matthew
                     Caraby.
                  Just at the time when Matthew was thus looking out for a place, Mr. Japhet
                     Sackett, a leading merchant of Harsford's Mills, was looking around for a
                     clerk. Accordingly, a bargain was struck, and Matthew transferred himself and
                     his services from the academy to the establishment where we find him at the
                     commencement of this history; the store of—"JAPHET SACKETT. DRY GOODS &
                     GROCERIES. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE TAKEN IN EXCHANGE."
               
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               EASY KINDLED, HARDLY QUENCHED.
               A RIDE of two hours and a half brought Matthew Caraby to the precincts of
                  Enneton.
               Enneton was a village not much larger than Harsford's Mills. It had indeed two
                  churches, while Harsford's Mills had but one, but then it had no Bank. Then again
                  it could boast of no Mills; but on the other hand it possessed what Harsford's
                  Mills never will,—a jail and a court-house. For Enneton was the county town. And
                  this fact gave it a geographical importance which Harsford's Mills did not
                  possess. I think indeed you will not find Harsford's Mills down on any ordinary
                  map. It may be put down now-a-days, but the school atlases, such as we used to
                  study at the Bulwinkle Academy when I was a boy, wholly ignored it,—Gap, Churches,
                  Mills, Bank, Sackett's Store and all. Whereas I lost my place in the geography
                  class in the Bulwinkle Academy, one day, for inability to state the location,
                  principal business, and population of Enneton conformably to the account thereof
                  given by the Geography.
               The reader, however, is chiefly interested in Enneton considered as the residence
                  of Miss Arabella Mayes.
               Miss Arabella Mayes was the only daughter of Reuben Mayes, commonly called "Squire Mayes." The Mayes
                  homestead was a fine old farm-house, surrounded by far finer and older trees,
                  standing back at quite a remove from the road, a half mile or so from the heart of
                  the village. The broad greensward before the house, studded with large trees, was
                  a delightful play-ground in the summer, and it was really a luxury to drive up
                  through the great elms to the door of the house.
               To the door? There were two doors. One a front door of state and ceremony, grim
                  and cold; about the sort of door you would want to open in case of a funeral, to
                  let the procession out by; with a vineless trellis going up on one side, and
                  coming down on the other, and looking about as much like an arbor as a skeleton
                  does like a statue; and this was the door which was opened when the Maternal
                  Association met at Squire Mayes'. The other, a side door, of ease and freedom and
                  domestic comfort; warm and sunny; just the kind of door for a Newfoundland dog to
                  lie on the step of, and go to sleep in the sunshine. This door was on the
                  Southerly side of the house, and opened out upon a piazza. And here in front of
                  the piazza was no skeleton trellis, but a row of hop-poles, and hop-vines clinging
                  to them, thick and full, and intertwining. Turning dry and golden they now were,
                  but there was a reminiscence of summer life and verdure about them yet. The door
                  upon the piazza stood invitingly open; and there was the Newfoundland dog himself,
                  not sleeping on the door-step indeed, but trotting round the corner of the house
                  to see whose wheels these were he heard rolling up to the door. Who would go in at
                  a Maternal Association front door, when such access as this to his friend's house
                  stood open before him? Not I.
               Nor Matthew Caraby.
               Matthew accordingly drove up to the corner of the piazza; and throwing the reins
                  carelessly over his horse's back, he entered familiarly at the piazza door, and
                  stepped, without ceremony, into the family sitting room.
               If Mr. Caraby had hoped to find a young lady in this apartment, he was
                  disappointed. The only occupant of the room was a lady quite advanced in years,
                  who sat in a rocking chair at the window, knitting. He greeted her as Mrs.
                  Mayes.
               "How do you do, Mr. Caraby?" said the old lady, extending her hand to him, without
                  rising. "What a pleasant day it is, is n't it? Have you just come over from
                  Harsford's Mills? And how do they all do there?"
               Matthew said "Very well" at the beginning and repeated it at the end of this
                  sentence, and nodded at the middle; meanwhile looking around the room.
               "Where is Mr. Mayes?" he asked.
               "Oh, he's gone up the river. He went yesterday. He had some business there. You
                  know my son has a great deal to do. His business takes him off a great deal. I do
                  n't expect him back this week much, because when he went away he said—"
               "Is Arabella at home?" interrupted Matthew, with most polite petulance, his
                  glances of inquiry being quite disregarded by the loquacious old lady.
               "—that he might not be back till Monday, and when he says he may not be, we all know
                  that he won't be for certain, if he can help it. He got a letter from
                  New York, Saturday, and started off yesterday, and did n't say where he was going,
                  or what for, and I think that's kind of strange. But he'll have nice weather,
                  beautiful weather, if it holds on like this, and it will, I guess."
               "Is n't Arabella at home? Where is she?"
               "Why, la me, sure enough! Why! Did n't I tell you about Arabel? I might have known
                  you came to see her," said the old lady, with sly humor, "because, you know, you
                  always do come to see her. It reminds me how Reuben's father used to come over to
                  our house when I was a girl;—"
               "Ho," thought Matthew, with some impatience, "I never heard Grandma run on in this
                  way before. I suppose Arabel must be at work in the kitchen, and Grandma thinks
                  she is n't dressed up enough to come in."
               "—and how bashful I was, and—But Matthew! where are you going?"
               Matthew had his hand upon the latch of the kitchen door.
               "Only out to see if I can find Arabel," said he.
               "Why, I was just a saying," said the old lady, "when you interrupted me, that
                  she'll be in very soon. She's gone out, I believe, this afternoon. But she'll be
                  back soon."
               And the old lady rose, and looked out of the window down the road.
               The sun was near to setting. Its horizontal rays came streaming across the
                  landscape, and cast a warm, though sobered light, upon the changing foliage of the
                  hill-sides.
               "Has she gone away any where in particular?" asked Matthew.
               "Oh, she can't have gone far," said the old lady, apologetically. "She'll be at
                  home very soon. It was so pleasant she thought she'd take a walk. I told her she'd
                  better not go, but it was such beautiful weather she thought she'd go a little
                  way."
               "Which way did she go?" asked Matthew. "I think I'll ride down and meet her."
               "I do n't know," said the old lady, turning the other way, and looking up the
                  road. "I did n't see which way she went. It's too bad, now. She'll be so sorry. I
                  told her she'd better not go. But she'll be in soon, oh! very soon."
               It was a somewhat suspicious manner, the manner in which the old lady responded to
                  Matthew's inquiries. There was so much cordiality and frankness in the air with
                  which she told him nothing at all; so elaborate an ignorance respecting Miss
                  Arabella's movements; and so evident a disposition to detain Matthew in
                  conversation with the elder lady until the younger should return; that the young
                  man felt three-quarters satisfied that there was something to be discovered, and
                  two-thirds convinced he should not like it when he found it out. He said he would
                  go out and perhaps ride down and see if he could meet her.
               Matthew left the room as he had entered it, and stood upon the porch again; this
                  time in some uncertainty.
               
               Drive twenty miles to see a young lady,—find her gone out a-walking,—be
                  desperately anxious to see her,—and undertake to go and meet her without knowing
                  whether to go North, East, South, or West. There's a recipe for irresoluteness for
                  you. A dog can trace his master with the utmost promptness, but a lover shall not
                  be able, once in a hundred times, to find his mistress. Which leads me to believe
                  that the affections of young gentlemen are not in general as strong as those of
                  dogs.
               Matthew felt the difficulty, though he might probably have dissented from the
                  philosophical explanation. He paced irresolutely up and down the piazza. Continued
                  reflection upon his disappointment at finding his friend absent, irritated his
                  feelings into a state of disquiet which predisposed him to impatience and
                  dissatisfaction.
               From dwelling upon his present dissatisfaction, his thoughts reverted to the Bank.
                  He reflected upon the probability of its failure,—remembered with a momentary
                  complacency his little deposit so fortunately rescued,—then wondered whether Mr.
                  Mayes would be away too long to have opportunity to sell his stock in time,—then
                  queried whether he could not use the caution with some one else;—who?—Mr.
                  Sackett?—he owned no stock;—Miss Harsford's father?—people said he owned half the
                  Bank;—Matthew did not know him;—he lived off in New York,—what use to tell
                  him?—better leave word with Arabel for her father when he got back, and let it
                  take its chance;—and then went on to recollect how indignantly he had refused that
                  morning to pass off any Iroquois bills,—and to reflect how diligently he was now
                  trying to find some one whom he could advise to sell bad stock,—which was a pretty
                  piece of inconsistency, was n't it?—and besides,—
               Just at this point in his reverie a bare-headed, golden-haired little boy came
                  trotting round the corner of the house, in hot pursuit of the Newfoundland dog
                  herein-beforementioned, and brandishing one of those little switch canes of
                  whalebone which are so popular among the scions of American aristocracy. Seeing
                  Matthew, the child slackened his pace, hesitated, stopped.
               "Ah! Willie," said Matthew. "How do you do? Do n't you know me?"
               Willie gave a short laugh in reply, but did not move.
               "I do n't believe," said Matthew, sitting down upon the step of the piazza, "that
                  you can guess my name in three guesses."
               "Mattu," said the boy; and he laughed again, and brushed back the hair from his
                  forehead.
               "Somebody told you," said Matthew, "I know."
               Willie did not wholly comprehend this very simple criticism, but he recognized it
                  as being in some way depreciative of his guess. So he shook his head.
               "Come and show me your whip," said Matthew.
               "It is n't a 'ip."
               "Is n't it?" said Matthew, "why, I think it is a whip."
               Willie shook his head again.
               "You come and show it to me," said Matthew, "and let me see if it is n't a whip.
                  Will you?"
               Willie had already come to the foot of the steps leading ing to the piazza. He now began to climb up those
                  steps. Attaining the summit, he held the—whatever it was—triumphantly up before
                  Matthew. It was a little whalebone switch, made in the image of a cane, and
                  mounted with a fox-head, cut in ivory.
               Matthew took it and examined it with an appearance of great anxiety, to determine
                  whether it was a whip or not.
               There was a silver ring just below the fox-head; a collar, as it were, to the fox.
                  On this ring were engraved the initials, "J. G. H." These did not escape Matthew's
                  attention.
               "Whose is it, Willie?" he asked.
               "Misser Gwovering's," said Willie.
               "Mr. Glovering's?"
               Willie nodded.
               "Who is Mr. Glovering?"
               This question was above Willie's comprehension. He stood still, waiting for his
                  toy to be returned to him.
               "I want my cane," he said, at length.
               Matthew handed it back to him, saying: "You have n't told me yet who Mr. Glovering
                  is."
               "Misser Gwovering?"
               Willie only gave a short laugh in answer to this half inquiry, and stood still,
                  looking at Matthew.
               "Come. Where is he? Won't you tell me?" asked Matthew.
               "Awwy knows," said the child.
               "Arry!" said Matthew. "What! has he gone to walk with Arry?"
               Willie nodded assent.
               Matthew swallowed an exclamation of vexation, which, if it had gained utterance,
                  would probably have surprised his young friend. Then, bidding Willie to run into
                  the house and be a good boy, the first of which precepts was obeyed, if not the
                  second, he commenced a solitary promenade upon the piazza.
               While he awaits the tardy return of Arabella, let us turn to see where she is, and
                  what it can be that has so long detained her.
               I shall permit the young gentleman whom the reader is now about to meet, to
                  introduce himself to the confidence of the public, as he did to that of Miss
                  Mayes, as Mr. James Glovering. "A rose by any other name would smell as sweet." So
                  might the reputation of Mr. Glovering, and then again it might not,—it is entirely
                  a matter of opinion. The point is therefore dismissed with the remark, that if the
                  young gentleman has misinformed Miss Mayes, I feel sure that he has done so from
                  most delicate motives.
               Mr. James Glovering, then, (to speak from information derived from himself,) was a
                  young man of nothing and twenty, elegant in his dress, independent and easy in his
                  bearing, but with that indescribable air and manner peculiar to a certain
                  class,—the very highest bred,—of city young men; an air sometimes fascinating to
                  young and unsophisticated persons, but repulsive to those who know both sides of
                  human nature.
               A young person educated in the country, where honesty esty, industry and peacefulness form the common
                  chord of life, the harmony, to which constantly after all modulations and
                  diversions of key, the theme reverts, one who knows the world only by its genial
                  and goodly features, does not usually understand that "to have seen the world,"
                  "to know life," mean to have learned a great many evil things, together with a few
                  good ones. To such an one the polish, the readiness in conversation, the
                  nonchalance of air, the affectation of naughtiness, half as a boast, half as a
                  self-reproach, the apparent exuberance of social qualities which mark the type of
                  character referred to, all seem most attractive; and their supposititious
                  excellence is so nicely spiced with willfulness (pardonable because so frankly
                  confessed) that duplicity of thought comes to seem more intellectual than
                  simplicity, and sinuosity of conduct more graceful than straight-forward honesty.
                  Therefore it is that the quiet happiness of a simple heart is often so much
                  endangered when for the first time and unguardedly it is brought into intimate
                  association with such a character.
               I should misrepresent Mr. Glovering if I led the reader to attribute to him keen
                  wickedness. He was not very wicked, except perhaps in the theological sense; he
                  was not smart enough to be so. He regarded himself as a promising young man, (and
                  it was true; he had made promises enough,) of fair abilities, (nobody disputed
                  that; the worst that even his enemies had said was, "let him prove it,") of good
                  manners, (well, he never ate with his knife, nor appeared in a party without his
                  white kids,) of nice taste in dress, (he was what his tailor made him in that
                  respect, undoubtedly,) of a clear head and ready understanding; (with occasional
                  and in a young man quite excusable exceptions as to the clear head, and some
                  limitation as to the sphere of activity of the ready understanding, unquestionably
                  he was so,) and as moral as any of his acquaintance (very likely). Yes, this young
                  man was clearly right, when on Sunday, in morning service, he shut his prayer-book
                  just before the general confession, and put his head down to study the carpet
                  pattern, thinking that he was not a bad young man after all, and wondering why
                  Miss Westerby was n't out to-day, and wishing sincerely that some of those poor
                  wretches who pitch coppers in the streets, and sell Sunday papers, could only be
                  taught to be good Christians like himself.
               No, there was nothing vicious (yet) in him.
               But then to tell the truth, (for oh, thou promising young man, friend and
                  companion of him, take not premature comfort of my approval,) to tell the truth,
                  there was not one whit of good in him.
               Not one whit.
               He had no substantial, active, productive powers. He could not raise a grain of
                  wheat, nor form useless lumber into useful ware, nor by inventive genius give
                  matter power to take the place and do the work of man, nor guide the produce of a
                  surfeited region to a hungering market. He stood in no profession. Learning he had
                  not, the parchment certificate of a college to the contrary notwithstanding. His
                  brain generated no new ideas, whether literary, artistic, scientific, or
                  intellectual.
               
               Nor was he what is equal in worth and dignity to any or all of these, a man useful
                  by his deep social or moral feelings. A grain-growing, fruit-producing country,
                  without flowers or verdure, romantic scenery, graceful streams, waving forests, or
                  bold mountains, would be desolate indeed; but not more desolate than Life, if
                  thronged with wealth-producing men and women only, with no gentle, timid, loving
                  hearts to cheer the homes which wealth establishes, with no child's voice to call
                  upon parental love, no needy ones to give mankind the joys of generosity, no
                  suffering ones bowed down by long affliction, patient and meek, at the gentle blow
                  of whose example the dry rock of the long-prospered heart may flow with sympathy.
                  The true happiness of society is not evolved by its efficient workers only, still
                  less are the rich independent of the poor. In our social state, Lazarus is the
                  salvation of Dives.
               But Glovering had not the heart-virtues of a Lazarus. He rendered no home more
                  truly or wisely happy. He gave no bright example of any true or pure or sacred
                  feeling. His heart was as shallow as his brain was dry. He possessed no
                  enthusiasms. He knew too much about things to entertain such unsophisticated
                  feelings. He was not the subject of any powerful, permanent principles, or any
                  persistent, resolute motives. All sweet fruits of affection were in him immature,
                  green, and sour. His whole nature was empty.
               He was the child of luxury and of want; of false attention and real neglect. He
                  had always had every thing he desired, and almost nothing which he needed. And now
                  the higher faculties with which in a respectable degree he had been endowed at
                  birth, were dying out. His life had long since become useless to others, and was
                  daily growing more hurtful to himself.
               In short, if a disbeliever in the Providence of God, looking around for some
                  triumphant argument of refutation, and pointing out some such young man, should
                  say to me,
               Tell me why your Deity ever made such a creature as this, and I'll believe in
                  him;—
               I should hesitate for a convincing answer.
               I can understand why thistles are. They feed the bees. I can satisfy myself about
                  butterflies. They are ornamental, and they do really enjoy themselves innocently.
                  I can see a use in idiots and lunatics. They teach us more of the nature and value
                  of human reason than we should ever know without them, and their presence among us
                  is a spur to humanity. I can even imagine that the outrageous criminal may be
                  useful as a warning to others, and by putting society on its self-defense against
                  wrong and injustice in all forms.
               But I find it hard to explain the creation of young Glovering.
               While Matthew Caraby was pacing the piazza of his intended father-in-law's house,
                  Mr. Glovering—being in person of a medium height, well-formed and proportioned,
                  except that his mouth seemed slightly one-sided, and turned up at the corner when
                  he spoke, as if it had been very much accustomed to carry a cigar; and wearing a
                  glossy beaver hat, the flat rim of which slanted across his brow at an agreeable angle; and over his
                  usual dress a light fall over-coat, within which might be seen a rich velvet vest
                  adorned with two heavy gold chains, one passing round his neck, the other,
                  burdened with charms, being hooked to a button-hole—Mr. Glovering being such as he
                  is here described, was seated upon a hill-top a couple of miles from Mr. Mayes',
                  by the side of a young lady, a very charming young lady indeed.
               They had been diligently inspecting the sunset, and the setting sun was warmly
                  gazing upon them.
               As the sun went down an uneasiness arose in the breast of the young lady. She
                  gathered her shawl closer around her, shivered a feminine little shiver, and
                  ventured to put in definite words the suggestion which she had endeavored to
                  convey by hints and implications for some time previous.
               "It 's getting rather late," said she, "most supper time. The afternoons are
                     so short. Had n't we better be getting towards home, Mr.
                  Glovering?"
               As she said this, the sun nodded his head in assent. He nodded it so low that it
                  went entirely out of sight beneath the horizon.
               "Why!" said her companion, moving as if to rise, and then leaning back again as if
                  to sit still. "Do you know it seems so queer to me to hear of supper at this
                  hour?" And he laughed. "So odd, you know. Why, we do n't think of supper till ten
                  o'clock. In the city, you know, it 's so different. Every thing. We tea at seven,
                  but we never have supper till ten or eleven, and when we go out any where, it
                  's—oh, ever so late."
               "Do you think that 's a good plan?" said the young lady.
               "No," said the gentleman, "it 's bad 'pon honor. But then we can't help it
                  possibly. And then it 's a deuced—that is, I mean, a great deal jollier than going
                  to bed at nine o'clock, for all the world like a parcel of old grandfathers. Why,
                  the night before I left, some of us took supper at a hotel, and we actually did
                  n't sit down to the table till after twelve o'clock. We had a game supper. But you
                  know, where every body does so—"
               The young lady rose. It was growing dark.
               "Well," said the gentleman, rising also, "if it 's near supper time, I suppose we
                  must go. I should n't object to some more of that bread and cream and honey. That
                  's now what you do n't get in New York."
               "Do n't you?" said his companion.
               And they turned towards home.
               "No. Yes, you can get cream made to order. They manufacture it with milk and eggs,
                  and I guess a little sugar. You order cream at one of the saloons, and they bring
                  you two table-spoonsful in a little pitcher with the foam all on it where they 've
                  been beating it up."
               The young lady laughed.
               This young lady, to whom the reader has not yet been introduced, was Miss Arabella
                  Mayes. The only daughter of her father, a substantial farmer, and early in her
                  teens bereaved of her mother, she had grown up, petted, caressed, and
                  ill-governed. Yet the native force of her
                  character, and the effect of a noble maternal example in her childhood, were such
                  that at nineteen she was now an excellent girl, an obedient daughter, a most
                  capable and efficient housekeeper. If she was not beautiful, it was because she
                  was handsome. She was short, and slightly, though gracefully formed. Black eyes
                  lighted her open and pleasing countenance, and dark hair, lightly waving over her
                  clear forehead, was gathered over her ears and carried back where it fell down her
                  neck in a little cataract of curls. Her eyes were swift in their glance and sudden
                  in change of expression, but although brilliant, they lacked that capacity of deep
                  and tender expression which belongs to the most lovable natures.
               She was quick of thought, and strong of resolve, self-reliant and self-possessed.
                  She did not distrust herself, and had never had reason to distrust others. With
                  such a character, it was natural that although quite free from vanity she should
                  cherish a certain degree of pride, and should follow its dictates, sometimes
                  indeed unwisely.
               Altogether she was handsome, good-humored, independent; when she thought it
                  dignified, she could be distant, and when she thought it charming, she could be
                  willful, and her waywardness was as delightful as such vexatious qualities in a
                  young lady ever can be.
               This afternoon she looked, as her companion acknowledged to himself, very
                  charming. Beneath the edge of her dress a very unlady-like shoe, stout and
                  thick-soled, defying roughness and moisture, occasionally peeped forth. Partly
                  because she was pleased with the novel manners and converse of her father's guest,
                  and partly from a sense that some polite attentions were due to him, she had
                  accepted Mr. Glovering's invitation to take an evening walk. The beauty of the
                  closing day and the blandishments of her companion had prolonged it to a late
                  time. She was now thinking of Matthew. She tried not to do so, but she could not
                  help thinking that he might possibly come over to-night.
               They were by this time drawing near home.
               "You have never been in New York?" inquired Mr. Glovering.
               "Never," said Arabella.
               "Never in any city?"
               "Only in Albany."
               "Oh, Albany is nothing. You must come to New York sometime—I should like to show
                  you around—I should be proud—"
               And he finished the sentence with an admiring glance which he had found very
                  effective among the damsels of city society, but which Arabella did not understand
                  sufficiently to be displeased with.
               "In New York," he continued, "you 'd think it was a holiday, and every body was in
                  the streets. You 'd wonder where they were all going. You could n't get along in
                  the crowds without a gentleman, until you got accustomed to it. And then the
                  streets are so wide, and the shops so handsome, and there are so many carriages
                  and omnibuses. I suppose there's a heavier travel over parts of Broadway than over
                  any other spot of ground in the world. I do n't think I saw any thing in London or
                  Paris equal to it."
               
               "Have you been in London and Paris?" inquired the girl, with fresh interest in her
                  companion.
               "Yes, oh, yes," said he carelessly. "For business, mere business, I suppose New
                  York is as lively as they, but there's a great deal more of the world to be seen
                  in Paris than any where else."
               At this moment they came to a turn in the road where through the trees and in the
                  moonlight Arabel saw a familiar horse and wagon—Matthew's horse and wagon—standing
                  at the door of her father's house.
               She started; trembling so that her companion felt the tremor of her arm upon his
                  own, and interrupted himself upon his panegyric upon the trans-atlantic
                  metropolis, to say;—
               "Why, what's the matter?"
               "Matter, what about?"
               "Why, your hand trembles as though it was morning after a champagne supper," said
                  Mr. Glovering gayly.
               Arabella only laughed. It was a fictitious little laugh.
               "You have taken cold, being out so late. I ought not to have kept you out so
                  long," continued Mr. Glovering, in a tone of assumed self-reproach, "but I enjoyed
                  myself so much, I had no idea how time was passing."
               Arabella made no answer. She still looked intently towards her father's house.
                  This night, of all nights, was Matthew here? Mr. Glovering followed the glance of
                  her eyes, and following it observed the horse and wagon. He looked back again, and
                  noted the expression of her face, then gave a long-drawn whistle. One of those
                  whistles in a whisper accompanied by a slight shrug of the eye-brows, with which
                  your gossips are accustomed to intimate the making of a surprising discovery
                  respecting some one's private affairs.
               Arabella looked an interrogation point at him to ask its meaning.
               "I do hope my dear Miss Arabel—excuse me. But will you allow me to call you
                  Arabel?"
               To this somewhat free inquiry, Arabel made no answer.
               "Thank you;" Mr. Glovering continued. "'Silence gives consent.' Then I do hope my
                  dear Arabel that you will forgive me for getting you into such a confounded
                  scrape."
               "What do you mean, sir?"
               "Why, really though; I hope you give me credit for sagacity enough to perceive
                  that that is somebody's horse and wagon in particular at the door there."
               Arabella evidently did not understand him.
               "Why—in short—that your lover is waiting for you, and that you are to have a scene
                  with him à la Othello and Desdemona. I'll keep within hearing, and if he gets
                  dangerous, you call and I'll run in and—"
               Mr. Glovering interrupted himself in the middle of his sentence. Arabella had
                  withdrawn her arm from his as suddenly as if it burnt her.
               "Why, what 's the matter now?" said he.
               "You are impertinent, sir!"
               "Well, you are the strangest girl I ever saw; to take it as impertinent because I
                  insinuate that you have a lover. Every
                  girl I ever knew takes it as a compliment; the more lovers you give 'em the better
                  they like it."
               Arabella made no answer. She walked coldly and proudly forward at a little
                  distance from her companion.
               "It is just as I thought," continued Mr. Glovering, "you are vexed with me, it's
                  just my luck. But I do beseech you Miss Arabel to forgive me. How could I know
                  that he was coming this afternoon? It is truly my ill luck, not my
                  fault, that I have got you into such a scrape. If he scolds about it—"
               "Scolds!" said Arabella contemptuously.
               "Tell him," continued Mr. Glovering, "that it was my fault. Say you wanted to come
                  back, but I would n't let you. I think he won't mind. I would n't be
                  frightened."
               "I am not frightened sir," said Arabella in a tone of increased
                  displeasure. "I have no reason to be."
               They had just reached the house. Arabella would have entered the front door, but
                  it seemed to savor too much of cowardice, so she went up the piazza steps. She
                  wished to speak to Matthew, but she shrank from the little taunts of her
                  companion. Therefore she stepped straightway into the house.
               Mr. Glovering, seemingly the victim of sudden astronomical impulses, remained
                  without, and stood with his back against a pillar, gazing into the firmament, and
                  charmingly whistling a reminiscence of Casta Diva, with the latest operatic
                  adornments. His manner would have been fascinating to the admirers of the
                  Glovering style, but to Matthew it was galling and offensive in the extreme.
               Matthew was sitting in the further corner of the piazza. For a tedious hour he had
                  been awaiting Arabella's arrival, and now expected at least her kindly greeting.
                  Instead of this, she did not appear to notice that he was there.
               "Arabella," said her grandmother to her, as she entered the sitting room, "how
                  came you to be gone so long? Matthew 's out there on the piazza waiting for you.
                  He's been here over an hour waiting to see you."
               "Has he?" said Arabella. "Well, I suppose he can come in and see me, if he
                  wishes."
               "Pshaw, child! Do n't act so foolish," said her grandmother. "Go out and speak to
                  him, and behave harn-some to him."
               "Oh, no, I sha'n't do any such thing," said Arabella.
               Nevertheless, after waiting a moment, she went to the door.
               "Why, what's the matter, Mr. Glovering?" said she, stepping out upon the piazza,
                  "why do n't you come in?"
               "Arabella," said Matthew, and he rose from his seat and came towards them.
               "Why, Matthew!" exclaimed Arabella, in a tone of great surprise, "are you
                  here?"
               "This is Mr. Glovering, I believe," said Matthew.
               "My name," replied Mr. Glovering, speaking with fourth proof city politeness.
               "Will you allow us, sir, to be alone?" said Matthew, addressing him with the
                  double distilled extract of rural high manners.
               
               "Oh! ah! tête-à-tête! eh! Certainly, sir. I would not intrude for the world."
               And he descended the steps. Arabella and Matthew were left alone.
               For several moments neither spoke. There was a consciousness in each that the
                  approaching conversation was to be an encounter, and that an advantage in position
                  would be gained by which ever should stand on the defensive and await attack.
                  There was a silence, therefore. It was broken by Arabella, who, with a feminine
                  shrewdness of which she was not conscious, compelled Matthew to open the
                  dialogue.
               "Well, sir," said she.
               The "well" did not mean much, but the "sir" did, a vast deal.
               "Arabel," said Matthew, "what is the meaning of all this?"
               "Really, sir," said Arabella, "I think this is pretty well. You come here to make
                  a call,—spend the evening on the piazza,—never speak to me when I come home,—then
                  when I come out to see you, you ask my friend to go away, that you may talk with
                  me alone,—and then begin your mysterious conversation by asking what it all means.
                  I am sure, sir, I can't imagine. I was just about to ask, myself."
               Matthew walked down the piazza a step or two, and then back to where Arabella was
                  standing; then spoke:
               "I came to see you to-night, at the risk of losing my situation,—in spite of
                  Sackett. He said I should not come. I came. You were gone out, no one knew where.
                  Two hours, I should think, I have waited for you. The sun set an hour ago. It is
                  dark when you return with your friend,—you drop his arm as you come within my
                  sight, and affect a formal coolness toward your friend as you approach,—you pass
                  me by without a recognition,—when you come to the door, it is not to speak to me,
                  it is to your friend you come to speak. And when I ask you what all this means,
                  you laugh at me. This is not right or kind, Arabella. I have a right to know."
               "To know? To know what?" said Arabella. "What is it you want to know?"
               "First," said Matthew, "I want to know who this Glovering is. Is he a puppy your
                  father has bought for you, or has he sneaked in here for a night's lodging of his
                  own accord?"
               "You speak freely, sir," said Arabella, feeling her pride supported by the
                  sharpness of Matthew's tone. "Mr. Glovering is my father's guest and my
                  friend."
               "If I speak too freely, Arabella," said Matthew, conscious that he was losing his
                  self-control, "it is because I feel too deeply. But I ask you again, who is he?
                  You say he is your friend. What do you mean by that? Do you then change your
                  friendships so often?"
               "Do you find fault with me that I have friends?" said Arabella. "I did not suppose
                  that I gave up all other friendship because I accepted yours."
               "Arabella," said Matthew, "you know that I love you—"
               "I have heard you say so, sir, but I begin to think tonight that I am not the
                  docile, easily-managed girl you thought
                  you loved. I have friends, you see. She whom you loved was to have none—was
                  she?"
               "I assure you, Arabella," said Matthew, "that I do love you, without
                  delusion, and without mistake. More warmly than you ever were or will be loved
                  besides. I love you wholly. For myself, I have no other friendships. Excepting my
                  sister, I have none in the world to care for but you; none whom I even call
                  friends. But I do not quite expect the same from you. I do not desire to exclude
                  you from any healthful, wisely-chosen friendships, Arabella."
               Arabella laughed. It was a crisp, satirical little laugh; a concise embodiment of
                  the whole fable of the Fox and Grapes.
               "You laugh at me for loving you," said Matthew bitterly.
               "I do not laugh because you love me," said Arabella, "but because you are so
                  comically unreasonable."
               Matthew began to realize that unless his feelings were somewhat milder and his
                  thoughts more judiciously expressed, all the warmth of his affection for Arabella
                  would not enable him to win her back to kindness without making hazardous
                  submissions to her caprice and pride. He paced back and forth upon the piazza to
                  gain time for reflection.
               Upon this piazza at its farthest end, there stood a rustic bench which Matthew had
                  made. In the past season it had been through many hours of summer evening the
                  scene of delightful conversations and still more delightful moments of silence.
                  Before it in front of the piazza hung a curtain of vines and creeping roses, now
                  torn and faded in the chilly winds of autumn. Through these the curious stars
                  peered keenly. Perhaps they wondered why the lovers were not seated side by side
                  as on former evenings,—why they did not now according to invariable custom in the
                  intervals of conversation lean with heads close touching for the interesting
                  astronomical experiment of seeing at once the same star through the same crevice
                  in the leafy curtain.
               There is no structure possible to be erected within the human heart which will so
                  stoutly resist all pressure from without, the powers of all entreaties
                  persuasions, arguments, reproofs, reproaches, threats, as an arch of pride beneath
                  which is a hollow empty consciousness of being in the wrong. Upon such an arch as
                  this, Arabella was now standing.
               Arabella approached the end of the settee, and leaned with one hand upon its arm.
                  She stood pale and quiet waiting for Matthew to proceed. Matthew stood beyond,
                  with one foot upon the seat and leaning forward. From the garden walk below, the
                  steps of Arabella's visitor were heard pacing back and forth upon the gravel.
               "Arabel."
               "I listen," said she.
               "Yes," returned Matthew bitterly, "for the footsteps of your friend."
               The temper which the girl restrained from words, flashed over her face in a
                  burning blush.
               "Have you nothing more to say to me?"
               "Much. But nothing in his hearing."
               
               "I do not understand. I know of nothing which you may not say here;—so that it is
                  short," added she, shivering slightly, "for it is chilly."
               "Arabella!" he exclaimed, "I beseech you to carry this no further. If you love me
                  be plain and honest with me. Do not let us part, I implore you, without
                  understanding each other."
               He yields, thought she. I knew he must. He intreats. Why should he call me to
                  account? He will yield. Thus firmly planted on the arch of pride she said,
               "I should be sorry to misunderstand you, but I confess I do not understand your
                  conduct."
               "And what mysterious thing is it which passes your comprehension?" urged Matthew
                  irritated at being thus evaded.
               "I do not understand," said she, with a forced smile, "what it is that must be so
                  private, or what secret errand brings you here that requires so much seclusion and
                  mystery."
               "You are not accustomed to speak in this way of my visits."
               "The present is not always like the past; nor are you accustomed to make such
                  visits as this of to-night."
               "I came because—because I loved you. It seems I have presumed too much."
               "You certainly have if you think I have any thing to disclose or to conceal."
               "And have you no word of explanation for the reception which I find."
               "Indeed, sir!" persisted she, "and how should I? I am always glad to see my
                  friends. They are free to come and go, nor can I help it when they will come or
                  when they shall go."
               "What do you mean?" cried he. And then restraining himself, he said in a mild
                  tone, "You would say that I am free to come or go. You mean perhaps that my being
                  here is no longer a pleasure to you, and that but for your politeness I might
                  understand it so?"
               His cool, quiet, deliberate words heaped a heavy burden upon her; yet still the
                  arch of pride stood firm. She was silent.
               She must speak more explicitly, thought he. I would not restrain her a moment if
                  she has another preference.
               "I am going home now," he continued. "After this conversation, my course must
                  depend very much on your last words to me."
               She was still silent. Not a word.
               Matthew turned, passed her, and stepped along the piazza towards the door. The
                  impulse seized her to follow him, lay her hand upon his arm with its old gentle
                  pressure, and her head upon his shoulder to whisper in his ear what her better
                  feelings prompted her to say. She started to fulfill the impulse. But Matthew
                  unconscious of her relenting, before she reached him suddenly stopped at the
                  piazza step and said;
               "Mr. Glovering, will you do us the favor to step up here a moment?"
               Arabella turned back and sank upon the seat. Her instinct told her that Matthew,
                  from desiring to talk with her alone, had come to desire to talk with her in the avowed presence of a witness; and
                  that witness the very one whose insinuating words had been the stimulus of her
                  pride. Her throbbing head she leaned upon her hand, and awaited the approach of
                  the two gentlemen. They came up. The contrast she could not but note. Matthew
                  tall, and though slightly built yet robust and sunburnt. His hands were clasped
                  behind him, which threw his shoulders forward, and gave to his countenance a
                  downcast and severe air. The other stepped lightly over the floor, looking
                  alternately at the lovers with a nonchalant air, and tapping his teeth with the
                  little fox-head on his cane.
               "Pardon me," said Matthew, straightening himself toward the young gentleman, and
                  affecting politeness as well as his impatience permitted, "that I speak to you
                  without an introduction, and indeed without knowing whether your name is James
                  Glovering or J. G. H."
               The young gentleman inserted the fox-head, silver collar and all, into his mouth,
                  and closed his lips over them.
               "But it's unnecessary to say more of that, for we have never met before and may
                  never again."
               The young gentleman transferred the fox-head from the seclusion of his mouth to
                  that of his hand, and bowed a grateful assent.
               "Since you have seemed to take an interest in our conversation, and as Miss Mayes
                  seems to desire that you should not leave her, perhaps she will repeat to you what
                  she has just said to me of our relations."
               "About your relations?" said the young gentleman. "Yes! I did not hear that part
                  of it."
               She must own me or disown me now, thought Matthew.
               "Mr. Caraby," said Arabella rising and turning her head toward him haughtily, "if
                  our acquaintance is to lead to such scenes as this, I think it had better end. End
                  here. You are free. So am I."
               With these words the humiliated girl passed by them both toward the door.
               Matthew, no less humiliated himself, though from a different cause, said as she
                  passed, "If you, Arabella, say so, so be it."
               Arabella, with no response, entered the house.
               "Ha! ha!" cried the young gentleman, as he began to understand the dialogue he had
                  heard, and feigning to applaud with his cane; "ha! ha! ha! That's well done.
                  Bra-avo. And what about the relations now? Eh? 'Our relations!' pretty good. I
                  wasn't far from right, Mr. Caraway, when I told her I reckoned you would scold.
                  Eh?"
               "You told her? you scoundrel!" muttered Matthew between his teeth.
               "Ye-es," laughed the young gentleman, walking before Matthew, and keeping at a
                  safe distance from him while he laughed; "ye es, I told her you'd be very
                  uncomfortable, but I did n't know she would get on such a high horse as that."
               "Silence!" said Matthew.
               "She made herself regularly ridiculous," said the sympathizing young man. "I do
                  n't wonder she hurt your feelings; for really I never saw a girl make herself
                     so completely ridiculous, just because
                  she happened to have two beaux after her."
               "There!" said the incensed Matthew, dropping his well-knit fist upon the shoulder
                  of his companion with a power that felled him to the ground, "if that hurt
                     your feelings so much the worse for your feelings. Now you have
                  something of your own to attend to. Do n't say another word to me."
               As he addressed these last words to the young gentleman who was prostrate against
                  the steps, muttering and rubbing his bruises, Matthew leaped into the wagon,
                  turned a desperately short curve into the road, and disappeared from his vengeful
                  eyes.
               For my part, I would rather have walked to Harsford's Mills that night, than have
                  risked my neck in that wagon, with Matthew Caraby to drive.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               THE LADDER OF LABOR IS EASIER THAN THE LEAP OF LUCK.
               MR. ALEXANDER HARSFORD, of the city of New York, transacted commercial business in
                  Hanover Square, under the name, style, and firm of Alexander Harsford & Co.
                  What was the business, or who was the Co., a stranger passing the place would not
                  be likely to guess, for any thing that appeared from the sidewalk.
               I am very glad that the scope of this chapter does not involve an investigation
                  into the nature and variety of the business of Harsford and Company. The brief
                  inquiries I have been able to make always met the reply:
               "Oh, I believe he does a general commission business."
               It is needless to persist in such inquiries; for though I do not doubt that the
                  course of his dealings involved acts of omission as well as of
                     commission, it is equally certain that the business transactions
                  of this house, with which you and I as friends of Matthew Caraby have to do, will
                  be ample to satiate curiosity.
               From without, the establishment did not present an attractive aspect. In business
                  hours the front part of the store was thrown entirely open to view, like all
                     other fronts in that vicinity, by
                  swinging back the heavy doors that hung upon the stone door-posts. Not much
                  insight into the business, however, did even this afford; for all that could be
                  seen was a high fence, consisting of broad pickets and narrow interstices, that
                  ran from one side straight across the warehouse until it came to a steep erection,
                  which, in a barn or cow-house, would be called a ladder, but which Alexander
                  Harsford & Co. denominated the stair-case. A padlock and hinges in the picket
                  fence indicated a gateway there, and through the interstices between the pickets
                  were dimly discernible shadows of boxes and bales and huge piles of shapeless
                  things filling the void beyond.
               The convenience of the ladder was much enhanced by the fact that directly before
                  it a stout and very dirty cable, ornamented with an enormous iron hook for a
                  pendant, hung from above directly before the ladder, and was adjusted at a proper
                  height to tap the skull of any careless passer by.
               At half-past nine on one morning early in November, 1848, Mr. Harsford entered his
                  warehouse, which he did by dodging the cable and stumbling rapidly up the stairs.
                  At the top of the stair-case there was another picket fence, and behind it in the
                  dark a man wiping his hands upon a towel.
               "Morning, Warrack," said the merchant, and without waiting to hear Mr. Warrack
                  say, "Good morning, Mr. Harsford; it 's a fine morning, sir," he opened a glass
                  door, which made a right angle with the picket fence, and entered his
                  counting-room.
               Why Alexander Harsford & Co should use a black step-ladder to gain access to a
                  suit of parlors; why they should ordain a trap-door, and institute something very
                  like a gallows in the entrance to honest offices, is something more than an
                  unsophisticated author can understand. But so it was.
               The counting-rooms of the firm were three in number. There was first the business
                  office, carpeted in oil-cloth, furnished with a safe and two high desks, and
                  adorned with railroad maps, which showed the "favorite route" in a bright red
                  line, straight; and all the rival routes in faint black lines, very circuitous.
                  This room was moreover enlivened by two clerks and a loud clock.
               The two inner rooms opened upon this, from which they were separated by a glass
                  partition.
               Into one of these rooms Mr. Harsford hastened, and seated himself at a large
                  mahogany structure which would have served as a church pulpit almost as imposingly
                  as it did for a desk. This desk stood in the middle of a brilliant carpet, and
                  from his seat at it Mr. Harsford looked out at pleasure, through the door he had
                  left half open, into the large office, or in the other direction, through the
                  window into the triangle which is called Hanover Square.
               But Mr. Harsford spent little time in looking about him this morning. He seated
                  himself in a morocco-cushioned arm-chair, took off his hat and placed it on a
                  chair near at hand, pulled off a pair of glossy India-rubbers, and tossed them out
                  of sight behind his seat, and leaning forward over his desk, rummaged with one hand among a profusion of papers which
                  lay scattered there.
               If I were an artist, (which the acute reader doubtless already knows I am not,) I
                  should be very glad to have Mr. Harsford sit to me. He was so small that he would
                  have made a capital subject; for his picture would not have taken so much canvass
                  or so much colors as common men's by the half. His life-size portrait would have
                  been a miniature of a man. Mr. Harsford was one of those men who did not get much
                  when he got his growth. I think it doubtful whether he ever did get his growth. It
                  may be that he was only a schoolboy with whiskers, wrinkles and wisdom. He looked
                  as if he had taken permanent board when he went into jacket and trowsers, and had
                  never allowed himself to get any bigger lest his landlady should charge him full
                  price. He was one of your short, thin, spare, sharp, mercurial men; quick, ready,
                  versatile. On the whole, I would prefer not to be the artist to take his likeness.
                  I doubt whether he could sit still long enough. His daguerreotype, for instance, I
                  should expect would have four distinct sets of eyelids, and would show the fingers
                  of three hands dimly visible in the whiskers. He was little, lively and keen. He
                  ran about among larger men in the street and on 'change as a revenue cutter glides
                  hither and thither among a convoy of merchantmen. So much the better for him, and
                  he knew it. He would not have been so promptly hailed by his business friends if
                  he had been like other people. They would not have so commonly said approvingly
                  that he was "a confounded sharp little fellow," if he had been as large as they.
                  So he was rather proud of his little person.
               He bore a dark complexion; a high and bald, but corrugated forehead, imparted to
                  him some intellectual power; wavy black hair, adorning thickly the top and back of
                  his head, contributed to his appearance a pleasing reminiscence of youth, and
                  thick whiskers and beard, well sprinkled with gray, while they filled out the thin
                  cheeks of his triangular countenance, yet elongated his chin, and spoke of age and
                  the wisdom of experience. He was elegantly dressed. His black broadcloth coat was
                  relieved by a crimson velvet vest, over which a gold watch chain hung. A light
                  silk handkerchief was comfortably adjusted around his irreproachable collar.
               Mr. Harsford's early history was not much known in Wall street. Those who knew
                  most about it had heard indefinitely, and remembered indistinctly, that he was
                  born and bred in the country;—that losing his first wife, about whose death they
                  had heard there was an odd story, but did not know what it was, he had come to New
                  York city to make his fortune;—that a few weeks after reaching the city he had
                  improved an opportunity of marrying again;—that at the outset he had devoted
                  himself in an honest and steady way to a legitimate business as a commission
                  merchant;—that after a time, as he became more and more influenced by the city
                  ways, and gradually lost the honest and steady tastes and habits which his rural
                  education had been able to impress, though only superficially, upon his naturally
                  selfish character, he became dissatisfied with the hard work and slow and moderate gains of his business,
                  and gradually became drawn into speculations of diverse and doubtful
                  character.
               While Mr. Harsford sat ransacking the papers that lay carelessly upon his desk,
                  which he did with a nervous manner that indicated uncertainty what to take up
                  rather than uncertainty where to find any thing that he wanted to take up, his
                  errand boy came in with the morning's letters. The merchant took them up and began
                  to glance at their superscriptions rapidly in turn, sliding them from one hand to
                  the other. Two which were for Mrs. Beulah Harsford, his wife, he dropped into his
                  coat pocket, to be straightway forgotten.
               Mr. Harsford's pocket was Mrs. Harsford's post office. It was often innocently
                  remarked by Mrs. Harsford how inconveniently irregular was the mail which brought
                  her letters. At which Mr. Harsford usually replied, "Yes, the department is
                  wretchedly managed."
               Having thus put his wife's letters, as we may say, into her own box, where they
                  were safe till called for, Mr. Harsford went on scanning his letters as if he
                  wished to assort them mentally so that he might take them up systematically.
               All this was done with a quick, nervous motion, an absent-minded air, and from
                  time to time an effort to resettle himself in his easy chair, as if it were not an
                  easy chair to him.
               After all, the real seat of comfort is in the soul. Alexander Harsford had no such
                  chair in his breast. Perhaps he had not room for it.
               In his abstraction he turned over the pile of letters in this uneasy way. Suddenly
                  his hand dropped upon the desk lid, and he sat motionless. The absent thoughts
                  were recalled. The restless eye became fixed upon a small envelope. The
                  superscription which seemed to present so strange a sight to him was this: 
                     "For Mrs. Martha A. Harsford, "Wife of Alexander Harsford,
                        "Hanover Square, "New York."
                  
               
               "Martha! Martha!" said the motions of his silent lips, as if the subject were too
                  secret even for his own hearing. "Yet another?" And he cast the note upon the desk
                  and threw himself back in that perplexity and doubt, than which there is but one
                  lower depth—Despair!
               From his hand the note fell upon its face on the desk. It was sealed with a motto
                  wafer. He took it up to read it. It bore the figure of a bloodhound pursuing a
                  fleeing man, and beneath this device was the word "JUSTICE."
               "Oh Heavens! what does this mean? Is there more of this to come? Heaven help
                  me!"
               Ah soul, self-cheated of thy Best Friend. How does the pressure of this grief
                  disclose thy highest instincts, perverted. All hearts must pray. And the prayer of
                  him who does not pray to God is mockery like thine;—"Oh Heavens!—Heaven help
                  me!"
               
               "'Oh Heavens!'" Ha! Oh Vacancy! Oh Blue and Illimitable Emptiness! Oh Infinite and
                  Eternal Nothing!
               Well, if Nothing be thy God, Nothing shall answer thy prayer.
               "Can she be living now? Am I to be blasted and ruined now through the most
                  innocent of errors twenty years ago? I thought I had heard the last of this. It 's
                  a conspiracy. Alive!" And the slight frame of the merchant trembled in a shudder
                  at some terrible thought until the great cold drops started from their fountains
                  on his high forehead, and wandered down till they were lost in making wet pathways
                  over his cheeks.
               "Impossible," he exclaimed again. "She never lived through that storm. We made
                  thorough search. Impossible. I'll not touch it. It 's some scheme,—some
                  infernal—Let them do their worst. The worst they can do is,—Good Heavens! What if
                  she should be alive? If she lives now, I wish I were dead. But it 's impossible;
                  it is utterly out of the question. Come now, it can't be. But then if,—if she is
                  not on earth, the Devil is. I'll acknowledge that. I must find some clue to this;
                  I must find some clue."
               Repeating slowly these words, he took up the note and opened it carefully,
                  avoiding breaking the seal. He held it fearfully, as if it were from quarantine in
                  times of pestilence, and he knew not what message of disease and death might be
                  concealed in its folds.
               This was the letter:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              NEW YORK, 14th October, 1848.
                              MY DEAR ALEXANDER:
                           
                           Why do you still doubt? You send to search for my remains. You hope
                              still in my death. You need not send so far.
                           I have received what you sent to me. But ten times that amount will
                              not satisfy me till I have seen you. Till you have seen me.
                           Am I less to you than you are to me? I must claim my rightful place.
                              It is mine. I am your wife. She is but a usurper. I know you long to
                              do justice to me and mine. But you shun publicity.
                           Will you come to me? Or must I visit you? I am ready if I must. Again
                              I say, meet me to-night as I last requested, or send me there your
                              reason why.
                           Come in time. You fear my demands may be irksome. They are. I have
                              suffered poverty for twenty years and more. What you sent one was but
                              the meanest fragment of justice. I do not ask for money. Come! Come!
                              What I ask, much as it may cost you, is but insignificant compared
                              with my rights.
                           Remember to-morrow night.
                           It shall no longer be my fault if your household mourns.
                           The unexpected life of one may prove as fearful as a sudden death.
                           For forty-eight hours adieu.
                           
                              Your first,
                              Your only wife,
                              MARTHA ALVIN HARSFORD.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               
               "Curse me for a fool," said the merchant in a lively, bitter tone, hissing between
                  his close shut teeth; "curse me for a fool if this thing—be she wife or Devil—can
                  make me waste one moment more;"—and he took out his gold watch, resolutely wound
                  it up, and set it on the desk before him, as if to take a pattern from its cold,
                  expressionless face, and the assiduity of its hands. Then falling from his
                  resolution, and forgetting his imprecation, he took up again the letter and
                  pondered in silence over it.
               It is not probable that Mr. Harsford would have been so much disturbed by this
                  epistle, if it had been the first one of the kind he had received. But it was not.
                  He had, a short time previous, received a letter signed in the same name, and
                  preferring the same claim; and although his first thought had been to rejoice in
                  the idea that one whom he had believed to have been long ago perished was
                  preserved, and his second to reject the claim as an imposture,—"for," said he,
                  "she would come and see me; she would have come to see me long ago,"—yet a longer
                  reflection suggested so fully the embarrassments which must result to himself and
                  his family should such a claim be established, that apprehension and dread at
                  length triumphed over every other feeling. He was a man habitually conscious that
                  his life was one long narrative of frauds, and wrongs, and schemes which would not
                  bear the light; and he was habitually timid, therefore, of every exposure of his
                  affairs. The suggestions of this letter, therefore, while they might have inspired
                  contempt for its author as an impostor in the breast of a man accustomed to trust
                  his own integrity, filled Mr. Harsford with an undefinable alarm. Never confessing
                  to himself, even in his secret thoughts, his consciousness of his wrong doing, he
                  now spoke only of his fear that the letter might be true. But in fact his fears
                  would not have been much diminished had he been able to assure himself that it was
                  false; for, if false, it was evidently the work of some one who had advanced and
                  would pursue the claim relentlessly; and who could tell how much evil and disgrace
                  a shrewd and persistent searcher into the merchant's affairs might bring upon
                  him?
               Mr. Harsford sat gazing upon the letter for many minutes, until the entrance of
                  Mr. Warrack, on some casual errand of the counting-house, recalled him. He looked
                  up with a pale and vacant face, replaced the letter in its envelope, and bent
                  himself forward over the task offered by his remaining correspondence.
               The next letter which this pallid and nervous man took up was hastily broken open
                  and read as follows:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 ALEX. HARSFORD, ESQ.,
                                 HARSFORD & CO., NEW YORK.
                              
                              DEAR SIR:
                           
                           Your favor of the 6th came duly to hand. I discounted the note you
                              sent up, and I send the $5,000 in small bills, by express this day, as
                              requested.
                           I have ten shares of our stock which I want to sell, if I can sell
                              well. Will you make me an offer? It will enlarge your line of discount, if you
                              take it. I will take good short paper, such as I can use here.
                           I have the honor to be,
                           
                              Yours, respectfully,
                              RICHARD GAULT,
                              Cashier Iroquois Bank.
                              Harsford's Mills, October, 1848.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "Selling out Iroquois, eh? That sounds bad. Gault must be looked to—Oh, stop; here
                  's a postscript."
               "P.S. The only reason I have for selling is that I have just learned from my
                  brother-in-law, at the West, that he has been burnt out, and no insurance; and he
                  wants me to lend him to rebuild. I am sorry to sell, for I never made a better
                  investment, but I must oblige him, and my stock is all the available funds I
                  have."
               "Brother?" soliloquized the merchant; "I never heard that Gault had any relatives.
                  He has n't, I know. Oh! Brother-in-law. Well—that may be so."
               He struck a pressure-bell that stood upon his desk, and at the sound, like a
                  wooden canary out of a Dutch clock, a clerk stepped forth from the door of the
                  outer room.
               "Sparaday," said Mr. Harsford, "here," and he held out the open letter. "Write to
                  Gault, 'Discount received, and I'll take his stock at ninety-four in note at three
                  months.'"
               "Yes sir," said the clerk, and bowed himself out.
               During all this time the merchant had not suffered his thoughts to return to the
                  dark subject which had for them so terrible an attraction. Although dreading a
                  strange crisis in his household, and already feeling its approaches,—although it
                  came by steps he could not as yet trace, and with claims he would not as yet
                  admit,—although thus struck through with the chilly terror of a disgrace he would
                  rather die than meet,—this man, so habituated to the tracks of business, so
                  intensive in the energy of his will, had vigorously repressed, though not quite
                  smothered, those strange and ominous perplexities under the lighter cares of
                  business. Behind his more active thoughts these never forgotten forebodings
                  followed, and the desperate energy with which he gave himself to the minutiæ of
                  affairs was even quickened by the pursuit of these shadowy terrors.
               In this mind he resumed the reading of his correspondence the instant Mr. Sparaday
                  left the room.
               The third letter, quickly opened and unfolded, ran as follows:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              HARSFORD'S MILLS, October 13th, 1848.
                              
                                 ALEXANDER HARSFORD, ESQ.,
                                 NEW YORK.
                              
                              SIR:
                           
                           Circumstances have just come to my knowledge which make me very
                              desirous to say to any friend of mine who is concerned in the Iroquois
                              Bank, "I advise you to sell out your stock." I have promised the
                                 cashier I will not say
                              more than this: this much I consider myself at liberty to say.
                           Although I can not claim the honor even of an acquaintance with
                              yourself, I say this to you because I hope one day to earn your
                              friendship.
                           I have understood you have something at stake in the Bank, and the
                              information I received only yesterday I now advise you of.
                           I am aware that a letter from a perfect stranger like me, and
                              conveying not facts but an opinion, possesses but little of that
                              weight which I am desirous to attach to my suggestion. Beyond my word
                              the only guarantee that I can add is that which I have mentioned.
                           I now expect to be in New York in a few days in search of employment
                              in business, and shall then desire your kind advice. I have thought
                              that if my opinion proves useful, I shall need no better letter of
                              introduction than this.
                           I am Sir,
                           
                              Very respectfully yours,
                              MATTHEW CARABY.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               The merchant having read this neat and careful letter, laid it down and amused
                  himself in drumming a little tune with his fingers upon the desk before him.
                  "That," said he, "is either plain truth or a plain hoax." In fact he was too
                  astute—too cunning to understand Matthew's bold, straight-forward appeal to
                  interested-motives. He thought it must be a hoax just because it seemed so honest,
                  for he was not very much accustomed to honest letters. "Truly," said he, bitterly,
                  "I am favored with unknown correspondents. I think I'll send this up to Gault and
                  see what he says to it. And the other"—he took up the first letter and turned it
                  over to hide that seal,—took it up again holding it as he would vermin to put it
                  away from him, hesitated, breathing fast and audibly, and finally put it in an
                  inner pocket of his wallet; then suddenly rose still breathing as before, and
                  lifted the windows and opened the counting-room door. He said it was close;—he
                  wanted more air. As he turned to his seat again, his eye caught the penmanship of
                  a familiar hand upon the envelope of the next letter. It was post-marked
                  Enneton.
               "From Jim," said the father, as he opened it.
               Thus wrote 'Jim.'
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              DEAR FATHER,
                           
                           Got here safely in due season, and started old Mr. Mayes off to the
                              lake the same day. I gave him your letter; he says it 's little use to
                              look again now; but I have talked it into him, and if any thing is to
                              be found he'll find it.
                           They 've invited me to stay a week here. But it 's too stupid for
                              that. I'll stay a day or two and try it. I do n't believe it will do
                              to stay long either for I gave my name as James Glovering; of course
                              it would n't be just the thing to say who I was exactly, except to the
                              old gentleman.
                           I expect I shall be back next week. I can't go over to the Mills for
                              Charlotte very well. She can go home alone just as well. She 's made the
                              journey a dozen times and I do n't know exactly when I shall want to
                              come.
                           
                              Your affectionate son,
                              JAMES GLOVERING.
                           
                        
                        
                           P. S. How do you like the name? I wish you could send me a little
                              money. I do n't want but a hundred this time. If possible send it by
                              return mail for I shall want to be off as soon as it comes."
                        
                     
                  
               
               At the first paragraph of this letter the merchant's countenance bespoke
                  satisfaction; at the second came a dubious smile accompanied by the paternal
                  remark, "Jim will get himself into some scrape yet; going about under assumed
                  names. But it 's just like him;" at the third paragraph came—a slight shade of
                  regret—and at the postscript a twinge of dissatisfaction. Let us not do the father
                  the injustice to say that he thought a hundred dollars too much. Nobody knew
                  better than Mr. Harsford that it cost something for a young man to keep up a
                  respectable appearance. "It can't be done," said the paternal heart, "without
                  money."
               Let us be thankful—in a parenthesis—that since Charity has gone out of fashion in
                  certain places, there is yet another cloak that will cover a multitude of sins. If
                  a young man can not keep up a respectable appearance without plenty of money, let
                  him have plenty of money by all means. In this point of view, what was
                  seventy-five or a hundred dollars a week to Mr. Harsford if it would make James
                  Glovering respectable? It was indeed but a drop, and although a constant dropping
                  will wear away a fortune, and Mr. Harsford's resources were under great pressure
                  this season, yet he was not the man to refuse this little favor. If he had been
                  asked for a day's personal care toward his son; if it had been a call to lay aside
                  business for an afternoon to spend a few hours in instructing or advising him; if
                  it had been an opportunity to sacrifice some self-pleasure for the sake of a good
                  influence upon his son, the result might have been different. But it was only a
                  hundred dollars, and although the merchant's balances were all the wrong way, and
                  his bank account very low, and he was "very short" as he expressed it to himself,
                  yet it was but to write his name; it was as easy as writing a letter; in fact the
                  easiest way of answering the letter which asked for it. But there was a stronger
                  reason than this. To refuse would imply inconvenience, inconvenience would suggest
                  pecuniary embarrassment. This would never do. It was altogether too near the
                  truth.
               With the merchant, extravagance was a policy; the outlays of an expensive
                  household were business expenses. Luxury and profuse hospitality were just as much
                  a part of the stock in trade of this speculator as any of the catalogue of
                  operations he had on hand. If one of his acquaintance were asked what was his
                  chief excellence, he would say, "He was a very liberal, freehanded man. He was one
                  of those noble little fellows to whom money was no object,—no object at all."
               This reputation Mr. Harsford had always labored for, since he knew that the only way for a poor man to
                  pass for a rich one was to persuade the world that money was no object to him.
               If there ever was a man to whom money was no object, it was Mr. Harsford. More
                  particularly, perhaps, other people's money. Thus the grand mahogany desk which
                  adorned his office, had been made to order regardless of expense. According to the
                  account-books it was made for Alexander Harsford, President of the Wilmerdingle
                  Gold Prospect Company; but according to the tenor of Mr. Harsford's conversation,
                  it was constructed at the sole expense of Alexander Harsford, Esq. And when some
                  one coming in said, slapping the desk approvingly, "Hallo, Alick, this is a great
                  one! What did you give for it?"—Mr. Harsford would say quietly, "Oh! about three
                  hundred. Money is no object you know, in getting a first rate article."
               So too when Exle, the great carriage dealer, who was a customer of the Bank of
                  which Mr. Harsford was an influential director, finding himself in need of large
                  and frequent loans, made Mr. Harsford a present of a silver mounted barouche which
                  would well outshine all the carriages of that director's acquaintances, he was
                  accustomed to remark to admiring and envious friends, that it was worth,—he did
                  not generally say what he gave for it,—that it was worth a thousand. 'That was a
                  good deal to give for a carriage, but then when one could get a first class
                  vehicle money was no object.'
               So also this very morning Mr. Harsford was thinking that it was now becoming
                  important that the Wilmerdingle dingle Company should employ a clerk; for
                  Alexander Harsford & Co. would like to have an additional clerk in the office
                  very much, especially if the Wilmerdingle would pay his salary, and perhaps allow
                  Alexander Harsford & Co. something, a little something for his desk-room,—he
                  must sit in the outer office, for it would be inconvenient to have him in the
                  Company's room. And if Mr. Harsford could find the right sort of young man for the
                  Company to employ, money,—that is the Company's money,—would be no object; no
                  object whatever.
               Mr. Harsford having therefore resolved to send his son the price of another week's
                  respectability, and having subsequently improved upon that resolution by
                  substituting bills of the suspected Iroquois Bank in place of a check, and having
                  further written a brief paternal note, unconsciously calculated to prove
                  encouragement, although written in the guise of expostulation, turned his
                  attention with renewed vivacity to the perusal of his further correspondence.
               The next letter was not a letter but a large package tied with red tape, the ends
                  of which ran into a small mass of sealing-wax.
               This package was addressed to:— 
                     "Alex. Harsford, Esq., "Pres't Wilmerdingle Gold Prospect Co.,
                        "New York City."
                  
               
               The President scowled at the "Wilmerdingle," and smiled at the "Gold Prospect Co," and disturbed
                  himself repeatedly in his seat as he commenced the examination of the contents of
                  this packet. He found within a bulky document accompanied by the following
                  letter:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "WILMERDINGLE, 5 Oct., 1849.
                              
                                 To the President and Directors Of the Wilmerdingle Gold Prospect Co.
                              
                              GENTLEMEN:
                           
                           I have the honor to lay before you herewith the annual report of your
                              secretary upon the business and the condition of the Company.
                           The unexampled prosperity of the affairs of the Company is a subject
                              of congratulation to which I may perhaps be allowed to refer with
                              pride. Such is the activity of business that my presence here is
                              indispensably requisite for some little time to come, and I shall
                              therefore be unable to be present at the approaching annual meeting. I
                              trust that the report will present in sufficient detail the
                              magnificence of our enterprise, and the incontrovertible evidence of
                              its now firmly established success.
                           
                              I am, gentlemen,
                              Your ob't serv't,
                              MERCURY CORNISH,
                              Sec'y Wilmerdingle Gold Prospect Co."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Despite his nervousness and the serious uneasiness which Mr. Harsford had
                  exhibited since commencing the perusal of his correspondence this morning, he
                  actually smiled as he read this letter;—a smile partly of amusement ment, partly
                  of admiration, partly of satisfaction; and he opened the long document which the
                  letter accompanied, saying:—
               "Well, that Cornish does understand things.
               "That report will read well in print," he added, as he glanced over its pages,
                  pausing here and there over some of the glowing passages in which were set forth
                  the marvelous richness of the Wilmerdingle Company's mines, the miraculous action
                  of its new machinery, and the fabulous profits of its business. "Yes," he
                  continued, "if we bring that out right, and manage the money editors*
                   well, I guess I can get the thing off my hands."
               
                  
                  *What a "money editor" may be, and what it may mean "to manage a money
                     editor," I am unable to explain.
               
               The reader would remain, I presume, quite in the dark as to why Mr. Harsford
                  should wish to get such an inconceivably profitable thing as the Wilmerdingle
                  Company off his hands, were it not that, falling from the folds of the report into
                  which it had got slipped, came another note addressed to the merchant, and marked
                     "Private." It was very short, and indicated haste in composition
                  as clearly as its companion did extreme care. It read as follows:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "DEAR A. H.
                           
                           "I called three times last week to see you. Three notes are due this
                              week, and the other directors say they can't do any thing about them
                              possibly, as they are in advance already. Unless you can get a meeting
                              before the 17th, you will have to take them up yourself. I hope you will be able to
                              provide for them, as they are only $7,000, and there is nothing more
                              due until the 1st of December, and we shall have time to turn round
                              before then.
                           
                              "Yours, etc.,
                              M. C."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "Well," said the merchant, as he laid away the report and the letter in a
                  pigeon-hole, and put the note in his wallet, "Well, we 'll attend to that pretty
                  soon. If the gentlemen of the Wilmerdingle do not stand by me I believe I shall
                  have to put the screws on them, for I believe I have the whip hand. However, I
                  think if we bring out that report well, I can get the whole thing off my hands. I
                  'm sorry I ever went into it, for it 's rather a small affair after all."
               As he said this to himself, Mr. Sparaday returned, bringing Mr. Gault's letter and
                  the reply which he had written, pursuant to the merchant's directions given a few
                  moments previous, as already mentioned.
               "Well!" said the merchant to himself, as he read again these letters. "Much
                  obliged to Mr. Caraby for the suggestion—whether he meant well or ill makes little
                  difference. If Gault wants to sell out that 's the very reason why we must not let
                  him. He must sink or swim with the rest of us. It can do no harm to look after
                  this Iroquois business."
               Upon this thought he directed a new note to be written to the cashier, declining a
                  bargain, and kindly consoling him with assurances that though he might from the
                  best of motives desire to sell, yet it would always be regretted if he should do
                  so.
               Mr. Harsford's further business this day will not much require our attention. It
                  is sufficient to say that the remainder of the forenoon he devoted to finishing
                  his correspondence, and to the pursuit of his legitimate business, from which he
                  arose in the afternoon apparently much cheered and enlivened, if not by the
                  success of his operations, at least by the respite which they afforded him from
                  the first perplexities of the morning. In secret truth, though he would not
                  confess it to himself, the merchant was much harassed by his affairs. The
                  vicissitudes of business and the obliquities of his nature had implicated him in
                  various sinuosities of dealings; these had brought their many and peculiar risks,
                  and under the spurs of such a driver as his position was, he had plunged more and
                  more deeply into the mire of secret dishonesty and unfaithfulness to trusts; until
                  now bearing the unquestioned reputation of honor and integrity, guaranteed before
                  society by the appearances of great wealth, he stood sinking in that slough which
                  has no bottom but in a penniless infamy. Goaded by his growing consciousness of
                  this state of things, the merchant turned restlessly from one task to another;
                  undertook every thing, accomplished nothing; schemed and planned every method of
                  escape, and achieved none. His vast embarrassments overshadowed his business, and
                  he groped as in the dark at his affairs, only bringing them into confusion. The
                  miserable expedients which he devised each day to stand between him and the
                  approach of a catastrophe he would not look at, instead of supporting him sunk
                  with him, involving more and more
                  widely the ruin of others in his own. Under this pressure he labored at all his
                  affairs in turn; at nothing long enough to arrive at any result, he started rashly
                  at every one, hesitated at every one, and left it in equal haste for another. Yet
                  these troubles were ease and comfort compared to that whose terrifying threats had
                  this morning been repeated. From those threats he had taken refuge in the sharp
                  perplexities of his business and found there a wretched relief.
               His mind continually reverted to the frank letter of Matthew and from that turned
                  to the question of the Iroquois Bank, and various contrivances for getting rid of
                  his stock before it should fail.
               It has often been observed by philosophers and others that there is nothing more
                  remarkable than the Association of Ideas. What, for instance, could be more
                  strange than that Mr. Harsford, from thinking of his Iroquois stock should
                  suddenly and without cause or suggestion turn to think of Widow Hopley's funds?
                  Philosophically speaking, I can discern no natural relation or affinity between
                  the nearly worthless scrip of a failing Bank, and the six thousand dollars which
                  the widow had deposited a few months ago with him for safe keeping until he could
                  find an investment safe, convenient, profitable, and in all respects suitable for
                  the sum total of the funds of an elderly lady who was quite alone in the world.
                  How it should happen that any idea having any bearing upon Iroquois stock should
                  even in the labyrinth which Mr. Harsford called his mind have any connection with
                  the idea of Widow Hopley or her money, is one of those questions which the
                  metaphysical reader may prefer to pursue according to his own favorite system of
                  analysis. But such was the case.
               Now it happened that Mr. Harsford had never yet been able to find a suitable
                  investment for the fund. In a great many calls which the widow made upon him, he
                  always said the difficulty was to place them securely.
               "There are plenty of risks," said he, "but not many safe investments. You would
                  rather have them at six per cent. and safe, than at ten per cent. and at a
                  risk."
               To this remark so appreciative of her feelings Mrs. Hopley always replied, "Oh
                  yes, indeed sir! for it 's all I have in the world sir, and I am getting old." And
                  she went away wondering whether it would not be best to prevail upon the merchant
                  to borrow the money himself and not run the risk of investing it; for as time
                  progressed and the investment seemed as far off as ever, the good lady began to
                  grow nervous lest there should be after all no earthly investment left for
                  her.
               It occurred to Mr. Harsford (and the suggestion seemed almost providential, for he
                  expected another call soon and had neither money nor security to show her) to
                  settle the Hopley account by investing in Iroquois Bank stock. In pursuance of
                  this thought Mr. Harsford, as agent of the old lady, estimated the value of
                  Iroquois stock at twenty dollars premium to the share; for, to Mr. Harsford as
                  agent of the old lady, money was no object.
               Since at that price what stock he had was not quite paid for by her fund, he made
                  out a note for the balance due him.
               
               The amount of the note was nearly three hundred dollars and payable on demand,
                  but, as he explained to her perfect satisfaction when she called the next day,
                  since the investment was first rate, of which the cashier's letter was proof, and
                  as he did not need the money immediately—it was no object to him whether it was a
                  month or a year—she could consult her own convenience about paying it;—or it could
                  lie until the next dividend upon the stock should be declared. For this Mrs.
                  Hopley was very grateful.
               Thus Mr. Harsford adjusted the Hopley account and the Iroquois stock account, and
                  had them balanced upon his books to his own profit and the widow's
                  satisfaction.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               JEWELS FOR THE RICH, FLOWERS FOR THE POOR; BUT BEAUTY FOR THE EYES
                  OF ALL.
               FROM the time of Matthew's final visit to Enneton, described in a preceding
                  chapter, he permitted no unnecessary delay in his preparations for leaving its
                  vicinity. Every hour that he spent in Harsford's Mills, was but so much addition
                  made to the ripeness of his pain and trouble. He was continually tormented by the
                  impracticable idea of revisiting Arabella, and repeating the interview of the
                  evening, though with hope of a happier result; and he felt he should not be safe
                  in temper nor comfortable in mind, until he was at a long distance from the scene
                  of that unfortunate dissension; until space as well as time should separate them
                  in outward life as effectually as Arabella's caprice and haughty bearing had
                  separated them at heart.
               Matthew did not know how evanescent was that caprice; that it had lived only upon
                  the resistance he had opposed to it;—how superficial was the revulsion of her
                  pride, wounded as much by the reproaches of her own heart as by the severity of
                  his words. Nor, alas! did Arabella know how deep and thorough a work that evanescent caprice, that superficial
                  pride of hers had accomplished. She had never understood that he, until he
                  commenced to learn of her, had scarcely known the idea of a true friend; that all
                  the experiences of his life had concurred in teaching him never to trust without
                  calculation, never to rely on the kindness of another unless he could discern the
                  selfish motive which might be depended on to prompt that kindness. She did not
                  understand that the affection he had cherished for her was not merely a new
                  preference, but a new feeling; the exercise of a capacity theretofore unknown
                  within him. Hence she did not understand that in the lesson of one brief hour she
                  had taught him to recant all that new faith which he had been so slowly learning;
                  that she had sent him back doubly a skeptic of the sincerity of love, and more
                  than ever a cold calculator of considerations and measurer of motives. She thought
                  she had offended him. He thought little of offense in the painful surprise of
                  being, as he imagined, undeceived. She would have had him return that she might
                  express her contrition for the unkindness of her behavior, and that she might win
                  his pardon. He would have returned, if he had returned at all, to tell her that he
                  had learned a lesson which must alter his course; that he had found that, being
                  without wealth or high position, he could not command the motives which would
                  govern her feelings; and that he hoped the ill success of his attempt would be
                  forgotten by her without pain.
               This however is perhaps a more distinct expression of his feelings than Matthew
                  himself could have given. He was conscious only of a mistrust in the reality of
                  disinterested affection, and of a chagrin that he had not more skillfully managed
                  those motives of Arabella by which he might have retained his place in her regard.
                  Predominant above these feelings, though vague and scarce even self-confessed,
                  there was yet a bitter pleasure in feeling himself free; and he took also a proud
                  satisfaction in recalling the circumstances of the interview to assure himself
                  that the separation was not by his act but by hers.
               A mind such as Matthew's, when brought under the excitement of such a
                  disappointment as his, seeks by a strong impulse, a new scene of life; and the
                  life of a great city has stronger attractions than any other. Matthew was not long
                  in resolving to try his fortune in the city of New York. He abruptly discharged
                  himself from Mr. Sackett's service, rejecting, without even respectful
                  consideration, an offer from that worthy merchant of a rise of a dollar a week;
                  and having written for himself and dispatched per mail a solitary letter of
                  introduction which has been already received and read in the reader's presence, he
                  one morning mounted the stagecoach at the door of the Harsford's Mills
                  Post-office, and took his seat behind the driver. The coach was already full
                  inside, but this made no difference to Matthew, who would have taken an outside
                  seat in any weather less unfavorable for open air riding than an actual rain
                  storm. The morning was clear and fine, and Matthew, elate with anticipations, felt
                  a peculiar satisfaction, as the stage rolled down the village street, in leaving
                  Harsford's Mills behind him; since he
                  had still all the world before him.
               Among other things before him, though not destined long so to be, was the
                  residence of Squire Harsford, whose roof,—the grand-paternal roof, so to speak, of
                  Miss Charlotte Harsford,—was at the moment visible through the trees.
               "Ha! The Squire's got his flag out," said the driver.
               "So he has," exclaimed Matthew. "I wonder who is going down."
               "Oh it's only some bundle or letter, most likely. I stop for something of that
                  sort more than half the time," replied the driver.
               This was so. The arrival of the stage, and its departure, twice every week, was
                  the chief event of life in the village of Harsford's Mills. Every body looked out
                  for the great lumbering red-bodied, rusty-topped, muddy-wheeled vehicle. Every
                  body knew when it went by. Every man had a nod for the driver; every woman had a
                  quick glance into the stage to see who the passengers were; every child, jumping
                  up from the road-way, had a round-eyed stare for the great destroyer of his
                  mud-built edifice; every dog, even, had a farewell bark for the horses as they
                  cantered out of town. This stage always passed the Squire's door on its way out of
                  the village; and frequently had occasion to stop there. So frequently, that at
                  length, the Squire, instead of sending up word to the office, or setting a watch
                  to run out and hail it as it passed, adopted the plan of affixing a little flag,
                  such as surveyors use, to the post at the corner of his door yard. The driver,
                  whenever he saw this flag out, stopped the stage, and received, sometimes
                  passengers, sometimes parcels, sometimes letters, sometimes little commissions to
                  execute in the neighboring city which was the other terminus of his journey. And
                  so often was he thus called upon to stop, that he was accustomed, in familiar
                  conversation with the stable boys, to call Squire Harsford's house "the down
                  street booking office;"—and from the patronage and business of the Squire's
                  household and their visitors arose no inconsiderable part of the revenues of the
                  stage proprietor.
               "A very good looking bundle it is, if you call it one," remarked an unknown
                  gentleman who sat next the driver, as the Squire came out of the front door,
                  leading upon his arm his fair granddaughter, who was evidently equipped for a
                  journey. The driver, as he stopped the coach, turned a glance of indifferent
                  contempt upon the speaker,—a stage driver never recognizes a joke unless it is
                  about horses,—handed the reins to Matthew, jumped to the ground and bowed
                  respectfully to the Squire. He was a fine-looking old man, tall, spare and erect,
                  and his full, white hair, which was yet as bushy as in youth, gave an expression
                  of vivacity and energy to his venerable countenance.
               The advocates of the doctrine of the hereditary transmission of moral qualities
                  have an ingenious way of disposing of the somewhat troublesome fact that some most
                  excellent men have very rascally sons, some women of genius very thick-headed
                  daughters, and vice versa; and their mode of
                  accounting for this circumstance is by
                  saying that the moral qualities of the descendant are in such cases received from
                  the grand parent; the immediate father or mother being only a sort of post-office
                  or express company by whom the qualities or endowments of the remoter ancestor are
                  transmitted to the grandchild. I presume that this class of philosophers will be
                  of opinion, when this history is fully before them, that Miss Charlotte Harsford
                  is a case in point for the application of this hypothesis, inasmuch as she
                  certainly partook much more of her grandfather's character than of her
                  father's.
               Be this as it may, the two now stood together side by side, the countenance of
                  each betraying an affectionate solicitude for the other;—his, for her comfort
                  while she should be on her journey; hers, for his health and happiness after she
                  should be gone. She knew not when she should greet him again, or whether she
                  should ever again see that white head erect in life and health. Busy with these
                  thoughts and with the preparations for her ride, it is perhaps not surprising that
                  she did not look up, and did not recognize Mr. Caraby, nor catch the bow and smile
                  and the salutation he had ready to launch forth the first moment he could catch
                  her eye.
               "James is not here," the old gentleman said to his granddaughter, after peering
                  through the stage windows as they approached it.
               "Is he not? Well! Then I must go alone. I did n't really believe he would
                  come."
               "I expected you 'd bring my grandson," said the Squire to the driver.
               "Have n't got him," said the driver with good-humored bluntness.
               He was a wonder of brisk strength, this driver, and had Miss Charlotte's big black
                  trunk up by one hand, swinging it about, anticipatory to strapping it upon the
                  rack.
               "Was the Enneton stage in before you came down?" asked the Squire. "My son, in New
                  York, wrote me that James was going on a fishing excursion up to the Lakes and
                  would come across from Enneton on his way back. He was to come this morning."
               "Yes, half my load are Enneton folks," said the driver. "We wait for them, you
                  know, till half past nine. That 's the contract. But I hain't seen any thing of
                  your grandson."
               "Never mind, grandfather," said Charlotte, in an under tone. "I can go alone just
                  as well as not."
               "You had better wait, my dear, had n't you? He will come,
                  certainly."
               "No," said Charlotte, "I think I had better go. I am not at all afraid,
                  grandfather."
               Then there was a consultation about seats. The old gentleman looked into the
                  coach, and the driver looked into the coach, and the young lady stood on tiptoe,
                  but could not very well look into the coach; and one gentleman passenger
                  magnanimously volunteered to get outside to make room for the lady, but did not
                  move an inch in pursuance of the offer; and then the young lady said something
                  more in an undertone to the old gentleman, and then they both looked up to the
                  top. Matthew, who had been leaning over
                  from his outside seat watching the scene below, suddenly straightened up, and
                  turned his head another way, and pretended to be very busy holding the horses very
                  hard. His first impulse indeed was to avail himself of that opportunity to give
                  the salutation he had been holding in readiness for the young lady, and to commend
                  the advantages of an outside seat on such a splendid morning; but in an instant he
                  imagined that if he did not attract attention she would get up; but
                  that if she were forewarned that by so doing she would seat herself by him for the
                  day she might hesitate. So he cunningly kept silence. Foolish fellow! To think
                  that his being there would make any difference!
               His suspense was short, for in a moment the young lady gave Grandfather her
                  parting kiss; three of them;—Matthew saw it done, out of the corners of his eyes,
                  the difficulty of holding the horses to the contrary notwithstanding;—and in a
                  moment more she was by Matthew's side on the broad seat behind the driver.
               I do not know why it is that the setting sun paints such gorgeous colors on the
                  western clouds, while the rising sun adorns so slightly the curtains of his
                  chamber;—nor do I know whether the Rev. Eleazar Williams was a Bourbon Prince in
                  disguise, or only a bona fide Indian
                  Missionary;—nor do I know who the man in the Iron Mask was, nor why Caspar Hauser
                  was denied the privileges of a common school education;—nor do I know why in New
                  England forests the moss always grows thickest on the North sides of the
                  trees;—and there are many other points of polite learning on which I am ignorant
                  norant. The candid reader will not be surprised therefore when I say frankly that
                  I do not know what conversation passed between Mr. Matthew Caraby and Miss
                  Harsford on their journey. This much I do know however, that from the style in
                  which, on arriving at New York, Matthew escorted his fair companion off the
                  steamboat, and handed her into a carriage, I formed the opinion that these old
                  acquaintances had become new friends.
               A day or two after Miss Harsford had returned from the country, as thus described,
                  she sate one morning at her bay window, amusing herself with her needle. Miss
                  Harsford's bay window was a large projecting window in her boudoir. Her apartments
                  were in the second story of her father's mansion,—an elegant edifice upon one of
                  the most fashionable streets in the city of New York,—and were in the rear of the
                  house, looking out upon a beautiful garden, which extended around and behind the
                  house. This garden was her especial charge and delight. From her bay window she
                  could survey this her province, and here she studied her improvements, planned new
                  paths, and imagined the effect of intended flower-beds; or, in another mood,
                  refreshed her eyes with the beauty of the scene, and inhaled the fragrance of her
                  flowers.
               When Mr. Harsford built the house the greater part of the block was vacant; and
                  although the neighborhood gave every promise of being aristocratic, yet to make
                  sure that he should have no disagreeable neighbors, he bought an additional lot upon each side of his
                  house. He would like he said, 'to own all the land next to him.' Imagine then his
                  dismay when, moving into his mansion, he found that the owner of two lots on the
                  other side of the block, fronting on the street below that in which Mr. Harsford
                  lived, and abutting in the rear upon one corner of his garden, had commenced the
                  erection of a lofty building with many stories and many windows which his
                  experienced eye at once recognized as a tenement house. Here then by one of those
                  strange contrasts which a great city exhibits in such numbers, luxury and poverty
                  were to stand over against each other. Wealth gathers herself up to stand aloof
                  from the touch of every strange neighbor, and scatters flowers and quickset hedges
                  on every side to screen herself from view; and forthwith Want huddles herself in
                  gaining shelter from the very walls built to exclude her, and matching the thorns
                  of her neighbor's hedge by the roughnesses and asperities by which her own life is
                  surrounded.
               Although Charlotte had at first echoed her father's expressions of dissatisfaction
                  at finding they were to have a tenement house in the otherwise elegant prospect
                  which their back piazza and windows afforded, yet she came, in course of time, to
                  feel an interest in its walls, dingy even in their newness;—in its many windows
                  through which she now and then caught glimpses of the homely life of the poor
                  tenants;—in its many stories and tedious flights of narrow, dark stairs, up which
                  the weary feet of the dwellers there climbed to gain their cramped homes;—in its
                  roof, so often bannered with white garments, drying ing in the sun and air. So
                  that, at length, although to the ordinary observer the prospect in that direction
                  from her windows was repulsive rather than attractive, there was no favorite
                  flower in all the grounds Charlotte overlooked, that gave her half the pleasure
                  she received from a little rose-bush which stood upon the sill of a small window,
                  far up under the eaves of that populous yet desolate building. Other windows were
                  obscured by dust and cobwebs, or disfigured by out-hanging garments, but there,
                  looking out from a little room at the top of five flights of steep stairs, were
                  two windows, always neat, one of which held the rose-tree and was also embowered
                  with a climbing vine. Both plants grew from the same handful of earth, contained
                  in a little wooden box. The vine, trained upon lengths of twine, was festooned
                  over the window, leaving the stem of the rose-bush standing in the middle, and
                  thus was formed a curtain, the only curtain which concealed from Charlotte's view
                  the little cot that stood against the window within. The other window was
                  uncurtained, even in so primitive a way. It was open this morning, and as
                  Charlotte was looking up towards it, a little head appeared at it. It was that of
                  a child who with a slow and gentle motion drew some seat within the room to the
                  window and sat down, looking out with a pale face but with a quiet and happy
                  expression upon the garden beneath him. He leaned forward a little, as if to gain
                  a better view, and examined the whole garden minutely, studying it with great
                  apparent interest, beginning at the most distant corner and scanning it round to
                  the nearest, as if he were the owner,
                  and were come to see what had been done during his absence. At length he leaned
                  back again slowly, as if fatigued, and rested his head against the corner of the
                  window post; turning away his face, as if speaking to some one within the
                  room.
               "Why! there's Benny!" said Charlotte, with surprise and pleasure. "Sitting up! How
                  glad I am,—poor little fellow! I 'll signal him."
               With these words the young lady went to her other room and brought out an ampelle
                  which was filled with flowers. This she hung in the open window by fastening it to
                  a cord which was suspended to the woodwork above for the purpose, and then,
                  drawing it to one side, she set it swinging back and forth, and stood watching for
                  the child's recognition. His face soon reappeared, and it was but a moment before
                  the signal was seen, for the child started forward with more energy than he had
                  yet displayed, and raised his thin hand which he waved gracefully in token of
                  response. Charlotte herself made no movement, but stood by the window where she
                  could just be seen by her little friend. In an instant after his recognition he
                  turned away again, as if to speak as before; and immediately Charlotte could
                  discern a figure unobtrusively standing back behind the boy and looking out
                  through the window. This figure was that of a woman. A small white shawl or scarf,
                  thrown over her shoulders and fastened in front, enveloped the bust, and the thin
                  face was surmounted by masses of black hair drawn straight down over the temples.
                  She did not approach closely to the window, but stood looking through it for a
                  moment from her position within the room, and then disappeared, leaving Benny
                  still waving his hand back and forth, keeping time with the oscillations of the
                  swinging vase of flowers. His countenance expressed a keen though quiet
                  satisfaction as he leaned his cheek against the window and continued gently
                  marking the time of the signal. Charlotte still stood by the curtain of her bay
                  window. It was certainly a smile which lighted up her beautiful features, yet it
                  was a sad smile, for her blue eyes glistened with sympathy for her puny neighbor.
                  There was something singularly touching to her in the happiness which it conferred
                  upon the poor boy to see that she was at home again, and to know that she thought
                  of him. He sought nothing beyond this knowledge. He made no signal which could
                  bear any meaning to her eye. The one simple message of the swinging flowers was
                  recognition by a kind heart; and that was enough for him. It filled him with
                  happiness.
               But before the ampelle lost its momentum, the feeble hand grew weary, and ceased
                  its synchronal movement; and the child sat still, looking at the bay window, and
                  now and then at the garden beneath, refreshing himself with the air and the
                  sunlight.
               His friend across the garden stood between the curtains of her bay window. She was
                  very simply yet elegantly dressed; and her fine form and ruddy face, slightly
                  browned with exposure to the summer sun and the zephyrs of Harsford's Mills,
                  glowing with health and now illuminated with the light of her kind sympathy for
                  little Benny, made her appear beautiful indeed.
               
               While Charlotte, the daughter, stood enjoying, almost unconsciously, the pleasure
                  she had thus conferred, the door of the parlor opened, and Mrs. Harsford, the
                  mother, entered. Her step, noiseless upon the thick carpet, failed to attract the
                  ear of her daughter, intent upon the window opposite; and she herself, seeing
                  Charlotte standing in this attitude of attention, paused a moment before
                  speaking.
               At length she said:—
               "Arlie!"
               "Ah! mother," said the daughter, turning and stopping the signal with one hand as
                  she turned, "I am glad to see you." And she drew up an easy chair to the window,
                  for her mother, and sat down herself upon an ottoman, by her side. "It is pleasant
                  to be at home again. How well the garden looks."
               Her mother looked out.
               "Yes," she said,—in the tone of one weary of a long discussion of the point, and
                  willing at last to admit it for the sake of peace.
               "Why, beautifully, mother! That wisteria in the corner there, must have looked
                  magnificently when in flower. It has grown very high. See, it 's almost as high as
                  the second row of windows over the fence."
               "I 'm sure I wish it was seven times as high again, to cut off those barracks
                  altogether. I do n't see why you like these rooms so much. I could n't endure
                  them, looking out in that direction. I should think you 'd prefer the front room
                  up stairs. Those people have no business to overlook us in this way. You do
                     n't think
                  they overlook us any more than we overlook them? Oh yes they do. You
                  may be sure they do. You 've been away so long you do n't remember how it is. Why
                  they overlook us all the time; positively all the time. Why I do n't suppose I
                  ever look over to the house without seeing some frowsy head or other looking
                  directly down into our garden; and I suppose I look out first and last twenty
                  times a day. I 'm sure I think it 's a shame the place was ever built. You
                     suppose the poor people must live somewhere? Yes, I suppose they must. I
                  'm willing they should live, I 'm sure. They may live any where they choose if
                  they can pay their rent. Every body has a right to live wherever they can afford
                  to. Of course I understand that my dear. I was n't disputing that in the least,
                  was I? I 'm sure I did n't intend to. But what I say is this, that when there are
                  so many other parts of the town so much better adapted to that class of people,
                  they ought not to be allowed to disfigure such a block as this. The government
                  ought to interfere. You think we ought to make the best of things?
                  That's just like you, Arlie, you always have something to say about making the
                  best of things. If I only had your temperament I would be as contented as you are;
                  a great deal more so, for I 'm sure you have every thing to make you happy, plenty
                  of money, books, a good house, and you have the best rooms in it, too, I think,
                  and I've told your father so half a dozen times. But at my age one can't always be
                  making the best of things. Besides, I do n't think it 's our duty. We all have our
                  trials of some sort or another. I think it 's intended we should have our trials. And when we have a trial we
                  ought to take it for a trial and let it do us good,—though what good that hornet's
                  nest of a house over there does me, I'm sure I can't tell,—and not go about making
                  the best of things and pretending we have no trials. I think it 's flying in the
                  face of Providence to refuse to be tried when He sends afflictions. Besides, you
                  do n't know what a trial it is to me. When you are my age you will value
                  retirement, privacy, more. Now you are all curiosity. What I want is to live
                  retired. Not that there 's any thing to be ashamed of in the way we live. Quite
                  the contrary, and I am as willing as any one to have our friends see our style of
                  housekeeping, and even to show them over the house and grounds. But I want to
                  enjoy privacy in my own apartments. My room does n't look out on the
                     garden? No, that 's very true. That's just what I say. I could n't bear
                  these rooms on that very account. No, those people can't look in at my windows I'm
                  happy to say. And I do n't want to see any thing of them. You think if we
                     did not see such people we should n't know any thing about them? That's
                  just what I say. You are all curiosity. Girls at your age always are. What you
                  want is to know about their affairs. Now I respect their privacy. I think we ought
                  to. They have their feelings just the same as we do, and we ought not to pry into
                  their concerns. We should n't want them inquiring into our affairs, and we ought
                  not to inquire into theirs. Besides, you can't really know any thing about people
                  just by living next them. You can learn a great deal more about such people by
                  reading the newspapers than you can any other way. I always read the newspapers on
                  that very account,—when I have time. But what do you know about any of those
                  people? Take your washerwoman there, for instance. You do n't know any thing about
                  her. You can't. You know she is poor, and has a sick child? Of
                  course. Any body could know that, just by looking in at her windows. But you do
                  n't know any thing about her private affairs. I could find out, if I once saw her.
                  I 've often thought I 'd go round some time and question her. You are going
                     to see her? It won't do any good. I 'll get the whole story from her,
                  though, some day, you may be sure, just to show I can make charitable visits as
                  well as any body. There's something wrong about her case, that I
                  know. What does she say her name is? Alfene Temple? Now did you ever
                  hear such a name as that? It can't be her true name. They never give washerwomen
                  such names as that. Besides, she 's not a washerwoman, in my opinion, she 's
                  something else in disguise. I told your father so, and he quite agreed with
                  me."
               "How is father this fall?" asked Charlotte, knowing by experience how
                  easy it was to divert the current of her mother's conversation. "Seems to me he
                  does n't appear to be well."
               "He is not well, I believe. He says it 's business; but
                  I think he 's ill. He can't eat, and he can't sleep, and he can't go away, and
                  when he does go, he can't stay long enough in one place to get rested. Either he
                  's sick, or he's got something on his
                  mind that's worse; though he says not. Can't we do something to cheer him
                     up? I don't know I'm sure. I do n't know what we could do. I should like
                  to do something to cheer him up, very much. I need something done for my own
                  health and spirits too. Besides it 's extremely uncomfortable to have one of the
                  family get run down as your father is. But what can we do? Get up an
                     enthusiasm about something and get him interested? Yes, but
                     what? I can't think of any thing—unless it's a party. That
                     would n't do at this season? I do n't know. Yes, I think that might do.
                  Yes! Capitally! It's just the right time. Throw open the house and the gardens!
                  Illuminate the garden! Have a band of music in the summer house! And pass round
                  refreshments out of doors. Every body is out of town? Oh! no. Not
                  every body. A good many have got back. And besides, they would come into town to
                  come. We could have a thousand people here, just as well as not; yes, fifteen
                  hundred. That's a bright thought of yours Arlie;—a bright thought."
               "But it would cost a great deal, mother," suggested Charlotte, by way of
                  remonstrance. She seemed not to relish either the bright thought, or the idea of
                  having it attributed to her as its originator.
               "Yes I know—but then if it would only do your father good, we ought to be willing
                  to sacrifice something. I am always willing to make sacrifices for the family. Of
                  course my first duty is to consider your father's health."
               And Mrs. Harsford went on to amplify the details of the project, and opened the
                  bay window to get a better view of the garden for the purpose of imagining more
                  vividly how it would look illuminated and filled with music and promenaders; and
                  from thence she went down stairs and thereafter resolved herself into a committee
                  of arrangements on the subject of giving a grand party at an expense of two or
                  three thousand dollars, for the purpose of relieving the business anxieties of her
                  unhappy husband.
               For some days indeed the considerate wife succeeded in exciting a great enthusiasm
                  in her own mind upon the subject, whatever sentiment may have been aroused in the
                  breast of Mr. Harsford; and if it were indeed true that her own health and spirits
                  only required the stimulus of a new subject of interest and enthusiasm to raise
                  them from their state of despondency, it is probable that they were elevated to
                  the highest pitch. The benefit was not permanent however, for after a few days of
                  garrulous gossip with every one of whom she could make a listener, her enthusiasm
                  collapsed, she cast the whole responsibility of the plan upon her daughter, and
                  went about bewailing that she could have no real help from her family, even in her
                  best contrived plans for their own benefit.
               As for Charlotte, she listened most patiently to her mother's plans and projects;
                  interposed most sensible suggestions and advice, which were most coolly put aside
                  and rejected; and moreover devoted herself during the few days of her mother's
                  zeal, to performing the numerous errands, and making the very considerable
                     number of purchases to which the
                  project while yet in embryo gave rise. In the end she accepted with an
                  unprotesting and 
                     cheeful
                     cheerful
                   grace, the burden of responsibility which her mother chose to cast upon
                  her.
               As for Mr. Harsford, I do not know whether he ever knew what was going on. I do
                  not believe he did.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               YOUR TRAP MUST BE LARGER THAN YOUR GAME.
               IF the reader had happened, by any chance, to have been standing, on the morning
                  of a certain day of November, 1848, upon the glowing surface of the Sun, he might
                  probably have seen a small company of rays of light, as they started upon a short
                  pleasure excursion of ninety-five millions of miles or so, to the Earth. These
                  rays traversing space with incredible velocity, reached in the short period of
                  about eight minutes, the place of their destination, a certain steamboat wharf on
                  the bank of the Hudson river in the city of New York. There arriving they fell, as
                  fate would have it, upon the person of Mr. Matthew Caraby then standing upon said
                  wharf, and in the act of bowing a farewell to Miss Charlotte Harsford as her
                  carriage drove off up the pier. They,—the rays not Mr. C. and Miss H.—were
                  shattered into fragments, naturally enough, by their fall from so great a
                  distance; and many of them rebounding fell upon the eyes of certain by-standers,
                  where, finding cameras and other daguerrian instruments ready to their hands, they
                  proceeded to take daguerreotypes of Mr. Caraby.
               In other words Mr. Caraby was seen standing on the steamboat wharf, bidding Miss
                  Harsford good-bye.
               
               From receiving Miss Harsford's courteous thanks for his politeness to her while on
                  her journey, and from bidding her good-bye through the carriage window, and from
                  bowing his farewell, Matthew turned around and stepped back from the wharf on
                  board the boat again, showing no outward token of taking any further thought of
                  his fair companion; yet bearing, I imagine, in undisclosed thought, a certain
                  recollection of a smile and tone not readily to be dismissed from mind. Being
                  again on board he possessed himself of his valise, and, therewith accompanied,
                  deposited himself in a great hack labeled "PEARL STREET HOUSE," and in due course
                  of time was deposited with other passengers and their baggage, at that place of
                  entertainment.
               In its palmy days the old Pearl Street House looked out upon the very center and
                  focus of business, although in the changes which Time has wrought, the penumbra of
                  business has now enshrouded it. The old hotel itself has gone up in smoke, and for
                  aught I know its proprietor may have gone down in ashes long since. At the time of
                  which I speak it was yet a thriving hotel, prominent among the great hotels of the
                  day. To live at such an institution was an extravagance which Matthew would have
                  resolutely avoided, but he had a business instinct which brought him there for a
                  day or two, as a good place "to hail from;" and accordingly, there was his name
                  upon the hotel register, in a bold hand, with a fearless cross through both the
                  "t's", and an indisputable period at the tail of the "y."
               Whether it was either of these features of the autograph graph, or the addition of
                  "Harsford's Mills" in the right hand column, or some other cause that rendered the
                  name striking to a reader, I do not know; but so it seemed to be to a gentleman
                  who sauntered up to the desk, about half an hour before dinner time, to spend a
                  few leisure moments in studying the register. He was a stout, well-built man,
                  glossily dressed, and embellished with an admirable beard, the credit of the
                  amplitude of which belonged undoubtedly to Nature, while the praise of its glossy
                  blackness was as undeniably due to Art.
               As this gentleman is one of a large family whose members any stranger may meet in
                  the city, the reader will naturally expect a formal introduction.
               There exists in our great commercial cities a class of persons peculiarly
                  compounded of elegance and iniquity. They are gentlemen without,—jail birds
                  within. It is their profession to instruct in vice. They earn a livelihood by
                  acting as guides at the gates of Death. As Religion maintains ministers of purity
                  and truth to recall the wandering into paths of peace, so does Commerce support an
                  infernal priesthood to entice the weak into wickedness. The unsophisticated and
                  wondering country merchant who, having found himself somewhat at home among the
                  respectable attractions of the city, begins to feel a curious desire to witness,
                  at a careful distance, some of the wonderful wickednesses of a fermented
                  community, does not fully understand how this weakness of his nature has been
                  reckoned up and calculated upon by the eminently respectable head of the jobbing
                  house with which his principal dealings are had; nor that it is conceded among many merchants that
                  the easiest way to obtain a good run of custom is by providing ample facilities
                  for the demoralization of the customers; that to insure patronage one must attempt
                  to ruin the patrons.
               The man who now stood reading the hotel register was a guide and showman of
                  immoralities, one of those professors of iniquity whose employment has become so
                  common in the rivalries of trade. He was exclusively employed and well paid by a
                  large dry-goods house; and the duties of his position well suited his indolent and
                  licentious nature. All the patrons of his house who were approachable by motives
                  of immodest curiosity and appetite were turned over to him for their amusement. At
                  the store he filled any function which for the time suited this purpose. Sometimes
                  he officiated as salesman, sometimes sat as a clerk in the counting-room,
                  sometimes passed for one of the firm to show a stranger over the establishment and
                  invite him to dinner and the theater, sometimes he contrived to be taken for a
                  gentleman of leisure and genial companionship, who was delighted to extend the
                  hospitalities of the city to a friend of his friends. The assuming of these
                  characters was the task of his business hours; his evenings and nights were less
                  irksome. Since his influence commanded so much patronage the doors of all places
                  of amusement were freely open to him. The brilliant halls of revel and the
                  chambers of darker vice welcomed him freely; and from the theater down to a Five
                  Points ball; from those mirrored palaces where the manners of vice are sometimes
                  refined into a heartless semblance of propriety lest profitable new-comers should
                  be shocked instead of allured, down to the vilest den of Orange Street, where
                  fallen humanity at its lowest degradation, and with its last breath, exhibits
                  itself to the curious eye of those who would shrink fearfully from its touch; from
                  the first haunts of folly down to the last retreats of crime, this man was a
                  familiar and a welcome visitor. More respectable institutions recognized his
                  influence and bowed to his favor. The great hotels looked to him for friendly
                  recommendations, and in return for his occasional visits always presented him with
                  receipted bills; and the most expensive restaurants were more than repaid by his
                  companions for all the dinners they gave to him.
               All this was well understood by his respectable employers. But there was a coil in
                  his wickedness of which they did not know. He often diminished the contents of
                  their customer's purse as much by play as they did by business. They expected him
                  to run the round of the cheaper vices, but they did not know that the center of
                  that circle was gambling; that which is at once the meanest and most extravagant
                  of all.
               Take him all together this man was, and still is for aught I know, one of the most
                  utter scoundrels that ever wore broadcloth and velvet. He was commonly known and
                  looked up to as a master by all of his companions in the profession; and the neat,
                  dexterous swindling that he accomplished was confidentially whispered around among
                  a circle of imitators, with admiring criticisms.
               This man going his accustomed rounds in search of confiding strangers, now nodded to the clerk with
                  familiarity and scanned the list of the day's arrivals.
               While he was so engaged, Matthew, it happened, approached the desk and asked the
                  clerk:—
               "Can you tell me if there is a line of stages that go up to Hudson street?"
               "Yes, what part of the street do you wish to go to?"
               "None in particular. I—I should like to go through the street. I wish to look for
                  a boarding place."
               "Ah!" said the clerk. "Go right up Fulton street to Broadway. Take a white stage
                  marked 'GREENWICH AND CHELSEA' in red letters;—the Kip & Brown stage. Tell the
                  driver to stop at the corner of Canal and Hudson street. Then you can go either up
                  or down. Or you can stay in the stage and ride up through Hudson street."
               "Pardon me, sir!" interposed the black whiskered man at Matthew's side, addressing
                  the clerk, but speaking with a bow and smile to Matthew, which directed at least a
                  third of the speaker's words to him. "Is your friend a stranger in the city?"
               "Yes," said the clerk, "I believe so."
               This man, so elegant in his rich dress and shaggy beard, spoke in a clear,
                  deliberate, straight-forward way, and with a tone slightly English in its
                  distinct, yet quiet enunciation. His manner excited Matthew's respect and elicited
                  from him a bow that meant "I am very happy to have an opportunity of conversation
                  with so respectable a citizen of New York."
               "In that case," said the stranger, turning slightly towards Matthew and speaking
                  with another bow and smile which addressed another third of his words to him, "I
                  hope he will pardon the interest which I express when I suggest that he runs some
                  risk in going out in search of a boarding place in a strange street, and without
                  guidance or direction. It would be well for him to take some acquaintance with him
                  in exploring for such a purpose."
               "Undoubtedly, sir," replied Matthew, "but to me the people are all stranger than
                  the streets. What would you do, sir, in that case?"
               "I am making very free upon short acquaintance," said the stranger, addressing
                  himself now at least nine-tenths to Matthew, "but if I were you I would stay here
                  until after dinner, and then if you will accept my company for a walk up Broadway
                  and across, I will put you in the way of seeing Hudson street to advantage, and
                  post you up a little as to the New York boarding houses, on our way. You can't be
                  too careful in the matter of choosing a home. Many a young man who came to New
                  York with good prospects owes his failure and ruin to the counsels of bad
                  companions at his boarding place; and there are a great many tricks and traps for
                  strangers in the boarding-house business."
               "Of all things what I should like the best," cried Matthew. "To be as free as
                  yourself on short acquaintance, I like your ideas. I should like to take a walk
                  with you up Broadway very much."
               "I can show you more in two hours than you could learn by yourself in a month,"
                  said the stranger, with the air of an expert.
               
               "That's so!" ejaculated the clerk. "He's the best fellow to show you round that
                  you can find. He knows all the ropes. He does."
               It was hardly true, this last admiring remark of the clerk. Mr. Arent, by which
                  name the stranger was known, did not know all the ropes. There was
                  one rope that he had not yet learned.
               Matthew and Arent took dinner side by side, at the public table. The gambler, to
                  whom almost every scene of city life was trite and threadbare, and devoid of
                  excitement, took a keen delight in the excitement of gaining the confidence of a
                  shrewd Yankee boy, and trying upon him his powers. Mr. Arent 
                     expecetd
                     expected
                   no pecuniary reward for these labors. He would not have expended a
                  dollar in ensnaring Matthew; but as the sportsman, disappointed in game, will
                  sometimes wind up the afternoon with firing at a mark, so this blackleg, having no
                  important end in view, was pleased to waste an afternoon in practicing upon our
                  hero. And this shows the fallacy of the adage—"Time is money." Time is money, by
                  one argument, it is true; they will both pass. But in every other point of view
                  they are quite different, and men draw most important distinctions between
                  them.
               At the dinner table the two new acquaintances conversed, with scarcely a pause.
                  Arent sounded the principles and the ambitions of the young man as well as he
                  could, though with imperfect success, for Matthew, although he did not distrust
                  his new companion as yet, had an instinct which preserved an impassable barrier
                  between his inmost thoughts and free conversation.
               "You come from the country?" said the gambler, as the couple sauntered up the
                  street after dinner.
               "Yes."
               "What part of the State?"
               "Near Enneton."
               "Enneton?"
               "Not from Enneton;—from Harsford's Mills, near there."
               "Harsford's?"
               "Why!" said Matthew, struck with his companion's apparent surprise, "have you ever
                  been there?"
               "Oh no! It was only the name that struck me."
               "Do your parents live there?" inquired he.
               "I have none," answered Matthew. "That is, my mother died when I was very young,
                  and my father has been gone ever since then. I suppose he has forgotten all about
                  us before this time."
               A desperate scheme came into the head of the gambler. He looked furtively at
                  Matthew, scanning the expression of his face as he spoke to him.
               "It is wonderful how many ways there are to make a fortune in New York, easy."
               "Is it?" said Matthew, glad to come to a subject in which he was so much
                  interested.
               "Ways without number;—and yet it's wonderful how many poor fools drudge and drone
                  along as honest as dogs, and as wretched as dogs, too, and dare n't lift a finger
                  to help 'emselves."
               
               "I expect a man needs some spirit to succeed here."
               "Yes," returned the other. "A man must be ready to trade for his head once in a
                  while. You've got to do it. It's the way they do business here. Every body
                  does."
               "Trade for his head?" repeated Matthew, inquiringly.
               "Yes, trade for his head, or any thing else he's got. If a man is n't afraid, he
                  can make money fast enough. I helped a fellow to make five hundred dollars or so
                  in a couple of days, last week. Easy as death."
               "How?"
               "Well, he was hard up. He's a very good fellow, but he has n't the genius that
                  some have. Now I should dare bet you were five times as smart as he, but I showed
                  him how to make five hundred in a couple of days; yes, and double it in the
                  evening. It was pretty neatly done, too. I 'll tell you how. He was short—he
                  actually had n't a red left, and he came to me and says, 'Arent, what the devil
                  shall I do?' Those were his exact words," added the gambler, interrupting himself
                  apologetically. "'Well,' said I, 'do n't swear so, and I 'll tell you.' So I said
                  to him, now advertise in to-morrow's paper that you have a nice business for sale;
                  shop, fixtures and stock, or would take a partner; say the stand is first rate and
                  the business genteel. 'What business?' said he. 'Never mind,' I told
                  him. 'Do as I say; there's time enough to fix the business afterwards.' So I gave
                  him a half dollar, and the next day he came to me with a half a dozen letters
                  asking interviews to inquire about the business. Some of them were at hotels.
                  'There,' said I, 'those fellows are strangers in town, looking for business. They
                  are bonâ fide; always deal bonâ fide when you can; that's my rule. Now,' said I,
                  'Flaggerby,' that is his name. 'Now Flaggerby, go and see each of those fellows
                  that are stopping at hotels, and find out what kind of light business they prefer.
                  Tell them the business you advertised was a cigar store, but you have also a—say a
                  genteel bar, and a part interest in a drug store. You understand—you want to
                  dispose of one, or take a good partner, because you can't attend to all
                  three."
               "But he had n't any such thing," said Matthew; "had he?"
               "Oh not too fast; it all came true enough before next day. Said I, 'find out what
                  they want and how much they want to pay, and make an appointment to meet them
                  to-morrow and go and see the place. Mind and name different hours.' So pretty soon
                  he comes back and says he has made two appointments to see the cigar store. One
                  was a Connecticut gentleman, and one was a sea-faring man. The next thing I made
                  him do was to fly round and find a man in that business that would sell out. He
                  ran about all the afternoon and he found several. One of 'em wanted two hundred
                  and fifty dollars; his stock was low,—lots of boxes and precious few weeds,—and it
                  was near quarter day. Flaggerby got his offer to sell in writing. 'That place,'
                  said I, 'Flaggerby, is worth a thousand dollars clear to any strange gentleman
                  that wants a business,' (I knew the place.) 'You must take one of those fellows
                  equal partner for five hundred dollars,
                  and bring him to me to draw your papers.' You know I'm a bit of a lawyer. So sure
                  enough he brought Jack Tar to me and said, 'I've taken this gentleman into
                  partnership and we want your professional assistance to draw the papers.' So I
                  drew the contract, and put in this clause, that if either party should become
                  dissatisfied, he should buy out the other at a fair valuation. Well, they had n't
                  been together twenty-four hours when Flaggerby gets the new partner into a raging
                  passion at some little trifle. The new partner swore he would n't be imposed on,
                  and that the store was n't worth half what he gave. Flaggerby told him that was a
                  matter of opinion, and he was in for it now, it could n't be helped, and he could
                  n't be got rid of. So they came to me as a fair man to decide the question. I
                  asked them who was dissatisfied, and they said it was the new partner. I told them
                  the articles provided for that case, do you see, and that Flaggerby was bound to
                  sell out to him. Flaggerby pretended he did n't want to sell, but finally Jack
                  Tar, who said he was bound to be out of the scrape, paid him three hundred dollars
                  to get rid of him. We made—that is Flaggerby did—five hundred dollars on that job,
                  besides expenses."
               "Well, but how did he double it in the evening?" asked Matthew, desirous to hear
                  the end of the story, and restraining his indignation.
               "Oh! easy as turning over your hand; I told him how. You see he called for me that
                  night to go round with him. He felt under some obligations to me for having set
                  him up, and he said he would stand treat. Well, we went all around to all the
                  fancy places just to see what was going on."
               "Fancy places?" asked Matthew.
               "Yes. We had some fun that night;—but I was going to tell you. We stopped at
                  Dyce's place. There were some gentlemen playing eucre there—cards you know,—and we
                  were looking on. I know Dyce, and I winked to him and nodded toward my friend. He
                  took the hint and gave me a cue. So I told Flaggerby how to stake his money; he
                  was going to bet,—and he won of course; he could n't help it. Oh it 's easy enough
                  for a sharp-sighted man to make money, if he is n't afraid; but for a poor devil
                  who sticks up his back at a shadow and dare n't hazard himself once in a while
                  when he has a good chance,—there's no room for such fellows here. They never earn
                  beef till they 've no teeth left to eat it with. There are two kinds of people
                  that have no business in New York: poor folks and straight-laced folks. If they
                  were all off the track, the enterprising men here would have it all their own
                  way."
               Matthew shrank at these words,—though more from the conception of society they
                  presented than from the thorough depravity they revealed in the speaker. He still
                  felt a certain fascination in the conversation of this man, and continued in his
                  presence and prolonged the conversation, as one exploring some strange building
                  might linger peering through a trap door into dark vaults he would not enter. With
                  this feeling Matthew continued the dialogue.
               
               "Well, I for one am going to make or break. I have no money to lose," added he by
                  way of caution to the enterprising mind of his companion, "but I only want a fair
                  chance."
               Arent walked on in silence; he was hesitating whether Matthew would prove
                  sufficiently pliable to serve as a tool in a nefarious scheme in which he wished
                  the assistance of a stranger. He spoke.
               "The way is to find out the want of somebody who has money—some great want I
                  mean—and make them pay well for supplying it. That 's the best business."
               "That 's very simple," said Matthew, "for instance the grocery business. Every
                  body wants groceries."
               "That 's too small a scale altogether. There are bigger wants than that. The fact
                  is every one of these rich fellows sets his heart on having something extravagant.
                  Every one of them has a weakness of one sort or another; and all you have to do is
                  to find out their weakness, and then you have 'em. Now I know a gentleman rich as
                  you please, he 's got a singular want. He wants a son. Very singular!"
               "Why that 's not so strange," said Matthew, laughing. "If I were rich—"
               "Ah but he 's got one, and a daughter too—fine children; splendid wife! He wants a
                  son that he thought he lost twenty years ago. He would give any thing I believe to
                  find that son, and yet he would n't dare to own him!"
               "No?" said Matthew.
               "Not he. Family reasons I suppose. Now the right young man who should come along
                  and have pity on him and say poor old governor—I 'll be a son to him, perhaps he
                  is n't my father, but then again perhaps he is—who knows?—stranger things have
                  happened—here he is pining away for want of a son,—I can set him up straight;—why
                  the old gentleman would do any thing for him. Support him traveling in Europe, or
                  set him up in the hide business in South America. Any thing he wanted, the right
                  young man might have, by just showing himself."
               "But why does he want to find him if he would n't own him?"
               "Ah! there 's the point—there 's the mystery of it," said Arent, speaking
                  softly.
               "I do n't understand why."
               "No, I should not think you would. It 's a long story. That would be a very nice
                  affair for the right young man to take hold of—"
               "I beg you will excuse me," broke in Matthew suddenly, and starting at the same
                  time toward the edge of the sidewalk. "Excuse me, I 'll see you in the morning. I
                  must—"
               The rest of his words were lost to Arent's ear as Matthew darted off into the
                  middle of Broadway and disappeared among the carriages. The gambler instinctively
                  put his hands to his pockets at this strange disappearance as if accustomed to be
                  suspicious of the light fingers of his companions, but the act reminded him he had
                  had nothing in them all day, and he felt reassured. He hastened after Matthew, and
                  by hurrying forward caught one glimpse
                  of his retreating form among the vehicles. He appeared to be running behind a
                  covered cart, aiding his speed by holding on to the end of the body. Thus running
                  he in a moment disappeared entirely from the gambler's sight.
               It would seem that the loss of Matthew's companionship must have been the
                  slightest of losses to such a man as Arent. Yet he bore it hardly. He stood upon
                  the curb-stone resting one hand upon a lamp-post, while he gave a stamp of
                  vexation upon the stone beneath him; and he scowled without while he swore within.
                  He was one of those men of strong ungoverned will and temper who will not submit
                  to be defeated in a purpose, however trivial. Besides he was in reality somewhat
                  disappointed. His ambition outran the short and humble course of his profession.
                  He had in hand great and delicate business, and for some reason best known to
                  himself, and which with us must be at most a matter of conjecture, his ready mind,
                  quick to avail itself of every advantage, calculated upon drawing some assistance
                  from Matthew. Already had he in imagination connected this young man, so earnest,
                  so ambitious, so unsuspecting, so ready to be bought by a pecuniary success, with
                  his weighty plans. So sudden, so capricious a departure, was vexatious indeed.
               His disappointment however was destined to be soon forgotten. Just as he was
                  deluding himself with the idea that Matthew could be easily found at the hotel
                  again that night or the next morning, an expectation which seems reasonable, yet
                  which was destined to be disappointed through the occurrence of events soon to be
                  narrated, his attention was attracted by seeing, among the crowd of vehicles in
                  the street, a horse drawing a slight buggy, approaching. This buggy, fitted to
                  carry two persons, was now occupied by only one; a young man of slight stature and
                  effeminate frame, who sat in a careless, stooping attitude. He had a cigar in his
                  mouth, and leaning between his knee and the seat of the carriage was a slim cane
                  with a fox's head. The young man was threading his way up Broadway, in careless
                  style, now trotting his horse a few steps, then walking, then stopping, then
                  backing or turning short aside to avoid a collision. Mr. Arent smoothed his
                  ruffled features into a facetious expression, and leaning forward, swinging
                  himself around by the lamp-post, and holding up one finger to attract the young
                  man's attention, exclaimed,—"Hi! Ride hup! Broadwhay! Ride hup!"
               At this humorous salutation, Mr. James G. Harsford, alias James Glovering, looked around. The two men greeted each other
                  with a loud laugh; and in a moment more Arent was in the seat by the young man's
                  side.
               Then commenced a dialogue which was as long as from the corner of Broadway and
                  White street, where they started, to Bloomingdale, where they supped and turned
                  around. The monotony of the ride was relieved by the various stoppages they made
                  for cigars and other good things, and by various races with any chance gent of
                  their own class they might meet, who was inclined to try speed with them.
               
               Casual as was this meeting, the reader is not to suppose that Arent was without a
                  purpose in availing himself of it. Scarcely was the shrewd and cunning spider
                  fairly seated by the side of the weak and inexperienced fly, than his active brain
                  had evolved the materials for that web of ingenious question and insinuation and
                  suggestion, by which, when the victim should be brought to the proper condition of
                  yielding weakness by potations and excitements, he was to be entrapped to the
                  furtherance of Arent's deep laid projects.
               "Have n't seen much of you lately, Jim," said the spider. "Married, I suppose, and
                  cutting your old friends."
               The speaker uttered the last sentence with an ironical tone; but the former more
                  in earnest. There might possibly be a dash of satire, though, in his first remark;
                  inasmuch as one might see Mr. Harsford, alias
                  Glovering, many times, yet not see much of him, there being but little of him to
                  see, even though he were examined under the magnifying glass of charity.
               "I've been in the country," said the fly. "Only got back last week."
               "Hunting, or fishing?" asked the spider. "Or pretty girls?" he added, as a third
                  alternative.
               "Not much of either," said the fly; "business for the governor. I did make rather
                  an impression though in one quarter, I expect. And fixed one fellow's flint pretty
                  well for him."
               "How was that?"
               "Why you see I was up in the country; at Enneton. Were you ever there? Regular
                  country place. Nothing going on. Nothing to do. Nothing to drink even. I stopped
                  at a fellow's house named Mayes, to get him to go up the country for the
                  governor,—to hunt up some old matters of his. While he was gone I had a few civil
                  words with his daughter, of course, and before I knew it, the poor thing was dead
                  in love with me. Dead. Entirely gone. Well one night we were out to walk, and
                  while we were gone a young country spark came to see her, and when we came back
                  there he was waiting. He 'd been kept standing so long that he 'd got a little
                  sour, and nothing would suit him but a flare-up. So he talked to his girl a while,
                  and at length he asked her point blank which she 'd rather have, him or me. Well,
                  she blushed, and simpered, and tried to pacify him, but nothing would do but she
                  should answer, so at length she said 'me,' of course. Then he offered me some
                  impertinence or other, and I hit him a lollipop over the shoulder and down he
                  went, flat as a paving-stone. I did n't mean to knock him, but I do hit a
                  tremendous blow sometimes without meaning it. He was a stout fellow, twice my
                  size, but he saw he could n't do any thing against my science, so he got up and
                  walked away; and left me to comfort the pretty Miss Arabel."
               "Which you did of course!" This was said in a tone that to a more observant
                  listener would have implied,—"I shall believe just as much of that story as I
                  think is credible."
               "Of course. Wiped her eyes. Told her all about New York. Talked in a round-about
                  way about showing ing her round the
                  city one of these days. Oh! we got on nicely; like a street contractor and an
                  alderman, as the governor says."
               "How is the old gentleman?" asked the spider. "He and I dined together at
                  Delmonico's the other day,—only two tables between us,—and I thought he was
                  looking poorly."
               This was a lie thrown out at random to catch the truth with. Arent had not seen
                  Mr. Harsford.
               "Yes. He 's not in prime condition."
               "Business cares I suppose. He works too hard, and lets things worry him too much.
                  Why do n't you go into the counting-room and relieve him? Or are you going to do
                  the traveling? You were up at Enneton on business for the house, I think you
                  said."
               "No, not for the house; for father. Private affairs of his own."
               "Why did n't he go himself, and get a run in the country? He 's killing himself
                  with hard work."
               "No, it 's not work. He 's fretted a little by some old stories being raked up
                  against him. He 'll clear 'em all up in a little while and come out all
                  right."
               "Ah," said the spider, "those things are very worrying. I know what they are. I've
                  had a good deal to do with cases of that sort. Rich men you know, and lying
                  stories made up to get money out of them. Why a friend of mine would have been
                  worried to death in that way once, I believe, if I had n't helped him out of
                  it."
               This was another lie, coined to buy knowledge of the truth with. It served the
                  purpose of exciting the young man's curiosity.
               "How was it?" he asked.
               "Why my friend was traveling out West once with his daughter and they got lost in
                  the woods, and had to camp out over night. Next morning he left her at the camp,
                  and started off to find the way out. He got on the track at last and went back to
                  the camp for her, but she was gone. He never set eyes on her again. Hunted all
                  round and about but could n't find a trace of her, and never heard of her again.
                  About four or five years afterwards some rascals got hold, of the story, and made
                  a charge against him of murdering his daughter, and making up that story to
                  conceal it. And they worked on his feelings so that first and last they had got
                  over five hundred dollars out of him when he came to me."
               "And what did you do for him?"
               "I said this to him: 'You send out there, and hire some old hunter, some man that
                  knows every step of the woods, to get up a gang of men to make a new search all
                  round and about. Keep it up until they find something.' So he did that, and sure
                  enough they found his daughter's bones off about a mile from the camp ground. By
                  good luck she 'd cut her name on a log with a penknife, and underneath she 'd cut
                  'Lost in the woods,' so that was the end of the talk about murder."
               "Well, but we 've done that," said the fly. "I mean,—that is,—ahem—suppose you 'd
                  done that and found nothing. Then what would you have done?"
               "Then I should have told my friend, 'Here now, you 'd better see these fellows, face to face, and
                  find out what they 're at. Find out what they can prove. Challenge 'em to prove
                  any thing against you, and they can't help bringing forward their evidence. Then
                  you 'll know where you stand, and what you 've got to disprove. Then come to me
                  and I 'll tell you what to do next according to what their story is.'"
               "But suppose they 'd found the woman herself and offered to produce her, alive and
                  well."
               "Then we should have beat 'em do n't you see, for there would have been an end of
                  the charge of murdering her."
               "Yes, but suppose they had n't charged him with that. Suppose they had only
                  accused him of going off and leaving her and then marrying again."
               "Well, his marrying again would make no particular odds, would it?" said the
                  spider, with a sly smile at the unguarded frankness of his victim. "That is, not
                  if it was his daughter that was lost?"
               "N—no. No. Oh! no. Of course not," said the fly, recovering himself as well as he
                  could from this unwary plunge into the net. "No. I do n't mean daughter. Suppose
                  it was a man's wife who was lost, and they got up a story that he had gone off and
                  left her a purpose and then married again?"
               "That would have been a pretty bad case. I do n't know any thing a man could do in
                  that case, if they could produce the woman, except to make the best bargain he
                  could. That would be an awful scrape to have get about."
               And so they rode on and conversed. At Blooming-dale they stopped for a more
                  substantial refreshment than they had thought it worth while to call for at the
                  various inns and saloons at which they had stopped on their way up. Their
                  entertainment completed, to the decided exhilaration of Mr. Arent, and the very
                  successful obscuration of the feeble intellect of Mr. Harsford alias Glovering, they mounted into the chaise and set
                  out on their return.
               Young Glovering sat silent, apparently revolving weighty matters in his mind.
                  Arent drew a cigar and small box of lights from his pocket, and commenced a
                  careless smoke. There was little need for him to pursue the conversation further.
                  To his ready mind the unguarded admission of his companion, coupled with his
                  previous remark respecting his errand at the residence of Mr. Mayes, and aided
                  also by the uncalled for confusion alternating with transparent mystery of young
                  Harsford's manner, were quite enough to reveal that Mr. Harsford the elder had
                  been deeply disturbed by some communications calculated seriously to affect his
                  good name; that he had sent abroad to search for means of meeting these charges,
                  and that his search had been unsuccessful. How fully the details of this
                  difficulty of Mr. Harsford's stood further revealed to the gambler, it is not for
                  me now to say.
               At length the little buggy drew near the thickly settled streets of the city, and
                  arriving at the stable where young Harsford was accustomed to leave it, the two
                  men stepped out. Mr. Glovering, alias
                     Harsford, bade his friend 'good
                  night' with the most enthusiastic professions of regard, in expressing which his
                  utterance was impeded,—by excess of emotion I suppose. And parting at this place,
                  the two went their several ways.
               Instead of following these gentlemen further, let us turn in the other direction
                  to overtake Matthew whose heels are flying in an undignified manner through
                  Broadway, at the tail of a bakery cart.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               IT IS HARD FOR ROGUES TO UNDERSTAND HONEST MEN.
               CLINGING tenaciously to the tail-board of a rattling cart whose youthful Jehu took
                  evident delight in the perils of rapid riding in Broadway, Matthew maintained his
                  speed down the street. The secret of his unceremonious and singular behavior was
                  that the cart had upon it, in large letters, "HOPLEY, BAKER." Now Matthew had
                  proposed to himself, as one of his early errands in New York, to search out Mrs.
                  Hopley, his benefactress and foster mother in childhood; the widow to whose
                  kindness he and Roselle owed their home when her blindness made her doubly
                  dependent. He knew she had come to New York, and that she had come to reside with
                  a brother who was a baker; but further than that he had no clue by which to find
                  her. The idea of looking in the directory had not occurred to his rurally-educated
                  mind; and now, when the very cart of her brother's establishment drove by, he saw
                  an opportunity to find her which he might not soon have again. "If I follow that,"
                  he thought, "I shall soon be at the shop; or I can ask the driver her address, if
                  he is not going directly there." Therefore it was that, breaking away from his new companion without
                  ceremony, he had dashed along the side-walk, and after two or three personal
                  collisions of a nature which threatened serious consequences, he took to the
                  street, and soon caught up with the cart. He was less successful, however, in his
                  endeavor to open communication with said Jehu, whose sharp eyes were intent upon
                  his course, and whose ears were full of the rattle of his own wheels, and the
                  crash and thunder of the heavier vehicles around him. The only answer to his
                  breathless calls to the driver to "Stop," were those made by a villainous looking
                  dog which stood tipping about, or rather sliding about, among the big baskets in
                  the agitated wagon. This faithful brute, firmly convinced that Matthew entertained
                  sinister designs upon the contents of the bread baskets, broke into a fit of
                  barking so violent that it seemed as if it must cause some severe internal injury,
                  and menaced Matthew with a formidable row of teeth. What with the uncertain
                  pavement, slipping away so fast beneath his oscillating legs, what with the
                  lurches and sudden starts made by the wagon, what with the admonitions he heard
                  addressed by malicious boys to the all-engrossed Jehu to "cut behind," and the
                  glimpses that he now and then got of passing omnibus drivers leaning over in the
                  evident attempt to crack their long whips under his flying coat-tails, and what
                  with being out of breath with running and calling, Matthew was about discouraged,
                  and smiling at the predicament he was in, was looking around to see if the way
                  were clear to let go and sheer off for the side-walk, when he heard a shout of
                  "Stop thief," from the other side of the street, and turned his head in that
                  direction. Just at this instant the cart gave a sharp lurch, the baskets slid
                  about in wild confusion upon the bottom of the wagon, and among them faithful
                  Watch, sliding upon his fore-feet and haunches, came down upon Matthew, in reality
                  impelled by natural forces, but apparently inflamed with the thirst for blood.
                  Matthew, who was naturally of a cool and resolute disposition, though now somewhat
                  flustered by his exercise, preferred to face his enemy rather than to drop off and
                  be run over; and finding no other weapon, he grasped the end of a loaf of twist
                  projecting from one of the baskets, with the other extremity whereof he gave Watch
                  a tap on the nose, so vigorous as to enable him to overcome entirely the natural
                  forces which had operated to impel him in his onset upon Matthew, and sent him
                  backwards, howling, to the forward end of the cart.
               All this was done in half the time that it is read, and when the slanderous cry
                  was repeated, and young Jehu, just about to turn into a cross street, looked
                  around, and breathless Matthew gasped out to him to "Hold on," and his request was
                  very promptly complied with,—he was thunderstruck at seeing Jehu leap like a flash
                  from his seat and rush up at the head of a crowd of spectators; and at feeling
                  himself thereupon grasped unceremoniously by the collar of his coat, and jerked
                  this way and that.
               "Let go," said he, breaking loose from the grasp, but still encircled by the
                  crowd. "What do you mean? Why could n't
                  you stop before? Did n't you hear me calling to you?"
               "Nerh," said John with infinite contempt for a sneak caught in the act who would
                  be guilty of contriving such a transparent story as that—"Nerh."
               "Perhaps you heard us calling to you, eh?" said the man
                  who had set up the cry, and had come across the street to see the result.
               "What!" exclaimed Matthew, as the idea of his being alluded to in the hue and cry
                  first broke on his mind.
               "I cried 'stop thief,' as soon as ever I saw him dodging after you," said the
                  man.
               "What!" said Matthew, bewildered with visions of an early visit to one of the
                  public institutions of the city floating before him.
               "Yes, and I saw him look round to see if any body was looking, before he touched
                  the bread," said another.
               "And he dropped it quick as I looked around," added the driver.
               "Impossible, gentlemen," said Matthew appealing to the crowd. "I'm not a thief. I
                  wanted to speak to this man and ran after his cart—"
               "What did you touch the bread for?"
               "I only took up a loaf to knock his dog with; he was going to bite me."
               At this the crowd laughed. One of them said that he was good for six months, sure.
                  Jehu said he would n't get such good bread as that there, pointing over his
                  shoulder with his thumb, meaning to indicate that the bread served at the Tombs
                  was from another establishment. "And mind, young man," continued the youth, "when
                  you get out again, if you ever want to see me, which I guess not, you 'll remember
                  to come round to the shop, like a gentleman, and not run bobbing after my baskets
                  in the street."
               "That's just what I wanted," returned Matthew, reminded of the wish that had led
                  him into this scrape. "I wanted to know where the Widow Hopley lives."
               Matthew having been admonished to speak more respectfully of the lady in question,
                  repeated his wish to see her. To this the only response was a promise that he
                  should see the police justice forthwith; and this purpose was about to be carried
                  into effect even at the expense of a troublesome interference with Matthew's
                  natural freedom of locomotion, when he made one more appeal.
               "Gentlemen," said he, "I am a stranger in New York; but I know Mrs. Hopley. I am
                  no thief. She knows me very well, she knows I am not. I have no need to steal
                  bread. I have plenty of money," said he, pulling out a handful of change.
               Quick as thought a half a dozen hands fell upon it, and the money was speedily
                  transferred to the pockets of Jehu, to abide the event. This was not without its
                  good effect however, for Jehu appeared much more inclined now to listen to
                  Matthew's remonstrances, and it was finally agreed that the culprit should be
                  taken in the first instance to the Widow's shop, and thence to the Halls of
                  Justice. This course was taken; though not without objection on the part of many
                  of the crowd, who declared that "he was a confidence man and ought not to be allowed to bamboozle any body."
                  These objections were overruled however by Jehu, who, there being of course no
                  policemen in the vicinity, took upon himself the command of the capture. Under his
                  direction Matthew was marched along the side-walk, flanked by loafers in white
                  coats and in black coats and in no coats at all; among whom were several of the
                  objectors, who went, as they said, "for the sake of seeing him bamboozle the old
                  woman." Little boys ran before and followed after, and Jehu like a prudent general
                  mounted his cart and driving slowly close to the side-walk brought up the rear of
                  this little army.
               In this array they reached the bakery of Mrs. Hopley.
               The good widow however much she was surprised at the apparition of so numerous an
                  array of visitors soon forgot that, in her greater surprise at seeing Matthew.
                  Then and there, all unmindful of the presence of the public, she kissed "her boy"
                  as she called him, asked a hundred times for his health, and a thousand times for
                  little Roselle, and summarily dismissed the crowd, even before Matthew had had
                  time to complete his volunteered explanation; so that he was, for a few days at
                  least, free from apprehension of involuntary confinement. Jehu disgorged the
                  change he had taken possession of,—he took it "by way of bail," as he
                  explained,—and the entire posse comitatus went
                  away in great ill humor, the objectors above mentioned alone excepted. They,
                  having known all along how the affair would turn out, expressed themselves greatly
                  satisfied with the confidence man's performances, and stated and agreed, that it
                  was "a most tip top bamboozle;"—"one of the neatest things that ever was
                  done."
               Matthew soon felt himself very much at home, seated on the old-fashioned sofa in
                  the homely little sitting room which opened off from the shop. The widow ran out
                  now and then to attend to the wants of occasional customers, and always ran back
                  again, to renew with as little delay as possible their conversation.
               Matthew told his old friend all his plans. How he had left Mr. Sackett's store at
                  Harsford's Mills, (though he did not say how he had left Enneton,)—how he had come
                  to New York,—how he was determined to get into business and make his way to a
                  brilliant success,—how he intended to present himself at Mr. Harsford's
                  counting-room (though he did not say, alas! what letter of introduction he had
                  already sent in advance of his own coming),—how glad he was to have accomplished
                  so soon the finding of his old friend,—and many details besides.
               Mrs. Hopley entered into these plans with great interest and kindness. She spoke
                  in high terms of Mr. Harsford to whom she owed much, she said—alas! it was true,
                  not at all in the sense in which she meant it, but in far too literal a way. She
                  further narrated to Matthew the events of her own quiet life since they had
                  parted;—how she came to New York to be with and keep house for a bachelor brother
                  for many years a prosperous baker,—how he had lately died leaving the bulk of his
                  little property to her,—how she had just effected a sale of the business, stock,
                  fixtures good will and all, and was
                  carrying it on for a month or two until the purchaser could perfect his
                  arrangements to take possession,—how she had realized between five and six
                  thousand dollars which she had safely invested, (though she did not say alas! how
                  it was invested,)—how she was planning in the course of a short time to remove
                  from the city, and find a quiet home for the remainder of her days in some country
                  village. She urgently invited Matthew to make his home with her during the few
                  weeks that might remain of her residence in town, which would give him time at
                  least to become better acquainted with the city, and able to choose a better place
                  intelligently. She would not hear even of his going back to the hotel that night.
                  So he resigned himself with a good grace to his good fortune, made himself
                  agreeable till a servant appeared from some subterranean region to lay the table
                  in the homely sitting room; and during tea and after tea he made himself still
                  more agreeable with cheerful conversation, enlivening the homely sitting room that
                  for a long time had been silent and lonely to the sociable widow. And thus, with
                  pleasant reminiscences of the past and cheery plans and anticipations for the
                  future, the evening was far prolonged.
               Early the next morning Matthew went down to the hotel and brought up his valise
                  before breakfast. He was truly rejoiced to find so pleasant and safe a home, and
                  he found it not easy to express his gratitude to his hostess for the cosy little
                  bedroom overlooking the street which she appropriated to his use. After breakfast
                  and a long consultation as to the best time to present himself at the
                  counting-room, and after taking a walk around the neighboring blocks to acquaint
                  himself with the locality of his new home, Matthew finally at about nine o'clock
                  started on the momentous expedition. He thought it an important occasion, a
                  turning point perhaps in his history. I will not deny that premonitions of
                  wonderful success and fabulous wealth floated through his mind. Nor will I
                  undertake to say whether the chimerical fiction of a clerk's coming into the firm
                  and marrying the senior partner's daughter, and doing a tremendous business, were
                  or were not also within his foolish head. No dream is too daring to be a wide
                  awake expectation of Young America. It can not be gainsayed that Matthew believed
                  that important things in his destiny hung on this interview.
               But this I know, that if he had had an inkling of their momentous nature he would
                  have shrunk from putting his foot on the black stair-case of Alexander Harsford
                  & Co.
               Few things cause more surprises in affairs than the propensity of men to calculate
                  upon each other's actions according to the motives by which they are aware they
                  would themselves be influenced in like cases. Almost every man looks at others
                  through himself; and for the most part what he suspects in others is what he has
                  learned in himself.
               Now Mr. Harsford, as the reader knows, was a very shrewd man. Deep, he was. Keen,
                  too; oh! it was not words that would express his penetration and his cunning. It
                  took looks, and shrugs of shoulders, and winks and nods, and slow shakings of the head,—none of which are practicable in
                  pen and ink,—to convey an idea of the sharpness of the merchant's business
                  faculty. He could see roguery in every man. And in all his transactions, while
                  with great politeness and a charitable consideration for the feelings of the man
                  with whom he dealt, he intimated no suspicions, but to all appearance conversed
                  with the honest and simple-minded man who was tangible in the person before him,
                  he always dealt by the cunning and double-minded man who to the eye of his
                  penetration was visible in that person. Thus he was always prepared to meet
                  deceit, treachery, double dealing, prepared even to turn them oftentimes to his
                  own advantage. But honesty, fidelity, straight-forward frankness he did not well
                  comprehend because he was so little capable of them himself; and when in the
                  collisions of business he met either of these virtues, as sometimes strangely
                  enough he did, he always looked at it, scowled at it, set it down as a phase of
                  roguery too deep for his penetration, and protected himself from loss by it by
                  very carefully having nothing to do with it.
               Accordingly Mr. Harsford had written to Matthew, very cordially thanking him for
                  his letter, and inviting him to call at the counting-room when he should arrive in
                  the city; but had thereafter proceeded gradually to nurse his curiosity into
                  suspicions, and to educate his suspicions into distrust.
               Thus it was that Matthew whose confidence remained at the point to which it was
                  raised by Mr. Harsford's letter, entered the counting-room anticipating a cordial
                  welcome; and stepped up to the pulpit-shaped desk, and introduced himself to Mr.
                  Harsford in a well-framed sentence which seemed amazingly short to repeat when he
                  thought what a very long time it had taken to prepare it. But the merchant
                  received him with a silent and chilling bow, and went on with his writing. Matthew
                  stood still as long as his patience lasted, and then stood uneasily some moments
                  longer, and then was about to turn away, when the merchant, availing himself of
                  the very moment he had predetermined for the opening of the conversation, motioned
                  him to a seat, and sat looking at him very intently for a few seconds.
               Matthew returned his gaze with an innocent frankness; and, in an embarrassed
                  manner, uttered an apology for his intrusion, reminding the merchant of his
                  invitation.
               There was a fine contrast between these two men as they sat thus inspecting each
                  other, and each awaiting the other's words. The younger one sat in a rustic
                  attitude with one arm resting over the corner of the back of the chair; and in
                  this hand he held his hat, hanging just above the floor. His position was upright,
                  his head slightly thrown back, and the strong light from the window illuminated a
                  countenance which though it displayed a certain uneasiness and uncertainty,
                  springing from the unexpected manner in which he found himself received, was yet
                  singularly bold, open and self reliant in its expression. He properly thought he
                  had said enough and should await a reply. The older man, his face in its own
                  shadow, sat bent over his great desk and half concealed by it; and scanned his
                  visitor in a hesitating, undecided
                  manner. Matthew's air, instead of prepossessing this suspicious man, had revived
                  and strengthened the doubts which had haunted his mind. For, in truth, if the
                  young man maintained this semblance of straight-forward honesty and simple
                  heartedness, impenetrable, the merchant wanted nothing more to do with him. He
                  must in self-protection he felt, penetrate this mask of open heartedness until
                  Matthew should stand revealed before him as being, what the merchant assumed him
                  to be, a sharp fellow with two eyes to the main chance and no eye at all to
                  honesty, an unscrupulous man into whose knowledge Mr. Harsford's private
                  arrangements with the Iroquois Bank had fallen, and who was come now, confident of
                  power, to make terms for keeping silence;—then he could deal with him
                  understandingly.
               The interview was therefore to a certain degree important to the merchant as well
                  as to his visitor; and while he was scrutinizing the young man he was wondering
                  whether he should receive a broadside of plain words or fall into an ambush of
                  inuendoes; and was revolving in his own mind how he should make the most of the
                  dialogue, and how probe thoroughly his visitor's thoughts and purposes without
                  disclosing his own. "Rather young," he thought, "to be going into such an
                  operation; but if he were a mere clerk he would have asked for a place before now.
                  His eye is impudent enough for any thing"—and the merchant fairly dropped his gaze
                  from before a pair of eyes whose good-natured fearlessness would have been
                  impudent enough in a rogue like himself, but in Matthew Caraby was a more modest
                  and honest expression than he had met so closely for a long time;—no! I am wrong
                  there; than he had seen, I should say, since he left his daughter at the breakfast
                  table that morning.
               Matthew had at first been somewhat perplexed by the cool impassibility with which
                  he was received by this gentleman, for whom he entertained so much respect, both
                  in his capacity of senior partner in the firm of A. H. & Co., and of father of
                  Miss Charlotte Harsford. He soon however banished the misgiving with the thought
                  that it was perhaps only the New York way of doing business,—as to a certain
                  extent indeed it is;—and with the further thought that allowance must be made for
                  the fact that as yet he was not even an employeé of the firm. This thought of the
                  distance between himself and the object of his ambition, only renewed his courage
                  and hopefulness, and he sat still, resolved to await the merchant's pleasure;
                  though I fear he was much more willing to wait for the father aforesaid than he
                  would have been for the senior partner alone.
               "You have come to seek employment in New York, I believe," said the merchant,
                  speaking at last, and in a conciliatory tone.
               "Yes sir."
               There was a pause, which Matthew improved by laying his hat aside upon a chair
                  which stood near by that on which he himself was seated.
               "I was in hopes," he added, "that I might be able to make myself useful to you. I
                  do not know as you want a clerk," he
                  continued, perceiving a slight contraction of the merchant's brow as matters were
                  thus abruptly brought to a point. "I see indeed you have several, and perhaps I
                  may not seem very well qualified for city trade; but I have picked up some
                  knowledge of business here and there since I have been at Harsford's Mills,—you
                  know there's a good deal going on there, what with the Bank and all,—and I have
                  learned a good deal I think besides the business I have been in. Or if you could
                  put me in the way of getting a place, sir, or advise me as to my best way to set
                  about it, I should be very much obliged to you indeed."
               "By the way," said the merchant with an appearance of carelessness, "you wrote me
                  something about Iroquois stock. How did you find out—er—what's the trouble up
                  there?"
               "Well, Mr. Harsford," said Matthew, rather perplexed between his desire to speak
                  freely and his remembrance of the promise made to the cashier, and smiling a frank
                  smile which the merchant took for an attempt at a very knowing look, "I am not
                  prepared—that is—I am not at liberty just at present to say any more than I wrote
                  to you."
               The merchant's brow contracted slightly again, and he sat with his eyes turned
                  listlessly upon the paper on the desk before him, revolving some matter in his
                  mind.
               
               The results of the prolonged conversation which ensued, are of more consequence
                  than the details. Mr. Harsford was not quite able to feel that he understood
                  Matthew; and if his interests in connection with the Iroquois Bank had been less
                  important, or secrecy in regard to them less desirable, it is probable that he
                  would have determined to take the risk of leaving Matthew to take care of himself.
                  As it was, however, he felt unwilling to let this young man, who knew so much more
                  than he was willing to tell, and who might know so much more than the merchant was
                  willing to have told, depart quite yet from the circle of his control. And as it
                  happened, as the reader already knows, that Mr. Harsford was then deeply engaged
                  in the affairs of the Wilmerdingle Gold Prospect Company,—an association organized
                  for the prosecution of an auriferous business in a district of country where, as
                  there never had yet been any gold found, it was reasonable to suppose that vast
                  stores remained hidden and undisturbed,—and as he had been already meditating the
                  employment of a clerk to be paid by this company, he now further decided that the
                  best thing he could do was to put Matthew at a desk in the outer office in charge
                  of the books and affairs of the company, to whom, of course, if Matthew should
                  prove a competent and faithful clerk, money could be no object.
               In a few days, therefore, Matthew was formally installed, upon trial, in his new
                  position, where Mr. Harsford at first employed him in copying old minutes and
                  making out prospectuses for the company. He was not long, however, in finding his
                  way to more congenial employment. His readiness and energy soon gave him
                  precedence in matters of real utility, over the senior clerks, whose zeal had long before worn off. He
                  labored hard to dispel the distrust with which he saw himself to be regarded, and
                  as he appeared to be successful, he soon thought no more about it. His success in
                  this respect, was, however, in part at least, only apparent. Mr. Harsford was not
                  yet dispossessed of the idea that there was something to be unraveled in Matthew's
                  course. Even his very energy and enthusiasm in work were mysterious to his
                  employer, who could not see the plain explanation afforded by considering
                  Matthew's youthful ambition coupled with his country habits and training. He was
                  watching his clerk distrustfully yet.
               "Mr. Warrack," said the merchant, one day, to him who was his confidential clerk,
                  if the partial and illusory disclosures of purpose and policy which he now and
                  then made, of necessity, to the oldest of his employés, deserved the name of
                  "confidence," "Mr. Warrack have you noticed this young man, Caraby?"
               Mr. Warrack had noticed him, though not specially.
               "I took him into the office," said the merchant, "partly because I needed some one
                  at once and I had no one else in view, and partly from private reasons,—family
                  reasons. He has certain claims on me, and I am anxious to help him if he deserves
                  it. Not otherwise. I'm not quite satisfied with him, however, come to observe him
                  closely. I think he is driving at something more than he shows. I wish you'd
                  observe him, and if you see any thing calculated to confirm my idea, let me know.
                  I'll soon turn him to the right about."
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               DARKNESS SOMETIMES COSTS MORE THAN LIGHT.
               SEVERAL days passed before Charlotte found time to fulfill her intention of
                  visiting her poor neighbor. What with the various engagements incidental to a
                  return to the city after a long absence, and what with her mother's preparations
                  for the party, which, as already said, consisted for the most part in talking a
                  great deal herself and giving Charlotte a good deal to do, it was many days before
                  she found opportunity to go out upon one of those rounds of quiet good doing in
                  which she was accustomed to take so much pleasure. But at length she went. She
                  made several calls upon humble friends whose homes were accustomed to be
                  brightened occasionally by her coming; and at last, as the close of the afternoon
                  drew on, she bent her steps nearer and nearer home until it remained only for her
                  to call upon her neighbor Alfene.
               The small windows high up toward the roof of the edifice so obnoxious to Mr. and
                  Mrs. Harsford, from which Benny had watched the signal of Miss Harsford's return,
                  lighted a small room, devoid of ornaments, and almost bare of conveniences. This
                  afternoon the occupant of the apartment had been engaged in ironing large quantities of clothing she had washed
                  the day previous; and although the weather was cool and the windows stood wide
                  open, the room was hot and close with the heat and fumes of a charcoal furnace
                  which stood on the hearth near the stove, and which had served to heat the irons
                  for her work. Her task was uncompleted, for, upon the board, which, supported by
                  two chairs, formed the ironing table, was a pile of rough-dried garments, one of
                  which lay spread out, as yet but half ironed. The little fire in the furnace was
                  dying out, and from observing that the box upon the hearth, blackened within with
                  charcoal, was almost empty, one could infer that there was but little more fuel
                  left to renew it with. Upon the mantel were a few odd dishes, a few vials, a faded
                  miniature case, of morocco, and a child's slate; and a little wire save-all,
                  supporting a bit of candle, stood in the broken bottle which served as
                  candlestick. In the corner near the door, and almost out of sight when it stood
                  open, were two wash-tubs, empty and turned over, leaning against the wall. The
                  walls of the room were bare, but they were very clean, as was the ceiling also;
                  and shining nail-heads which protruded here and there through the well-worn boards
                  of the floor, added their testimony to the habitual neatness of the apartment. A
                  common wooden clothes-horse which stood across the corner of the room between the
                  hearth and the open window, was hung with garments fresh and spotless from the
                  hand of the laundress.
               In the other corner of the room, beneath the window which was curtained by the
                  vine and rose-bush, stood a narrow cross-legged cot. Over its lean form hung a
                  quilt or comforter, of a dark color. Its original figure had been quite lost in
                  the repeated washings and mendings which had yet preserved its purity and
                  integrity. It was so disposed as to hang like a valance from the front and foot of
                  the bedstead, concealing that uncouth frame-work, except where an end or corner
                  projected; and this quilt was folded down neatly at the head, disclosing a thin
                  pillow and coarse white sheets and pillowcase.
               Seated, or rather reclining upon some low seat by the head of this cot was a pale
                  woman. Her head was thrown back and rested upon the hard edge of the cot
                  imperfectly cushioned by the thin pillow; and her pallid face was turned upwards,
                  and slightly toward the open window, as if to catch the air. A thin white shawl or
                  scarf was folded across her shoulders, and the thick dark hair drawn straight down
                  over her temples, seemed, when contrasted with the scarf and the pillow-case
                  beneath it, and with the pallid face, to be jet black. The dress of this woman was
                  of a plain dark material, and its faded hue and scant meager folds contrasted
                  strangely with the flowing robes, embroidered garments, and delicate laces and
                  muslins which hung before her. But her frame was almost as motionless as was the
                  support on which they hung. One hand rested upon her knees; the other had fallen
                  and hung passive at her side. Her eyes were closed or nearly closed. Her thin lips
                  and sunken cheeks were made to appear more thin and sunken still by the position
                  of her head. It was not possible to discern cern any movement of that narrow, hollow chest
                  which should show that she was yet breathing; and only a feeble cough which
                  returned at intervals and disturbed her languid form, showed that this woman still
                  lived and suffered.
               All these things did Charlotte see with one glance of her bright and kindly eyes,
                  as she reached the top of the fifth flight of stairs and arrived at the open door
                  of this apartment.
               As she came to the door, Charlotte started involuntarily, as if in alarm. Not that
                  this home of the poor laundress was an unfamiliar room to her; on the contrary in
                  months past she had come here several times on errands of kindness. But now Benny
                  was gone, and the sight of the mother, alone, exhausted, almost insensible, cast
                  down against her little cot, and of the expression of suffering upon the thin face
                  that lay upturned, was one that went to the very heart of the maiden, and caused
                  her to exclaim with dread. It haunted her, waking and sleeping, for days, until
                  more fearful scenes engrossed her thoughts; until anxieties and distresses of her
                  own expelled from her mind for the time the trials of her neighbor.
               She entered the room with a quick step, and hastened forward to the side of the
                  woman, who raised her head and seeing her visitor, rose with a strong effort,
                  compounded, it would seem, of respect and pride, and saluted her.
               "Why! Mrs. Temple! Are you sick? What is the matter? Where is Benny?" exclaimed
                  the young lady.
               "No," said the woman feebly, but coughing as she spoke, "I am not sick. Benny's
                  gone away of his errands. I wish he would come back, though,—poor little fellow!
                  It s time."
               "But what is the matter with you?"
               "Oh nothing. I felt a little fatigued and sat down to rest. I believe I had almost
                  fallen asleep."
               There was something most extraordinary in the appearance of this singular woman as
                  she stood before Charlotte,—so thin and wasted, yet commanding so much energy from
                  her worn-out frame,—so poor, yet so refined and lady-like, not only in her manners
                  and speech, but in her very mien and movement,—engaged in so menial and severe an
                  occupation, yet bearing a brow in which the light of intellect and even of
                  education illuminated the wrinkles of care and premature old age. Charlotte was
                  struck, as never before, with the enigma she presented. Her mother's recent
                  suspicious words arose to her mind. Charlotte was indeed not very familiar with
                  poverty; if she had been, this room, which, although narrow and scant, was in
                  reality a comfortable home, would not have seemed to her the depth of want. To her
                  inexperienced eye, however, the small, ill-furnished room had always appeared to
                  be comfortless in the extreme, but she had never yet felt it strange that she
                  should now meet here one who seemed to be her equal—perhaps her superior,—in
                  native intelligence and grace of person, and who even displayed traces of an
                  education and habit of life worthy to compare with those of the accomplished Miss
                  Harsford. The strangeness ness of this
                  meeting now, however, struck her with its full force, and she stood looking in
                  wonder at the face and form before her.
               The woman, feeling that she was scrutinized, cast down her eyes with a blush in
                  which were mingled traces of a strong pride and of a bitter humiliation, and
                  turned away, feebly walking to her rude table.
               "You will excuse me, Miss Harsford," she said, "if I go on with my work. These
                  things must be finished to-night."
               "Oh do not. Rest a little longer."
               The poor woman made no reply. She had scarcely commenced her labor when a violent
                  paroxysm of coughing recurred, and she almost sank to the floor. Charlotte led her
                  to the cot, and partly through the feebleness of her resistance, and partly
                  through the urgency of her own insisting, induced her to lie down, at least until
                  it should pass off. In brief intervals of rest the invalid made efforts to rise,
                  but was as often dissuaded by her visitor.
               "But Benny will be back soon," she would say, "and we must carry
                  these things home to-night."
               Week after week this poor mother dragged out her existence, forgetting the misery
                  with which the strange vicissitudes of her past life had been filled, unmindful of
                  her disease, of her want, of her lost position in life, and devoted all her little
                  strength and many thoughts to the future of the son whose return she now awaited.
                  If she had been alone in life she would have long since lain down quietly in
                  death. But her child bound her to life; and through a sickness which in wealth
                  would have made one helpless, she toiled on, rising from her bed to wash, when her
                  weakness and her cough sent her back to bed again, after one hour of toil, to rest
                  and sleep before another hour of toil. Through every hardship and privation she
                  still clung to life, concealed her illness from others and denied it to herself,
                  resolutely living for her boy's sake. As she lay there, breathing quick and short
                  after the paroxysm of her cough, Charlotte sat in silence. She had never seen her
                  thus before.
               At length Charlotte spoke.
               "Now you shall lie still here and rest," she said, "and I will stay with you until
                  Benny comes. Meanwhile," she continued, after a moment's pause, "can you not tell
                  me something about yourself? You are indeed ill. Have you seen a physician?"
               The invalid shook her head.
               "If you would like, Mrs. Temple," continued Charlotte, hesitating as she made the
                  suggestion, "to tell me something about yourself, I might be able to assist you
                  better."
               The woman turned her face doubtingly towards Charlotte. The eyes of the latter,
                  suffused with tears, testified the sympathy that was expressed in her voice. Her
                  look seemed to reassure the poor woman; who however continued silent.
               "I do not ask from curiosity. Indeed I do not. I do not
                     ask at all. I want to do any thing I can for you and little Benny
                  at any rate; but I have thought I might be better able to judge what, if I knew something
                  more—"
               Still she hesitated.
               "Have you no friends?"
               She shook her head slowly once.
               "Except yourself," she answered, "none,—that I can call friends. Mrs. Walters has
                  been very kind to me; but she told me last week that if I did not bring these
                  things home to night,—for I have disappointed her a little several times
                  lately,—she should not pay me for them nor give me any more. She's been very kind
                  to me, but I think she does not care so much for me as she does for
                  her things."
               "Poor little Benny! His father,—is dead, I suppose."
               "He never knew his father," said the mother, bitterly.
               "Have you any relatives?"
               "I think I have some," replied the woman, speaking very deliberately, and watching
                  her questioner as if to see what effect the answer would have upon her. "I think I
                  have some. I am almost sure. But I wish to know with certainty. I intend to find
                  out before—"
               "Before what?"
               "Before I die."
               There was a pause.
               "Can you not ascertain now? Let me help you."
               Again this woman so mysterious by all that she said, so incomprehensible by all
                  that she refrained from saying, hesitated. She shook her head slowly once, perhaps
                  more as if she were doubtful whether to speak than as if she would refuse.
               Charlotte, however, little conjectured what was passing in the mind of the
                  singular woman before her. This conversation was to this lonely woman an
                  opportunity earnestly desired, long sought. The hope that there might come a time
                  when to some member of that wealthy family she might speak freely of herself, and
                  above all of her boy, had been for months and years the desire of her long and
                  hopeless days, the dream of her short and sleepless nights. In the degradation out
                  of which, since the birth of this boy, she had been rising,—for though her way of
                  life had been downward as men count progress, it had been, in a Wiser sight than
                  theirs, upwards from that time,—she had set this hope before her, far distant in
                  the dim future; that before she died she would claim and secure for him their kind
                  offices. For this she had sought and made her home in the precinct of their
                  stately dwelling. To realize this purpose she had labored and waited, waited and
                  labored, in silence. This had been almost the only thing of which in her earthly
                  future she had felt assured. To her resolute and patient determination it had been
                  certain. But one thing in that future was more so, to her faith,—that one was
                  Death.
               Now, the opportune time, long hoped for was come. More opportune than even Hope
                  had pictured. Here at her side the flower of that family,—good and tender of
                  heart, the nature of all natures to whom she would trust,—young, and therefore
                  giving promise of long years of
                  faithful affection to come,—she, Charlotte, solicited the very confidence long
                  since prepared to be offered with many fears of repulses.
               And yet the mother hesitates. Why? Because Death was not near enough? For her own
                  sake her lips would never have been opened to recount to any mortal ear the
                  strange experiences of her life. Nor did she dare to think that any friend would
                  take up her boy, encumbered with the wreck of herself. It were hopeless to bring
                  him to notice till her time was come to pass away from notice. When she was
                  forgotten there might be happiness for him.
               All these thoughts passed through her mind as she lay looking into the tender eyes
                  of her fair visitor. They filled her with strange emotions. "Why should I wait?"
                  she thought. "She cares for him. It is enough. I am ready to go. Surely the Good
                  God has now brought the time about."
               "Charlotte!" she said, breaking silence with a tremulous yet earnest voice and
                  startling her with so familiar an address. "Charlotte! you care for him? You
                     really think of him? Oh, how he loves you already. Will you take
                  care of him?"
               And the mother raised herself upon her elbow.
               "Will you see him provided for?" she continued. "Can you promise me that? I do not
                  hope to live long, and when I die he will be without means, without protectors,
                  without a home. Will you care for him?"
               To Charlotte all this was stranger than a dream. This woman, always singular, was
                  now mysterious, incomprehensible.
               "I shall be very glad, I assure you, Mrs. Temple," she commenced, feeling that the
                  dark and piercing eye of the invalid bent upon her demanded an answer, although
                  she herself scarcely knew what to say in reply to the unexpected request. "I shall
                  be very glad to do all that I can, all that is right for him, in case he should
                  need my aid. But I ought to know,—ought I not?—something about his history—and
                  yours—before I can help him aright; before I can even give you a promise such as
                  you would wish to have."
               And she turned her kind and attentive eyes toward the sick woman's face.
               "I will tell you the whole story," the woman rejoined without urging the promise
                  she had asked. "It is a sad, sad story. A cruel story. I can not ask you to care
                  for him if I conceal any thing from you. I can trust you I know. My name is
                  nothing to me; but poor Benny. How my heart aches that I can leave nothing better
                  than that name to him!" and for the first time the mother's eyes filled with tears
                  and they coursed down her hot, dry cheeks. "It is a sad story. I will tell it to
                  you. Listen!"
               And she put out her hand upon Charlotte's arm as if to fix her utmost
                  attention.
               "What is it?" asked Charlotte, after a pause.
               "Hark."
               There was a noise upon the stairs below as if some one were ascending. The steps
                  were short and unequal, like those of a
                  little child, who clambers up by putting both feet upon each stair, but they were
                  quicker and louder than the step of such a little child.
               "It is Benny," said Charlotte.
               "Yes; but there's some one with him; a gentleman's step it is."
               And in a moment—
               "Mother," cried a little lame boy, limping gayly into the room, "here we are!"
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               THE FIRST TIME IS THE BEST TIME.
               IN the latter part of a cold and cheerless day, the very day of Charlotte's visit
                  to the laundress, just related, Matthew, having performed all the duties of his
                  clerkship for the day, and finding himself quite at leisure from any demands upon
                  his time in respect of the business of A. Harsford & Co., or that of the
                  Wilmerdingle Gold Prospect Company, seated himself at his desk with a view to the
                  composition of certain letters which possess interest in connection with this
                  narrative.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              NEW YORK, November —, 1848.
                              MISS ARABELLA MAYES,
                           
                           Will you be so kind as to return to me the letters which I have
                              written to you, or to destroy them? I am willing to return yours or
                              destroy them, whichever you may prefer. I ought perhaps to have
                              thought to offer to do so earlier. If I have been negligent please
                              excuse me. With sincere wishes for your happiness, I am:
                           
                              MATTHEW CARABY.
                           
                        
                        
                           P. S. Please address me in the care of Alexander Harsford & Co.,
                              New York City.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              NEW YORK, November —, 1848.
                              MY DEAR SISTER ROSELLE,
                           
                           Here I am, grandly established in New York. I wrote you about my place
                              in my last letter, so I have nothing more to say of that. Mrs. Hopley
                              is as kind as ever, only, I am sorry to say, she 's not going to be
                              here long. You know she came on here to be with her brother the baker.
                              He died a few weeks ago, and she 's left all alone. She is settling up
                              his affairs, and says she is going to get out of New York just as soon
                              as she can. It 's no place for children or widows, she says, and I
                              suppose she 's right—poor woman! I should think she would be
                              lonely—but it 's a first rate place for a young man like me; that I
                              know. His affairs, fortunately, were in a very simple condition. He
                              left all his property to her, for he had no family, and she has sold
                              out the business for quite a comfortable little sum; enough for her to
                              live on the interest of it. I believe Mr. Harsford is investing her
                              money for her. She is only waiting till the man who has bought the
                              business is ready to take possession, "and then," she says, "good-bye
                              to New York."
                           But now to come to the main object of my letter. I want you to come on
                              and make a little visit here before Widow Hopley goes away. You could
                              come just as well as not. There 's plenty of room here. She 's
                              enthusiastic about it; and tells me to tell you you must
                              come. It would be a great deal better to come now than by and by. I
                              have no idea where I shall board after she is gone; besides it would
                              be lonely then for you all day while I am away at business; and now
                              you would have a good time all day long in her little sitting room or
                              in the shop, hearing the customers coming and going and talking; and
                              then in the morning early and in the evening we would take walks about
                              the city. I have found ever so many things to show you. There are some
                              noisy streets full of crowds and business which we should not go into
                              often, only once or twice to let you see what they are; and then there
                              are quiet places, little nooks and corners where the trees grow, and
                              there are gardens full of flowers, and there are little greens where
                              the children play. I think you would enjoy it very much.
                           I know you say that you enjoy it very much where you are, and do not
                              need to make such an expensive journey; but just think how much I want
                              to see you. Besides to tell the truth I want to have you see a first
                              rate oculist here to see if something can not be done to restore your
                              sight.
                           Come Roselle, do not refuse me this time. I inclose $15 for you to
                              come on with. I hope I shall receive a letter from you the last of
                              this week saying you will come right away. Only let me know the day
                              and I will meet you at the boat when it arrives in the afternoon. The
                              stage-driver will take you down to the boat at Troy and find you a
                              good seat and introduce you to the stewardess. I wish I could come for
                              you; but it will be a good while before I can leave here. But I have
                              n't much doubt that you will find somebody coming on in the course of
                              a few days who will take care of you.
                           
                           Hoping soon to see you, for I have much to say that I can not write, I
                              am ever your affectionate brother
                           
                              MATTHEW.
                           
                        
                        
                           P. S. Miss Harsford asked me to send her love to you when I wrote. I
                              had so long an account of my journey to give that I believe I forgot
                              it in my last.
                           
                              M.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               This last letter, which is so short to read, took a good deal of time to write,
                  for a reason not expressed in its last paragraph;—that he could not write freely
                  when every word must pass over the tongue of whomsoever accident or necessity
                  should designate as the reader to Roselle of her brother's letter. This serious
                  obstacle to their free correspondence, while it apparently separated them,
                  operated to draw them more closely together. Neither could be happy long away from
                  the other; and brief separations served to cause them to cling more tenaciously to
                  personal companionship; and during the years of Matthew's growth to manhood he had
                  taken care, in forming his plans, to be always near enough to his sister to see
                  her frequently; to be as near to her in fact, and to be with her as much, as was
                  possible.
               For a year or two past indeed Roselle had been living for the greater part of the
                  time in a quiet town a few miles distant from the Mills. The chief importance of
                  this town arose from the fact that it contained an ancient academy whose long and
                  successful operation had made its locality well known thereabout as the seat of
                  learning in that part of the country. To it from all the surrounding towns came
                  students young and old, and, partly because she enjoyed the society of many young
                  people thus collected, partly because the place itself had an air of refinement
                  and intelligence not common in other places she had been in, but chiefly because
                  she had there found it possible to gain instruction in a few simple studies,
                  Roselle had with Matthew's advice and assistance sought and found a home there.
                  She lived in a humble family whose cottage stood just back of the academy upon a
                  pleasant road leading out of the village. Here by assisting in the care of the
                  children, and by assisting in the plainer and easier kinds of sewing and by
                  knitting, she made compensation for her frugal board and scantily furnished little
                  room; while she spent such hours as she could spare from these duties, in the
                  recitation rooms of the academy,—where she was always a welcome visitor,—listening
                  to the lessons, always knitting meanwhile. While the classes recited, she studied,
                  by the ear; and the rest of the day, she recited to herself; and thus by her quick
                  ear and retentive memory, she made better progress in many things than the other
                  children with their bright eyes. She was very fond of music, and sang at her work
                  all day long; and every new song or tune that she could hear was committed to
                  memory by her, and soon heard from her lips more clearly, delicately, and sweetly
                  sung than it had been by those from whom she had learned it. Her love and aptitude
                  for music made her even a greater favorite than she would otherwise have been. She
                  soon became indispensable in the
                  village choir, and when she could be prevailed upon to join some little evening
                  gathering of the young people, which was however very rarely, it was a pleasure to
                  all to see her beaming face smiling over her neat but very plain attire, and to
                  hear her voice in turn among others in the songs of the evening.
               It was a bright day of happy excitement for the poor girl when one of the ladies
                  in the town who knew how to do a good deed in a kind manner, opened the way for
                  her to better occupation by employing her to instruct her daughters in music. The
                  example this lady set was soon followed by others; and though Roselle at first
                  undertook the labor with much trepidation and many protestations that she did not
                  know enough, she soon gained confidence, and if her pupils did not begin at the
                  very strait, five-barred gate usually set for the discouragement of children from
                  music, the familiar songs which they soon learned to sing enlivened the home
                  fire-sides more than thousands of the brilliant unpronounceable fantasias so
                  popular with young ladies who can not play Home Sweet Home or Auld Lang Syne
                  "without the notes."
               But even while Roselle had been here dwelling she had been but a few miles
                  separated from Matthew; and he had scarcely ever permitted a week to pass without
                  one or two, or even three calls upon her. Now, since Matthew had come to New York
                  the brother and sister for the first time felt parted by a serious distance; and
                  Matthew knew too well how serious that separation would be to his sister, not to
                  desire an early visit from her, for her sake as well as his own.
               The two letters which he had written, Matthew now folded, superscribed and sealed;
                  and laid them upon the upper part of his desk, to be mailed by his own hand, in
                  due time.
               This task performed, Matthew addressed himself to the duty of putting in their
                  places, before closing the office for the night, the various books and documents
                  which the business of the day had evoked from their dusty shelves and
                  pigeon-holes.
               As he returned to his seat, he heard the door open; and looking around he saw a
                  small boy enter the room, and shutting the door carefully after him advance
                  limping a little way towards Matthew's desk. Matthew had been alone some little
                  time, the senior clerks having followed the example of their principal and gone
                  away early, and he was rather glad of a visitor even if it were only a beggar. For
                  though he had nothing but kind words to give away, he had those, and they were
                  genuine; gladly spoken and gladly received. The boy looked about the room as if in
                  quest of some person. His appearance was singular. His puny form was clad in a
                  neat gray suit which was much mended, and hung awry upon his thin frame; but it
                  was clean and whole, and neatly buttoned up to the neck where the little jacket
                  was surmounted by a broad collar, white and clean, but rough, coarse, and entirely
                  without starch. He wore on his head a queer little beaver hat shaped like a
                  miniature man's hat except that the crown was very low and the rim more curled
                  than even was then the fashion. This black and shining hat shaded a mild face in
                  which the vivacity of childhood was
                  quite displaced by an expression of premature carefulness, of disappointment,
                  suffering and resignation. There was nothing gloomy in the expression, but rather
                  an air of quiet submission, as if Trouble and he, from being so long acquaintances
                  had come to be very good friends after all, and got along together in their quiet
                  way very well. Matthew calculated, by taking a mean between his very old face and
                  his very young form, that he was about ten years old.
               "Good afternoon sir!" said Matthew cheerily, "and how do you do?" It was a queer
                  way he had of speaking as kindly to a beggar even as he would to his employer.
               "I 'm a great deal better," said the boy, standing still, but looking up with a
                  pleased expression. "Is n't Mr. Warrack in?"
               "No," said Matthew, "he's gone home. A'n't you cold? Walk up to the fire and warm
                  you."
               Is there any thing more touching than to see a human face filled with surprise at
                  being kindly spoken to? In all our great cities are thousands upon thousands of
                  fellow-creatures seeking their precarious living in despised employments, who are
                  as much surprised at meeting a truly kind greeting as they would be at finding a
                  piece of money in the street; and as much pleased too I doubt not. Little Benny,
                  for it was he with whom Matthew was speaking, was unaccustomed to hear such a tone
                  even from those men who befriended him. It reminded him of the kind young lady who
                  lived near their house and visited them occasionally. At Matthew's invitation he
                  stepped forward, but instead of going to the fire came across to where Matthew was
                  sitting, and stood by the corner of the desk, looking up at him, as if the feeling
                  of a kindly heart was a more genial warmth to him than a bright fire, as no doubt
                  it was.
               "And what did you want of Mr. Warrack?" asked Matthew, looking down at his
                  visitor.
               "He lets me sell the papers," said Benny, "the waste papers in the baskets, and I
                  came to take them this afternoon."
               "They are all gone you see," said Matthew, looking in the baskets. "I suppose they
                  were emptied this morning."
               "Yes I see," said Benny, mildly. "I'm sorry. You see I've been sick. I could n't
                  come for a long while." And he held up his hand which was so thin that the cords
                  lay in ridges upon the back of it.
               "Sorry for that," said Matthew. "But it 's a blessing to be well again. You are
                  almost well, ain't you?"
               "Not quite," said the child. "I do n't expect I ever shall be well like other
                  boys."
               "What was the matter with you?" asked Matthew.
               "I fell off an elephant," said the child, "and disculated my leg."
               "Fell off an elephant!" said Matthew, with surprise.
               "Yes," said the child, his face lighting up with a certain smile of pride at
                  having been the subject of a calamity which his new acquaintance evidently
                  regarded as uncommon. "Yes. I 'll tell you how it was. You see I was going home
                  one night and I came along by a door
                  where there was a kind of a tent hung out, and all sorts of animals painted on the
                  tent, and some musicianers in the window, playing music, and oh! a whole crowd of
                  boys and girls standing there and watching. So I asked one of the boys what they
                  were watching for? So he said they were watching for the animals to come out. So I
                  asked him if there were any animals in there. So he said 'yes, there was an
                  elephant, and a solar bear, and a rattlesnake, and two monkeys.' So I thought I
                  would wait awhile too and see if they would come out. By and by a man came out and
                  asked me if I did n't want to see the elephant. So I told him 'yes.' Then he said
                  they wanted a boy to ride the elephant, and if I would go he would give me a
                  shilling and I might see the elephant besides for nothing. Then I asked him if I
                  might see the other animals too, and he said 'yes.' Then I asked him if it was a
                  fair elephant—"
               "A 'fair' elephant?" said Matthew, inquiringly.
               "Yes a fair elephant, because you know I would be afraid to ride him
                  if he was a fair elephant."
               "Oh! you mean a real elephant," said Matthew.
               "Yes. A real, fair elephant. But he said 'no, it was only two men covered up under
                  a skin.' Then I thought I would go; so I went in with him, and he took me inside
                  and he put a little red tunic on me, and gave me a cap to put on, and then did
                  something to my face; I did n't know what he did then, or I would n't have let
                  him; but then he carried me into a great room like a church you know, with saw
                  dust all up and down the middle, and there was ever so many ladies and gentlemen
                  men all crowded in, and the elephant was in the middle, and they hoisted me up on
                  his back and began to lead him round; and every body laughed and clapped and
                  stamped and cheered, until we went up by where there was a great looking-glass
                  over opposite, and I looked in and then I saw that it was a fair elephant after
                  all, and the man had blackened my face all over, so that I looked just like a
                  little nigger monkey. Then I got scared you see and fell down and so I hurt my
                  leg. It was n't broke the doctor said, only disculated. Then they carried me to
                  the hospital; and after I was part cured they sent me home. Did n't you read about
                  it in the papers?"
               "No," said Matthew. "I did n't see any thing about it."
               "Why, I thought every body read about it. They had a whole biography of it in the
                  papers. They made the man pay my mother fifteen dollars too, to help cure me."
               "A biography of it?" asked Matthew.
               "Yes. I expect I've got it here." And with an evidently enjoyable consciousness of
                  being favorably known to fame, the lad fumbled in his pocket and at length drew
                  out a soiled and worn scrap cut from the police reports of a daily paper; which
                  recited that two men connected with Somebody & Co.'s Circus were brought
                  before a magistrate on a charge of maltreating a lad named Benjamin Temple, by
                  inducing him to ride an elephant, in the circus ring and negligently permitting
                  him to fall, by which his hip was dislocated; and that the magistrate discharged them with a reprimand, on
                  their paying fifteen dollars to the boy's mother, towards the expenses of his
                  cure.
               Matthew read the notice and handed it back to the lad; who then in answer to
                  further inquiries related how he lived up town with his mother, and how he had
                  come down to this and several other offices this afternoon as had been his custom
                  occasionally when well, to clear out the waste papers which he was allowed to sell
                  for his own account for his labor; how he had stopped to watch the boys playing
                  tag in the Park, and had become belated though he thought he did n't stop but a
                  minute, and how all the other offices were closed, and he must go home
                  empty-handed. Matthew became quite interested in his story, told in a quaint,
                  young-old way, and his kind listening made the boy quite loquacious. He told of
                  his mother and her washing for a living, and how nicely she ironed, and asked
                  Matthew if he knew any body that would have work for her.
               "Why perhaps I might have some work for her to do myself. How much does she ask? I
                  have n't engaged any body to do my washing yet."
               "Five shillings,—or six," said the child. "But she will do it for you just as
                  cheap as any body will—just as cheap as she can possibly afford to. I know she
                  will. I wish you 'd come round and see her. Could n't you?"
               "Have you any father?"
               The child shook his head, and, with a long breath, said, "I do n't know any thing
                  about him. Mother tells me I must n't ask. But could n't you come and see
                  her?"
               "Could she give me any references?"
               "Oh yes, she could tell you ever so many. There's Mrs. Walters, and there's Miss
                  Harsford—oh is n't she a nice lady?"
               "Miss Harsford!"
               "Yes," said the boy, "do you know her? She's this Mr. Harsford's daughter is n't
                  she? I like her a great deal the best. We live near their house. She comes round
                  to see mother, sometimes. She's been away for a good while; but she's come back
                  now. I saw her the other day from my window. Oh she's got a beautiful garden. Did
                  you ever see her garden?"
               "No."
               "It's beautiful. You ought to see it. Then she gave me a rose-bush out of it. I
                  keep it in mother's window by her ivy. But the leaves are all coming off now."
               Matthew very naturally concluded that if Benjamin's mother could give such
                  references as that, she was just the person he would like to employ to do his
                  washing; so at the child's earnest urging—poor Benny had learned to put no faith
                  in promises—he consented to go up there with him that afternoon; and as it would
                  now do very well to close the offices, they started forthwith.
               From Wall-street they walked along up Broadway until they reached the Park, where
                  Matthew, finding that the uncomplaining child was quite weary with his walk, and
                  that they made but slow progress coupling his fatigue with his lameness, 
                     voluntered
                     volunteered
                   to treat his companion to the unusual luxury of a ride in the small
                  cars. By this conveyance, they were brought within a few blocks of their
                  destination.
               Benny beguiled the way with quaint conversation, pointing out the objects of
                  interest on the route, till, almost before he knew it Matthew found himself
                  climbing the narrow stairs of the tenement house behind his little guide, who
                  limping up the narrow stairs in advance of his new-found friend, and reaching the
                  top, stepped gayly in at a half open door crying out:—
               "Mother, here we are!"
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               WE SELDOM KNOW A BLESSING WHEN WE SEE IT.
               IT will be easier, reader, for your quick intuition to imagine, than it would be
                  for my slow pen to describe, the little mob of conflicting feelings which pursued
                  each other through the agitated mind of the merchant's daughter, as she sat in
                  suspense, while the distinct and vigorous yet gentle step of Matthew reached the
                  top of the stair-case, crossed the narrow landing which served the purpose of an
                  entry, and stopped before the half-opened door. Her confusion of thought became
                  apparent in a confusion of manner, when, in response to Matthew's tap, the happy
                  Benny called out, simultaneously with his wondering mother—"Come in!"—and
                  Matthew's cheerful face and manly form appeared within the room. Why this
                  kind-hearted girl, whose refinement was not so fastidious as to prevent her taking
                  pleasure in the welfare of her poorer neighbors, and who was not unaccustomed to
                  meeting strangers in her visits of kindness, should be embarrassed at so
                  accidental an interview with one whom she had so many times met, and who had at
                  least no reasonable reason for flattering himself that she took any particular
                  interest in his welfare, must be left to conjecture. He was indeed a handsome looking fellow, as he stood there, a few
                  steps within the door, his countenance the picture of health, and frankly
                  expressive of a sympathy in which were mingled curiosity at the scene before him,
                  and sorrow at the sight of the feeble woman thus outstretched upon the cot. His
                  head was uncovered, though the hand which held his hat had halted with it against
                  his chest, as if it were uncertain what to do; and in the instant between the
                  instinctive bow he made to the poor woman, and his exclamation at recognizing
                  Charlotte, it certainly did occur to the latter, among other flashing thoughts,
                  that his was a fine presence. Yet the embarrassment of her thoughts is certainly a
                  mystery. It is quite out of the question to attempt to explain her feelings upon
                  any theory of love at first sight, because it was not first sight; no, not by a
                  score of times. This absurd notion being rebuked, there arises the conjecture that
                  her agitation arose from the fact that the narrative she was about to hear was
                  interrupted; but then that idea is clearly untenable, because the story might be
                  resumed at any time. Then occurs the hypothesis that she might have thought
                  Matthew's unexpected appearance the forerunner of some bad tidings; but this fear,
                  if it had been entertained at all, must have been dispelled by the first few words
                  he spoke. So the: there remains for us only the belief that her agitation was the
                  unreasonable, inexplicable beating of a foolish little heart, that fluttered just
                  because Matthew came near its handsome cage.
               "Why! Mr. Caraby!" said Charlotte, rising as Matthew entered, and speaking in a
                  tone in which pleasure was not entirely submerged in surprise.
               "What an unexpected pleasure," exclaimed Matthew, advancing with a smile in which
                  surprise appeared to heighten pleasure, and offering Miss Harsford his hand.
               Stop a moment! That last clause is liable to misconstruction, to very serious
                  misconstruction. When I say that Matthew offered his hand to Miss Harsford, I mean
                  no more than that he extended his hand to meet hers in a shake of friendly
                  salutation. She extended her hand in return; and it lay an instant in the clasp of
                  his. Like a letter dropped into the post office destined to be taken out again
                  soon and never to be put back?—Perhaps. Well, as a bird in spring time flies half
                  timidly to a strange tree and shoots away again, but will come back and find a
                  home in the green branches before long?—Oh! no. Wait and see.
               "I did not know," said Charlotte, "that you knew Mrs. Temple."
               "No;" said Matthew; "I made acquaintance with my young friend here, at the office,
                  and came up at his suggestion, to see whether I could arrange with her to do some
                  washing for me."
               "She will do it well," said Charlotte, "that I am sure of, if she is able to
                  undertake it. But—"
               And her eyes turned pityingly toward the invalid, who had not yet risen from the
                  cot. Matthew's glance followed in the same direction. Benny, who was glad to see
                  the conversation take a business turn, was already pulling his mother by the dress, to draw her
                  attention to it.
               "Mother," he was saying in a low voice, "this gentleman wants somebody to do his
                  washing for him. I told him you would do it cheap, mother,—cheap."
               The woman, thus invoked, rose slowly and with effort to her feet, and stood
                  resting herself by one hand against the cot.
               "I shall be glad to do it, sir," she said. "I am quite able, too, I think, to do
                  it well. To-day I have had an ill turn, but in general my health is quite
                  good."
               As Matthew pursued the conversation thus opened, Miss Harsford turned to the
                  window to examine the growth of the rose-bush which she had given, the previous
                  spring, to Benny. And in a moment, reflecting that she had no special reason for
                  remaining longer, and surmising also that Matthew might wonder what she tarried
                  for, she determined that the present instant, while his conversation with the
                  laundress was yet unfinished, was a good time for her to slip out and go home. So
                  she turned from the window and stepped towards Mrs. Temple, on her way to the
                  door, meaning to bid her "Good afternoon" in the first pause of the conversation,
                  and then to leave. Matthew, however, who had a very correct notion of the perils
                  of city streets to unattended ladies, at night-fall, already entertained an idea
                  that it might be well for him to offer his escort to Miss Harsford, on her return.
                  He was much too shrewd to open the way for her to leave while his own business was
                  yet unfinished; so he stood,—the rude fellow!—as if wholly unconscious that she
                  was awaiting an opportunity to speak, and kept the shuttle of conversation flying
                  back and forth with the utmost rapidity, until his agreement with the laundress
                  was fully woven, and nothing remained but that he should write down his address
                  for her. This he at length turned aside to do, and was now quite willing, nay,
                  anxious, that Miss Harsford should say, as soon as she pleased:—
               "Good afternoon Mrs. Temple; it is quite too late for me to stay longer. I will
                  come again soon. Meanwhile do be careful and not work too hard."
               And receiving the laundress's grateful acknowledgments of her kindness in coming,
                  she turned towards the door.
               It was now the most natural thing in the world for Mr. Caraby to offer to
                  accompany her through the darkening streets to her father's door. And it would
                  have been the most unnatural thing in the world, she thought,—and she was quite
                  right,—for her to have declined it. She tacitly accepted his escort, therefore,
                  and a civil word of farewell having been exchanged between Matthew and the
                  laundress, he accompanied Miss Harsford down the stairs to the door.
               As they stepped out of doors upon the side-walk, Matthew looked around him. It was
                  beginning to grow dark, in the early twilight of a November afternoon, and there
                  were moreover not many passers in the quiet street. Matthew thought it would do to
                  offer Miss Harsford his arm. So he did.
               Miss Harsford looked down upon the side-walk,— which was certainly rather rough and uneven, and
                  threatened some tripping places and occasions of stumbling. She thought it would
                  do to take it. So she did.
               And thus it came to pass, that when, a few moments afterwards, Miss Arabella Mayes
                  met this young gentleman and lady thus proceeding on their way, it certainly did
                  appear to her that they were walking in an extremely pleasant, amicable and
                  satisfactory manner.
               But how came Miss Mayes to meet them?
               I will explain.
               It so happened that Arabella Mayes, at home in Enneton, suffering from the
                  recollection of her parting with Matthew, and not well knowing what to do with
                  herself, in the sense of loneliness which overcame her after the unexpected
                  quarrel, recollected in the course of a day or two, that she had an invitation
                  from a friend in Brooklyn to make a visit there whenever she could leave home.
                  This had been received in the previous spring; it was an earnest, and as Arabella
                  had good reason to believe an honest invitation to "come whenever you can; only
                  let me know when you are coming;" and Arabella had duly acknowledged it when it
                  was received, expressing her intention of one day accepting it definitely. This
                  done, she had, according to the custom of young ladies in preserving pressed
                  violets, stray notes, locks of hair and sprigs of cedar, and such treasures, put
                  it away safely between the leaves of that volume in her little library which
                  happened just at that time to be most in use. There it reposed, until this present
                  exigency, when, from motives very much like those which moved Matthew to a like
                  course, she concluded she should never have a better time to visit the city than
                  this fall. So out came the note, flying to the floor, when she shook the volume,
                  and with it a little flock of similar articles which had been there secreted.
                  Having read it anew, and feeling assured that it had not, like some of the
                  flowers, lost all its life by keeping, Arabella sent a letter to her friend
                  apprising her that her invitation was at last about to be accepted in good
                  earnest; and in a few days afterwards she in person followed this letter to
                  Brooklyn.
               One thing embarrassed her preparations. She had one little budget of
                  letters,—letters that had not been accustomed to be left around between leaves of
                  books. They were not very large letters, and altogether they did not make a very
                  heavy budget, for correspondence had been only an occasional resource between the
                  writer and herself, who had frequently met. Small as it was however, this packet
                  was a great thing to dispose of. After trying a variety of depositories during her
                  morning of packing the young lady carried it in her pocket all day; and finally
                  the last thing at night, before her trunk was locked for an early departure next
                  morning, she put it in one corner, under a little pile of handkerchiefs which she
                  so cunningly disposed over it that the most you could have conjectured was that
                  there were thirteen handkerchiefs in the pile, instead of only a dozen. Thus
                  ensconced the little budget went with its mistress to make the long expected visit
                  in Brooklyn.
               It came about therefore that the curt note which Matthew had written to Arabella
                  in reference to the fate of that same
                  budget of letters, had not yet reached her, though she had heard before leaving
                  home that he had gone to New York, whether for a visit or a permanent home, she
                  did not know. She was indeed not without an undefined hope that by some good
                  fortune they might meet during her visit to the city. And it further came about,
                  that upon this very day of which I write, she was in New York, with her Brooklyn
                  friend, and was at this very hour riding down town in an omnibus. She was looking
                  out at the window, when the omnibus drew near and passed the corner of the street
                  around which Matthew and Charlotte were now turning on their way from Alfene's to
                  Mr. Harsford's. Arabella was struck with surprise at seeing them. She instantly
                  recognized both; for the young ladies had several times met while Charlotte had
                  been at Harsford's Mills. Matthew and Charlotte however did not observe her.
               "Ah!" said Arabella to herself. "Now I shall see him. I will call on Miss
                  Harsford, and she will contrive to let him know for me that I am here. Then he'll
                  call. I'm sure he will call on me if he knows I am here. I certainly will do that
                  to-morrow."
               To-morrow however was too raw and inclement for the long jaunt from the heart of
                  Brooklyn to the upper part of New York; and so was the next day. It was not until
                  two days afterwards, on Saturday, that Arabella found it practicable to make the
                  intended call upon Miss Harsford.
               As for Alfene the laundress, when Matthew and Charlotte had gone, the poor woman
                  dragged herself to her work again; and hotter and more deadly than the fumes of
                  the half suffocating little furnace fire, was the cruel story which she treasured
                  in her sore heart. The pride of the rich is in their ostentations; the pride of
                  the poor is often in their concealments. This poor woman, with infinite shrinking
                  had, for the love of her son, forced her courage to a disclosure, the utterances
                  of which would fill both herself and her hearer with pain. And now that the
                  opportune time had been opportunely lost, her feelings rebounded with relief, and
                  she was half glad the privilege for which she had so long lived, was gone
                  unimproved.
               How seldom do we know a blessing when we see it.
               The events in life to which we look forward with the highest anticipations and
                  desires, the achievements for which we exert ourselves the most strenuously, the
                  hopes which as they approach fruition give us the most brilliant promises of
                  enjoyment,—how often do these disappoint us even in the very hour in which we
                  seize them, or develop consequences from which we should have shrunk could we have
                  foreseen them. And on the other hand, how often does a cloud of disappointment or
                  of sorrow, which has filled us with apprehension as it approached, break into a
                  refreshing shower of unexpected joy, as it passes overhead.
               Here Matthew Caraby, leaving a prosperous course, so monotonous in its prosperity
                  that he wearied of it, had unconsciously placed himself upon the threshold of
                  abounding temptations, evils and perils, and rejoiced to think how he had
                  "bettered his situation." And Widow
                  Hopley was glad of his coming, unconscious of the means by which he had opened his
                  way. And Matthew thought he had happened in at Mrs. Temple's in the very nick of
                  time to meet Charlotte there, when of all moments he should then most have
                  regretted to interrupt. And the unhappy mother felt a sad deceitful relief in that
                  interruption. And Charlotte Harsford herself, she who above all others should have
                  known, went away, half glad to postpone to a more convenient season, so sad a task
                  as listening to that cruel story.
               Meanwhile, in the progress of events, so gradual that it mocks the patience of my
                  pen, a different hour draws near.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               WHEN A ROGUE SHARPENS HIS KNIFE ON THE LAW'S
                  GRINDSTONE—BEWARE.
               AT the date of these scenes, Dey street, now filled with elegant warehouses from
                  Broadway almost to the North River, and well known as one of the busy commercial
                  streets of the city, was a narrow dirty lane or alley, wherein the dilapidated
                  residences that frowned upon each other over the narrow carriage-way already
                  deserted by the families of the wealthy, were taken in possession by that
                  miserable class who burrow in such streets. The windows of the liquor store, of
                  the corner grocery, and the grog-shop, marked both sides of the street on every
                  block, interspersed here and there with the cellar of a junk dealer, and in the
                  lower end of the street with slop shops, sailors' boarding-houses and emigrant
                  hotels. The widening of the street has since revolutionized—I will not say its
                  moral character, for there may be as much evil behind a brown stone front as
                  behind the most toppling wall in all the Five Points—but has revolutionized its
                  appearance. But at that time it was one of the homes and haunts of vices, small
                  and great.
               
               The end of the street near Broadway, was, however, even at this time, not without
                  its pretensions. A large hotel stood on the upper corner, and a few doors below
                  it, among buildings less disreputable than their further neighbors, stood a house
                  of entertainment very popular with a certain class of men, who as they combined
                  elegance with vice, very appropriately took their stand here, between the
                  splendors of Broadway and the degradation of the street beyond.
               On the afternoon of this day, while Matthew in the counting-room was closing his
                  duties, there sat, here, in the back parlor of this house of entertainment, in
                  chairs opposite each other across a small cherry table, two men; and on the table
                  between them stood a decanter of spirits, with glasses.
               One of these persons was a thin man, of a sallow and unwholesome appearance as
                  respects his person, and a very second-hand aspect with regard to his dress. His
                  wrinkled face was lighted, or rather, I should say, dimmed, by two dull, leaden
                  eyes, whose occasional gleams of intelligence bespoke a natural quickness and
                  mental power, now almost destroyed by habitual intoxication. This man was well
                  known in the lower criminal courts, not as a criminal, but as a counsel. However
                  slight the reader may suppose the difference to be between a lawyer and an outlaw,
                  his opinion, though perhaps widely erroneous in the general, would not, in
                  application to this particular case, be far wrong. There was hardly a rogue in
                  town of sufficient importance to have been brought before the notice of the
                  courts, who had not at one time or another availed himself of the professional aid
                  of Jurat.*
                   He had therefore a large acquaintance, and if it was not of an elevated
                  class, this was no great matter, for it was congenial; and as in no part of the
                  town did he fail to find open doors and free tables and all the hospitalities of
                  vice for the asking, he lived freely, though after all with but a small
                  income.
               
                  
                  *Other members of the family spell the name Jewrat. There are not wanting
                     plausible reasons in favor of that orthography, though I incline on the
                     whole to that adopted in the text.
               
               His companion the reader would have instantly recognized as Arent.
               Drinking here in quiet, aloof from the more noisy company in the front part of the
                  room, these two men entered into a conversation, which, omitting the ingenious and
                  horrible oaths that constantly recurred with the most original variations, was
                  somewhat as follows:
               
                  Arent.
                  And what do you suppose I brought you in here for?
               
               
                  Jurat,
                  (looking at the decanter.)
                  I'm satisfied if you are,—that is, for the present.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  I'd never bring you in here to tipple for nothing. I'd choose jollier
                     company.
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  If you want me to tell you just what I think,—you're up to some rascality, and
                     you reckon that it would be better to have a little law before, eh! instead of
                     after, like last time.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  Come, come! I want your opinion and then your assistance perhaps. But mind,
                     what I have in hand is a piece of strictly legitimate business.
               
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  Yes, I understand. Let us have the facts.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  Suppose a man has a wife—
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  The more fool he,—ha! ha! ha! That 's my opinion, ha! ha! ha!
               
               
                  Arent,
                  (without regarding the interruption,)
                  and his wife gets lost, say gets separated from him on a journey, and he gives
                     her up for dead.
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  Best thing he could do. Sensible fellow that, ha! ha! ha! Is that your case,
                     Arent, eh?
               
               
                  Arent.
                  Come, hold your tongue till I ask you a question. I've no time to
                     lose, if you have,
                  (looking at his watch.)
               
               The lawyer, bearing quietly this rebuke from his companion, upon whose enmity he
                  could not afford to venture, closed his lips upon the edge of his glass and
                  cheered himself with a draught while waiting for his companion to proceed.
               
                  Arent
                  (resuming.)
                  Well, I say, the husband gives her up for dead; perhaps he 's inconsolable and
                     perhaps he is n't; for she was a poor girl, though she is a great beauty, or
                     was in her day. However that 's neither here nor there. At any rate suppose he
                     marries again, and has children; and after all said and done she turns up
                     again.
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  I am to understand that the first wife being still living, the husband marries
                     again, and that there-upon the second, wife being still living, first wife
                     appears or turns up, and turns up alive.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  Alive! Why you do n't suppose she'd trouble him if she were dead?
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  I do n't know about that. According to my idea of a woman, I do n't see any
                     thing impossible in that.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  Of course she's alive. That 's just the point of it, and he did n't know it.
                     But that 's the case I want to ask you about. Man married twice, both wives
                     living.
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  Bigamy.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  That 's rather a tight place, is n't it?
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  In my view, after he married the second wife he 's just about twice as worse
                     off as when he had only one.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  But it 's a criminal offense is n't it?
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  Oh! yes. If that 's all you 're at. It 's five years more or less.*
                      But then he can be got off. Nobody will trouble him unless the women
                     do, and they can be shut up easy. If they show fight bring the man to me.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  
                     
                     *I am informed by my friend the district attorney of Enneton, to whom I am
                        indebted for much information which has aided me to elucidate various
                        points connected with this history, that marrying a second wife or
                        husband is not bigamy, by the law of the State of New York, when the
                        first wife or husband has been absent for five successive years, and the
                        party remarrying shall not know the other to be living within that time.
                        But even in such case the absence and supposed death does not make the
                        second marriage valid. It only "purges the felony," as the law books
                        say,—that is relieves the second marriage of its criminal character and
                        punishment. The parties to the second marriage, however sincere in
                        supposing the first to have been dissolved by death, are exposed, if the
                        supposition prove erroneous, to the misfortune of having the second
                        declared null.
                  
                  But it 's a ball of the other color. What I mean is this. I know the man. I have got my
                     thumb on him; (and the gambler put his thumb on the head of a nail on
                        the surface of the table to signify the efficiency of his control,)
                     and I know the woman.
               
               The lawyer bent upon his companion for once a very keen gaze of his usually heavy
                  and inexpressive eyes, and asked,—"Is he rich?"
               
                  Arent.
                  Yes. Or no. I do n't know which; and I do n't care. He can get money if he
                     wants it. That 's enough for me.
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  You think that a man who goes in for two such luxuries at once should pay for
                     'em? Bring her round to my office. I know just how to manage that man.
               
               The lawyer was not accustomed to place very implicit reliance in the word of this
                  client; and in a matter of so great delicacy as was the case disclosed he felt a
                  great desire to insure the safety of his professional reputation for good faith,
                  by an actual interview. Whether Arent was unable entirely to substantiate his
                  story, or whether he was unwilling to trust the lawyer with the whole case at this
                  stage, or whether the reason that he assigned was the true one, or whether, as
                  perhaps you will think more likely to be the case, he desired to try his own hand
                  in the negotiation first at his own risk and profit, did not clearly appear to his
                  legal adviser. But he replied, after a moment's hesitation, "She's shy; she won't
                  see any body about it."
               The lawyer, conjecturing that he was to gain no emolument from the negotiation,
                  thought it would be safer to have as little to say about the means as possible;
                  and intimated as much to Arent; who replied: "You need n't be afraid. I have n't
                  done with you yet. Besides you can give advice I suppose. Advice of counsel?
               
                  Jurat.
                  Of course.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  And if I pay you out of the proceeds?
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  But the safer way would be to pay in advance. But it 's no difference. Money
                     has no earmarks. I 'm not bound to see where your money comes from, any more
                     than you 're bound to see where my money goes to. That 's my maxim.
               
               
                  Arent,
                  (looking at the lawyer's red nose.)
                  Not hard to see where yours goes to, if I wanted to. But here! (taking
                        some papers from his pocket) I 've sent him that, and that. Read
                     'em. Those are copies.
               
               
                  Jurat,
                  (reading.)
                  Neatly enough written. She writes a good hand.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  I wrote 'em myself.
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  I should say you were used to writing in other people's names.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  (Laughing.)
                  But what do you think of the way I put it to him?
               
               
                  Jurat,
                  (reading the letters, the latter of which was the one which Mr. Harsford
                     received, as related in a previous chapter.)
                  They 're very well done. They are threatening letters, but not with a view to
                     extort money, so it 's no offense. Very good idea that. You rather spurn the
                     idea of money. You scorn it, eh?
               
               
                  Arent.
                  I won't soil my hands—that is she won't—with less than a hundred thousand
                     dollars.
               
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  It 's only a question of who is the biggest fool.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  How?
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  You, to expect to get it, or he, to pay it.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  He can't help himself. I 've had a thousand towards it already, so there 's
                     only ninety-nine more to come.
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  It 's none of my business what you are going to do, but as your friend I tell
                     you you 'll get yourself in a worse place than the fool of a husband. However,
                     so much the better for me who will be called on to try to get you out.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  Yes, 't is your business. I 'm going ahead with it. I 'll run the risk. But I
                     want to know what it will come to.
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  The devil knows.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  Then you 're the very fellow to answer. Suppose I go to him—this husband I
                     mean. I tell him the case plainly. The wife waits to claim him. Very unpleasant
                     affair. Family broken up. Terrible exposure. Second marriage criminal matter.
                     Children illegitimate. Both wives suing for a divorce. Scan.
                        Mag. I step in as a friend to know what can be done. Of course he
                     can't propose but one thing. Suppose I, as a friend of all parties, and acting
                     for the poor woman, accept his offer. What 's the harm of that?
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  If he has the sense of a sneak thief he 'll burn your fingers for you before
                     you 're through. But if he do n't you 're safe enough on one condition.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  What?
               
               
                  Jurat,
                  (with a knowing look.)
                  Provided always, that is to say, that the poor woman gets the
                     benefit of it all.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  Oh, is that all? I 'm easy upon that score. When I 've got the funds I 'll take
                     care of the poor woman. Well now, meanwhile I 'm going to hail from your
                     office.
               
               
                  Jurat.
                  No you do n't.
               
               
                  Arent.
                  Yes I do. Thus. I 'm a friend. You 're the legal adviser who in case of any
                     difficulty will have to be called in. You understand. That 's the way I shall
                     talk about law to him. You 've nothing to do but keep quiet and look on for the
                     present, and whatever comes to your office for me let me know of.
               
               The lawyer, thinking perhaps that in any issue of the affair he could probably
                  make himself useful to one party or another, he was indifferent which, so long as
                  he could be useful, was about to express his assent, when the conversation was
                  suddenly broken off by the client, who rose, and with an oath protesting he could
                  not be loafing about here any longer, paid his charge at the bar and went forth
                  into the street.
               As for the lawyer, he remained in his chair to finish with economy the remainder
                  of the spirits, and reflected on the problem whether he should probably make any
                  thing through his client's venture, and if so on which side of the contest.
                  Meanwhile he consoled himself for not having a more active part in the
                  negotiation, by the thought that his much abused profession was not justly
                  chargeable with the roguery developed by it, since, after all, the roguery was in
                  the clients, who did all the mischief and got all the booty;—too large a share by half,—while the poor counsel were never
                  called in till the thing was all over, when they were expected to shoulder the
                  consequences.
               Although it was hardly dark when Arent appeared in the street, the lamps were
                  lighted. This man, whose sinister purposes we must still follow, lighted a cigar
                  which he put resolutely between his vicious and physically-expressioned lips,
                  turned into Broadway, and bent his steps up that street. He made no haste, but
                  walked deliberately, looking furtively at the foot passengers, as if in hope or
                  perhaps in fear of meeting some one.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               EARNESTNESS OF PURPOSE IS AN EARNEST OF SUCCESS.
               THE next day passed about as usual, so far as I know, with Mr. Harsford, with
                  Arent, with Charlotte, with the laundress, with Benny, and with Matthew. The
                  latter, however, leaving the counting-room for the night, and calling at the Post
                  office on his way home to tea, found there, what was not quite usual so late in
                  the day, a letter for his employer. It was characteristic of Matthew to perform
                  every duty a little better than would be expected. He resolved, therefore,—quite
                  unnecessarily so far as the demands of business were concerned,—to take this
                  letter with him, and after tea to deliver it at his employer's house.
               Carrying the letter carefully deposited in his breast pocket, and stopping now and
                  then to look in at shop windows, the young man passed up Broadway.
               While Matthew was thus commencing his walk home, Alfene, the laundress, in her
                  elevated retreat, was carefully arranging, in a large hamper or basket, those
                  garments upon which her labors of the day previous had been expended, and was
                  making ready to carry them home. A
                  reaction seemed to have come over her feelings, for she moved, though not
                  vigorously, yet with a light and cheerful step about the room, while completing
                  her preparations, and looked from time to time with a gentle smile of affection
                  toward her son, as he sat in the window. The boy had come home from school—for,
                  thanks to the common school system which so thoroughly pervades the community, a
                  child need not go untaught, unless its little hands must be set at work to
                  maintain itself, or to contribute to the resources of its parents. It might be
                  thought that a mother in circumstances so narrow and straitened as those in which
                  this one was now passing life, might properly spare herself the additional burden
                  of sending her son to school, and of course dispensing during the day with those
                  thousand little services by which a child so mature and gentle in disposition as
                  was little Benny, could save her own steps. But it is evident that Alfene did not
                  think of care or pain in her devotion to her child.
               One can carry two burdens balanced one against the other with comparative ease,
                  where he would stagger, overladen, under the unequal weight of either one alone.
                  This was proved in Alfene's case; and the toil which Benny unconsciously exacted
                  from his feeble mother was the only counterpoise which lightened the burden of her
                  own existence; which without him would have been to her feeling a useless and
                  hopeless load. All her thoughts seemed to have this common center; and regardless
                  of probabilities or even of seeming certainties, she laid her plans for the
                  education and welfare of this child;—plans that could not have been more aspiring
                  or more inflexibly pursued, if she had been a royal mother rearing the heir of a
                  kingdom. The child himself entered into all these plans with a gentle, almost
                  timid interest;—the ambition, the energy, the resolution, the daring, were
                  hers.
               Was this not a worthy, a noble ambition for this mother to entertain? Could she
                  put before her thoughts a higher purpose than to train the soul of her child to a
                  perfect and harmonious development of all its powers and faculties? Is there any
                  Machine or Engine more curious in its construction or wonderful in its performance
                  than a well regulated mind; any Architecture more noble than to build a soul; any
                  Oratory more powerful than that of a mother who speaks to generations who never
                  know her name or voice, through the life and deeds of her child; any Art higher
                  than to color the life-long thoughts and the thought-prompted words and deeds of a
                  human being, with purity and happiness and universal love? As we witness the
                  manifestations of a soul trained and habituated to the highest and purest action,
                  when we meet with one in the ripe power and glory of adult life, it seems a palace
                  built by some sovereign who should desire to represent in one edifice every phase
                  of human life; and so going from room to room we seem to see every thing of which
                  we ever heard or read;—and first, in the very lowest story, half underground, is
                  the Will, a great engine, from which by shafts and wheels and bands and a thousand
                  nice arrangements, power is conveyed through all the building to work wherever
                  needed;—and in a strong room near by we
                  find the Passions, a menagerie of wild beasts once, but now well chained and
                  taught to work, which day and night chafe in their cages, snarling and howling at
                  their keeper, Self-Control;—and coming a story higher, Anger is the armory wherein
                  are stored all manner of weapons of defense, and here sits the warder
                  Courage;—and, opposite, Hospitality is the parlor of the soul, wherein all
                  friendly visitors are welcomed;—and Friendship is the boudoir opening from the
                  parlor, yet somewhat guarded from its bustle and crowd;—and Benevolence is the
                  dining hall where all the hungry are fed, Acquisitiveness being the steward,
                  charged to gather in abundantly that he may be able to provide bountifully;—and
                  Compassion is a nursery for the sick, Care and Kindness the nurses;—and the
                  Affections are a conservatory of flowers where all fair and fragrant blossoms
                  grow;—and Imagination is a hall of paintings, with pictures of all places, things,
                  persons, events, that were ever known or conceived;—and next door is the apartment
                  of Memory, the king's librarian, who at a word will give you down any book or turn
                  you to any sentence in the whole royal library;—and Knowledge is a museum crowded
                  with a thousand and a hundred thousand curiosities;—and Doubt is the laboratory
                  wherein all things are brought under test, Judgment the careful chemist;—and
                  Conscience sits near by, as judge, in a white hall of justice, trying the conduct
                  of all, and decreeing reward or punishment, with Remorse for the executioner of
                  his condemnations;—and in the chapel beyond, Reverence worships always;—and
                  Aspiration is the observatory where men sit and gaze on heaven above them, and
                  long to read the stars. Such is the mansion where Wisdom is the sovereign and
                  Virtue the queen, dwelling and ruling therein. What human work can rank higher
                  than thus to build a Soul; either in one's self or in one's child?
               Benny's mother at least had scarcely another object in life than to rear her child
                  and secure to him the highest education her limited means and opportunities
                  enabled her to give. And although she had but an imperfect and partial view of the
                  work to be done, and but an incomplete knowledge of the means by which it was to
                  be accomplished, she spared no pains, nor sacrifice, nor effort, to attain this
                  end. Perhaps it was from love of Art; an ineffaceable trace of the refinements of
                  education and wealth in her former years;—perhaps it was her sanguine judgment
                  that in that field her son would develop genius;—perhaps it was because the mother
                  herself found a relief and pleasure in stimulating his mind in this
                  direction;—perhaps it was because the avenues of progress in every other direction
                  in life seemed closed to him, and in this one alone she could take even now some
                  steps, and find no obstacles at once;—or more probably it was from all these
                  feelings commingled, that the mother had slowly come to look forward to Benny's
                  future as that of an artist. At any rate this was her thought; and in her silent
                  hours of labor she built grand castles in the air, picturing success, wealth, even
                  fame, for the possible future of her boy; and meantime, to realize these dreams,
                  she drew upon every resource within her reach. The rich merchant's garden, which
                  lay like a diorama beneath her windows;
                  the rose-bush and the climbing vine; the miniature of herself, the last relic of
                  days gone by, that lay in its faded case upon the mantel; the figures upon the
                  muslins, lawns and calicoes which passed over her ironing table; the pictures in
                  the shop windows; the trees by the street sides and in the public parks; quaint
                  groups of queer people; the flowers and the shrubs which grew in front of wealthy
                  houses; all these were lessons with which she improved the time she could snatch
                  from her tasks. All these lessons Benny enjoyed, as well as many hours which he
                  spent in the window seat, with his broken slate, reviewing them; but the most
                  inexhaustible of all was that which was to be learned from the shop windows. All
                  the windows of paintings and of books and engravings in Broadway, he well knew;
                  and from week to week marked the changes which took place in them, as one after
                  another the old objects of interest were removed to make room for new ones. These
                  windows were Benny's books; only "he had to wait for the shopkeepers to turn over
                  his leaves for him," as he said. Windows of toys, of tools and apparatus, and of
                  various goods, some useful, some luxurious, he occasionally looked at; but the
                  print shops were his great resort, and formed the landmarks and the half-way
                  houses of the street to him.
               This afternoon, or rather evening, for the hour of lamplighting was now drawing
                  near, Benny was waiting for his mother to complete her preparations for an evening
                  walk; as he was going to assist her in carrying home the clothes, and to take a
                  view, on the way to and fro, of the shop windows. His mother seemed to feel much
                  better than she had appeared the day before. Although she feared she had, by her
                  delay, lost a customer, yet she had found a new one in Matthew, whose dealings, if
                  not so important, promised to be far pleasanter. The sympathy which Charlotte had
                  shown, and the willing desire she had expressed to hear the story which this
                  mother was at once anxious and reluctant to relate, had in some degree reassured
                  her. Her elasticity of feeling was however chiefly owing to one of those strange
                  reactions or intervals of ease so common in the progress of her disease, which
                  constantly deceive the sufferer into an assurance of convalescence. Benny too was
                  in good spirits with the prospect of the walk in Broadway with his mother.
               Although her preparations were in fact complete, Alfene busied herself with
                  arranging, with scrupulous care, the scant furniture of her room, while she waited
                  the closer approach of evening. Benny had observed that his mother never went out
                  except in the evening, unless it were unavoidable, and then she evidently went
                  with great reluctance.
               "Why do you never go out with me in the day time?" he sometimes asked.
               "If we go in the evening we save candles; besides the shop windows look so much
                  handsomer in the evening."
               "But mother, sometimes when you have n't any work to do you might go in the day
                  time; and it would be better for you, I know it would."
               
               To this the mother would make no reply.
               Why she feared the daylight, and only at evening ventured forth to do the
                  indispensable errands of her calling, and to gather such relief from toil, for
                  herself, and instruction for her child, as she then could, was not for him to
                  understand, poor boy.
               This evening, while waiting for his mother to finish her preparations for the long
                  expected walk, Benny was improving the time by studying the miniature which was
                  inclosed in the faded morocco case.
               This miniature, the only work of art which this young pupil had ever held in his
                  own hands, was the likeness of his mother.
               It was one of those exquisite pieces of miniature painting, for which, in years
                  gone by, the delicate pencils of certain French artists were famous.
               At this portrait, one who had known the living original only by her present thin
                  and pallid countenance and wasted form, would have gazed with astonishment. The
                  likeness could not be mistaken. Yet how diverse! It seemed as if the animate and
                  inanimate had changed places. As if the bright and fresh complexion, the glossy
                  hair, the full fair neck, the rounded form filling well the dress, so elegant yet
                  so simple, and the brilliant eyes, whose light had been admirably reflected by the
                  artist's skill,—as if this must be the living reality, the Divine Art-work; and as
                  if the other, the pale cheek touched in one burning spot, by the pencil of
                  disease, with an awkward counterfeit of the color of health, the dull, faded
                  complexion, the weary, hopeless eyes, the thin, emaciated form,—as if these were
                  the inanimate copy, Man's poor imitation. In the contrast the lifeless was
                  life-like, the living was death-like. Still, the likeness was
                  unquestionable. This indeed is the true power of the art of portraiture; so to
                  catch the whole life of the original, as by depicting a wonderful generalization
                  of the thousand elements of its appearance, to present a likeness at once
                  historical and prophetic. There are portraits which so completely embody the very
                  life itself that the original may pass through all those changes which pleasure,
                  passion, or misery have power to work, and never, not even in Death, lose the
                  likeness. Such a portrait was the miniature of Benny's mother. Benny was never
                  tired of studying it. And now, as darkness was coming on, he sat at the open
                  window looking at it by the fading light.
               "It is beautifully done, mother;—who did it?"
               "A French artist in Paris. I think there will not be a great many more such
                  pictures painted, at least after a few years."
               "Why, mother?"
               "They have a way now of taking pictures by the sun's rays. They can take one in a
                  few minutes, and very exact indeed."
               "I do n't see how they do that, mother."
               "I do not understand it myself, my child. It is a new invention. I am going to
                  learn about it if I can, one of these days, to tell you. I saw the place where
                  they take that kind of pictures in Broadway, a few days ago. They call them
                  daguerreotypes."
               
               "Let us go and see it to-night."
               "They are not open in the evening," said the mother. "They can only take
                  daguerreotypes in the day time, so that we can't go."
               "Why can't we go?"
               "Because it 's in the day time and I do n't think it 's best to go."
               "Well, I do n't care very much. They can't be as beautiful as this is. What is
                  this painted on, mother?"
               "It is ivory."
               "Is that ivory? Is it a piece of an elephant's tooth?"
               "Yes."
               "What broad ones he must have. Who did you say painted it, mother?"
               "A French artist. His name was Isabey. He was the finest miniature painter in
                  Paris. There was another one, some people thought better; but I liked Isabey's
                  pictures best. They were so delicate and soft. Augustin was the name of the other;
                  now I recollect it."
               "I do n't think this looks so much like you, mother, as it used to. Or else
                  perhaps it 's because I 've looked at it so much. But it has n't any wrinkles in
                  the forehead, mother."
               "Have I got any wrinkles in my forehead?" said the mother, smiling, and putting
                  her hand up to feel. The poor woman had no other mirror than her boy's eyes.
               "Oh, yes. Of course I should have. They have come since that was taken. That is
                  not Monsieur Isabey's fault. Do you know what is the painters' rule about painting
                  wrinkles, Benny?"
               "No, mother; what is it?"
               "The rule is, 'never count the wrinkles.' It is a very good rule I think. If I was
                  painting an old gentleman and should count all his wrinkles and take great pains
                  to put them all into the portrait, he would look so old that he would n't know
                  himself when he saw it. When the forehead is wrinkled you must give the forehead
                  in the picture a wrinkled appearance, but 'never count the wrinkles.'
                  When an artist paints another person, just as when we talk about other people, he
                  ought to present a pleasant view of him and not count up his defects, and contrive
                  how he can show up every one of them. But now Benny I'm ready I believe."
               Benny took up his end of the basket at his mother's word, and the two proceeded
                  down stairs to the street and thence out to Broadway.
               Carrying their heavy burden slowly, and frequently stopping to rest, and to rub
                  the hands that smarted with incipient blisters, the mother and child walked slowly
                  down the thoroughfare, now brilliantly lighted.
               Before a large window, filled with paintings and mirrors,—a favorite halting place
                  in Benny's rambles,—they stopped for a longer pause than usual.
               "Ah! mother," said Benny, "they've turned over the page for us. See! The picture
                  of ships is gone, and there 's a beautiful country picture. Oh! is
                     n't it nice mother?"
               "A landscape, Benny," said his mother, instructively.
               "Yes; a landscape; ah! that 's fine. If I 'm ever a painter I 'm going to paint
                  country pictures—landscapes, I mean. I
                  like the country. Is n't that a splendid mountain? and see! there 's another
                  mountain looking right over his head;—unless it 's a cloud. Do the mountains look
                  as blue as that, mother?"
               "Sometimes. Do you like that picture very much?"
               "Yes."
               "What part of it do you like best?"
               "Well, I think I like the mountains best. I am not afraid of the mountains. I do
                  n't like sea pictures half so well. I 'm—I 'm rather afraid of sea pictures, and
                  ships, and storms, mother, but the mountains never do any harm. I should like to
                  live in the country and have a mountain live near me."
               "Do you see any thing there that you think you could draw?"
               "Yes, I think I could draw the great elm-tree that hangs over in the front; and I
                  think I could draw the mountains; that is the outline of them. I 'll try that.
                  That 's a beautiful picture. But mother, should n't you think he would have put a
                  river in,—just a glimpse of the river through the trees down in the meadow there;
                  or a pond, a little pond?"
               "I do n't know. Perhaps it is some real scenery; painted from nature. Then it
                  would n't do for the artist to put in a pond or a river which did n't belong
                  there."
               "Oh, is it a real scene?" asked the boy who seemed to be disappointed at the
                  thought that the landscape was only a copy from nature, not the creation of the
                  artist's imagination. "I thought it could n't be a real place it 's so beautiful.
                     I never saw such a beautiful place. I wonder who painted it. Do
                  you know, mother?"
               "No."
               "Oh, there 's his name on that log down in the corner, under the shadow—'Cole,
                  1846.' See, mother. It 's Mr. Cole's picture. Is he famous, mother?"
               "I do n't know."
               "I thought you knew who all the great painters were."
               "I do n't know who is famous now," said the mother sadly, but with a
                  smile. "But now," added she as if to change the subject, "look at that engraving
                  there."
               "Which one, mother?"
               "That one leaning against the large mirror."
               "I see it. The prisoner in prison. There 's the jailor with his big keys holding
                  the door. Is that a line engraving, mother?"
               While this conversation, and much more, was being prolonged before the window, so
                  full of interest to these poor people, Matthew, on his way home and carrying Mr.
                  Harsford's letter yet safe in his pocket, came by.
               "Aha!" exclaimed he to his new acquaintances cordially, yet quietly, so as not to
                  attract the attention of passers by to them. "Good evening. Taking a walk?"
               "Yes," said Benny; "and looking at the pictures. See that one. Is n't it a fine
                  one?"
               "Very good-looking," conceded Matthew, "but rather a rough country."
               "We are going home with some clothes," said the mother to Matthew in an
                  apologetical tone, and turning to
                  proceed upon the errand she had almost forgotten.
               "Will you call for mine as you come back?" asked he. "It 's fortunate that I met
                  you; as I am going up town to night of an errand, I shall only be at home a short
                  time now."
               The three stood facing the window, Benny being between his two elder companions.
                  As they spoke a shadow fell across them.
               "Mother! mother!" whispered the boy pulling her dress, and pointing furtively at
                  the mirror in the back of the window.
               Matthew looked up as he heard this timid exclamation, and saw reflected there
                  beyond the woman's form, the black head, and sinister, scowling countenance of the
                  man whose company he had so suddenly fallen into, and so suddenly escaped from on
                  his arrival in the city. Cool as he was by nature and by habit, he started
                  involuntarily as he saw that a quick glance of those black eyes met his in the
                  glass, and he thought the recognition boded no good.
               While this thought flashed through his mind he observed that the woman, meeting
                  also a recognition from this man who stood doggedly awaiting the impression his
                  apparition should make, started, trembling violently, and caught at the
                  window-post for support; while she gasped to her son, "Come, Benny, quick!"
               It was too late. The interview she would avoid was inevitable. The precautions she
                  had taken so long to elude this man were now at an end. He had found her at last.
                  Even darkness, her last retreat and protection, no longer concealed her from him.
                  She must meet him now face to face.
               "Ah!" said Arent in a voice in which irony and a malicious joy were ill 
                     diguised
                     disguised
                   under a tone of politeness. "Ah! So I have found you at last?"
               The yellow lights gleamed on the poor woman's face as she turned away her head.
                  Matthew had never seen a paler despair than hers.
               "Why keep yourself so private?"
               "Leave me," said the woman, faintly.
               "Now, you do n't want me to. You would not have me do so. You do n't know how glad
                  I am to see you."
               "Is it not enough," said she, gathering strength and turning upon him vehemently,
                  while she drew her wondering child closely to her side, as if at once to protect
                  him and to conceal this man from his curious sight, "Is it not enough that you
                  have done already? Let me alone. I ask nothing from you."
               "Hush, not so loud, Alfene," said he, deprecatingly.
               "Let me alone then. What would you have, after I'm lost? Would you poison my boy
                  too?"
               With that audacity which the maternal instinct alone can inspire, this frail woman
                  clasping her son to her side braved his threatening frown, and gazed into his
                  ill-omened eyes till he dropped them from her countenance.
               "I tell you," said she in a quiet, low voice, but with a hissing
                  distinctness, terrible to hear in the voice of a woman, "I tell you
                  that I will be let alone. If I have n't suffered enough, I 'll suffer more. If I
                  have n't done enough, I will do—more. But I will be rid
                  of you."
               The gambler bent forward, and whispered a few words into her reluctant ear, and
                  stood to watch their effect.
               The agitated woman raised her eyes and made as if she would speak; but she
                  relapsed into uncertainty, and said nothing.
               He whispered again to her; and then added, "Will you come with me now?"
               With a sudden resolution she started forward. "Benny stay till I return," she
                  said; and then following Arent, who had already turned down the street in
                  anticipation of her decision, the man and the woman passed into a cross street and
                  were lost in the darkness from Matthew's view.
               Leaving the child guarding the basket where it stood, Matthew slowly turned and
                  pursued his way homeward pondering on the strange scene. The more he thought of it
                  the more mysterious did it seem; until it was put out of mind, for a time, by
                  matters more serious to him.
               When Matthew arrived at Mrs. Hopley's, he found that lady, usually so good-humored
                  and cheerful, seated behind the counter, supporting her head with her left hand,
                  while with the right she held the handkerchief with which from moment to moment
                  she wiped from her eyes tears such as only some fresh and heavy sorrow could have
                  caused to flow. A little fellow with bare head and feet, and unwashed and tattered
                  garments, attending for a penny's worth of stale rolls, (the penny for which lay
                  unregarded on the counter, peeping out from under his grimy hand,) stood looking
                  over the show-case at her, in mute astonishment that a lady with such piles of big
                  loaves of bread should ever cry.
               "What 's the matter?" exclaimed Matthew.
               The widow raised her head at the well-known voice and pushed towards him a paper
                  which lay open upon the counter. She put her finger upon a paragraph which ran as
                  follows: 
                     IROQUOIS BANK. SINGULAR DEVELOPMENTS.—Facts have come to light in reference
                        to this institution, which is situated at Harsford's Mills, that show it to
                        be an utterly worthless concern. The cashier has disappeared, leaving "a
                        beggarly account of empty boxes;" and the same day the sheriff took
                        possession of the said boxes under an attachment at the suit of the holder
                        of a protested draft,—much good may they do him. The institution has never
                        been in very good odor, being situated in the interior, but mostly owned by
                        parties here and elsewhere. The bills were discredited day before yesterday,
                        but the circulation was small here, being mainly maintained at the West. We
                        understand that under the charter the stockholders are personally liable for
                        the debts. A small portion of the stock had been put off on parties
                        unacquainted with the concern; but the greater part is in the hands of the
                        original projectors of the scheme. It is said that a considerable amount is
                        held by a well-known commission merchant on Hanover Square.
                  
               
               Matthew read this paragraph very coolly; and nodded as if to say he had expected
                  as much all along. He was rather pleased than otherwise, for it verified his
                  prophecy to Mr. Harsford. He looked at the widow again, but did not at all
                  understand how so common-place an event
                  as the bursting of a bank, the defrauding of its bill-holders and the
                  impoverishment of innocent stockholders should cause any uneasiness to her.
               "Oh! Mr. Harsford," sighed the poor woman, who was by this blow made
                  penniless.
               "I 'm sorry for him," said the young man; "but do not let that affect
                  you. He can bear it better than you could I doubt not. It won't hurt him. He won't
                  even feel it."
               The widow rose with an air which showed that she had more to tell than she could
                  trust herself to utter, and went back to the sitting room. Matthew, struck with
                  vague apprehensions, hastened after her. From a little drawer, the key of which
                  she carried, she took some papers, and showed him a handsome specimen of engraving
                  in which, among wreaths and railroad cars, figures and flourishes, faces and
                  scrawling signatures, Matthew picked out the information that Sarah Hopley was the
                  owner of fifty-three shares of the capital stock of the Iroquois Bank of the par
                  value of one hundred dollars each. She pointed to this bit of paper, so suddenly
                  transformed to her from a treasure to a curse, and looked up at her companion
                  without saying a word.
               Matthew did not know what to say. When those in trouble will not utter a word of
                  complaint, one does not know how to utter a word of consolation.
               But when he saw in the upper corner the recent date, the truth flashed across him;
                  and as he became conscious that it might be that his letter, cunningly devised to
                  ingratiate himself with the merchant, had been the means of bringing a calamity so
                  sore upon the best friend, almost the only earthly benefactor he ever knew, he
                  could but cry out with pain,
               "Oh! He gave you this?"
               The widow nodded.
               "I see through it all," he said. "I see. The heartless man," said Matthew,
                  speaking through his teeth. "What's that sum to him? It's every thing to you. He
                  shall make it good."
               "It 's not his fault," said the widow, speaking for the first time.
               "Not his fault?" cried Matthew, with indignation. "He invested the money for you?
                  Did he not? Well! He knew that it was coming. He knew it. He knew 't
                  was worthless;—worse than worthless."
               "How?" asked the widow.
               That little word took all the color from Matthew's indignation, and in an instant
                  filled him with grief. He lamented, he walked back and forth, he threw himself on
                  the sofa, he uttered extravagant self reproaches and said it was all his fault;
                  until the poor widow, unable to get any explanation, was afraid that the loss had
                  quite turned his head. But these self reproaches were too extravagant and severe
                  to be uppermost long, and he soon came to relate to her quietly, but with many
                  pangs of regret, the circumstances which led to his letter to Mr. Harsford, and
                  what its contents were, and in turn from her he heard how the merchant, only a day
                  or two afterwards, gave her the stock in exchange for her little fund.
               
               If there ever is a warm and pure affection of gratitude between man and woman,
                  involving neither the instinct of the child nor the passion of the lover, it was
                  exemplified in the love which Matthew bore to this kind widow. She had taken him
                  up when every other hope forsook his heart, and from the beginning of her kindness
                  his welfare dated. Moreover, she had by patient nursing saved Roselle from death,
                  and made her what she was, useful and happy, though a poor blind girl still.
                  Matthew had been buffeted and played upon, bargained sharply with and almost
                  bought and sold by all the world; and now there were but few persons of all his
                  acquaintance in whose disinterested affection he had any confidence; and first in
                  claims to gratitude was the widow. No interests of his own weighed a feather
                  against the welfare of this friend, and when after tea the sight of the letter he
                  had brought reminded him of his errand at Mr. Harsford's house, he instantly
                  determined to lose no time, but to seek opportunity that evening to confront his
                  employer with the charge of his fraudulent dealing with Mrs. Hopley, and to insist
                  with all his power that reparation full and complete should be made her. This he
                  resolved should be done if there were law enough in the State to do it; as he
                  said. He would leave no means untried to compel the man to disgorge.
               Full of this purpose, and with an indignation in no wise abated by reflection,
                  Matthew, at about eight o'clock that evening, ran up the steps of his employer's
                  door, and rang the bell for admission.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               'TIS HARD KNOWING WHAT TO SAY WHEN A KNAVE ASKS YOU TO TELL THE
                  TRUTH.
               AT the moment when Matthew, without the door, rang the bell, Mr. Harsford, within,
                  was in deeper trouble than ever yet before.
               Fifteen minutes, or thereabouts, before Matthew had arrived at the house, Mr.
                  Arent had ascended the same steps, and rung the same bell, upon his daring errand;
                  an errand indeed more daring than the reader fully knows; and had been admitted to
                  the house, and within the house, to the study of the merchant. And now in that
                  apartment, these two men, these two miserable schemers of frauds and cheats, this
                  respectable and this disreputable trader in the ruin of the innocent and
                  confiding, sat face to face; or rather mask to mask, for both studied to hide the
                  real working of their thoughts behind the false expressions of their
                  countenances.
               The true character of the schemes by which Arent was accustomed to extort from the
                  world that living which he considered the world owed him, has been developed by
                  this narrative somewhat more fully than that of the contrivances and expedients to
                  secure the enjoyment of other people's
                  money which Mr. Harsford dignified with the name of his "business."
               In the popular view, undoubtedly, Mr. Harsford's business was reputable and
                  praiseworthy, (so long as it was successful,) while Arent's was not. Mr.
                  Harsford's modes of acquisition were certainly far more genteel, and far more
                  cunningly contrived to avoid immediate detection and legal punishment, than the
                  reckless tricks and extortions of his fellow swindler. But the reader is mistaken
                  if he supposes that because the nominal commission merchant had a counting-room
                  wherein to ensnare his victims, while Arent ranged around the town, casting his
                  net wherever he saw a fish; because the merchant put a "Co." after his name over
                  the counting-room door, while Arent pretended neither to a sign nor a partner; or
                  because the former went home at night to a fine house, was received into stylish
                  society, drove his own carriage, and was complimented occasionally in a city
                  newspaper, while the life of the latter bore no such tokens of prosperity;—that
                  therefore the money getting schemes of the one scoundrel were in any important
                  respect more honorable or truly commendable than those of the other. The
                  entangling affairs which this narrative has disclosed were by no means all of
                  those which beset the merchant at this time. The same causes which involved him in
                  a false position towards the Widow Hopley, had involved him, operating through
                  other circumstances, in far more serious ways. Of all the thousands of dollars
                  which, during a fifteen years' business, he had spent in luxurious living and
                  ostentatious show, very few had been earned by any benefit he had conferred on the
                  community; very few would he ever have had if those from whom he gained them had
                  not been deluded by specious promises and imposed on by false returns and showy
                  but valueless compensations. A short period there was indeed, after his second
                  marriage, and following his first settlement in New York, a period of five years
                  or so, during which he had followed the legitimate business of a merchant; but he
                  had gradually abandoned the slow gains of that vocation, and had involved himself,
                  step by step, in a vast congeries of complicated and incomprehensible concerns;
                  stock speculations, the erection of bubble companies and corporations; the receipt
                  and management of trust funds, the negotiation of loans upon fictitious
                  securities, and a hundred schemes of other kinds whereby he could obtain the use
                  of other people's money for his own purposes. Once obtained, this money was not
                  destined to be repaid, if any shift could be devised whereby his good name and
                  credit could be preserved without it; or, when pressed by the necessity of actual
                  payment, some new scheme of speculation would supply means to discharge the
                  liabilities of the old one; bringing, however, in its train, an increased burden
                  to be borne. Nothing but his fertility in devising miserable expedients and his
                  agility in executing them, could have evaded so long the fatal result of the
                  pressure of these things; but by means of an extraordinary skill and alertness, he
                  had thus far succeeded in eluding the catastrophe which pursued him, and which he
                  now saw in the distance drawing nearer and nearer upon his flying footsteps; and
                  thus he had been able still to maintain
                  his place in the public esteem as a man to whom money was no object; that is to
                  say, a man to whom money was the only object. But, drown old cares in new as he
                  would, he was conscious that he was drawing near the end of his strength, and that
                  without some resource, as yet unfound, he must soon succumb.
               And now, as if to complete the utter misery of his case, Arent approached him.
               Mr. Harsford's study was a large room upon the rear of the mansion, looking out
                  upon the garden. In this room, at the further end, before a library table under
                  the chandelier, he sat; while his visitor, unknown to him as yet, approached
                  him.
               Mr. Arent hastened eagerly up the room, and affecting the utmost cordiality,
                  seized the astonished merchant by the hand, exclaiming, "How do you
                  do, sir? How do you do? It gives me great pleasure to meet you again,
                  notwithstanding,—ah! Great pleasure. Great pleasure. But you do not recollect
                  me."
               "Your countenance, sir, is perhaps not unfamiliar, but I—I can not call your
                  name."
               "Ah, I do n't doubt it, sir. It 's so long since we have met. My name is Arent,
                  sir. Ah! I presume that I know you, sir, much better than you know me. I am but a
                  private individual."
               And he bowed, smiling in indication of the compliment he intended.
               "I thought you would begin to recognize me soon. I knew your father very well some
                  years ago. Is Mrs. Harsford quite well?"
               "Quite so."
               "Ah. And the young people?"
               "Yes."
               "Ah."
               There was a pause during which Mr. Harsford sat as if waiting to learn the object
                  of the visit. The gambler seemed not to be at all embarrassed by the pause, for he
                  deliberately took a chair and composed himself to enjoying a meditative
                  silence.
               "Ah," said he, "how time flies!"
               This striking remark seemed to have reference to some reminiscences into which the
                  merchant could not enter, and he therefore made no response.
               The nervous merchant sat uneasily, as if impatient at the unexplained
                  interruption. Arent seemed rather to wait for him to grow impatient, for he sat
                  still, with his eyes half closed, as if the bright light were too strong; but out
                  from beneath his heavy eyelids he was studying the countenance of the man with
                  whom he was about to deal.
               "I would not have believed," he said, "that it was twenty years ago that we had
                  that terrible winter; 1828 it was. You remember it I suppose. You must
                  indeed."
               The merchant was not inclined to go over the past with the harrow of any chance
                  gossip that might offer. He rose, saying, "Excuse me, sir, if I say that my time
                  is valuable; and if you have no special matters, requiring immediate attention, it
                  would be much more agreeable to me to see you at another time when I shall be more
                  at leisure."
               
               "Ah! my dear sir," said the visitor with an air of commiseration, "that 's just
                  what it is. Matters of immediate importance."
               "Please proceed."
               "But there 's the trouble. When one brings sad news he does not know how to tell
                  it. And when he brings very glad news to one who for twenty years has given up all
                  hope, he does not know how to break that. But when one comes, as I suppose I do,
                  with that which is such a great joy, and yet after all at the same time a sad
                  calamity, what can he say to begin?"
               "I do not understand you," said the pale merchant; who did understand him now,
                  perfectly.
               "Are we alone?" said his visitor looking around, "quite alone? For I come as a
                  friend, and I know how you will appreciate my caution."
               The merchant bowed.
               "You have received," asked the other in a low voice, leaning forward, "some
                  letters recently, from—from a very unexpected correspondent—a person you in fact
                  thought dead? Eh?"
               The merchant made no reply.
               "I know that person," continued Arent, watching the effect of his words. "And
                  while I appreciate the hardship of her position, and the justice of her urgent
                  demands, I have felt also a sympathy for a family I have known so long. I have
                  come as a mutual friend to interpose, with the hope that the interests of all
                  parties shall be subserved. She is impatient. I deprecate it, sir, I regret it,
                  but still I can not wonder at it. Consider what a position she is placed in; to
                  discover at last the home in which she belongs. Delay is irritating to her.
                  Suspense infuriates her. I appreciate your very delicate and embarrassing
                  position. I do n't see what you can do. But she will not keep quiet long. As a
                  friend of the family—a mutual friend—I have interposed. As circumstances have
                  thrown the whole facts into my knowledge, and she looks on me as—as—with some
                  respect—yes, and I may say gratitude—I have prevailed upon her to put the whole
                  case in my hands for a very short time, and meanwhile to await quietly the result.
                  But she 's hard to manage. If I had not been determined to do what I could on
                  behalf of all concerned, I could never have restrained her impetuosity a day. She
                  means well I know, I concede it, sir, but she is rash; she burns with excitement.
                  She means well; but she will make havoc if we are not careful. Mischief!
                  Mischief!"
               The merchant, still incredulous, and determined to continue so, indignantly
                  interrupted these remarks by pointing to the door and motioning the speaker away.
                  "Enough, sir. You 've delivered your message. I 've nothing to say to you. You may
                  go."
               "Certainly, sir," replied the wily man, feigning to comply, but by no means
                  intending to do so. "Certainly. I will not trespass by saying one word more than
                  you wish to hear, even to save your family from such a catastrophe. I must respect
                  your wishes though I mourn for your fate."
               "The whole thing," exclaimed the merchant, losing his self-possession, "is an
                  infernal lie from beginning to end. If
                  you think to frighten me with your bugbear stories you are very much
                  mistaken."
               "I knew that your judgment would dictate the utmost caution in proceeding in this
                  matter," replied the visitor, "but I had supposed that you would rather scrutinize
                  the proofs in private, than have them for the first time laid before you in
                  public. Still I am prepared to make great allowance for the effect of so terrible
                  a discovery on your feelings."
               If the suggestion did not at once have the intended effect on the merchant, it had
                  another which equally answered the purpose. Though he was not prepared to continue
                  the conversation for the sake of avoiding immediate publicity, the offering of
                  proofs suggested to him the idea that by humoring the design which he attributed
                  to his visitor he might draw him on, until his threats should assume the form of
                  an actual attempt to extort money. Then the conspiracy, as he thought it, could be
                  readily crushed.
               "Stay," said he, "what would you have?"
               These words revealed his purpose to the other, who replied, "I want nothing. If
                  you are satisfied with the present course of things, I am. I have done my best,
                  and she must take her own way now."
               "If you have any thing to show for the truth of your story I will hear it. If not,
                  the sooner you are gone the safer you are."
               "It will be useless to refer to the origin of this difficulty," said the other,
                  standing where he had risen a few minutes before. "The facts you doubtless know
                  better and remember more keenly than I. How and where you lost her. How, soon
                  afterwards, you married again. The absurd things that busybodies said; impertinent
                  people who did not know how truly, how unalterably you loved her. Yes, though
                  circumstances did look suspicious, I have no reason to doubt your sincerity; and
                  that she has only to appear now to be claimed by you."
               "Men are not to be called in question for what they may have done so long ago. It
                  is twenty years since."
               "It was not twenty years after you gave up your wife for lost when you took up
                  with this other one. Twenty weeks would be nearer to it. True she was rich, and
                  there are many circumstances to be taken into account, but the time was short,
                  certainly very short. But suppose 't is twenty years. She's your wife still. Do
                  you suppose a woman's love fades out in twenty years?"
               "But where has she been all this time? Impossible. People do n't live in silence
                  twenty years to speak in this style at the end of it all, when—when it's just too
                  late!"
               "It does n't lie on me just now at any rate to explain all the apparent
                  improbabilities of her history. All that in good time. The fact in hand now is
                  that your wife you thought was dead is alive, and claims her own. People have
                  disappeared for twenty years and come out at last before now. People have been
                  shut up in prisons and asylums; some people have been driven mad by terrible
                  frights; and some people," he continued, lowering his voice almost to a whisper,
                  "some people have been shut up in mad-houses in their right minds, while twenty
                  years passed away like a night, and have come out at last to astonish everybody. But she 's in
                  earnest about this," he added. "She knows what she 's about now. Oh if you knew
                  what a time I had had to persuade her to wait till I had forewarned you. I don't
                  know whether you would recognize her now," he continued, taking from his pocket a
                  faded red morocco case. "That was taken several years ago. She 's seen much
                  trouble since;—yes, and before too, for the matter of that."
               He opened the case and held it toward the merchant, who with a pale face, beaded
                  with perspiration on the forehead, studied the miniature.
               "That proves nothing," replied he at length, for the time, at least, convinced
                  that there was possibility of truth in this fearful story. "That proves nothing.
                  She may have been dead long ago after all. If she was alive ten years ago, she may
                  be dead now."
               To this remark Mr. Arent had no reply at hand. He did not know what an impression
                  he had made upon the mind of his victim, already almost overwhelmed by other
                  troubles, and he was about to concede this point by silence and pass to the next,
                  when he was furnished with a ready and conclusive answer by an unexpected
                  circumstance.
               A servant entered; and approaching Mr. Harsford, said, in answer to his inquiring
                  look:—
               "A young man wants to see you, sir. Somebody from the office, I believe. Says he
                  wants to see you on very particular business."
               Matthew's business was somewhat particular; but he had not so described it to the
                  girl. She was however a somewhat timid young person, standing in some awe of Mr.
                  Harsford; the more so that he was sometimes very severe and inconsiderate in his
                  reproofs when she admitted to his private study unwelcome visitors whom he thought
                  she should have excluded:—for example, duns. She was wont therefore to state as
                  strong a case as she could, whenever she thought it probable that Mr. Harsford
                  would feel interrupted by a visitor, to the end that she at least might seem
                  justified in admitting him.
               On this occasion the merchant was not unwilling to be interrupted.
               "Show him in immediately," said he.
               Although Mr. Harsford was prepared to be glad of any interruption which might
                  break this interview, and postpone, for a time at least, the trouble which was now
                  pressed upon his attention, yet nothing certainly could have been more unfortunate
                  for Matthew, nothing for Mr. Harsford himself, than that Matthew should have been
                  the one to appear just at this instant.
               He entered, however; and as he entered he saw the two men at the other end of the
                  room. He recognized instantly Mr. Harsford, whose face was toward him, he being
                  still sitting at his desk. Arent had risen from his seat, and stood with his face
                  turned away from Matthew. The miniature, although not yet noticed by Matthew, lay
                  on the desk before the merchant.
               "Good evening, Mr. Caraby," called out Mr. Harsford, with a cordiality of voice
                  very unusual in his greeting, or in his
                  conversation with his clerk, and beckoning the young man forward.
               "Now," thought he, "I shall have an interruption, or, if not an interruption, at
                  least a witness, to this dialogue."
               The stranger stood without moving, facing in the other direction.
               Matthew, unconscious of the recognition he was destined to meet, walked boldly
                  down the room with even more than his accustomed energy. He was revolving in his
                  mind how he should attack his employer with his charges on behalf of Mrs. Hopley,
                  as soon as this third person should leave them alone.
               "That came for you to-night, sir," he said, handing the letter to Mr. Harsford. "I
                  found it at the Post office as I came by, and thinking it might be of importance,
                  I brought it up."
               As Matthew stood before his employer the stranger at his side turned full upon him
                  a black and sinister countenance, bristling with the same smile of covert and
                  treacherous triumph which he had an hour before seen reflected in the mirror in
                  the print-shop window. Matthew involuntarily started with astonishment. Instantly
                  conscious that no good could come of being identified as an acquaintance of this
                  man, he suppressed the glance and smile of recognition which were instinctively
                  forming themselves upon his countenance, and assumed, as well as he could, the
                  careless unconcerned look of a stranger to the person who stood before him. Arent,
                  wearing still the same smile of sinister triumph, stood, making no endeavor to win
                  any greeting from Matthew. There was therefore that expression upon the face of
                  each which was easily mistaken by Mr. Harsford, whose suspicious penetration was
                  excited to its highest activity, for a mutual recognition suppressed and concealed
                  for the furtherance of some secret purpose in which the two men were interested.
                  Upon Matthew's countenance this expression seemed to sit uneasily, and his look
                  and manner were embarrassed and irresolute; in reality by finding himself at one
                  instant defeated in the object of his call and confronted with a man of whom he
                  knew no good and surmised much evil, and who knew just enough of Matthew himself
                  to warrant him in claiming an acquaintance which Matthew was not disposed to
                  admit; but to the suspicious eye of Mr. Harsford the young man appeared disturbed
                  by the consciousness that he was playing a treacherous part. Upon Arent's face
                  there was no appearance of embarrassment nor of weakness of resolution; but the
                  smile of sly satisfaction which denoted that the rogue saw in Matthew's unexpected
                  arrival a further means of securing his victory over the merchant. To Mr. Harsford
                  this smile appeared the covert greeting bestowed on a confederate.
               Matthew, by way of commencing a conversation which might set him more at his ease,
                  unfortunately remarked to his employer that the letter, as he had observed, was
                  post-marked Enneton.
               To Mr. Harsford, who had already recognized the hand-writing of Mr. Mayes in the
                  superscription, and who very correctly surmised that it brought intelligence of the final results of a certain
                  search, which, as the reader already knows, he had been driven by the letters of
                  Arent to institute under the direction of Mayes, this remark was strong
                  confirmation of the conjecture that Matthew was cognizant of the errand on which
                  Arent had come, and was but his confederate in it. A remark so free, and which
                  seemed in connection with the contents of the letter as Mr. Harsford anticipated
                  them, so impertinent, superadded to the evident recognition, evidently suppressed,
                  and the air of indifference and ill-dissembled ease, sufficed to satisfy the
                  employer that Matthew was banded with his enemies. If any thing was wanting to
                  justify this conclusion it seemed supplied when Arent quietly said, continuing the
                  conversation—a conversation which Mr. Harsford thought would assuredly have been
                  broken off, or suspended, on the entrance of any one wholly a stranger to the
                  plot:—
               "You think she 's dead. I'm sorry to say it, but if you must have proofs you must.
                  Ask your clerk, here, if he has ever seen the original of that picture, and how
                  many hours ago he talked with her."
               By this appeal made to him as a witness in a matter of which he knew absolutely
                  nothing, save that he inferred from Arent's character and Mr. Harsford's manner
                  that it was some affair by which Mr. Harsford's peace was seriously threatened,
                  Matthew was thunder-struck. But while what this meant puzzled him much, what he
                  ought to do puzzled him more. Whether to reach out his hand and take the miniature
                  which Arent was holding toward him, and answer the question put,—whether to
                  disavow any connection with this stranger,—whether to admit his knowledge of the
                  man, and explain how much or rather how little he knew of him,—whether to
                  disregard the whole matter and pursue a conversation with his employer in hope to
                  reach the subject he had most in mind,—Matthew could not decide. Not knowing what
                  to do, he did nothing. He stood still and was silent. The ease of his appearance
                  was not increased however by the malicious smile which Arent turned upon him, or
                  by the scowl with which Harsford scanned his face.
               After a short pause, which seemed intolerably long to Matthew, and reflecting that
                  this would be no favorable time to broach the controversy he had come to open, he
                  said:—
               "If you 've no further commands, sir, I will go."
               Mr. Harsford nodded assent in silence.
               "Let him go," he said to himself. "He can be neither interruption nor witness,
                  since he is a confederate."
               But before Matthew left the room he was destined to meet with a greater surprise
                  still. As he approached the door he heard a step upon the hall floor without, and
                  as he laid his hand upon the door knob, he felt that a hand upon the other side
                  was trying to turn it. The knob, however, followed Matthew's more vigorous
                  pressure; and as the door swung open towards him, James Glovering Harsford stepped
                  in.
               Matthew had no desire to increase his present perplexity by renewing old
                  hostilities with the young gentleman who now stood face to face before him; and
                     young Harsford's brain was not
                  quick-witted enough to suggest a good thing to say or do by way of greeting to one
                  whose parting salutation, a week or two before, had been so emphatic and
                  disagreeable; so the young men passed each other with merely the exchange of a
                  cold bow on Matthew's part, for a surprised, supercilious stare on the part of
                  James.
               Matthew departed, saying to himself:
               "So he's James Harsford, I suppose. Glovering, he said his name was, but it was J.
                  G. H., I remember, on the stick. Her brother, eh! Well he 's a nice brother to
                  have, I should think. Pah!"
               James entered the room, but whatever thoughts respecting Matthew, his feeble mind
                  might have begun to evolve, were quickly dissipated in his surprise at seeing
                  Arent standing at his father's desk. He was by no means disposed to recognize, in
                  his father's presence, this companion of his darker dissipations; but it did not
                  suit the effrontery of his nature to avoid a recognition by withdrawing from the
                  room; so he drew a chair toward the fire, and engrossing himself in the evening
                  paper by way of a semi-concealment, awaited the other's departure.
               "Well," said Mr. James Harsford, alias
                  Glovering, to himself, "what may these two gentry be here for tonight, I wonder?
                  Caraboy, or Caraway, or whatever his name is, has come on some sort of business
                  trumped up from the office, I suppose. If the governor will employ an impudent
                  young scamp like him for a clerk, he must expect to have him thrusting his nose in
                  at the house sometimes, I suppose. I dare say he 'll come as often as he can find
                  a decent chance, and then brag of being on intimate terms with the Harsfords. I
                  can see through him well enough. But Jack Arent! what can he have to
                  do with the old gentleman? I never heard of their having any business together
                  before. Hope I 'm not going to be brought into any scrape. I suppose Arent could
                  stir up a very pretty kettle of mischief for me if he liked, but I do n't know as
                  it would do him any good, or father either."
               It would have little suited Arent's plans to have had James gain any suspicion of
                  the subject of his interview with Mr. Harsford, so after assuring himself, by a
                  moment's pause, that the young man was intending to await his departure, he
                  brought his interview to a close by saying:
               "Well sir, as you were saying, plans of this sort require some time for
                  consideration. 'Sleep over a bargain before you make it, and you 'll not lie awake
                  over it afterwards,' my grandfather used to say. But if my services can be of any
                  use to you in any negotiation you may wish to make, command me. A line addressed
                  to me there, sir, will always reach me."
               So saying, Arent laid down upon the table before Mr. Harsford the professional
                  card of "DEMAS JURAT, ATTORNEY & COUNSELOR, AND PROCTOR IN ADMIRALTY. NO. 8
                  CENTER STREET."
               "I am much obliged to you, sir," said Mr. Harsford, courteously, and directing a
                  certain glance toward his son, intended to intimate to the gambler that the
                     merchant chant did not choose to
                  discuss the matter further in the presence of a third person, "for your attention
                  to what you consider my interests in this matter. I somewhat doubt whether I shall
                  think it best to give any further attention to the claim, but if I should, I know
                  of no one I should prefer to confer with than yourself."
               "Very well, sir," said Arent.
               And bowing and smiling and repeating the assurances of his most distinguished
                  consideration, Mr. Arent departed.
               Mr. Harsford, disregarding the presence of his son, commenced the perusal of the
                  letter, which was from Mr. Reuben Mayes, and announced that he had returned from
                  his expedition, but had entirely failed to make any discovery which could aid Mr.
                  Harsford to foil the plot of Arent and his confederates.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               BETTER DO JUSTICE AND SUFFER INJUSTICE, THAN DO INJUSTICE AND SUFFER
                  JUSTICE.
               MATTHEW slept little that night. In fact he had so grave cause for uneasiness that
                  we ought rather to credit his habitual buoyancy of spirit with success in
                  measurably resisting the depressing influence of his circumstances, than charge
                  him with weakly anticipating trouble. He had now been in the city less than half a
                  month, and had made more enemies than friends, and had done more harm than good.
                  In order to come here he had severed the ties that secured to him his former
                  position, and had thus, as it were, cut off his retreat; while now the bright
                  prospects which had opened upon him at the outset were dismally clouded. He had
                  been instrumental in bringing a blow upon his friend, the widow, from which even
                  his sanguine temperament could hardly promise a retrieval. He had, without
                  understanding how or wherefore, incurred the hostility of the merchant; the cause
                  of it he could not analyze; its bitterness he felt; and the utter unreasonableness
                  with which, as it seemed to him, he had been selected as the object of suspicion
                  and hatred, stimulated in his own mind a reciprocal distrust and dislike. He related the incomprehensible scenes of
                  the evening to Mrs. Hopley; but the poor widow, whose mind, unaccustomed to
                  business, was already full and overflowing with the perplexities of her own
                  affairs, could give him no assistance in unraveling these.
               The one result to which his thoughts returned after every unsuccessful effort to
                  solve the enigmas of his position, was this; that he would leave no efforts unmade
                  to compel Mr. Harsford to reparation, or to bring him to justice. The singular
                  circumstances which surrounded him,—the rencounter with the merchant's son,—the
                  apparent implication with Arent,—the mystery involving the projects of Arent and
                  the affairs of the poor woman, who seemed to be in some way connected with these
                  projects;—all these things, instead of making him cautious, and wary, and
                  circumspect in his action, made him desperate, and more rash and impetuous than
                  ever before. He could not see what these affairs had to do with him. He knew
                  nothing of them. He would pay no regard to them. Even the thought of the
                  merchant's daughter made him the more hasty. Why should he think of her? He
                  persuaded himself that Mr. Harsford was the worst of men and deserved the severest
                  of fates.
               In such a mood of mind this impetuous young man entered the counting-room on the
                  morning of the day following the interview described in the last chapter.
               Mr. Harsford came down late. It was nearly noon when Matthew found the first
                  opportunity to enter his inner room and say:—
               "I wish to have a few moments' private conversation with you, sir."
               "I am busy now," the merchant replied.
               "I hope you will excuse me, sir," returned Matthew, "but what I have to say
                  demands immediate attention."
               There was something in these imperious though quiet words that had their effect,
                  and the merchant motioned Mr. Warrack, who was sitting in the corner of the room,
                  to leave them. He saw that Matthew was determined to speak; and he preferred to
                  hear him alone.
               Show of secrecy stimulates curiosity. Mr. Warrack left the room; but when outside
                  of it he did not go so far from the ground glass partition as not to be able to
                  hear some of the sharper volleys of words which were discharged between the
                  merchant and his clerk in the encounter which ensued.
               "Sir," said Matthew, too much excited to take the seat to which he had been
                  pointed, "some very singular circumstances have come to my knowledge, which are
                  such that I hardly know how to understand your course, but I hope that immediate
                  attention and prompt justice may repair the terrible wrong of which it is my duty
                  to complain. You will recollect—"
               "Come! come!" interposed the merchant. "I 'll hear nothing of that. You had better
                  leave the talking to your confederate. His tongue is more glib."
               "My confederate! I 've no confederate. This is no business for confederacy. What I
                  ask is simple justice for her. You can't deny her justice?"
               
               "You shall have justice before you 're through with this blackmail business,"
                  retorted the merchant. "But you 'd better confine yourself to the dumb show part
                  of the conspiracy. You make a very good puppet,—till you speak; and then you spoil
                  it all. You 're too rash."
               "'Conspiracy!'" cried Matthew, enraged in his rashness with being taunted with
                  rashness. "You may call me puppet and rash, if you please; but when you talk of
                  conspiracies you come to more serious matters. I won't bear that. You will please
                  not repeat that again. But that 's neither here nor there. You 've ruined this
                  poor woman, and you shall make it good. What part I 've had in her trouble I 'm
                  sorry for, God knows. But now I 'm bound to see to it that you put her where she
                  was before."
               "It is a conspiracy; the more you say the more you prove it. As for
                  your poor woman! not a sixpence more shall she ever get out of me. I
                  'll die first. It 's all a swindle from beginning to end; you insinuating young
                  rascal. Go about your business! Leave the room!"
               "I'll not leave the room. You shall hear me out first. If you know what 's wise
                  you will satisfy me before I go."
               "Satisfy you? Oh, you 're to be bought off are you?" broke in the merchant.
               "You recollect that six thousand dollars—"
               "Now you come to the point;" said the merchant. "You 're not quite so wary as your
                  black whiskered accomplice. Now you show the cloven hoof. Six thousand is all you
                  want, is it? Not quite, eh? More yet? Not a cent! Not a cent shall you get. I tell
                  you once for all that your woman is a sham. You 'd better let her go back to the
                  world she belongs in and not let her go prowling around making hell on earth in
                  this style. If you do n't take yourself off I 'll have you locked up and the
                  police on her tracks in half an hour. Your miniatures, and your letters, and your
                  unexpected meetings, and your rascally coincidences won't have any effect on me.
                  You play into one another's hands well; but it 's no use."
               "If you refer to any thing that occurred last night," returned Matthew, "I know
                  nothing about it. I have nothing to do with that man. I do n't know his name. I
                  never saw him but once or twice,—and as for the woman—"
               "Silence!" screamed the merchant. "You 've gone too far to get out of
                  it. Once or twice is enough for two such rascals to scheme together. The Devil's
                  eggs hatch quick. If you open your mouth on that matter again I 'll have you taken
                  in custody."
               "I shall not be silent, for I have not said what I have to, yet. It
                  will be time enough for you to get excited about your private affairs (since it
                  seems you have such affairs as that) when I begin to speak of them to you. I know
                  nothing about them and do n't wish to. What I want, is—what I demand, is—that you
                  should make reparation to Mrs. Hopley. Your bank has burst; and you do n't think I
                  am going to sit quietly and see her suffer by it."
               "Oh you change your tune now! You 've got to the end of one tack, and now you try another. I tell
                  you there 's no money at the end of either of 'em. You 're a bold fellow to fiddle
                  on two strings in this style. But I tell you I 'm not fond of such music. I 'll
                  not listen to it."
               "Fond of it or not, sir, you must hear it. You 've defrauded her; at any rate you
                  put her money in Iroquois stock when you knew better. And I believe, sir, that the
                  stock you put off on her was your own, sir. At any rate, you can't refuse to give
                  her up the note you induced her to make."
               "Yes, I can refuse. I do n't hold it now. You must ask the man who does hold
                  it."
               "The man who does? Why! you have n't passed it away, have you?"
               "Of course I have," returned the merchant, who took a malicious pleasure in
                  Matthew's alarm at this new phase of the difficulty. "We always turn these things
                  over. You do n't suppose I let any paper lie idle, do you? I can't afford
                  that."
               "But where is it? Who has it?"
               "I do n't know. I do n't suppose I ever shall, till it 's protested. Then they 'll
                  come down on me as indorser, I suppose."
               "Well," said Matthew, "I demand that you make her loss good. Stock and note. She
                  must be saved harmless. You do n't know what a loss it is to her," he continued,
                  raising his voice with excitement as his thoughts turned upon the certain
                  destitution of his friend, if the redress he claimed were denied. "It 's a matter
                  of life and death to her."
               "Young man," said the merchant, becoming cool as he saw the advantage he had in
                  the retort, "you must have a bright head to come to me with such a complaint as
                  that. 'Twas n't many days since I got a letter from somebody advising me to sell,
                  and now he comes and makes a criminal charge against me of having followed his
                  advice."
               "Alas!" said Matthew, "it 's too true. But that does not help this poor widow. You
                  have had her money, and you have sold her note, and she has what to show for
                  it—what? nothing."
               "To my thinking," continued the merchant, "if your story were true, which remains
                  after all to be proved, yet to my thinking the man who suggests the fraud, knowing
                  the facts, is rather deeper in it than the man who ignorantly follows his advice.
                  How should I know that your smooth-worded advice was meant to trap me into a
                  fraud? And you, who contrived the scheme, have the face to charge me with bad
                  faith."
               "It 's false!" cried Matthew. "You know it 's false. I did n't suggest that you
                  sell it for more than its worth. I did n't suggest that you put it off on her—a
                  helpless woman."
               "And who is she that it should make any difference with you? Do you want me to
                  believe that you meant me to cheat anybody but your friends? And what
                  is she to you any more than anybody else, more than any other widow? Eh?"
               Matthew's temper was no longer within bounds. He seized a heavy ebony stick which
                  served as a ruler, and interrupted the
                  speaker with a heavy blow upon the desk which left a deep dent there.
               "I tell you," cried he, "you shall answer for this another time. What I want to
                  know now is, will you make it good to her or must I force you to?"
               "Not a penny," said the merchant, resolutely, though appalled by the fearful
                  energy of Matthew's anger.
               "I swear," cried Matthew, uttering for the first time in his life an oath, as he
                  dashed the ruler to the floor, "I swear you shall answer for this if I have to go
                  through all the courts of justice in the State."
               So saying, and trembling with excitement and unrestrained passion, Matthew retired
                  into the outer counting-room, where, as he passed, he was followed by the
                  wondering eyes of Mr. Warrack and the clerks to his seat at the other end of the
                  room.
               The merchant was perplexed in regard to what course he should pursue. His evil
                  genius, which always preferred a circuitous course to a straight-forward one,
                  suggested a policy of conciliation, to which a consciousness of his own wrong
                  conduct towards the widow added some weight.
               Mr. Harsford perfectly understood that while he might lawfully and safely, if not
                  honestly and honorably, have sold the stock in the market (could a sale for it
                  have been obtained) to a stranger who dealt upon his own means of information as
                  to its value, and not at all upon trust in Mr. Harsford, yet that having been
                  employed by Mrs. Hopley to make an investment for her, he could not, even legally,
                  transfer to her any thing of his own; but was bound to give her the benefit of his
                  best knowledge and skill and means of information, and to buy for her such stock
                  as he would have bought for himself. He very well knew that the transaction had
                  only to be exposed, to be pronounced a wrong for which reparation might be
                  enforced under severe penalties; and that Matthew had only to consult a tolerably
                  competent lawyer to learn that this was the case. Understanding this, he was, upon
                  reflection, quite disposed to avert any immediate steps which Matthew might
                  contemplate taking by almost any conciliatory measures not involving the repayment
                  of the money; a thing which his selfish avarice was fully determined to
                  resist.
               While, however, he was yet undecided how to arrange matters so as to give Matthew
                  a temporary satisfaction or an illusory hope which might postpone the difficulty
                  for the present, Matthew returned, now more calm in manner, though not less
                  resolute in spirit.
               "After what has occurred, Mr. Harsford," he said, "of course I shall not remain
                  here. I shall leave to-night. It is the end of my week. If you wish to see me for
                  any thing, I shall be, for a few days at least, at Mrs. Hopley's house."
               Without waiting for any reply to this announcement, Matthew turned away and left
                  the room, and seating himself again at his desk, resumed the labors which had been
                  interrupted. Though pale, he was assiduous and noiseless in his work; yet seemed
                  to revolve some deep purpose in his inner thoughts, while his hands were still
                  busily engaged in the routine of affairs, Soon after noon he went out to do an
                  errand, as he said.
               
               Meanwhile Wall street was in a pother. Wall street was in a tangle. Wall street
                  was in a ferment. All Wall street was running in and out of brokers' offices,
                  breaking into conversations on the steps of the Exchange, huddling up in little
                  knots on the corners of the streets, stopping to put questions to passers by; and
                  all about this strange development, this deep mystery in the affairs of the
                  Wilmerdingle Gold Prospect Company. That world-renowned corporation which had been
                  introduced at the brokers' board with a flourish of trumpets which astonished the
                  entire street, and which had run up in the market at a rate and to a price which
                  astonished the street again, and which had only a week or so before put forth a
                  new report filled with gilded statistics and golden promises, by which the street
                  had been astonished over again, was now the subject of a fourth astonishment, so
                  much more profound and wide-spread than the others, that Wall street shook to its
                  very paving stones.
               For it so happened that the eminent Mr. Hokus, senior partner of the well-known
                  firm of Hokus & Pokus, brokers, being about to take a trip to Europe,
                  nominally for the benefit of certain great interests which he represented, though
                  really only for the fun of the thing, was making up a schedule of the various
                  securities which were held by the firm at this time, and among others he had
                  occasion to make a list of ten bonds of the Wilmerdingle Gold Prospect Company.
                  Not a great while previous, that company, being desirous to effect a loan,—that
                  is, the directors being agreed they would like some money,—had issued their bonds,
                  five hundred in number, and for the sum of five hundred dollars each, and payable
                  thirty years from date,—at which time the directors thought they might all
                  reasonably hope to be dead, and out of the way of trouble, at least on the score
                  of raising money for the company. These bonds they had secured by giving a
                  mortgage on the mining and other lands of the company, valued at upwards of a
                  million, by reason of the rich deposits of gold they were supposed to contain; and
                  had thereafter offered them for sale to the highest bidder. And such was the
                  enthusiasm of the report and prospectus, that the entire lot of five hundred bonds
                  sold for about ninety per cent. on the average, netting a nice little sum, which
                  the directors, with a flourish, paid in to the treasury on one day, and quietly
                  drew out the next, on various vouchers for services, salaries, incidental
                  expenses, commissions, etc., etc.; no one else drawing half as much as the
                  President, Alexander Harsford.
               Now the firm of Hokus & Pokus held no less than ten of these bonds, and Mr.
                  Hokus being engaged in making out a list of them, by their numbers, was smitten
                  with astonishment at finding that there were two numbered 224. How
                  could that have happened? They were both very pretty bonds,—beautiful bank-note
                  paper,—engraving in the highest style of art,—filled up in elegant
                  chirography,—autograph signatures of the highest flourish,—fine red seal,—every
                  thing of the most solvent and responsible character. But there were
                     two of the same number. Two! It might be a mistake of the clerk in
                  using the same number twice when filling the blanks; but then the result would be that five hundred and
                  one bonds would have been issued; and query, whether they were all secured by the
                  mortgage? Or it might be,—horrible suspicion!—that somebody had been issuing some
                  spurious bonds.
               At any rate it was as well for Mr. Hokus to step over and consult his friend, Mr.
                  Makus, of the equally eminent brokerage firm of Makus & Brakus, which firm, as
                  he happened to know, held a large number of the same bonds.
               Upon going over the bonds held by the latter firm, it was discovered that three of
                  them were duplicates of numbers held by the firm of Hokus & Pokus, and
                  thereupon the two brokers went over together to consult with their very eminent
                  friend, also a leading stock broker, Mr. Tryon Fixus. In his safe they found two
                  more duplicates; and now, having pretty decidedly discarded the theory of an
                  accidental mistake, they settled down on the theory that either Mercury Cornish,
                  the Secretary, or else Alexander Harsford, the President, both whose respectable
                  autographs were officially appended to the bonds, had entrapped the other into
                  signing an indefinite number in blank, and then after filling up and disposing of
                  the lawful five hundred, had filled up and disposed of a few more for private
                  account, duplicating the number so that the fraud might not be detected, unless by
                  the accident of one person coming into possession of two bonds bearing the same
                  number.
               "But then it was impossible," said Mr. Hokus, "to suspect Mercury Cornish of such
                  a thing."
               "That would be very true," assented Mr. Makus, "if it were not equally impossible
                  to suspect Aleck Harsford."
               "That would be a very just remark," said Mr. Tryon Fixus, "if it were not still
                  more unreasonable to suppose they both had a hand in it."
               And with this the three brokers broke up their conference, and separated to trace
                  back the history of the mysterious bonds, with a view to ascertain, if possible,
                  from whom they had in the first instance come. But as they separated they gave
                  each other their solemn word of honor to keep the whole thing a profound secret,
                  until the truth should have been found out and made clear.
               "For we do n't want to injure the reputation of an innocent man," said Hokus.
               "No; no;" said Makus and Fixus.
               "Nor damage the credit of the company," said Makus.
               "No; no;" said Hokus and Fixus.
               "Nor spoil the market for our good bonds," said Mr. Tryon Fixus.
               "No; no;" said Hokus and Makus.
               "Nor for our bad ones either," said each to himself.
               And so saying they parted. Now how it was I never could learn;—Hokus swears he
                  never said a word;—Makus kept perfect silence, did not even consult his
                  lawyer;—Fixus positively did not drop the least hint,—how it was I can not tell,
                  but in less than two hours all Wall street was bristling with the news of the
                  great embezzlement, or defalcation, or spurious issue in the Wilmerdingle merdingle Gold Prospect Company; and
                  all Wall street was alert for proofs to bring home the fraud to the perpetrator,
                  whoever he might be.
               The day had not passed away before these bonds were quite distinctly traced to Mr.
                  Harsford as their originator.
               Matthew, who had as yet formed no acquaintances in the street, heard nothing of
                  the excitement as he passed back and forth there, his mind too full of the heavy
                  anxieties and cares which arose out of his own circumstances to admit of his
                  taking much note of the fevered excitement which agitated the crowd around him.
                  Returning to the counting-room he bounded in in haste, and looked in at the open
                  door of Mr. Harsford's private room. He was gone.
               "Did you want to see him?" asked one of the younger clerks. "He 'll not come back
                  I think."
               "No," said Matthew, taking his seat at his desk, and resuming his writing, "it 's
                  of no consequence."
               And he wrote on, steadily, as the afternoon wore away.
               At five o'clock or thereabouts Matthew, still lingering at his desk, bade good-bye
                  to the departing junior clerks; their curiosity being too much excited by the
                  scene of Matthew's quarrel, of which they had heard so little and conjectured so
                  much, to allow them to assume the distant and frigid bearing of Mr. Warrack. As
                  the last and youngest of them ceased a vain attempt to draw out an explanation of
                  the mystery of the quarrel he had overheard, he said as a last bait upon the hook
                  of his conversation:—
               "I have got to go up to Harsford's house to-night with a box of cigars he left for
                  me to take up. If you want to send any word, I 'll take it."
               "Bring it to me," said Matthew, "I have something for you to take with it. Stop.
                  Is it in his room?"
               "On his desk," said the boy.
               Matthew entered the room. In a moment he reappeared at the door.
               "John," said he, "I can take it up just as well as not. It will save you going up
                  town."
               "Good!" said John. "Then I can go now. But I would n't go near his house if I were
                  you."
               "I 'm not afraid of him," said Matthew, smiling darkly.
               Thus Matthew was left alone in the counting-room of the man lately his employer,
                  so truly now his enemy. It is certain that whatever dark and hostile thoughts may
                  have filled his mind during this hour, he preserved a certain appearance of
                  fidelity to his work, for he patiently waited until the stroke of six for the
                  expiration of the day which freed him and set him adrift again upon the world. How
                  he occupied himself meanwhile there are no witnesses, alas! to tell. From the time
                  that John, faithless to explicit instructions, left him alone in the counting-room
                  with that box of cigars, to the time when as the clock struck six, having looked
                  around for the last time on the offices so briefly familiar to him, he closed the
                  door upon them, and carrying the box under his arm, bade good-bye to the porter
                  whom he passed on the stairs, no human eye watched his actions.
               
               Taking at length his last farewell of the merchant's counting-room, he pulled his
                  hat desperately down over his eyes, and bent his steps resolutely toward the
                  merchant's house.
               Arriving there at length he rang the door bell. The door was opened by a female;
                  for Matthew, raising his eyes from the step, saw first the lower part of her
                  dress. He heard an exclamation of surprise at the same time that he saw a hand
                  extended, toward which he reached forward the box, saying:—
               "This is for Mr. Harsford."
               And at this instant looking up he recognized the person whose simultaneous
                  exclamation in a strangely familiar tone, startled him.
               "Matthew!"
               "Arabella!"
               This was all. Even this recognition seemed more than the overwrought feelings of
                  the young man could endure. He hesitated an instant, turned quickly, pulled his
                  hat over his forehead again, descended the steps, and walked rapidly away.
               Arabella Mayes, whose sudden appearance will not be wholly uncomprehended by the
                  reader, startling as it was to Matthew, stood with the box in her hands gazing
                  vainly after him for some moments. She had but a moment before finished the call
                  she had been making on Miss Harsford, the main object of which was to let Matthew
                  know, indirectly, of her visit in the neighboring city; in the confidence that he
                  would hasten to avail himself of the opportunity to see her. She was on the point
                  of coming to the front door to leave, as Matthew rang; and with the independent
                  manner of one bred in the country, she instinctively opened the door, in response
                  to the ring she heard.
               She now handed the box to the servant who came up stairs to answer the bell; and
                  stepping out, descended the steps, and entered the carriage which stood awaiting
                  her coming; and which now whirled her rapidly away.
               It will not be difficult for the reader to understand that the demeanor of Matthew
                  in this hasty departure was a surprise and disappointment to Arabella.
               She was already,—nay, she had been almost from the moment when his retreating
                  wagon-wheels died away upon her ear on that memorable evening in
                  Enneton,—sincerely repentant for the pride and temper which she had displayed in
                  that interview. She thought Matthew somewhat to blame also to be sure,
                  particularly for the provoking way in which he had appealed to young Glovering;
                  but she thought but lightly of Matthew's share in the quarrel. She acknowledged to
                  herself, and was willing freely to acknowledge to him, that the first fault in the
                  quarrel was hers; and to accept the slightest apology or concession from him. She
                  had all along imagined him to be ready, to be desirous, as she was, that matters
                  should be restored to their former footing between them. And she supposed she had
                  but to let Matthew know in any of those ways which young ladies contrive for
                  giving that sort of information to young gentlemen, that she was near, and he
                  would at once seek a reconciliation. If he would but do that,—and it had never occurred to her to doubt that he
                  would,—all, she thought, would be well again.
               But now she had met him, he had seen her face to face. And he had avoided her, and
                  turned from her, and hastened away without a word.
               She was astonished and grieved. Her expectations were disappointed; and she rode
                  on her way in deeper trouble than ever.
               Meanwhile Matthew pursued his walk to Mrs. Hopley's, where he was destined to meet
                  with as serious a cause of surprise and anxiety as he had just given to
                  Arabella.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               WHEN JUSTICE IS EXPENSIVE, MERCY IS MADE MERCHANDISE.
               MATTHEW, walking rapidly from Mr. Harsford's door, passed into Broadway. Choosing
                  the least crowded and the darkest side of the street, as if the sight of his
                  fellowmen, and the gay lights of the shops, were not attractive to him, this
                  night, he walked on for some time; but at length he gradually slackened his pace,
                  and at last irresolutely turned about, and appeared almost inclined to retrace his
                  steps. Any hesitation, or uncertainty of action, was, however, a rare thing with
                  Matthew, and was never long indulged. He soon resumed his former course, and
                  pressed on towards home.
               Arriving at the door of the bakery, where he expected to find Mrs. Hopley sitting,
                  according to custom, in the open shop, he was surprised to find it closed. The
                  shutters were up. A heavy padlock held, with pertinacity, two staples driven into
                  the doors; the windows above were all closed; and to his repeated and impatient
                  knocks, no answer came.
               Matthew was not in a mood to ponder quietly upon so strange a circumstance or to
                  await with much patience a solution of
                  the mystery. His pounding and rattling at the door, although it aroused no
                  attention within the building, did attract first the ears, and then the eyes, of a
                  sedate and modest policeman, who after discreetly "watching" Matthew from a
                  sheltered point of observation just around the corner, and having satisfied
                  himself that there was "only one of them," ventured gently up to the spot where
                  Matthew stood, and asked him, mildly, "what he wanted there?" The young man
                  desisted from the vain attempt to gain attention from within, and coolly proposed
                  to the astonished policeman "to help him burst in the door;" and even followed up
                  this daring solicitation with the inquiry "if he knew where he could find a fellow
                  who would pick the lock." The policeman, overcome by the brazen character of such
                  a proposal from a supposed burglar, resolutely withdrew himself from the scene of
                  temptation, having admonished the young man to "be quiet and go away;" and retired
                  to the opposite side of the street, whence he watched, as in professional duty
                  bound to do, the conclusion of Matthew's proceedings.
               Those proceedings were simple. Matthew having by his noise drawn forth a head from
                  a neighboring window, which popped out much as a turtle thrusts his head from
                  under his shell, a brief conversation ensued, resulting in Matthew's being
                  informed that Mrs. Hopley had assuredly gone away, that nobody knew where she had
                  gone, and nobody knew when she would come back. Thereafter the head popped in
                  again, the window was shut down like a guillotine just too late for its purpose,
                  and Matthew walked slowly away. At this the policeman was greatly relieved. His
                  eyes followed Matthew's retreating form, for some distance, and his ears followed
                  the retreating footsteps for some distance further; but his alert attention was
                  soon demanded by the duty of suppressing and dispersing a seditious assemblage of
                  two small boys who were about to avail themselves of a vacant corner on the
                  side-walk to engage in the unlawful and riotous game of marbles; and in the
                  performance of this public duty, the dangerous young man was forgotten for a
                  time.
               This same Saturday, so soon to be marked as a terrible, day in Matthew's history,
                  had already brought no small trouble upon Mrs. Hopley.
               Matthew had left his friend that morning with a dark and resolute expression of
                  countenance. Instead of the light-hearted and cheerful step and smile which she
                  was accustomed to observe in him, his tread was heavy, and there was obvious in
                  his voice and manner the energy of an intense resolve to see her vindicated, let
                  it cost what effort it might. Though she did not venture to call him back, or
                  utter the warning which was upon her very lips, she almost feared more from his
                  impetuosity than she dared to hope from his determination.
               Shortly after he had gone, leaving her in this mood of anxiety, uncertainty, and
                  gloomy foreboding, the attention of the saddened woman was attracted by the
                  arrival of a sharp-faced, lank looking man, who was, in fact, an attorney and
                  collecting agent of the lowest class. That he was an attorney was disclosed by his
                  errand; and that he was of an inferior
                  rank amongst attorneys, was shown by his manner of performing it.
               "Hopley,—Sarah Hopley,—that you?" said this man, pulling out some papers as he
                  spoke, and singling out a slip from among them.
               "Yes, sir," said the widow. And she wondered whether it was a letter, or a tax
                  warrant, or an invitation to a funeral, or some small bill to be paid, or a
                  summons to attend parade in the militia in place of the departed William Hopley.
                  These were the errands which in general brought the bearers of such packages of
                  papers to her abode.
               "Yes! 'Sarah Hopley,'" continued the man, reading. "'Three hundred and,'—yes that
                  's it. H'm. Little note of yours."
               And the collector held out a note, the body of which was in Mr. Harsford's
                  hand-writing, but the signature was undeniably the autograph of the widow herself.
                  And as he held it forward for her inspection, he looked up indifferently at the
                  shelving of the shop, and then at the gas fixtures, and then at nothing at all,
                  just as a very young doctor rolls up his eyes when he is feeling a pulse
                  professionally.
               "Well, sir, I know it."
               "Well, mum, it 's all ready to be paid," said the man, as blandly as could be
                  expected of him.
               "But I am not ready to pay it."
               "Sorry for that, mum; for we must have the money."
               "But I'm not to pay it till next year; unless I want to."
               "That ain't in it."
               "No it is n't in it," said the widow, without needing to look at the note, for she
                  knew it by heart, and had gone over it, sadly, twenty times since last night. "It
                  is n't in it I know; but I was to pay it any time it was convenient. He said so. I
                  was n't to pay it till the bank dividend came in, if I did not want to. And I
                  can't pay it now."
               "We 've waited long enough, mum; and we must have the money now."
               The widow's heart sank within her, and she looked up at her visitor, with surprise
                  and fear mingled in her moist eyes.
               "Them 's my instructions, mum," said he, still speaking somewhat blandly for one
                  of his class; for although grown callous by passing through a thousand such
                  scenes, he was touched with a certain sympathy for the fair debtor to whom he
                  brought such distress. "Them 's my instructions. We must have the money now."
               "I have n't got the money. He never ought to ask it. I do n't believe I'd pay it
                  if I could. I certainly would n't till I had time to see about it. He expressly
                  said I was not to pay it until I had the money to spare."
               "I do n't know what Mr. Chaffer said to you, but he said to me, Do you get that
                  money for me, by ten o'clock this A. M. That 's what he said to me."
               "Mr. Chaffer! Who is he? 'Tis n't his note."
               "Come! come! Yes, 't is his note. But that do n't signify. I've got the note.
                  There 't is. I want the money. Where is it? Come!"
               
               "I assure you I can't pay it to-day. I have n't got the money. I can
                     not pay it now. I do n't know exactly when I could either, if
                  indeed—; but I expect to have the money soon. I do really, very soon; and then I
                  'll see about it. I am going to sell out my place here, for I am going to Vermont
                  to live; and I shall have money as soon as I have sold out. I 'll see Mr. Harsford
                  about it then."
               "We can't wait, mum, till that time."
               "But you must," insisted the widow, resolved to do nothing in Matthew's absence.
                  "You must. I certainly shall not pay it till I have seen Mr. Harsford. He has
                  treated me most shamefully; shamefully. I certainly sha'n't pay it. I would n't if
                  I had the money, after what he 's done."
               "H 'm!" said the man, ominously.
               "No!" replied the widow, "I do n't believe he can ever make me pay it. He has
                  treated me so that I certainly sha'n't pay a cent of it, if I can help it. Not a
                  cent!"
               Strangely enough these words instead of being a disappointment to the creditor's
                  representative, seemed to give him entire satisfaction. He smiled with a
                  mysterious and contemptuous pleasure, took a turn through the shop repeating his
                  inspection of its contents, and without further words, went away whistling
                  contentedly as he walked.
               The widow was surprised at the abruptness of his departure; and in truth alarmed
                  at his too easy acquiescence in her explanations. She instinctively tried to call
                  him back; but then it occurred to her that she had nothing to say to him if he
                  complied with the call, and she desisted.
               Filled with gloomy forebodings of unknown trouble, she sat at her post,
                  mechanically attending to such business as required her attention, and anxiously
                  wishing that Matthew would come home.
               Late in the afternoon, after she had several times stepped to the door, to look up
                  the street hoping to see Matthew approaching, she at length, while standing in the
                  door-way, looking and waiting, saw three men coming towards the shop. One, she in
                  a moment recognized as her visitor of the morning; the others she had never seen
                  before. They came up to the door; and one of them, the most dirty and coarse of
                  the three, in his appearance, remained outside, while the others entered. She had
                  retreated from the door on recognizing the attorney, and they approached the
                  counter behind which she now sat.
               The attorney's companion was a stout and vulgar looking man, whose dirty dress and
                  authoritative manner would have marked him in the eye of an experienced person, as
                  one of the ministers of justice of the subordinate class; a sort of low priest in
                  the temple of law; a 'deputy sheriff.' He walked up to the counter, accompanying
                  the attorney, and seeing no chair convenient, hoisted himself to a seat upon the
                  counter, where, having glanced around the room leisurely, he twisted his fat neck
                  so as to look in a sidelong way at the widow, and sat waiting, apparently, for his
                  coadjutor to open the business on which they had come, whatever it might be.
               
               "Sorry to trouble you, mum, about that little matter again;" said the
                  attorney.
               "I told you that I could n't do any thing about it at all; but I 'm glad you 've
                  come again, for Mr. Caraby will be here in a few minutes I expect, and I can't do
                  any thing without him. He 'll go with you and see Mr. Harsford about it."
               Whether it was an affection of the heart, or only an affection of the eyelids I do
                  not know, but while she spoke, this minister of justice, sitting offensively on
                  her counter, winked both his eyes, much as we may suppose a spider might wink in
                  view of a fly, or as an alligator should, just before he swings his tail around to
                  knock his victim into the water.
               "It 's of no consequence to wait for your friend, mum," said the deputy, taking up
                  the conversation. "You 're the pusson we want to see. I 've got an attachment for
                  you, and you can take the papers and we can take the things, just as well by
                  ourselves."
               "An attachment?"
               "Yes, mum. Suit of Nicholas Chaffer. Them 's the papers."
               And the officer handed toward her two or three shabby looking legal documents. As
                  she made no movement to take them they fell from his relaxed grasp upon the
                  counter.
               "All the same, mum," he said. "That 's due and regular service, same as if you
                  took 'em. Now about the things."
               "Why! what are you going to do about my things?"
               "Attach and safely keep, mum, the goods and chattels, mum, of Sarah Hopley.
                  Perishable goods 'll be sold, mum, that 's what the law is, and them as is n't
                  perishable won't. These 'ere goods looks perishable, though."
               And the deputy took up a small cake from a pile in a tray upon the counter, and
                  crowded it entire into his capacious mouth.
               "You do n't mean that you are going to take my things away?"
               "That depends on you, mum;" he replied, as soon as he regained the power of
                  articulation.
               "How? But come, can't you leave it till next week? Till Monday morning; just till
                  Monday morning. I 'll go and see Mr. Harsford just as soon as Matthew comes."
               "What, Aleck Harsford?"
               "Yes, Mr. Alexander Harsford."
               "That won't do no good, mum. He can't help you. Ha! there 's writs
                  out against him, now. 'No goods,' too, I 'll warrant. He 's a regular foot-ball.
                  Go a-flying over anybody's head as long as he 's got the wind; but prick him and
                  he 'll wrinkle up like an old woman. He 's wrinkled up now, they say, so 't he 'll
                  never come out smooth again."
               And the minister of justice laughed at his conceit. This was about the last job of
                  the week to him, and he was at leisure and inclined to be sociable with the
                  widow.
               "Not Alexander Harsford, of Hanover Square! Why he 's a rich man. I know
                  better."
               
               "Well, mum. So much the better if he is. So much the worse if he is n't. But he
                  won't help you. He 's got enough of his own to attend to,—too much to help other
                  folks. He never was over foolish in that way either. But he 's nothing to do with
                  it, any way. Did you say you wanted me to put a man in?"
               "Put a man in? What do you mean?"
               "In here."
               "In here? A man! No I do n't. I never said so, you know I did n't."
               "Come, come. Do n't you understand? When we attaches we put a man in, instead of
                  carrying the things off; that is if they wants us to."
               "Why! you do n't mean that you shall really carry away the things," said the
                  widow, looking around in despair.
               "That 's the law, mum; as I told you."
               "But the shelving and counters do n't belong to me, they are the landlord's."
               "So much more reason for taking care of the rest of the stuff. But we can put a
                  man in if you want. I 've got him here at the door. It 's the way we always do.
                  The law requires we should take the things, but it 's just the same to put a man
                  in."
               "What! in here to stay with me. I won't hear of it."
               "Oh, do n't be bothered, mum. He won't trouble you. Give him a shake-down on the
                  floor or under the counter. You won't mind him more than a watch-dog. On my soul,
                  I would n't much mind staying here myself. You 'd feed a fellow well, I suppose.
                  Those cakes ain't bad to take. Good chance to try a vegetable diet. Ha, ha."
               "You must wait a few moments," said the widow, now thoroughly alarmed, and trying
                  unsuccessfully to assume an appearance of self-possession. "He will be here very
                  soon;" and she went to the door to look for Matthew.
               The unprepossessing appearance of the "man" whom she was assured she would n't
                  mind more than a watchdog, and who now confronted her at the door, turned her back
                  again.
               During a few moments, as it was growing dark, they waited, but Caraby did not
                  come.
               "Can't stop any longer," said the deputy.
               "I 'll resist this to the utmost," exclaimed the widow. "Justice costs a good
                  deal, I know, but I 'll have it. I won't be imposed upon in this way. You must n't
                  touch any thing."
               "Justice costs a considerable, mum, but then mussy is n't very dear. I can put a
                  man in and he 'll only cost three dollars a day; and then you can have things just
                  as they are as long as you please."*
                  
               
                  
                  *It may be thought that the officer asked an exorbitant price for the
                     attendance of his watchers. Three dollars a day will pay a member of the
                     Legislature. But when we take into account the fact that these subordinate
                     officers are not paid by the functionary whom in law they represent, but
                     while he takes all the lawful perquisites, annually amounting
                     to a sum larger than the salary of the President of the United States, his
                     business is all done for him without expense to him by a horde of needy men,
                     in consideration of their being allowed to exact first from one party and
                     then from the other, such pecuniary rewards as may purchase their
                     accommodations, their zeal, or their slackness—when we consider that these
                     men have no other remuneration than such as they may thus obtain, three
                     dollars a day will scarcely seem too much.
               
               
               "No," said the widow, "I sha'n't have any man in here as long as Mr. Caraby is
                  away."
               "Get a cart, Nate," said the officer to the man at the door.
               "Can't take 'em to-night," said Nate, putting his head in at the door. " 'T would
                  be dark before we could get 'em on."
               "That 's so," said the other. "But she won't agree to leave 'em in charge."
               The subordinate grumbled, and rattled a padlock and keys he carried in the pocket
                  of his sack.
               "We must lock 'em up then, mum," said the officer. "That 's what we must do.
                  Meanwhile you can see your man, and by Monday morning you 'll have it all
                  arranged; put a man in charge, and take your time about it."
               "Can't you wait till Mr. Caraby comes?"
               "No, mum. Our time is valu'ble; to us if 't is n't to
                  you. Ha! ha! We know its valu'. It 's no object to us to stay."
               Perhaps, as the event turned out, it was not the wisest thing she could have done,
                  but the widow finally resolved to submit to having her shop shut up temporarily,
                  and take refuge herself for the Sabbath with some friends of her late brother in a
                  neighboring street, rather than purchase mercy at such a sacrifice. This plan
                  afforded also the advantage of giving her a good opportunity to hasten down to the
                  counting-room to find Matthew, and seek immediate redress. So she hastily gathered
                  up a few articles indispensable to her in the contemplated absence; secreted her
                  few personal valuables, and having made hasty arrangements with her single
                  domestic such as the emergency required, she signified to the ministers of justice
                  her readiness to comply with the mandates of the Law.
               A few minutes before six she was shut out into the street; and staying a moment to
                  see the padlock securely fastened, Mrs. Hopley, with her bundle in her hand,
                  started at a rapid pace in the direction of the counting-room; the counting-room
                  which at that moment Matthew was preparing to leave.
               She hastened along the street until she reached an omnibus route, and then walking
                  on her way until she was overtaken by one of those accommodating vehicles, she
                  beckoned to the driver, and took her seat in the coach.
               She had not gone, however, much more than half way down to the counting-room, when
                  a sudden thought occurred to her.
               "I declare," said she to herself, "I shall be too late. Matthew will be gone up
                  long before I get there now. Why did n't I think of that? I ought to have waited
                  at the shop till he came. However, I suppose it 's no use to go back now."
               She rode on, therefore; and in due time reached the place of destination. Of course she was too late.
                  She found the warehouse closed and silent; she turned away in deep perplexity, not
                  however with so sore and gloomy thoughts as those with which Matthew, an hour and
                  a half later, tried in vain the locked door of the deserted bakery.
            
            
               SATURDAY NIGHT.—A VISION.
               SATURDAY evening. A large and handsomely furnished apartment. No stiffness of
                  elegance, nor scantiness of economy; but liberal luxury. Brilliant light flashing
                  through the ground glass globes of the chandelier, and from the soft coal fire in
                  the grate. A milder radiance reflected from the mirrors, from the windows, from
                  the gilt cornices and bands of the window-curtains, from the glass doors of the
                  book-case, from the brown sides and yellow edges of the cigar box upon the mantel,
                  from the polished rosewood of the desk and table, from the bright black mohair
                  cushions of the chairs and sofa, from the gilt wreaths of flowers which adorn the
                  paper on the wall, from the burnished frames and varnished canvas of many
                  paintings which hang on every side. Ease, comfort, luxury, abounding in all the
                  appointments of the room; but in the heart, misery, woe, shame, disappointment,
                  vexation, mortification, impatience, distress, remorse, despair.
               A man pacing to and fro in this apartment. Steps hurried, yet irresolute. A manner
                  betokening that excited, frantic struggle which the heart makes, when the
                     late-developed developed results of
                  a long course of wrong doing rise and bear all before them in their resistless
                  current. One can paddle out very gracefully into the stream far above the Falls,
                  but when the boat is drawn down through the rapids to the brow of the ultimate
                  plunge, the struggles of the boatman are fearful to behold.
               
                  Ah me! where shall I go? Which way turn, or whither fly? My credit broken!
                     My means gone! My name a by-word in the street. What further can I do? How
                     shall I break way through these troubles to a free Life;—or must I now wait
                     hopelessly for Death?
               
               Still pacing to and fro. His steps hurried and impatient, yet irresolute. Turning
                  to the grate;—where he bathes his hands inattentively a moment in the light and
                  heat of the blazing fire. Turning to the table;—where he bends over the evening
                  paper, and reads again that little paragraph which foreshadows detection and
                  disgrace, and strives again to judge what course the hounds upon his track will
                  take, and whether he can reckon upon yet another day. Turning to the window;—where
                  he leans, resting his hot forehead against the panes, gazing out into the
                  gathering twilight. Opening the window, and standing in the cool draught.
               
                  Ah me! Where shall I go? Which way turn, or whither fly? Means gone! Credit
                     broken! My name a disgrace and by-word. What remains in Life worth waiting
                     for;—or what refuge have I except in Death?
               
               Long standing at the window. Deep and sorrowful thinking. Then a certain bending
                  forward and adjust ment of something upon the some support before him. What he
                  does, no one within the room, were any one within, could tell; though if the
                  fire-light and gas-light shine brightly enough upon him, it might be that one in
                  the house windows opposite, if any one were there, could tell what it is he holds
                  in his hand;—and now thrusts in his pocket.
               At length shutting down the window, with a shiver, and coming back to the
                  fire-place. Leaning his head upon his arms, which he crosses upon the mantel. A
                  sudden recollection. Taking a little white paper from his pocket, and dropping it
                  into the fire, where it blazes up, and smoulders in ashes, and disappears.
               
                  Alas! what shall I do? Which way turn, or whither fly? Wealth gone! Credit
                     broken! Disgraced and ruined! Can I, by any chance, retrieve these misfortunes?
                     What refuge have I?
               
               Turning to the sofa and disposing the cushions upon it to give an easy
                  resting-place. Holding a cigar in his hand. Endeavoring to light it; but it will
                  not draw well. Moistening a strip of paper by the lips, and winding around the
                  upper end of the cigar, so as to bind the loosened leaves of the tobacco more
                  closely around the roll.
               Lighting the cigar by a paper match which he throws into the fire when used. Lying
                  down upon the sofa. Disposing the newspaper at his hand, as if to read. An odorous
                  smoke, from the burning cigar, rising from time to time, in whiffs.
               
                  Alas! how shall I escape? Which way turn, or
                  
                  whither fly? Means and credit exhausted. My wife shamed. My children
                     disgraced. Myself ruined. I have no way of escape unless Death shall open a
                     door for me.
               
               
               An hour passing. The white paper around the cigar crisping slowly up as the fire
                  eats its way onward, and turning to black ashes, and falling undistinguishable
                  upon the floor. The cigar consumed at length almost to the very end. Slumber, a
                  deep and heavy slumber, overcoming the frame. The unburnt end of the cigar
                  dropping from the relaxed and nerveless lips. The newspaper falling at the side.
                  He breathes slowly, gently, imperceptibly.
               
               Two—three—four—five—six—seven—eight—hours. A faint gray light of dawn glimmering
                  in the sky. Dead and cold ashes lying in the grate; and a cold and lifeless form
                  outstretched upon the sofa, lying in the chill morning air, and the senseless
                  imbecile glare of the gas-light.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               BETTER TO TRUST TOO MUCH THAN SUSPECT TOO MUCH.
               ABOUT the time that the streets were thronged with persons returning from their
                  various places of worship, in the afternoon of the Sabbath following Matthew's
                  unexpected meeting with Arabella, two plainly dressed, quiet looking men paused at
                  the front door of the Harsford mansion, and, after assuring themselves by a glance
                  at the name on the door-plate that it was the house they sought, they descended
                  into the area, and knocked at the basement door.
               These were detective officers to whom was committed the elucidation of the sudden
                  and mysterious death of Mr. Alexander Harsford.
               Being silently admitted the officers were shown directly up stairs into one of the
                  parlors upon the first floor, and there awaited the person for whom they had
                  inquired upon entering.
               "Very remarkable case this is, Heckoe," said the elder of the two.
               He was a plump and portly man, with a very intelligent countenance, made somewhat
                  mysterious in its expression pression,
                  however, by a frequent twitching movement of the corners of his mouth. This
                  movement was especially frequent in the intervals of conversation, when he was
                  accustomed to close his lips and look keenly at his listener, while the corners of
                  his mouth played, as if the little that he said was nothing in comparison with
                  much that he shrewdly repressed.
               "That 's a fact," responded Heckoe, "it 's most remarkable; it 's my opinion that
                  the fellow was a very 'cute one. But he took a bad time to it. If it had been any
                  other night than Saturday, he might have cleared out next morning, and been fifty
                  miles off before they knew any thing about it. But Sunday you see takes the
                  linchpins right out of his wheels. By the way, Sneyer, do you know how they found
                  it out?"
               "They would n't have known it so soon if the doctor had n't happened to have been
                  here. You see the old gentleman was n't the most regular man in the world, and was
                  n't always expected home at night. So when the family went to bed they thought he
                  had n't come in yet, and left the front door on the latch, for him; and when they
                  got up in the morning they thought he had n't come in at all,—was out of town, or
                  something. So they got their breakfast without thinking any more about it. But
                  after breakfast, the girl happened to try the lib'ry door, and found it locked,
                  and then they happened to see that his hat was in the hall after all. Then they
                  knocked at the door till they were tired, and then they broke it open, somehow,
                  and there they found him."
               "Dead, was he?" said Heckoe.
               "Stone dead," returned Sneyer. "They took it for apoplexy; though by all accounts
                  he was n't a very likely subject for that complaint. But the doctor happened in
                  that morning to see some one of the family, and he said, 'poison.' Then they found
                  the end of the cigar, and that told the whole story."
               "Where do you think the fellow is, Sneyer?"
               "He 's not gone far yet," returned the elder officer.
               "No, he 's not gone far yet," rejoined the other, "that 's clear enough. But where
                  is he, that 's the point; he might be over in New Jersey, eh? He could have taken
                  the ferry any time."
               "He won't go out of town, I believe," said Mr. Sneyer, "till he knows
                  the thing is done. 'T would look suspicious, and 't would be no use. He 's in town
                  somewhere, or I 'm mistaken. Whether he will be long is another thing."
               "Whether he will be long is a very different thing," assented Heckoe, "very
                  different. But 't was ingeniously done though, was n't it? Did you ever hear of a
                  neater thing?—to poison a man's cigar for him!"
               "There it is," interrupted the other, "that 's the very point. It was only one or
                  two out of all the box that he poisoned, because you see the others are all good
                  they say. Now whoever did it, and it seems pretty plain that the young man is the
                  one, he would n't know when the old gentleman got to the right one, or if he ever
                  did, unless he waited to see. 'T is n't as if he had put a dose in his breakfast,
                  and knew 't would be all over before dinner. If that was the case, he might clear
                  out, and go with his mind easy, but by
                  sending him a whole box of cigars, and no way to know whether or when the old
                  gentleman will get at the right one of 'em, he leaves himself all in the dark as
                  you may say until the right one is smoked, and he knows it is. So I 'm of opinion
                  that if he 's any sort of a fellow he 'll hang around here till he finds it out,
                  and then he will make tracks."
               This piece of reasoning appeared to be so conclusive to the other, that he merely
                  replied:—
               "Yes, then I think he 'll make tracks. Yes. Only let his boots creak as he goes,
                  that 's all I ask."
               At this moment the servant came into the room and reported that Miss Harsford sent
                  word that she could not see any one on any account whatever.
               "You please tell Miss Harsford," returned the elder, in a tone which though quiet
                  and respectful was expressive of a firm decision, "that 't is imperative she
                  should come down, and come without delay. Listen, now. Tell her that all the
                  murderer wants is Time, and we do not expect that she will be the one
                  to give it to him. Say that."
               The servant retired, and in a few moments returned, saying that Miss Harsford
                  would be down presently.
               "She 'll be down presently," whispered Heckoe, who began to be excited as they
                  approached the duty of actual investigation. He was but recently appointed on the
                  detective corps, and this was the first case of so serious a nature which had ever
                  been intrusted to his exertions. "She 'll be down presently. Wide awake now."
               "You keep quiet," retorted Sneyer, gently, "and leave her to me, and see what I
                  do; and mind you remember every word she says."
               "Yes," said Heckoe, "it 's very important to remember every word she says; trust
                  me for that. I 've nothing if I have not a memory. Give me a talk with a man, and
                  I 'll repeat every word he says when he gets through."
               As these words were uttered, the door opened and the bereaved daughter entered.
                  Mr. Sneyer rose, and quickly met her near the door. Mr. Heckoe approached them, as
                  nearly as seemed to him proper, and stood deferentially, appearing to be one of
                  the group, but in reality being a mere listener.
               Miss Harsford was so altered by the scenes of the past few hours, that Mr. Sneyer
                  would hardly have known her, even if he could have seen her with the eyes of her
                  best friends. Had they themselves looked upon that pale countenance, and those
                  reddened eyelids still moist with tears, that hair, the disheveled locks of which
                  hung the face in mourning, that form and attire so utterly devoid of ornament, and
                  almost neglectful in its manner, they would hardly have recognized the daughter of
                  the deceased merchant. All this, however, was of little interest to the visitors
                  who now approached her; the elder of whom spoke first, addressing Charlotte in a
                  quiet pleasant manner.
               
                  Sneyer.
                  Sorry to disturb you, ma'am, but we 've no time to lose. It won't do to let the
                     grass grow under our feet.
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  I—I did not mean to keep you waiting. But what is to be done? Alas! my
                     father.
               
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  I would like to know, ma'am, firstly, when the young man was here last?
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  Who? Mr. Caraby?
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  Yes.
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  Oh! yes. Do send for him. He 'll do any thing he can. Send for Mr. Caraby, by
                     all means. He 'll do any thing for my father, and—
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  Do you think he would help us?
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  He would if he could, I know. Why did n't I think to send for him before? He is
                     indefatigable. Oh, I wish he were here.
               
               
                  Sneyer,
                  (with a look of intelligence at his companion.)
                  So do I.
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  He may know something about it. He knows about father's business.
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  I presume he does.
               
               
                  Heckoe.
                  I presume he does! Why he 's the very—
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  Come, come Heckoe, do n't interrupt the lady.
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  He 's the very what? He? What? he? You surely do n't—oh impossible!
               
               
                  Sneyer,
                  (blandly.)
                  He is the very man we want. If we had him here we should know how to go to
                     work.
               
               
                  Charlotte,
                  (reassured.)
                  Do n't you think he could give you some information that could help you? There
                     was a very ill-looking man here the other night—Friday it was. He spent some
                     time with father. And Matthew saw him.
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  Well, we know where the young man lives, but the place is shut up.
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  But is there no one there?
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  No one.
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  But the neighbors must know where the family are gone.
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  No ma'am, they do n't seem to have left any word.
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  What shall we do?
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  We must try to find him.
               
               
                  Heckoe,
                  (impatient and wondering why his companion does not tell the young lady
                     that Matthew himself is the object of their suspicion.)
                  Find him! Let us just get scent of him—
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  Yes, yes, never mind. When was he here last?
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  I do n't know. I have not seen him since Friday night, when he was here, and
                     that man I told you about was here. The servant thought it must be he who was
                     here and left the box last night. But it could not have been he.
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  Why not?
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  What! he bring the box? Oh no, it could n't have been. Besides he would have
                     seen some of us. He never comes here without our seeing him.
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  But what made the girl think he came last night?
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  Nothing that I know of. She did not see him. She only said it might be he,
                     because he often comes up on errands from the office about that time in the
                     evening, and the ring at the door sounded like his, she said.
               
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  Did no one see him? Did no one see the person who brought the box?
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  No. No one, except Arabella.
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  Please call her, ma'am.
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  Oh, she is not here. She is a friend of mine who called here last night. She
                     received the box at the door as she was going out, and she turned back and gave
                     it to the servant.
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  Where does Miss Arabella live, and what is her name?
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  Her last name is Mayes, and she is stopping at—stay; here, I have her card, she
                     left it with me. There is her address.
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  Well. She saw the person, and you think no one else did.
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  No one. I was in the hall when she went out to the vestibule, and saw her come
                     back and give it to the servant.
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  We will go and call on this Miss Mayes immediately.
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  Yes, do. She will know who brought the box.
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  What I want to know is where he went.
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  But what about Mr. Caraby? Can't you find him?
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  Ah! I wish we could.
               
               
                  Charlotte.
                  You send again to his boarding place. Perhaps they were gone to church.
                     Meanwhile if he should come here—but then he will not—but if he should come
                     here, I'll keep him till you return.
               
               
                  Sneyer.
                  I do n't think, ma'am, he will come here, but if he does I hope you will keep
                     him.
               
               Having thus obtained all the information he could, and imparted as little as
                  possible, partly because he foresaw that to state his suspicions, would render it
                  impossible to get any calm statement of facts from the young lady, and partly
                  because his habit was never to tell a part of his story until he knew the whole,
                  the detective with his companion unceremoniously withdrew; leaving the afflicted
                  daughter to sink, overwhelmed with these terrible scenes, upon a chair near at
                  hand, where she remained till the approach of a servant aroused her.
               The officers passed on together down street, discussing the course of
                  investigation they should pursue.
               In the course of the afternoon they found Arabella. She had heard nothing of Mr.
                  Harsford's death, and had no idea of the purpose of the inquiries which the
                  detectives made. She listened to their questions with some wonder, yet answered
                  them frankly, although not without putting some inquiries in return, to which Mr.
                  Sneyer replied, by telling a little truth and leaving a good deal of falsehood to
                  be inferred. From Arabella they gained the elements of a description of Matthew's
                  personal appearance, and then departed, leaving the young lady in quite as much
                  astonishment as she herself had occasioned in Matthew's mind, by her unexpected
                  appearance the evening previous.
               Not long after this, the officers visiting the bakery again, in hope of finding
                  some of its occupants returned, were disappointed in that hope, but found the
                     watchman who had seen Matthew by the
                  door on Saturday night. He described to them what he had seen, but could give them
                  no information of the young man's further movements. The next clue that they found
                  was that the young man had been to the Post office on Sunday morning, and had
                  taken out Mr. Harsford's letters, but had returned most of them—all but one the
                  clerk thought—and asked to have them put back in the box, to be called for on
                  Monday, as he had got all that he wanted. That the clerk refused to take them
                  back, saying that he could not be troubled to deliver the same letters twice. And
                  that finally Matthew put all the letters into his pocket, and went away. They
                  found no clue to what had been his resting-place on Saturday night, if indeed he
                  had had any.
               Early Monday morning, when Mr. Sneyer had just returned to the house, after a
                  tedious and unsuccessful circuit of investigation, little Benny came to the door
                  and handed up a package of letters for Mr. Harsford. He was clambering down the
                  high steps again, when Mr. Sneyer, learning his errand, called him back to inquire
                  where he got the letters. He said that the gentleman in Mr. Harsford's office,—not
                  Mr. Warrack, but the other gentleman,—met him in the street, a little while
                  before, and gave them to him to bring. He did not know the gentleman's name, but
                  his mother did, for she did washing for him. From the child's description,
                  however, there was no doubt of Matthew's identity. He seemed to be in a hurry,
                  Benny said, and went out to the corner of the street, and turned down town. He
                  said he was going away by the steamboat, but did not say where he was going.
               Half an hour after this, Matthew, who had stopped a few moments on his way for a
                  hasty breakfast, stepped on board the morning boat for Albany and Troy, a short
                  time before its hour for starting. Threading his way through the crowd, noise and
                  confusion of the scene upon the pier, he crossed the plank and ascended the
                  stair-case into the saloon. Close behind him followed a well-looking man, who,
                  whenever Matthew looked around, scanned his face with a gaze that was not
                  particularly agreeable to him. This stranger followed Matthew up into the saloon.
                  Matthew walked back and forth, but still this strange companion kept him closely
                  in view. At last he sought a seat in a secluded corner of the promenade deck; but
                  in a few moments Mr. Sneyer—for it was he—came up and took a seat by his side, in
                  such a position that Matthew was quite hemmed in where he sat.
               "Going up river, this morning?" said Mr. Sneyer.
               Matthew looked at his interrogator in silence a moment, but seeing nothing but
                  that bland expression which the detective well knew how to assume when he desired
                  to gain by friendly conversation some insight into the character and purposes of
                  the persons with whom he was to deal, the young man replied:—
               "Yes, sir, so you see."
               "This is Mr. Caraby, I believe,—Matthew Caraby?" continued the detective,
                  inquiringly.
               
               "I do n't know that I ever met you before," returned Matthew.
               "Well sir," responded the officer, now well satisfied that the young man before
                  him was the person he sought, "I am sorry to call you back, but I am commissioned
                  by Miss Harsford,—you know her, I believe?—to ask you to come immediately to her
                  father's house. It is a matter of great importance."
               Matthew started in surprise.
               "I—I can not go this morning, possibly. Tell her that I must go out of town
                  to-day, but will be back soon."
               "Ah! but she needs you right away. You must come now."
               "Now? It is out of the question. Tell her I am just starting for Troy to meet my
                  sister. She knows about my sister; she is blind. I expect she is on her journey
                  now, coming here. I am to meet her this afternoon and bring her down; and I can
                  not possibly disappoint her, because, you see, she is blind."
               "Perhaps," said the officer, quietly, "perhaps you did not know that her father
                  was dead?"
               "Dead!"
               Matthew's agitation was painful to behold.
               "And she needs your assistance immediately."
               "I wish I could go, but it is impossible, to-day. Tell her I will come to-morrow
                  morning. I will come right back by to-night's boat. There! There is the last bell.
                  Quick! You'll be too late. Tell her I'll certainly come to-morrow."
               The officer rose from his seat as he heard the bell clanging above all the noise
                  and confusion of the surrounding scene. But he rose without any purpose of parting
                  with Matthew.
               He leaned over, and spoke in a clear, distinct voice.
               "Perhaps," said he, "perhaps you did not know that Mr. Harsford was murdered, and
                  you are my prisoner? Come!"
               With these words, and grasping Matthew firmly by the arm, he half led and half
                  pulled the astonished young man to the deck below, and thence to the pier, just as
                  the ropes were being cast off. At once a carriage was engaged, and the prisoner
                  and his custodian being placed securely within it, they were driven rapidly across
                  the city, while Mr. Heckoe, who had been held in reserve as an additional force to
                  meet any resistance which might be offered, sat beside the driver and recounted to
                  him the ingenuity and success of the capture.
               What gloomy thoughts and terrible forebodings filled the mind of the unhappy
                  Matthew, as the carriage traversed the streets until it descended from Broadway
                  into the valley which lies between that street and the Bowery, and which like a
                  sink drains the misery and vice of the metropolis, and as they drew up before a
                  side door of that forbidding edifice, the Tombs, may be better imagined than
                  described.
               After some preliminary ceremonies which were apparently considered to be necessary
                  before Matthew could be considered as fairly installed in his new accommodation tion and in which the officers of the
                  prison took a much more active part than the young prisoner himself, Matthew was
                  inducted into a circumscribed, ill-furnished and ill-ventilated apartment which he
                  was informed would be at his service during his stay.
               Leaving Matthew where the officer left him, in this cell whose walls glaring with
                  whitewash made the scanty light that struggled through a narrow slit of a window
                  tolerably sufficient to show him that he was now fairly in prison, we will turn to
                  visit Roselle and observe the scenes that await her.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               TRUST YOUR KINDRED, WHOMSOEVER YOU DOUBT.
               WHILE it was with real grief that Roselle had bid her brother good-bye the evening
                  before he left Harsford's Mills,—at which time it should be mentioned he walked
                  over to visit her,—she had still felt no little sisterly pride in his plans; and
                  her quiet encouragement and sympathy supplied an additional stimulus to his
                  purposes and hopes. When, on a previous visit, he had told her he should leave his
                  present residence, so near her, and go to the city, she indeed wept at the thought
                  of the separation, and besought him not to go. Yet his serious earnestness of
                  purpose soon overcame her hesitation, and she resolved to say nothing to him upon
                  this last interview, but words of cheer. The parting was doubtless as hard to him
                  as it was to her. She would not make it harder. So with smiles predominant, and
                  tears shed only by stealth, and hastily wiped away, she bade her brother good-bye,
                  and he returned to the Mills, and thence departed next morning in the stage.
                  Roselle, resisting an increased sense of loneliness, which at times overcame her
                  utmost resolution, devoted herself anew
                  to her employment of teaching. She had now attained such prosperity in this
                  employment, that she could make a direct and exact compensation for her board; and
                  she experienced a new relief in finding herself released from the uncertain and
                  ill-defined domestic obligations, the performance of which had been at first the
                  only compensation she had been able to make. Now too she could more freely enjoy
                  the recitations at the academy than she could when her time for attending them was
                  snatched in the intervals of care at home. Thus then, free as a bird in the
                  independence which her fortunate occupation brought to her, she sang and knitted,
                  and knitted and sang through a growing circle of engagements, till almost half the
                  homes in the village had been enlivened by her visits. It is true her tuition fees
                  were very small, but so also her wants were very small and very few. It was thus
                  that Roselle was engaged when she received Matthew's second letter from New York;
                  the one urging her to come down to the city to visit him while he was yet staying
                  at Mrs. Hopley's.
               In truth the project of consulting an oculist, though always a favorite plan of
                  her brother's, had never been encouraged by the blind girl herself. She had wholly
                  resigned herself to her fate. She cherished no expectation, and had no hope, that
                  she should ever be restored to sight. At the present moment, however, the request
                  certainly came more opportunely than ever before. She felt more independence and
                  self-reliance than she ever yet had attained, and she now began to feel that with
                  restored sight her life would have more of promise in it than it had ever
                  presented. Then, again, the way seemed now opened as it never yet had been.
                  Matthew was in the city, and in a substantial position, and the means of defraying
                  the expenses of her journey were in her hands. The only obstacle was that the
                  journey was a long and tedious journey,—a journey formidable to be undertaken
                  alone, to any young girl, but almost too formidable to her, a blind and helpless
                  girl. After advising with those of her friends who seemed most able to direct her,
                  she resolved that her own timidity should not be the obstacle which should prevent
                  her going; and she therefore finally wrote to Matthew by the hand of one of her
                  companions, as amanuensis, that she would come;—that she had some hope that she
                  might find company, but she could not hear of any one as yet, and she did not
                  think it would be best to wait;—that she would start on Monday morning by the
                  stage that left Harsford's Mills, and should, by the assistance of the driver,
                  reach the boat in Troy at night, by which she would arrive next morning in New
                  York; "where," she said, "you will meet me, my dear brother, at the wharf."
               With these plans and expectations, she mailed her letter the day before Matthew's
                  quarrel with his employer. This letter Matthew, who had good reason to be anxious
                  to hear from his sister, as to her plans for her journey, obtained from the Post
                  office on Sunday morning. And being by the events of the previous day at once
                  thrown out of employment, and mysteriously excluded from his home, he determined
                  to go up to Troy on Monday morning to
                  meet his sister there, and either accompany her down at night, or postpone the
                  visit for a time, and escort her back to her home meanwhile.
               Upon that same Monday morning, Roselle, with bright anticipations, yet not without
                  serious foreboding and solicitude at commencing so solitary a journey, entered the
                  stage, and was swiftly carried on her way. To venture upon such a journey alone
                  seemed like embarking to cross the ocean in a shallop. It was not impatience that
                  made the day seem long, yet never had she spent so long a one. Every mile that the
                  speed of her journey dropped between herself and her home, seemed to be an
                  addition to the burden of the responsibility and danger she was incurring. And
                  while, as the stage was rolling on its way, she reclined in the corner of the
                  coach quietly listening to the conversation of the strangers who surrounded her;
                  or while at the stopping-places, when others got out, she sat in her seat,
                  watching with an attentive ear for all the unfamiliar sounds, in such scenes; you
                  would hardly have suspected from her quiet, passive countenance, the surmises of
                  evil and danger, and the disquietude and alarm with which each new phase of her
                  strange experiences filled her mind. The sudden swinging of the coach, when the
                  burly driver threw a trunk into its place upon the rack behind; the noise of some
                  outside passenger moving the small baggage upon the roof of the coach to improve
                  his seat there; the unexpected starting of the horses when all was ready; the
                  alternations of up-hill and down-hill riding, for the changes of which no glimpses
                  of scenery prepared her; these, and many other little things which pleasantly
                  break the monotony of stage-coach riding to the ordinary traveler, made the poor
                  blind girl all the more uneasy and solicitous.
               Necessity makes a thousand things possible which, without its stern pressure,
                  never could be attempted; and this girl, so helpless in such circumstances, so
                  unused to such scenes, summoned all her courage, as the approach of evening found
                  them near the end of their ride, in preparation for consigning herself to the
                  conveyance of the steamer down the river. The driver with blunt kindness conducted
                  her to the boat, as a fortnight before he had promised Matthew he would do, and
                  hurrying her into the charge of the stewardess, left her seated upon a settee in
                  the cabin, with the little bandbox which composed her baggage by her side.
               Sitting here where chance first placed her,—for she said she would prefer not to
                  retire,—the anxious girl remained, startled from time to time by all the strange
                  noises, which her keen ears could not but hear, but for which her inexperienced
                  mind could suggest no explanations. The evening wore away slowly, and the night
                  more slowly still. The tread of the promenaders upon the decks over her head
                  diminished, intermitted, and finally ceased. The voices of the passengers about
                  the cabin grew quiet, leaving the strange groaning of the engine to come out more
                  strongly in the silence. The atmosphere of the cabin grew thicker and heavier,
                  until its sleepy poison silenced even the infantile portion of the inmates, and
                  put them one after another into a dull slumber. But still the wakeful, watchful,
                  fearful blind girl sat trembling at
                  every new sound, and equally alarmed at every occasional period of silence, and
                  longing for the morning and Matthew. Still she did not regret the undertaking, nor
                  would she have turned back. But in patience bearing her trepidation, she watched
                  and waited.
               Morning at last came, but no Matthew. The boat being made fast to the pier, the
                  passengers departed on their various ways. Strange faces peered in at the cabin
                  door in search of expected friends; but Roselle, who could see nothing, was
                  obliged to content herself with watching the footsteps as they approached, and
                  lingered, and turned away, and with listening to the voices she heard around her.
                  Her sharp and tutored ear would have known Matthew's step, I suppose, in a general
                  muster, or a fireman's procession; and his voice amongst the cheers of a
                  mass-meeting; and she was able to be sure that he had not come. Several good
                  women, themselves waiting for friends to meet them, and feeling from their own
                  solicitudes a sympathy for Roselle, approached her with inquiries, and two of
                  them, when their escorts arrived, respectively invited her to go with them. Her
                  heart leaped at these kind words, and the thought of relief, but she said
                  resolutely that her brother had promised to meet her, and she ought to wait for
                  him. He would come soon.
               "But," said the last of these departing friends, looking around upon the empty
                  cabin, "they are all gone now. It 's more than an hour since the boat got in. I do
                  n't think your brother will come now; something must have prevented him."
               "I thank you very much. I can not thank you enough; and yet I think I ought to
                  wait. I am sure he will come,—or send. He will send if he can not come."
               Attempting to encourage herself with these words, Roselle bade good-bye to her
                  fellow-passengers, and in truth she bade good-bye to her own self-possession also;
                  for when the last sound of their retreating footsteps was lost to her ear, amongst
                  the noise and confusion around, her heart sank within her, and she burst into
                  tears.
               Faint and weak with fatigue, hunger, and anxiety, the poor girl resolved to await
                  Matthew's coming till noon, and then if he had not come, to go, she knew not how,
                  in search of him.
               Already, by a presentiment engendered by her own trouble, she conjectured vague
                  and terrible evils befalling him; and began to forget her own suffering, in
                  imagining his. Alas! if she had known the truth, what hope or strength would she
                  have had left?
               As the church clocks of the city struck twelve, she rose from her seat, and taking
                  her bandbox in her left hand, and in her right a slender rod or wand which she
                  used for guidance in her walks, she groped her way to the door of the cabin.
                  Passing out, she met the black stewardess, who accosted her:
               "La! child, where are you going?"
               "I do n't know," said Roselle, "I am going to find my brother. Something must have
                  befallen him. He certainly would come if he was alive and well."
               "Oh, no, they do n't come half the time. Need n't think any thing 's happened to
                  him. He 's too busy.
                  Brothers generally are. They was generally so busy they could n't
                  possibly come. Husbands ain't generally too busy, but they forget all
                  about it. We had one woman here who made three trips with me, and then she was a
                  great mind to go back again. You see she would n't go ashore, because her husband
                  would n't come for her as he had promised he would. So she staid on board all day,
                  and went back up river that night, and came down again next night; and the next
                  day, along towards noon, he happened to think of it, and came down to
                  get her. He said he thought possible she might be on board, but she was all made
                  up to go back again. She said she felt like as if she belonged on the boat."
               "My brother is n't too busy, and he has n't forgotten either," said
                  Roselle. "Something has happened to him. I must go and find him right away."
               "Why child! are you crazy? You go right back again and sit down. Where does your
                  brother live?"
               "With Mrs. Hopley. She keeps a bakery. Do you know where it is?"
               "What street?"
               "I do n't know the street where he lives, but his business is in Hanover Square.
                  He is in Mr. Harsford's counting-room. Do you know Mr. Harsford?"
               "La, child! Me? No, not I. But I know where Hanover Square is, though; it 's 'way
                  over the other side of town. My husband used to work there."
               "I must go over there then. I must go right away."
               "Well, then, I'll put you into a carriage, if they are not all gone. I expect they
                  are, though. Come, we 'll see."
               With these words the kind stewardess conducted the blind girl out towards the
                  plank that led towards the pier.
               Her conjecture, however, proved to be too true. The pier was crowded with drays,
                  carts, carmen, barrels and boxes, and as far as she could see up the wharf, no
                  carriages were in sight.
               "No," said she, "not one. I expected they would all be gone. It 's too bad. But
                  come, have a heart. Cheer up! Cheer up! The captain will be down again by four
                  o'clock. He 'll fix you out. There 'll be plenty of carriages then. Come! You just
                  go back and sit down, and wait patient; and you 'll get home one of these
                  days."
               "Oh my brother, my brother," sobbed the girl, refusing to be comforted by this
                  thought. "I must go right away. Can't you take me? Oh, do take me yourself!
                  Something must have befallen him. Something terrible! He said
                  he would be here, and he is n't. Ah! I can not wait. He 's in some trouble, I
                  know. I will go now."
               "Stop! stop! child," cried the stewardess, grasping her by the arm, to prevent her
                  from passing over the plank, on which she had already one foot planted. "You go?
                  You can't go. They 'll run over you. You 'll be killed in the streets."
               "Ah!" said Roselle, turning her sightless eyes upon her friend, "do you not know
                  that I must? He is my brother. If he can not come to me, I must go to him."
               
               "You could n't get across the street without being knocked down."
               "Oh they would be careful for me. Men do not run over blind girls as if they were
                  sheep. They will be careful."
               "Careful! If they stop to pick you up after it, you may be thankful."
               "If I were hurt they would carry me to him. Do you think I can sit here while he
                  does n't come, after he said he would? I must go. Good-bye."
               "Well! stop a minute, if you will go, though I tell you it 's foolish. I 'll tell
                  you what to do. There 's an alley-way in the boxes on the pier. You follow that
                  right up to the head of the pier. When you get up to the head of it, there you 'll
                  find the office. There 's a door in the side, so you can go in, before you get off
                  the pier. When you get there, you go in, and ask for Mike. If he ain't there, you
                  wait for him. He 'll be around some wheres. You ask him to get you a carriage.
                  Tell him Jenny Montauk sent you. That 's my name, named after the boat. We
                  stewards mostly go by the name of the boats we run on. Mike 'll do any thing I ask
                  him. You tell him to get you a carriage. He can find you one out on the street.
                  Here! Let me lead you across the plank, and I 'll put your hand on the boxes to
                  start you."
               As good as her word, the stewardess led her forward, and in a moment, Roselle, who
                  with great trepidation ventured on the plank, rejoiced to find herself upon the
                  solid pier. Though she could see nothing, she knew at once in which direction her
                  course lay, for the noise of the carts and vehicles in the street at the head of
                  the pier, directed her. There was indeed a noise of wheels upon the pier
                  immediately around her, but this she could easily distinguish from that upon the
                  stone pavements beyond. The stewardess led her forward, and guided her to the
                  beginning of what she called the alley-way. It happened propitiously for Roselle's
                  enterprise, that the surrounding freight had been left upon the pier in rows or
                  heaps upon each side of a narrow foot-path, arranged for the convenience of
                  pedestrians, and which led up towards the street. This foot-path was upon one side
                  of the pier, while beyond it and parallel with it, the greater part of the breadth
                  of the pier was left free for the passage of carts, or rather was at this time
                  encumbered, obstructed, and wholly filled up with carts.
               "There," said the stewardess, "there 's a pretty straight path in the boxes; keep
                  in that, and you 'll go right up to the office. But do n't you step a step beyond
                  that, till Mike gets you a carriage. You do n't know what New York streets are.
                  Men may brag of their doings as much as they please, but a lone woman runs a
                  better chance any where else than in a crowd of men. That 's my experience."
               Roselle expressing her thanks to her friend, and bidding her good-bye, began to
                  grope her way slowly towards the street, guiding herself by the boxes and barrels
                  which formed a wall upon either side, and protected her from the vehicles on one
                  hand and from falling into the water, on the other, and feeling carefully for
                     each step and cautiously trying her
                  foothold before trusting her weight. The comparative ease with which she was able
                  to proceed gave her encouragement. The ominous presentiments which an anxious
                  inactivity had stimulated in her mind all the morning, were relieved by the
                  preoccupation of thought which every step required, and she began to feel already
                  the excitement of hope. She had proceeded a good way she thought, though in fact
                  not half the distance to the office, when her progress was arrested by her coming
                  against a cart that stood backed against the passage. She groped this way and that
                  but found no way to pass. She summoned all her courage and said "Driver," but
                  received no answer. Supposing that the driver had perhaps gone away, and might
                  soon return, she waited with patience, and meanwhile sat down upon a box.
               Sometime passed while she thus waited; at length she heard voices near by. They
                  were gruff voices, and their expressions had so little of gentleness, that she
                  shrank from appealing to the speakers. She could not tell the exact place or
                  distance from which they came, but she thought they were just the other side of
                  the freight upon her left. While waiting, she listened to their conversation.
               "I say Mike," asked one, "did you hear about that chap they arrested on the Troy
                  yesterday morning? Hand me the beer."
               "There take your beer," said Mike, "if you drink such stuff. It may be very well
                  for once in a while, but for a steady diet, give me old rye whiskey. I never drink
                  any thing stronger. No, I did n't hear about him. What had he been pocketing?"
               "Pocketing," said a third; "that shows which way Mike's ideas run. Talk to him
                  about spotting a man and he wants to know what's found on him. This fellow was n't
                  a sneak, but a regular blood-sucker. There's all about it in the paper this 
                     moring
                     morning
                  . I brought one down to read it. You must look out who fills your pipe
                  after this, ha! ha! Do n't let the old woman get hold of it, he! he! Mike. She 'd
                  smoke you out pretty quick, eh? She 'd put you where old rye would n't hurt you,
                  ha! ha! nor cost you much either, ha! ha!"
               "Read it," said the first speaker.
               "Oh, hang your paper, tell us about it," said Mike. "You 're always lugging around
                  some rag of a newspaper, and showing off your larning. Tell us about it."
               Roselle could then hear the rustling of a newspaper in a pause of the dialogue;
                  also the gurgling of some liquid, as if running from the mouth of some bottle down
                  some other mouth. These men were stevedores or 'long-shore men, a class who live
                  like rats in the cellars and garrets bordering on the river, and work or lounge
                  during the day according as they can find employment in lading and unlading
                  vessels, and other hard drudgery required in the course of commercial business. It
                  was now noon, and they had seated themselves in a sunny nook among the boxes, to
                  enjoy a respite from toil, and to partake a scanty meal in which the want of the
                  stimulus of an abundance of wholesome food was wretchedly supplied by drugged and
                  poisoned liquors of the poorest class.
               
               One of these men had at this moment in his hand the Daily Sun, from which he was
                  about to read for the amusement of his companions the account of the fatal scenes
                  of the previous few days.
               But Roselle, unconscious of the terrible tidings she was so soon to hear, sat
                  motionless upon her seat, scarcely daring to breathe, lest some danger should
                  approach unheard by her; yet she listened with all the keenness of her sense.
               It was with a singular fascination that this poor girl, sitting thus in so strange
                  a place, so ignorant of what was going on around her, so helpless, yet in so
                  pressing need of help, so overburdened with anxiety and care, turned her acute ear
                  toward the voices, and forgetting her impatience at being stopped in her course,
                  listened and waited for the reading to begin.
               In a dull monotonous voice very different in tone from that in which he had
                  conversed, the reader began. He read slowly and imperfectly, stumbling at long
                  words, and overlooking short ones; but we may disregard, as Roselle did, his
                  quaint and ludicrous mistakes. Listening, she heard him read how a terribly
                  mysterious murder had been committed. That on Sunday morning Mr. Alexander
                  Harsford, a prominent commission merchant, doing business on Hanover Square, and
                  extensively known in commercial circles, was found dead in his study.
               "Ah! my brother," said Roselle to herself, "I see now how it may be that you have
                  not been able to come for me. At such a time there is so much for friends to
                  do."
               "The mystery of his death," the account went on to say, "is now solved. Poison had
                  been introduced into some cigars which had been brought to him, and smoking one of
                  them had caused his death."
               "Oh, how terrible!" thought she.
               "The perpetrator of the act had been pursued, and was caught upon the very point
                  of escaping from the city, and is now safely lodged in the Tombs."
               "Ah! my brother, how glad you must be that so wicked a man has not escaped."
               "The chain of evidence against him seems to be complete, and although it is with
                  regret that we are brought to believe so young a man to be so desperate, either
                  from revenge or other motive, yet there can be no reason to doubt that the
                  prisoner is the murderer. The affair has been in the experienced hands of
                  Detective Sneyer, and he has already collected overwhelming proofs. It is known
                  that the young man brought the cigars to the house himself on Saturday night, and
                  it was yesterday ascertained that he bought the poison at a well-known druggist's
                  that afternoon. It has transpired also that he had a quarrel with Mr. Harsford
                  that morning, and it is said threatened his life then. The young murderer was in
                  his victim's employ at his store, and the quarrel arose out of some of their
                  relations on some private matters of business."
               "One of his clerks," thought Roselle. "Then Matthew knows him. Oh! how he must
                  feel."
               "Our reporter visited the criminal in his cell in the Tombs this morning. Although
                  evidently much impressed with the fearful position in which he has placed himself, he does not seem to have much
                  sense of his crime. Although every fact unerringly points to him, he says he is
                  innocent, and shall insist upon it to the last. He is recently from the country
                  and spoke much of a sister whom he had sent for, but who had not arrived. He said
                  he had no other friends."
               These words touched Roselle's heart, not merely with sympathy, but also with a
                  rushing current of fears and terrors she would not entertain, but could not
                  repulse.
               "His name is Matthew Caraby."
               The cry that rose from the lips of the blind girl at these words, spoke a volume
                  of misery and suffering. It was not loud nor long. It was a gentle cry in its
                  beginning, and was cut short in its utterance, as her powers failed, her head
                  swam, her limbs relaxed, her strength deserted her, and she fell back insensible
                  against the boxes behind her.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               UNCERTAINTY IS THE WEIGHTIEST OF CARES.
               THE reader may share Roselle's surprise that Matthew, even if defeated in the
                  performance of his promise to meet his sister on her arrival, did not at least
                  send some one in his place. I have but ill succeeded in depicting the genuine
                  though imperfectly developed generosity and magnanimity of his native character if
                  it appears possible that even the severe anxiety in which he was himself involved
                  could cause him to forget his sister's helplessness. It was his misfortune to
                  distrust the nobler qualities of human nature so much as to have but few friends,
                  but those few he loved more warmly, and cherished more generously for that very
                  reason. He was not so unmindful of his sister as to neglect any thing in his power
                  to do in her behalf. But the behests of a prisoner are not so weighty as those of
                  a free man. Matthew's first messenger, who required to be paid in advance the
                  night before for the task which he was charged to perform the next morning, spent
                  in his own convivial entertainment over night the exorbitant sum he had extorted,
                  and arose next day much too late to fulfill his duty. Matthew, after waiting impatiently all the forenoon,
                  became convinced of the faithlessness of his first envoy, and dispatched another;
                  the most promising one he could find in the precincts of his present abode, though
                  by no means the sort of gentleman one would encourage in particular attentions to
                  one's sister if it could be helped. Having learned something by experience,
                  Matthew took the precaution to advance but a small installment of the agreed
                  compensation, and he thereby secured a sufficiently prompt departure, and a
                  sufficiently prompt return; but the report of his second messenger was still more
                  unsatisfactory to Matthew than the silence of the first.
               "She 's come," said this envoy, returning about one o'clock. "Where 's my
                  money?"
               "Where is my sister?" exclaimed Matthew, excitedly.
               For the messenger had returned alone, and without sign or token of success.
               "I do n't know. I could n't find her. I 've been, and she is come, and that 's all
                  I know about it."
               "Could n't find her? Where is she? How do you know she 's come? What 's become of
                  her? Speak quick."
               "Why how should I know? I went to the boat. Cut right down there. Stewardess said
                  a blind girl had come down with them. She waited till noon, and then she got half
                  crazy because nobody came for her; thought her brother must be dead or something
                  worse; and went off alone to find him, in spite of all she could do or say. She
                  had n't been gone half an hour, she said. She sent her up to the office to have a
                  carriage got for her. I told her that the girl was more than half right about the
                  brother, for he was in a fair way to be dead and something worse too before long,
                  and I came away. I expected I should find her here before me, for they say a blind
                  girl will track out the folks she belongs to quicker 'n a dog. If she is n't here
                  that 's not my fault. So where 's my money? You do n't mean to do me out of that
                  because the girl 's run away, do you?"
               "Why did n't you ask at the office?"
               "Why did n't I? Because I did. I 'm not such a jolly fool as to go right by the
                  door without it. The office folks had n't seen any thing of her."
               By all his inquiries, Matthew could get no further information, so at last he paid
                  the fellow, glad to have no more to do with him, and sat down again to rack his
                  aching brain with the fruitless inquiry,—"What shall I do?" He thought of sending
                  to Miss Harsford, but what madness was that! He was sure that for his innocent and
                  helpless sister she would do what she could, but the bare thought of their
                  relative positions repelled the idea of any application to her. How could he hope
                  indeed to be permitted to communicate with her? He thought of Arabella, whom he
                  had seen so unexpectedly on Saturday night; and he wondered whence she came. He
                  thought of Mrs. Hopley, and wondered whither she had gone. He thought of Mrs.
                  Temple and Benny, but felt that there was nothing that they could do. He thought
                  of Roselle, alone, ignorant, inexperienced, helpless, and longed for some means to
                  send aid to her. He finally resolved to wait for a time. Roselle might yet
                     come. She was perhaps on her way.
                  She had yet to learn where he was, and her progress after she knew where to come,
                  must be slow. It were unreasonable to expect her yet. Despite all his
                  calculations, however, his fears and anxieties over-mastered these feeble hopes,
                  until at length, in overwhelming perplexity, he threw himself on the little iron
                  cot and groaned aloud in bitterness of spirit.
               Roselle meanwhile lying where the overwhelming tidings of her brother's fate had
                  cast down her frail form, was unconsciously exposed to new dangers, and was as
                  unconsciously succored in a singular manner.
               It was not a long time after her fall, but her returning consciousness did not at
                  once restore her former powers. She lay for a time in that dreamy state in which
                  one receives impressions, but can communicate nothing. She felt the sunshine upon
                  her face. She grew conscious that she lay upon a hard and uncomfortable couch, and
                  in a constrained and uneasy position. She heard voices, as one hears voices in a
                  dream. She felt, or thought she felt herself touched. Gradually her sensations
                  became more distinct. She could distinguish what was said. Now it was a child's
                  voice; then a man's; then the child's again, more shrill than before.
               "Go away I say," cried the childish voice, "you shall not touch her."
               The words had no clear meaning to Roselle's mind.
               "Hush! be quiet! you little vagabond. I was n't doing any thing," replied the
                  older voice.
               "You was. You was takin' her money. I saw you."
               "Shut up your dirty head or I 'll toss you into the dock," replied the man's
                  voice, approaching nearer in Roselle's hearing, and growing more distinct to
                  Roselle's wakening sense. "You be quiet. It 's none of your business what I do.
                  It's my bandbox."
               "It is n't your bandbox. It belongs to the poor girl," insisted the child's
                  voice.
               "No such thing," said the man, "I tell you it is mine, and if you 're not quiet, I
                  'll give you over to the police for stealing fruit."
               "I do n't believe it," said the child, "it 's hers. If you touch it, I 'll scream.
                  E'ee! Young lady! Miss! Miss!"
               This shriek and these exclamations uttered at the very moment that Roselle felt
                  something pull at the bandbox, which still hung by its string upon her finger, was
                  enough to rouse her from her insensibility. As she moved, the thief who would have
                  robbed her, released the box, and with an oath, aiming a malicious blow at the
                  child, which the child in turn nimbly evaded, ran away and disappeared.
               "Poor girl," said the child talking to herself, "I do believe she 's sick. If I
                  had n't come up just now, like as not she would n't have had any thing left."
               Roselle raised her head feebly, resting it upon her hand, and turned her face
                  towards the speaker.
               "Who is that?" she asked.
               "It 's me," said the child. "Are you sick?"
               Roselle lay still for a few moments, making no reply. She was endeavoring to recover her thoughts, and to
                  recall her recollection of where she was, and how she came to be there. At length
                  she spoke.
               "What is the matter?" she asked.
               "Ah! They were going to rob you," replied the child. "You should n't go to sleep
                  upon these boxes,—that is if you 've got any thing to be stolen."
               "Have I been asleep?" asked Roselle.
               "You did n't answer me when I spoke to you," said the child. "I tried to wake you
                  up. I thought you were asleep. Then I thought you were sick, you look so pale and
                  white."
               "Where am I? Who are you? Has Matthew come? Oh, no! Oh, my brother! They said he
                  was in the prison. I must go. What have I been stopping here for?"
               And Roselle tried to rise, but her strength failed her.
               "Ah! how sick you are," said the child, "you can hardly stand. Won't you buy an
                  orange? Here! look! it is only four cents. See! it 's a fine one. I should like to
                  give it to you if I could."
               "Where is it?"
               "Here right before you. Do n't you see it? It will do you good."
               "Ah! my child, I do n't see it. I can't see. I am blind."
               "Are you blind?" said the child's voice.
               There was something very touching to Roselle in this voice, soft, gentle, yet
                  deliberate and distinct, betokening in the kindness of its tones that the native
                  generosity of the child had been stimulated not quenched by the severe experiences
                  of her life.
               "Are you blind?" she continued. "Oh, how sorry I am. Here is the orange. I will
                  put it in your hand. There! But why do you go about alone if you are blind?"
               "Alas!" said Roselle, as the full recollections of her troubles overcame her, and
                  she burst into tears, "my poor brother—they 've put him in prison—I was trying to
                  find him, but now I do n't know what to do. I do n't know what to do."
               "Now you will eat the orange, and that will make you feel better. There; if you
                  are blind, I will open it for you. This is the way my mother does."
               "Thank you. What is your name, my child?"
               "Marie. That is, Marie Montecabella."
               "Marie, you are very kind to me."
               "Ah! If you were only well and could see. And then that ugly fellow was going to
                  steal your things. He had his hand in your pocket when I came."
               "And how did you dare to come near him?"
               "Oh! I was n't afraid. I knew he would n't dare do any thing if he thought any
                  body saw him. So I just let him know that I was looking at him."
               "And so you drove him away, Marie. You 're a brave girl. How old are you?"
               "I do n't know. I expect I am a good many years. I can remember ever so many
                  winters."
               "How many?"
               "Oh! six or seven. I can always remember the winters, they are so cold."
               
               "But how is it that you come down here all alone, Marie?"
               "I sell oranges, and nuts, and apples, and other things. I come down to the boats
                  to sell to the people. See my basket there. Ah! but you are blind, I forgot. You
                  shall feel of it. There! It's quite full. I have n't sold hardly any thing
                  to-day."
               "Come a little nearer me, Marie. You are going to be one of my friends, I think;
                  and I always have to look at my friends with the tips of my fingers, just as I did
                  at your basket."
               With this request Marie complied, and Roselle gathered from a rapid but close
                  physiognomical examination, that the child before her was a plump round-faced
                  girl, twelve or thirteen years of age. That she had a smooth complexion, regular
                  features, thick, soft hair, large eyes, and a stout well developed frame. She
                  further detected that Marie was clad in a thin and well worn dress, neatly made,
                  of calico, and had over her round full shoulders, a little woolen shawl which
                  served to cover her arms, and in the front corners of which she could wrap her
                  hands to protect them from the cold of these autumnal days. Upon her head, was a
                  little hood made of silk already worn thin, and as it leaned back from her chubby
                  face, disclosed a lining of similar material. If in addition to this, Roselle
                  could have seen the look of intelligence that shone in those large and lustrous
                  eyes and lighted up the full and healthy face, the smile that disclosed a
                  beautiful set of pearly teeth, and the air of womanly dignity and self-possession
                  with which the little maiden took her basket upon her arm, and folded her hands in
                  the shawl as if she were ready to move on,—if Roselle could have seen all this,
                  she would have had before her complete, a very perfect picture of childhood in
                  health, beauty, and vigor. Altogether Marie presented a spectacle not often seen
                  amongst the children of the great city.
               "Would you like to buy any thing else?" asked Marie, "any pins, needles, tape,
                  buttons, shoe-laces? I have got some under the fruit."
               "No," said Roselle, "but I must pay you for the orange; but I do n't want you to
                  go away yet; I want you to go with me."
               She put her hand into her pocket for her purse, but her search for it appeared to
                  be in vain.
               "Ah, me!" she exclaimed, "where is my purse?"
               "Did he take it then, after all?" exclaimed Marie. "Oh! what a shame."
               "It is surely gone," said Roselle mournfully. "It did not have a great deal of
                  money in it, for I am not rich;" said Roselle, "but it 's gone, what there was. I
                  am sorry, for now we can't take a carriage."
               "And you can't pay me for the orange?"
               "No, Marie, that was all the money I had, every bit. I can't pay you; that is, I
                  can't here. But if you will come with me, and show me the way to my brother, I
                  will pay you then. He will have some money, and he will give me all I need."
               "Where to do you want to go?"
               "Ah! I want to go to the prison. To the Tombs, I thought they called it. Is there a prison that they
                  call the Tombs?"
               "Oh, yes."
               "That is where my brother is, then. Poor Matthew. Come, let us go quick."
               "I know the Tombs," said the child, sadly, "but I must sell my oranges. I 've been
                  here a good while now, and I must go."
               "If you will go and guide me, I will pay you for your trouble as soon as we get
                  there. My brother will have money I know. And I will pay you for your orange too.
                  I know I am a stranger, but you can believe me. You have been a friend to me, and
                  a poor blind girl can not afford to deceive her friends. I tell you the
                  truth."
               "I will go with you," said Marie. "Only I do n't know what my mother will say, if
                  I do n't sell my oranges."
               "You shall sell your oranges; or I will pay you enough to make up all you lose,"
                  said Roselle, as she rose, and essayed to walk. "Ah! I feel better now. But where
                  is your hand, Marie?"
               The child took her heavy basket upon her left arm, and twined the string of
                  Roselle's band-box upon that hand, and extended the right toward her companion,
                  and commenced slowly to lead her around toward an exit from the place in which
                  they were.
               "Did you say your brother was in the Tombs?" she inquired.
               "Yes, so I heard them say."
               "They put my father in the Tombs, too."
               "Ah! Oh! poor Matthew."
               "Yes. He has an organ he plays on in the streets. He played one night very late,
                  because he had n't earned enough to get any thing for us to eat, and they arrested
                  him, the police officers did, for playing so late, so they put him in the Tombs.
                  But he is going to get out again, mother says, soon."
               "Is he? Come, let us go quicker. Why do you stop?"
               "We must wait for that cart. I could get across the street easy, but you could n't
                  now."
               "Well let us be quick—my brother is waiting."
               "What did they put your brother in for?"
               "Oh! Matthew, Matthew," cried Roselle in the agony with which this question
                  pierced her heart. "My poor persecuted, innocent brother! What will become of us?
                  Quick! quick! let us be quick! Marie! Marie! quick!"
               Thus urging her little guide, and following close beside her, the blind girl
                  crossed the street, and they threaded their way up the crowded side-walk toward
                  Broadway.
               The foot-passengers who hurried past turned to glance at this singular couple.
               Roselle, her fair face pale with excitement and weakness, and made still more
                  strange in its wild expression by the dishevelled locks that fell down each side
                  from beneath her hat, walked feebly and with uncertain steps. She held her rod or
                  wand in her right hand. With her left she clung to the child, whose bright, full
                  face, and firm step contrasted singularly with the mien of the unfortunate and
                  unhappy young girl.
               
               Matthew in his cell waited with a hot and feverish impatience as the hours of the
                  afternoon wore away. His meager dinner was untouched. Mingled with all the
                  recollections of the past, and forebodings for the future, which crowded upon his
                  mind, there was an agony of suspense and inaction that made his suffering he
                  thought almost too great to bear. He was a new prisoner there; his was a startling
                  case; the eclat of so bold, so ingenious a form of crime, made him an object of
                  great interest in the prison;—made a lion of him I was going to say. And I might
                  appropriately say so indeed, for all the while as he lay there upon the cot, or
                  sat up, or rose with the futile purpose of pacing back and forth, or threw himself
                  upon the cot again, his frame convulsed with the excitement and agony which filled
                  his soul, strange faces of turnkeys and visitors and fellow prisoners one after
                  another looked in from the narrow gallery without through the half open door of
                  his cell; and as they looked at his sinewy and vigorous form, and his disturbed
                  and anxious countenance, which with uneasy eyes turned in every direction in vain
                  search of rest, he looked like a lion caged in some great menagerie, and they like
                  the boys who pointed to the strange creature through the bars of his cage.
               He was in this mood of mind when he heard a sobbing voice he recognized, approach
                  his door.
               A child's voice said, "This is the door, stoop a little now," and Matthew saw
                  Marie, leading his sister, enter his cell.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               PLEASURE IN THE POCKET DOESN'T HELP PAIN IN THE HEART.
               THE arrest of Matthew brought an overwhelming surprise upon Charlotte. The thought
                  that he might be imagined to be in some way implicated in the mystery of her
                  father's death was forced upon her mind for a moment during her conversation with
                  Mr. Sneyer and his companion on Sabbath afternoon. It was once or twice revived
                  when in the course of brief conversations between herself and her mother and
                  brother upon the chief subject of their thoughts, she heard Matthew's name
                  mentioned coupled with harsh and insinuating epithets. But she had had no
                  suspicion that he was, or that he could be thought to be the perpetrator of the
                  crime. When, however, the full results of Mr. Sneyer's investigations were made
                  known to her, she could say nothing further in his defense.
               The strange death of Mr. Harsford excited the greatest attention. The newspapers
                  were full of it. They served it up in every possible style. They gave it in full
                  as a fresh joint in the news pages. They made hash of it in the letters from
                  correspondents. They served it up cold
                  by quoting, in very small type, what each other had said about it the day
                  previous. They boiled it down into a thin editorial soup, which trickled all the
                  way down the leading column. And in whatever way they dished it up, it was
                  devoured most greedily. They made it the subject of numerous and most inconsistent
                  cuts and illustrations; showing the street and the position of the house; showing
                  the arrangement of the rooms within the house; showing the interior of the study,
                  and the positions of the various articles of furniture, especially the sofa
                  whereon Mr. Harsford was found. No two of these diagrams however looked alike; but
                  when I came to cut them out and paste them in a scrap-book I keep of curious
                  newspaper items, my pages looked like a treatise on domestic architecture got up
                  with plans of dwellings adapted to suit every variety of taste at every variety of
                  price. Portraits also were not wanting; for the editor of the Pictorial Journal,
                  having among some old cuts purchased at auction, a portrait of Jonathan Edwards
                  taken when he first entered the university, and rightly judging that his patrons
                  would not be likely to recognize it, he had it lettered "Matthew Caraby," and
                  brought it out on the first page with a biographical notice, to the infinite
                  delight of his readers, and the profound edification of many phrenologists, who
                  found in the correspondence which they observed between the conformation of the
                  skull of the eminent divine and the attributed character of Matthew new
                  attestations of the truth of science.
               The newspapers being thus filled with all the details and minutiæ of the case, it
                  followed that it was discussed in every quarter of the town. Every body was busy
                  talking about it. Every known detail of the quarrel was rehearsed, together with a
                  great many which were not known. The various events leading to the fatal issue
                  were reviewed separately and in their connection;—the relation of the prisoner to
                  the deceased, and the motive which he found in their quarrel for perpetrating so
                  daring an act, and one so unexpected from one so young and unconnected in other
                  ways with crime. And it was not long before public curiosity, put upon inquiry,
                  sought and found some account of the earlier history of the accused. He had but
                  just left his former employment in the country, where he bore a good enough
                  character, people said, except that he was quick-tempered. He left suddenly, and
                  some people said in consequence of a quarrel, the particulars of which were not
                  known. He had in some strange manner fastened himself upon his victim, and
                  harassed him with some deep and sinister purpose, without doubt, until the day for
                  the fatal blow. Mr. Warrack had disclosed, so it was reported, that the deceased
                  had taken the prisoner into his employ unwillingly, and only in consequence of
                  some claims which the prisoner had upon him, which Mr. Harsford did not appear to
                  be in a position to resist, though the nature of them was not known to Mr.
                  Warrack. The further facts that Matthew on the day of the commission of the crime
                     bought poison of the description used, which was indisputably
                  proved by evidence collected by the indefatigable Mr. Sneyer, that he was
                  afterwards an hour alone at the office
                  with the cigars, having himself volunteered to carry the box to Mr.
                     Harsford, and having sent away John, the only person remaining in the
                  counting-room. That he was met on the stairs by the porter as he went out carrying
                  the box with him; that he left the box at the door of his victim's
                  house at the close of the afternoon, when he might probably not be
                  recognized; that being unexpectedly recognized by the young lady who fortunately
                  met him at the door, he endeavored to avoid an interview with her, and departed
                  hastily and in a confused manner;—all these facts, with some minor circumstances
                  which are omitted from this narrative as unimportant, and many rumors which were
                  wholly false, or gross exaggerations of facts having no true bearing on the case,
                  pointed the public mind irresistibly to Matthew as the murderer.
               The funeral of Mr. Harsford took place on Wednesday morning. The house which had
                  been so carefully guarded, was now beset by a vast crowd of inquisitive mourners
                  and curious condolers, who jostled each other in the halls, and trod on each other
                  in the parlors, eager for a sight of those remains which were now more famous than
                  the living man had ever been, and they freely pointed out to one another the
                  widow, the son and daughter, the white-haired father from the country, the
                  confidential clerk, and other characters whom they recognized. The confusion and
                  publicity of the ceremony, most painful to Charlotte, seemed to have a soothing
                  and melancholy comfort for her mother. To all Charlotte's entreaties that so
                  afflicting a scene should not be made a public show, the mother urged resignation
                  and the necessity of leaving things to our friends on such an occasion, and the
                  respect which was due to public sympathy, however inconvenient its expressions
                  might be. It was evident that notwithstanding her assent to Charlotte's regrets,
                  she secretly enjoyed the pageant and pomp, as in some measure a counterpoise to
                  her grief. If he did have one enemy, she said, it was a pleasure to know that he
                  had so many friends. If he died by treachery, was it not a happy thought that he
                  should be buried by friendship?
               To this Charlotte made no reply. She could not trust herself to join the
                  procession in which every thing so distasteful to herself combined to insult, as
                  she thought, the memory of her father. The name of Friendship was a thin guise, to
                  her eye, for the noisy, excited curiosity that thronged the house and swayed the
                  crowd that hung around the coffin.
               A day or two after the funeral Charlotte entered, alone, the room which had been
                  her father's. It was the first time she had entered it since the fatal hour when
                  the sight of his lifeless form had thrown so black a shadow across her life. Since
                  then that scene had strangely clung to her. It seemed pictured upon her very
                  eyelids, so that every time she had closed them there stood before her the fearful
                  scene, and every feature of the room; the position of the furniture, the
                  half-closed shutters, the dimly-burning gas, the pen lying where his hand had laid
                  it aside, the paper on which he wrote, the opened box of accursed cigars before
                  him, the stump of one nearly burned and
                  gone out in cold ashes, which lay fallen upon the floor; the strange, unearthly
                  expression upon his face. All these stood out before her in sharp distinct view
                  upon her closed eyes. And by a power of association she could not resist, her
                  imagination acted on the sense of smell, and she felt the close stifling odor of
                  the dead smoke that had filled the room stealing over her and completing the
                  illusion by which she seemed carried back to that fatal scene. Thus her thoughts
                  were haunted by this picture till she resolved to go and by actually familiarizing
                  herself with the room in its altered condition to modify the painful image.
               She found her brother James seated at her father's desk examining his papers. He
                  looked up ill-humoredly as she entered. It was the first time she had met her
                  brother alone since that morning.
               "Oh, James," she said, coming to him, leaning her arm upon his shoulder and
                  resting her forehead upon his head as he sat at the desk.
               Poor girl. How hungry is your heart for the sympathy of a true and wise friend! It
                  brings you even by an instinct that has been a hundred times disappointed, but
                  which will not be undeceived, to your shallow, empty brother in the vain craving
                  for a support and an affection which his nature can not give.
               "Oh, James," she said, "I feel as if we were left alone now."
               The young man moved uneasily in his seat as if impatient at his sister's
                  presence.
               "I do not know how I could bear it alone, James," she continued, wiping the
                  tears,—the sacred tears that would have been wasted in anointing his selfish head,
                  "I do not know how I could bear it alone, but it brings us nearer together. We
                  have been so frequently separated that I have sometimes thought I was not the
                  sister to you I desire to be. But what a loss! What shall we do? Oh, James. How
                  much we shall look to you now! How mother and I lean on you already!"
               "What you will do I do n't know," returned the young man, "if you
                  come to that; it 's a bad piece of business,—that it should happen just at this
                  time too when his affairs are all in a snarl,—a perfect snarl."
               To this remark, so startling in its suggestions of James' heartlessness, and the
                  embarrassments of the estate, Charlotte made no reply.
               "He could not have gone off at an unluckier time," continued James. "I do n't
                  believe that any body but himself could manage his affairs. That Warrack is a
                  perfect noodle. He does n't know any more about the business than I do. He says
                  father always kept every thing to himself, and I should think he did, and does
                  still keep every thing to himself, for aught I can see that he 's left to us."
               "James! James!" said the sister, speaking gently between her sobs, "how can you
                  speak so? Please do not."
               "Oh, it 's all very well for you and mother to go on so, mourning, and black
                  dresses, and crape vails, and all that,—it 's very natural for you girls and
                  women, and of course to be expected; but what would become of me do you suppose if I were to give way to my feelings
                  like that, instead of looking into things, to see where we stand?"
               "That 's all right, James; perfectly right. I did n't mean to say you ought not to
                  attend to the business, I 'm sure, but oh! oh! oh!"
               "There! there! do n't cry now, Arlie. It won't help it any. It won't better it a
                  bit. All I meant was that while you 're crying after what 's lost and gone, I must
                  be looking after what we 've got left. There 's a precious lot of papers, but they
                  're cursed dry reading."
               At this remark Charlotte turned away with an involuntary shudder from her hopeful
                  brother, who devoted himself anew to the examination of drawer after drawer of
                  papers, while she, trying to dry her flowing tears, busied herself in little
                  offices of rearranging the room to give it a more comfortable appearance.
               While so doing her attention was attracted by a faded morocco case that lay upon
                  the end of the desk, near the place where the box of cigars had been found. This
                  miniature case had not been noticed before, perhaps because it was, where it lay,
                  an insignificant article in contrast with others, and it was partly concealed by a
                  pile of papers that had been pushed over it, or carelessly laid upon it. She took
                  it up mechanically, and opened it with a vacant air, as if lost in thought and
                  unconscious of what she was doing.
               "Why! James. What is this?"
               "I do n't know. What?"
               "Here! This picture."
               "Let me see. Oh! it 's some woman. Pretty good face."
               "I have seen that face," said the sister. "I know it. It must be! No! but how came
                  it here? Impossible! It can't be hers! Yet it is certainly her face. There 's no
                  doubting that. James, where did this come from?"
               "I do n't know. It 's always been here."
               "Why no, James."
               "I mean since before,—you know,—since Saturday. I saw it here then. I recollect
                  thinking it was a handsome face, and I would like to know the original. I wondered
                  what father was doing with it, and in that musty old case too. Some ancient flame
                  of his, only I 'd have a new case for it, if I was going to have it lying round.
                  But do n't bother me now. I want to see what 's here."
               And the young man opened a new bundle of papers.
               "It 's certainly she," said Charlotte, "or amazingly like her. James, I—"
               "There now," said James, "shut up your old miniature and look here. Here 's
                  something worth looking at. See here!" And he held up some papers folded long and
                  narrow, and with a partly printed and partly written endorsement on the back of
                  each. "See here! 'Monument Life Insurance Company, on Alexander Harsford; payable
                  to Mrs. Harsford; ten thousand dollars.' Not so bad after all,—is it? Here 's an
                  insurance on his life for mother's benefit. And here 's another one for you, in
                  the Marble Company. Five thousand. There you are. Now where 's mine? Mine will be
                  fifteen thousand, or twenty,—yes, if it 's in the same proportion it will be
                     twenty thousand for me. Five for
                  you, ten for mother and twenty for me. The old gentleman was very thoughtful after
                  all to insure his life for us. He always was a good father. But where is mine?
                  That 's what I want to know now. And 't was so lucky too. See, 't was only done a
                  fortnight ago,—not a fortnight ago,—last week. Just in the nick of time. I declare
                  I never heard of any thing more fortunate; and those are good companies too. But
                  where can mine be? It ought to be with these."
               Charlotte had nothing to say. As she looked at the papers her eyes filled with
                  tears again, at the thought that one of the last acts of business her father had
                  performed, had been to make provision for herself and her mother. She could no
                  longer see to read the inscriptions upon them as they lay upon the desk before
                  her. She turned away and left the room, where James remained searching anxiously
                  for the document which should evidence the expected provision for himself.
               Going up to her own rooms Charlotte carried in one hand her handkerchief with
                  which from time to time she checked her tears. In the other hand she carried the
                  miniature of Alfene.
               As for James he was successful in his search, though the prize did not bear the
                  proportion upon which he had fixed, as just. But he thought it a singular piece of
                  good fortune that his father, so few days before his death, should have thus made
                  provision for his family.
               Charlotte in her own rooms pondered long and painfully on the mystery of the
                  circumstance she had just discovered. That a miniature portrait delicately and
                  exquisitely executed, and presenting so fresh and beautiful a face, and yet
                  presenting in every light so strange a resemblance to the woman whom she knew as a
                  laundress, that woman herself being singular in her appearance and manner, and
                  having already excited a painful interest by the narrative which she had once
                  prepared Charlotte to hear, but the relation of which had been unexpectedly
                  disturbed,—these incidents so singularly connected, yet so separate and
                  unexplained, aroused anew the curiosity, the suspicions, the vague conjectures of
                  the girl. She went to her windows and watched for the inmates of the ivy-curtained
                  room. The day was keen and cold, and both windows were shut. Some white garment
                  was visible within the one usually open; hung against the glass so as to cut off
                  all sight within. The windows looked deserted. She returned to her seat and tried
                  to frame some explanation of this coincidence, but in vain. She tried to banish
                  the thought that it had any real significance for her. In this she was equally
                  unsuccessful. At last she formed her resolution.
               Changing her garments for the most simple and plain she possessed, and attiring
                  herself to attract upon the way as little attention as might be, and if possible
                  no recognition, she passed quickly down stairs into the basement, and watching her
                  opportunity slipped out at the area door unobserved. Turning in that direction in
                  which she thought she should be least likely to be noticed from the windows, she
                  bent her course around the block to the tenement house that had for her this
                  mysterious attraction.
               
               The finding the miniature, revived strongly in her mind the unfinished story of
                  the laundress. She was determined to let no more time pass without inquiring at
                  least into the details of that history which her poor neighbor had expressed
                  herself willing to narrate.
               "And I do not doubt she will also tell me," Charlotte added, in her own mind,
                  "about this miniature, that is, if she knows anything. She must know I think. How
                  could father have got it without her knowledge. Yet he never seemed to have any
                  acquaintance with her. Can I have mistaken the likeness? It is
                  perfect—perfect."
               And she drew the miniature from her pocket to examine it once more. Holding it
                  before her, and scrutinizing it, and walking slowly as she did so, she reached at
                  length the door.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               SHAME IS THE SHARPEST OF SORROWS.
               As Charlotte approached the narrow and black stair-case of the tenement house, she
                  slackened the speed with which she had walked, and began to ask herself how she
                  should enter upon the errand on which she had come. She did not falter in her
                  purpose, but she was perplexed to know the proper method of executing it.
               "What I wish," said she to herself, as she reached the top of the stairs, "is to
                  hear her story,—the story she was going to tell me when Benny interrupted us by
                  bringing in Mr. Caraby. Let me collect my thoughts. I want her to tell me in the
                  most natural and truthful way possible her own history. I must tell her nothing,
                  or as little as possible, for I ought to have her story unaffected by mine."
               With these reflections she knocked at the laundress' door. She stood waiting in
                  the cold and cheerless passage or landing, for an answer. The November wind sighed
                  through the bleak hall and stair-case, the lower door of which stood always open,
                  and she shuddered, partly with cold, and partly with the depressing influence of
                  her thoughts. Her heart beat faster as she heard a slight motion within the room, and felt that she was about
                  to discover the mystery which embarrassed her mind.
               In a moment the door was opened a very narrow crack, and the thin sharp face of
                  little Benny, inserted between the edge of the door and the door-post, appeared.
                  Seeing Charlotte, his friend and benefactress, he looked up to her face. There was
                  the ghost—no not the ghost, but rather the embryo of a smile upon his little
                  features, but it was merely the feeble offspring of the recognition, and it passed
                  away with a sigh. Strange to say he did not open the door and welcome her, but
                  stood there looking up into her face.
               "Ah, Benny, how do you do, and how is your mother?" asked Charlotte.
               "She's very sick I'm afraid," replied Benny, still holding the door. "She's a
                  feverin'."
               "Who is it Benny?" inquired a feeble voice from within, which Charlotte recognized
                  as that of Alfene.
               "It 's her, mother," replied Benny in a whisper, turning his face
                  back towards her. "It 's her. It 's Miss Harsford."
               And then as if in compliance with some signal from his mother, Benny opened the
                  door cautiously a little way and stood aside for his visitor to pass in. She
                  hesitated.
               "Please come in, mother says, and if you please let me shut the door. Our fire
                  is—is gone out."
               Charlotte stepped in and approached the bed-side of the poor woman. Benny
                  carefully closed the door after her and spread down some rags at the threshold.
                  Alfene lay on her cot, from which she had not risen for several days. Her cheeks
                  were flushed with heat, her hair disarranged, her garments lay in confusion upon
                  the bed over the thin and tattered bed-clothes, where they had evidently been cast
                  in order to give warmth to the invalid. The two chairs with the board across their
                  backs, which formed her ironing-table, were drawn toward the head of the bed, and
                  upon the end near her stood a tea-cup full of water. The room was chilly. The cold
                  stove instead of warming the room seemed to add to the discomfort of its cheerless
                  atmosphere. The little coal-box, which was broken, was turned upon its side empty
                  of the last particle of its dusty contents. The dead embers within the open door
                  of the stove, showed that the last little fire that had been kindled there was fed
                  with the fragments of the broken box. A thick garment was hung against each of the
                  windows, more to screen away the cold than to darken the room which these poor
                  people had no other means of lighting.
               Glancing an instant at these things and at Benny, who was stopping the chink
                  beneath the door, Charlotte took her seat upon the little stool near the cot, and
                  looked with pity upon the sick woman. Benny came up between them, and stood with
                  one arm extended over the cot soothing his mother's hot forehead, and looking
                  appealingly at Charlotte, as if he did not know what to say in this new
                  complication of trouble.
               "She is better this afternoon," he said at last, "I think she is. She was very
                  badly last night. I hoped you would come. I 've looked for you every day. Do n't
                  you think she is better?"
               
               "Indeed she is sick," said Charlotte.
               "Ah no," interposed the sick woman feebly. "I should be well enough if I was only
                  able to work. I feel a great deal better, only I have n't so much strength as I
                  used to have."
               Her feeble eyelids which she had raised to greet her visitor, fell of their own
                  weight, as if to testify how little strength she had.
               Charlotte had had little experience in the sick room, but she had the good sense
                  which dictated the first steps to be taken.
               She asked Mrs. Temple to let Benny do an errand for her, and receiving a nod of
                  acquiescence from the mother, who was reserving all her strength to fulfill the
                  intention which had been thwarted on the last occasion, Charlotte quietly
                  dispatched the boy with a half dollar to be invested in the purchase of fuel, tea,
                  sugar, a loaf of bread, a small quantity of milk and a candle. She did not attempt
                  to enter into conversation while he was gone, but sat pondering on the scene and
                  her errand. In a few minutes the lad returned with fuel,—the first installment of
                  his purchases,—and kindled a little fire in the stove. While he was gone again for
                  the residue, Charlotte heaped on the coal with so unsparing a hand that the little
                  stove fairly began to glow as it never had done before; and when Benny came in he
                  was quite struck with wonder at the luxury of a real blazing red-hot fire. Without
                  inquiries Charlotte satisfied herself that hunger as well as cold was one of the
                  inmates of this poor home, and soon the warmth of the fire and the simmering
                  mering sound of water on the stove preparing for a cup of tea, suffused the room
                  with an appearance which, though still wretched and pinched to Charlotte, seemed
                  the incoming of an age of luxury to the others.
               It was not long before Charlotte had made ready a cup of tea and a slice of toast
                  for the invalid. The latter drank the tea and seemed much refreshed. The toast her
                  feeble appetite rejected.
               "Mrs. Temple," said Charlotte, having waited some time to give the laundress the
                  opportunity of opening the conversation if she would, "I was sorry you were
                  interrupted the other day just as you were beginning to give me some account of
                  your history. If you feel strong enough I should like very much to have you go on
                  with it."
               Benny sat by the stove eating a slice of bread and enjoying the friendship of the
                  fire very highly. Alfene glanced at him as much as to say to Charlotte, "Please
                  come a little nearer so that he may not hear."
               Charlotte moved her seat close to the bed-side, told Benny to watch the fire and
                  not let it go down, and then turned to listen to the sick woman.
               "You will excuse me if I speak very low," she said. "My story is not so short as
                  my breath. If you can not hear, please draw a little nearer."
               
                  ALFENE'S STORY.
                  "I was born in 1808, with a twin sister. We lived in Vermont. In the town of
                     Calton. Alfene was not my name. It
                     was Mary. My sister's name was Martha. Temple was not my real name either. My
                     maiden name was Alvin. That's the way I came to be called Alfene from Alvin. I
                     will come to that by and bye.
                  "Our mother died while we were very young, and we lost our father when we were
                     about ten years old. Then we went to live with our aunt. She was our only
                     relative I believe. At any rate she was very kind to us. Too kind. She spoiled
                     us. I'm afraid she never would claim me again, but oh! what would I not give to
                     see her again before I die!
                  "My sister Martha was a beautiful girl. I can see her now. They used to say I
                     looked like her then, too. We were of the same size. Her hair and eyes were
                     black, as mine were. We always dressed alike. François used to say he could
                     never distinguish us unless he could induce one of us to speak,—he knew our
                     voices."
                  "Who was François? You have not told me about him," Charlotte said.
                  "I was going to do so. When I was just eighteen I became acquainted with
                     François,—my husband. François Vincent. He was a Frenchman. He was traveling in
                     this country. We were engaged. My aunt was opposed to him, but she did not know
                     him. I am sure if she had known François as I did she would have loved him. But
                     she would not hear me speak of him, and so at last we ran away. When he was
                     ready to return to Paris he came back to Calton, and one night we were married
                     and left the place immediately for the city; and here we went on board the
                     packet. I bade good-bye to Martha that night as we stood at the gate out beyond
                     the garden. I did n't think what I was doing when I did it. I never saw her
                     again. But François was a good husband. He was a Catholic, and he was really a
                     noble man, though I did lead him into some foolish things. I used to laugh at
                     his religious notions, as they seemed to me, but I believe now that if it had
                     n't been for me he would have been a better man. It is an awful thing, Miss
                     Harsford, for a wife,—a widow,—to lie on her dying bed and think that if it had
                     not been for her, her husband that was would have been a better man.
                  "We went to Paris."
                  "But what became of your sister?" asked Charlotte.
                  "I never heard from her. I was told once that she was lost in a storm. I know
                     she was married about a year after I went to Paris. I saw the marriage in a
                     newspaper. They told me when I came back that soon after her marriage, that is
                     a year or so, she was lost. So they told me. I suppose it was so. I 've never
                     heard of her since.
                  "We went to Paris. Ah, how time flew there! François was very successful; he
                     speculated, as you say here, at the Bourse. His business was folly, and folly
                     was my pleasure. We lived for more than ten years in luxury there. I had every
                     thing my caprice could desire. I forgot the instructions of my father, and all
                     the admonitions of my good aunt. I laughed François out of all his restraints.
                     I was—I can not tell you—'t would do no good to tell you the career of folly I
                     ran; since I have worse things yet to confess, we will let those pass. I must not conceal the truth, but the
                     darkest colors will suffice; they imply all the rest.
                  "One night François—But stop—that you may understand I must explain that I
                     gambled. I was mad with it. I was unfortunate at play. I always lost. What I
                     lost François had to supply. One night François told me he had no more money. I
                     said I must have it. I had parted with my jewels already. I thought he did not
                     know it. I told him I must have money. I must! Ah me! My heart! I recollect how
                     he looked. He looked sorrowfully at me. I shall never forget it. One does not
                     often see a man weep. The tears came into his eyes. He told me he was ruined.
                     His plans had failed, his expectations had been disappointed, the risks of
                     business had turned against him and he was bankrupt. I do n't know what I said
                     or did—God forgive me—but it broke his heart. He went away. I never saw him
                     again. They found him in the river, drowned."
                  The excitement of these recollections—her tears in recalling them—the intense
                     interest and anxiety with which the poor woman watched every expression of her
                     listener's face—these or some other causes seemed to have broken or at least
                     suspended her fever. She was bathed in perspiration; and with a weak effort
                     attempted to remove some of the coverings under which she lay. Charlotte
                     assisted her, and in a few moments, having gained breath, Alfene went on.
                  "What I suffered there I need not try to tell. No honest life was open to me. I
                     could not trust myself there. Friends I had had, but they were friends no
                     longer. Who would blame them? It was my fault, not theirs. I could no longer
                     maintain their society, even if they had wished it. I resolved to come to my
                     home, if only to die. I did not care to live there any longer. Perhaps—but no.
                     I was utterly wretched. I who went as a bride, in wealth and luxury, came back
                     as an immigrant, among the immigrants. They were very kind to me, for I was
                     sick; but still it was a contrast in my life. But I had nothing left. I was one
                     of them. It was about eleven years ago. I barely got ashore by the aid of my
                     immigrant friends. I was unknown and friendless except among them. I had not
                     money enough to carry me to Albany on my way home. I could not stay here. There
                     was no life for me here but a life of shame. I started to go home on foot. I
                     went only a few miles. I fasted as long as I could, and then I had to beg my
                     way They took me up as a vagrant, and sent me back to New York, where they said
                     the immigrants belonged. I had written home before this to my aunt, but I had
                     no answer. That was the reason I wanted to go myself, and yet had no help. They
                     sent me back. They meant well, I suppose, but I had better have starved on the
                     road than have let them bring me back. But I came. Then I fell into bad
                     company. Or rather, because I saw no resource left, I sought bad company. 'T
                     was no excuse, I know. But do not leave me. I know it is late, but I have
                     almost done. The rest is short."
                  And the poor woman covered her face with her thin hands, and gave herself up to
                     silent tears.
                  In a few moments she looked up and spoke to her son.
                  
                  "Benny," she said.
                  "What, mother?" said Benny, who was still enjoying the warmth of the fire.
                  "You may go out and play a little while now. You have been here so long."
                  "But I do n't care about going out; I like the fire a great deal better."
                  "My child, I think you had better go."
                  Poor Benny, accustomed to implicit obedience, complied with this strange
                     request, so far at least as going out of the room was concerned. Charlotte
                     heard him limping up and down the narrow hall a few times, and then his
                     footsteps ceased.
                  "Alas, my poor child," said the mother as he closed the door, "he need not know
                     of it yet. If the time ever comes when he must, I hope it may be after he has
                     forgotten me. I could not endure to think that he might hear me."
                  Here she paused some time.
                  "Charlotte," she said at length, "you may think it very strange in me to tell
                     you what I do. Bear with me, and forgive me if I am going too far. If you ever
                     are a mother you will cease to wonder at it.
                  "As I was going to say, then commenced my misery. I thought I had been wretched
                     before, but now I began to learn what shame was. I do not wonder that you
                     shrink from me. I tell you the truth. I expect you to despise me. But oh my
                     boy, my boy."
                  "I do not! indeed I do not!" exclaimed Charlotte. "I pity your sufferings. What
                     have you not endured?"
                  "Well, I must be brief. I told you it was a sad story. I met a man,—a gentleman
                     he seemed to be,—who was pleased with me. Ah! eleven years ago I did not look
                     so old. I have grown thin. This man was very kind to me. I—I—what shall I
                     say?—"
                  And the poor woman covered her face with her hands again. The sense of shame,
                     that a long course of folly and vice had once seared, had since her seclusion
                     revived within her, and now, when she for the first time began to recount these
                     experiences of years long past, the attempt suffused her face with burning
                     blushes, rare visitors of her pale cheeks and forehead.
                  Charlotte averted her gaze from Alfene, who was covered with confusion, and
                     listened with downcast eyes.
                  Alfene paused, shrinking from the conclusion of her narrative; in a moment,
                     however, she continued, but without uncovering her face:
                  "I—was not his wife, but I was faithful and true to him. I never did an act, I
                     never thought a thought that might dishonor him if he had been my husband, but
                     I was not his wife. I lived with him a year. I knew I was lost and dishonored
                     then. I no longer desired to find my friends. I knew they would not own me. But
                     Arent at first was kind to me. His name is Arent. I lived well, and I tried to
                     drown all my thoughts of the bitter past I remembered, or of the worse future I
                     expected. It came to be even worse than I thought.
                  "I might have known that I should be one day cast off. When he found that
                     I,—when I began to expect little
                     Benny, he turned against me. I kept it to myself as long as I could; but when
                     he found it out he,—he,—did not treat me well. I did not mind it so much
                     myself, who had no right to complain, for I was not his wife; but his child I
                     thought he would have cared for. But he did not seem to. Very soon he left me
                     to take care of myself. It was before Benny was born. I do n't know how I got
                     through it, but since then I have had nothing to do with him. God forgive me
                     for what I was before; but since then Benny's mother has been an honest woman.
                     It was that which saved me. What would have become of me if it had not been for
                     Benny I do n't know. All the good I know has come by him. Since then I've been
                     a different woman. Not for his sake alone, because I see things differently
                     now. But if it had not been for Benny I am afraid there would be no hope for
                     me."
                  "Ah! there is hope for you. There is always hope for those who will repent of
                     wrong, and turn from it in the Divine strength."
                  "Yes, for myself I do not fear. There is a Goodness I have found which can bear
                     and pardon all that even I have done. But my boy. Now you know his story. Now
                     you know what he is. Do you think you could care for him? I am afraid I can not
                     stay with him much longer. What will become of him if you do not own him?"
                  "Own him?"
                  "He will belong to you when I am gone."
                  "But, Mrs. Temple, there is one question I would like to ask you. Have you a
                     miniature of yourself?"
                  The sick woman raised herself on her elbow and looked at Charlotte.
                  "I will tell you all about it," she said. "He took it. I ought never to have
                     let him."
                  "Who took it?" asked Charlotte, wondering if the allusion could be to her
                     father.
                  "Arent took it. I gave it to him. I did not understand his purpose then. I
                     dreamed it last night."
                  "Dreamed it?"
                  "Yes. Or thought of it. I do n't know whether I was awake or asleep. I thought
                     I was asleep."
                  "When did he take it? What did he take it for?"
                  "Listen. I told you that my name was not Alfene. François used to call me so
                     sometimes because my maiden name was Alvin."
                  "Mary Alvin! yes; and your sister, Martha!"
                  "Martha Alvin was my sister, my own sister. She was your father's first wife,
                     that was lost."
                  "Ah, my father!"
                  "Ah, my poor sister! Alas! you see how I have been stripped. Benny only is
                     left."
                  "But what did Arent want with your picture?"
                  "Ah! he deceived me. I think he did. After I parted from him I learned that
                     your father, the husband of my sister that was, was living here. What should I
                     do? I knew he would not,—he could not,—have any thing to do with me, such as I
                     was,—and am. But I always hoped the time would come when he might be a friend
                     to poor Benny. Three years ago I got a room here; this room. I began to be not
                     so well as I had been. One's
                     strength fails after they have seen what I have, of life. I hoped to come in
                     some way, I knew not how, to your notice. I knew of you, though you did not of
                     me. Ah! I have watched for years for this time to come. Arent knew about my
                     history. Of course he did. I kept nothing from him. I did not know him then as
                     I do now. Some time ago he met me one day, and proposed to me to claim my
                     connection. He said a good thing might be made of it. I did not understand him.
                     But I knew he meant no good. I refused to have any thing to do with it. He
                     swore that he would do it, and that I must help him. He said that he knew best
                     what would serve me. He said he would do it in spite of me; but I did not
                     believe him. I have avoided him ever since. He did not know where we lived. I
                     have only gone out evenings and only when I must go. I did not dare to meet
                     him. He threatened Benny if I did not do as he said.
                  "But the other night, Friday night, he found me. He met me in the street. It
                     was shortly after I saw you, the last time you were here. I began to tell you
                     the whole story, and the young gentleman came in and stopped it. I began to be
                     afraid I never should have another such opportunity as the one I had lost.
                     Well, Friday night he found me in the street as Benny and I were carrying home
                     some things. He told me Mr. Harsford,—your father,—was ready to receive me, if
                     he were only assured of the truth of my story. He said if he took my miniature
                     to show him it would be enough; because I looked so much like my sister, his
                     first wife. It was an evil hour when I consented to have any thing more to do
                     with him; but I did not think he was deceiving me. I came home and got it for
                     him. He has not been near me since. It came to me last night that it was for no
                     good purpose that he wanted it. What his scheme is I do n't know. But if he
                     meant any good he would have brought it back before now."
                  Charlotte's tears, which had fallen often, as this story, grievous in itself,
                     continually led her thoughts to her own overshadowing grief, now, at its
                     conclusion, burst out afresh. Alfene evidently knew nothing of the death of her
                     father. The mystery raised by the miniature seemed not so much solved as
                     transformed into another and deeper one, the secret of the actions of this man
                     of whom she now heard for the first time. The account given by Alfene, though
                     couched in no harsh or uncharitable expressions, filled Charlotte with a terror
                     at the thought of him.
                  How much evil might not be attributed to this man.
                  "Oh, my father! my father!" she exclaimed, as these thoughts filled her mind
                     with a maze of perplexity. Her emotion, which would suffer her to say no more,
                     served to allow her to recur to her own position. Not knowing how much it was
                     wise to say she said nothing. Nothing except that which the mother most desired
                     to hear her say.
                  "Mrs. Temple, Benny shall be cared for. If I am not deceived in your account,
                     and believe me I do not doubt it, and shall not till I find reason to, neither
                     Benny nor his mother shall want a friend while I can be one."
                  
                  "God bless you! bless you! bless you!" cried the excited mother. "Ah, it is too
                     much for me! Ben—B—."
                  And she fell back upon her pillow, as Charlotte rose to go. Starting forward,
                     Charlotte took the hand of the almost insensible mother.
                  "Mrs. Temple!" she exclaimed, "speak to me! Are you faint? Benny, Benny! where
                     are you?"
                  Alfene gasped, as if for breath. Charlotte moved towards the door, but the hand
                     she held pulled her back. She saw that the dying woman wished to speak.
                     "Tell—your—father—about—the min—minia—ture,—and—do n't—let him
                     be—im—posed—on.—I was—very—very—ve—!"
                  The voice expired in a sobbing, gasping whisper.
                  But as it ceased, Charlotte saw a smile playing over the pale features. The
                     lips slowly opened once more with a pleased smile.
                  "Benny! Happy—at—last!"
                  And as these last words were whispered by the mother, Charlotte was left
                     alone.
                  Alone in the darkening room, Charlotte turned to the door and called for help.
                     It was only for a moment that she left the bed-side. She quickly returned. But
                     no longer was there any room for doubt. The frame of the poor consumptive, in
                     which, for a long time, life had fought but feebly, and with constantly waning
                     strength and retreating forces, against the approach of death, soon grew cold.
                     The touch which Charlotte attempted was so startling to her that she turned
                     again to the door and looked out, calling for Benny.
                  There was no answer.
                  As she stepped forward as if to go to the head of the stairs to call again, her
                     foot touched something soft upon the floor.
                  It was the child, who had curled himself up crouching against the door-post,
                     and there, with his deformed and shrunken limbs extended upon the floor, had
                     gone to sleep; while watching in the cold for his mother's voice to call
                     him.
                  A word roused him from his uneasy sleep, and in a few broken sentences,
                     Charlotte told him that his mother had been very sick; she was afraid would
                     never speak to him again. They called in the assistance of the poor neighbors
                     immediately, and Benny soon understood, though he received it silently, and
                     without outward complaint;—that his mother was dead.
                  It was now so late that Charlotte felt she ought not to linger any longer. She
                     had left home in secret, and she began to feel embarrassed at the thought of so
                     long an absence, at such a time, being unexplained. After some hesitation she
                     entered upon the fulfillment of her promise to the dying mother, by proposing
                     to Benny that he should go with her to her home. The child said he would rather
                     not. He could not go away now; and he kept his seat upon the little box by the
                     stove, looking around upon the strange scene with a countenance which touched
                     her heart.
                  Promising therefore that she would come again or send for him, Charlotte left
                     them, the corpse and the cripple, to the care of their poor but sympathizing
                     neighbors.
                  
                  From her home she soon sent a servant carrying a few such articles as she
                     thought might be useful, and then went up stairs to her own rooms, wondering
                     meanwhile what clue might be found in this discovery of affairs so startling,
                     and whether after all there was not some connection between Mr. Arent's evil
                     purposes and her father's death that would explain the mystery, and exculpate
                     Matthew.
               
            
            
               CHAPTER XXII.
               TOO SHARP FOR YOUR NEIGHBOR IS TOO SHARP FOR YOURSELF.
               "CHECKMATED! by Heaven!" said Mr. Arent to himself, as he read one day the
                  newspaper narratives of Mr. Harsford's death. "Checkmated, and no mistake! I
                  thought I had him, sure. He played a pretty stiff game at first, but when I came
                  the miniature over him, he 
                     knucked
                     knuckled
                   down if ever a man did. I could see it in his eye, though he said never
                  a word. Curse me if I thought he had a move left; but I believe I'm beat after
                  all."
               So soliloquized the gambler as he sat at breakfast one morning,—or rather one
                  noon, for it was usually twelve o'clock before the gambler, who habitually slept
                  late after his nocturnal dissipations, reached the restaurant at which he
                  generally breakfasted. He sat, as he thus spoke, in one of the little curtained
                  boxes of an underground eating saloon in Broadway; one of those saloons which are
                  crowded from evening till early morning with supper-parties of young men, while
                  through the day-time they are frequented only by an occasional visitor of the
                  Arent class. At the present moment, the gambler had just dispatched an overworked
                  and sleepy waiter to bring his morning
                  repast, and he sat whiling away the moments of the waiter's protracted absence in
                  the perusal of the morning papers.
               "Let me see, though," he continued, as he pursued the narrative from one paper to
                  another, gaining additional particulars from each, and promptly and skillfully
                  combining the various circumstances in various ways, in his own mind, to note
                  their bearings upon his own plans. "Let me see, though. Life Insurance! What 's
                  this? Ten thousand dollars payable to his wife! His wife, eh! Wife! That 'll give
                  me another move, I think. The point to be looked at then is,—which is the wife?
                  Rather a nice question when there happen to be two wives. Five thousand more to
                  daughter Charlotte. Five thousand more yet, payable to son James G. The two fives
                  must be delivered as per address for what I see, but hang me if I do n't get a
                  slice out of widow Harsford's ten;—a slice for the true widow, that is. Not a bad
                  chance for a magnanimous compromise there, I think. The other side have got the
                  policy to be sure, that 's in their favor, but then I represent the oldest wife;
                  that again is in mine. It 's a great thing in all these cases to be on the side of
                  the first wife. She holds the trump card. I rather think it would be the handsome
                  thing for me to call upon the present Mrs. Harsford, so supposed to be. Relieve
                  her mind. Let her know she has not lost a husband after all. Saves her the expense
                  of mourning dresses, and wear and tear of feelings, if she likes to cave in on a
                  plain statement of facts. Or if she likes better, she suggests a compromise, and
                  goes halves on the insurance and the estate. That saves me expense of law
                  proceedings, and wear and tear of conscience. Oh! yes! Decidedly I must call on
                  the good lady at the outset. That 's the move. Now the king is regularly taken off
                  the board, I must play check to the queen. And as they say the first time is the
                  best time, I think I 'll go on the strength of this identical beef-steak. It 's
                  just about the hour for a call upon the ladies."
               The identical beef-steak upon the strength of which Mr. Arent proposed to himself
                  to convey to the present Mrs. Harsford the joyful intelligence that so far from
                  having lost a husband she had in fact never had one, was now smoking hot upon the
                  table, surrounded by other viands and refreshments suited to the refined taste of
                  the gentleman for whom they were provided. He was not long in disposing of them,
                  nor much longer in making his way from the restaurant to the residence of the late
                  merchant.
               I do not know that under ordinary circumstances the gambler, although quite a
                  fashionable-looking personage in his way, could readily have gained admission to
                  the highly fashionable presence of the lady of the house.
               But the excitements of the past week had brought so many unusual callers to that
                  mansion, that all usual inquiries as to name and business of persons not
                  recognized as members of the family's acquaintance, had been perforce
                  discontinued; and accordingly, on a simple inquiry for Mrs. Harsford, the gambler
                  was ushered into the parlor, where, as it happened, Mrs. Harsford and her daughter
                  were at this time seated.
               
               "Ah! Miss Harsford, I presume," said Arent, addressing himself with his most
                  stylish bow and smile to the elder lady, and affecting not to observe the younger
                  one, as he entered. "Miss Harsford, I presume. I was in hopes to have seen
                     Mrs. Harsford."
               It was a stale trick, this pretense of mistaking the affected juvenility of the
                  mother for the blooming youth of a daughter; yet it had a certain success, for
                  Mrs. Harsford simpered and smiled as she answered,
               "I am Mrs. Harsford, sir; and this young lady whom you see is my daughter."
               "Is it possible?" exclaimed their visitor. "Can it be possible? Well, madam, I ask
                  pardon for my unintentional mistake, but really your appearance misled me."
               And he stood there, bowing to the daughter, and again to the mother, and looking
                  back and forth from one of the ladies to another, as if he could scarcely yet
                  believe that the lady he addressed could be the mother of the one he beheld; as if
                  he thought she must be under some mistake, and that she had confused her own
                  identity.
               "I have called, madam," he continued, "to express, in the first place, my very
                  sincere regret and sympathy in your affliction. I felt that I could not suffer
                  time to pass until I had testified the regard I felt for your late husband, by
                  every expression of it I had power to make to his family. Such a loss! And so
                  sudden! Ah! madam, I can not express what I felt when I heard it."
               "There was no need," thought Charlotte, as she turned to the window to hide the
                  tears which burst forth afresh at every allusion to the sorrow yet weighing so
                  heavily upon her. "There was no need to distress us afresh by such a visit from a
                  stranger."
               "You knew my husband, then?" said Mrs. Harsford in an inquiring way, and putting
                  her cambric handkerchief genteelly to her eyes.
               Mrs. Harsford still secretly luxuriated in her woe, and in the visits of
                  inquisitive condolence with which her affliction had overwhelmed her. Every new
                  visit was, in her view, a new testimony to the high estimation in which her
                  departed husband had been held, and to the importance and prominence of his social
                  position. And therefore each new visitor indirectly caused Mrs. Harsford to feel
                  afresh that she herself, as the relict of such a man, was a most important
                  personage; which was a very gratifying reflection, and one which did her a great
                  deal of good. She was pleased with the gentlemanly manner, and the genteel dress
                  and air of Mr. Arent, and was quite willing to take his own word for it that he
                  had been among the number of Mr. Harsford's friends, and to accept him, on his own
                  offer, as a witness to the public appreciation of departed worth as embodied in
                  the person of Mr. Alexander Harsford.
               "Oh! intimately madam, intimately," exclaimed the gambler, responding to her
                  question. "He was the best of my friends. I owe him a thousand favors."
               Mrs. H. again applying her handkerchief to her suffused eyes, motioned the
                  intimate friend of her deceased husband to a chair, and herself subsided into the
                  bosom of the easy chair in which she had previously been sitting.
               
               "I owe him a thousand favors, madam," he continued. "He has befriended me in many
                  ways. I had the hope, a short time before his death, of being able to render him a
                  slight service. It was my earnest wish to do something in return for my many
                  obligations from him; and I still live in the desire to be of service to his
                  family, if in my power."
               "I am sure I am much obliged to you, sir," responded the widow, "very much. If
                  there should ever be any thing. We should be most happy—Call upon you
                  freely—Kindness of our friends—Yours most unexpected—Not unwelcome—"
               As the good lady thought it genteel at this point in the conversation to allow her
                  voice to be drowned in sobs, I can not undertake to state with accuracy what it
                  was she said.
               "If I might be permitted, madam, to intrude further, I would say that there is one
                  matter in respect to which I am probably in a position to render you some trifling
                  service."
               "Oh! the bills!" exclaimed Mrs. Harsford. "Yes. Oh yes. I am sure, sir, if you
                  could aid us at all in regard to the bills, we should be most grateful. They have
                  come in heaps. Perfect heaps! And there is nothing to pay them with. Positively
                  nothing. Mr. Harsford's affairs are in a most dreadful state. Nobody can
                  understand them but himself. Oh, he had such a head for business; but they say
                  there won't be any thing left."
               "Madam, you distress me beyond measure," said the gambler.
               This was true enough. He was more distressed than he would have been willing to
                  explain at learning, what indeed he had been somewhat disposed to suspect, that
                  there would be but a small estate upon which his demands could be made.
               "Mother," interposed Charlotte, "if I might suggest, I should say we ought not to
                  trouble this gentleman, who is a stranger, with these anxieties of ours."
               She spoke in a significant tone, which, however, was much more intelligible to the
                  visitor than to her mother.
               "Oh, the gentleman will excuse it, I am sure, Arlie," replied the mother, "he was
                  a friend of your father, and he knows we must be in trouble; besides he was so
                  good as to say he would help us."
               "You only do me justice, madam," said the gambler. "I am indeed most anxious to do
                  all in my power for the welfare of the family of so cherished a friend. But the
                  circumstance I alluded to was different. There was a claim pressed upon your
                  husband's attention a short time before his death, which he thought important, and
                  in respect to which I happened to be in a position to aid him. I am sorry to say
                  that it will still be pressed perseveringly, nay, relentlessly, notwithstanding
                  his death. It will be pressed against yourself. Immediate attention is necessary.
                  It distresses me inexpressibly to bring such a matter to your notice at such a
                  time, but true kindness requires I should apprise you of the circumstances."
               Charlotte gazed at their visitor with surprise and apprehension.
               "Oh, dear, dear!" said Mrs. Harsford, "what shall I do? It was very inconsiderate of Mr. Harsford, very
                  inconsiderate, not to adjust all these things in good season. He knew he was
                  liable to be taken away, and leave nobody who understood his affairs."
               "The claim of which I speak, madam," continued Mr. Arent, "is one of a serious
                  nature, most serious in its consequences to yourself, and to your family. You are
                  aware, of course, that before Mr. Harsford had the happiness of uniting his
                  fortunes with your own, he was once married—married to a young woman of rural
                  education and habits, and, I believe, of no property."
               "Yes, sir," said Mrs. Harsford, "she died in a snowstorm. They were lost in the
                  woods, and she perished."
               "So it was supposed," said Mr. Arent, "but it has been found that she survived.
                  She lived and still lives, and has lately made claim to the position and rights of
                  Mr. Harsford's wife."
               Charlotte's surprise and apprehension deepened into astonishment and terror. Mrs.
                  Harsford's hands dropped powerless in her lap, and she gazed at Mr. Arent with a
                  puzzled expression, as if unable to comprehend the effrontery and wickedness of a
                  woman who would come to life under such circumstances, and prefer so unjust a
                  claim.
               "I had an interview with Mr. Harsford, myself, upon the subject," continued their
                  visitor, "a short time before his death. I told him that I knew the person by whom
                  the claim was made. That I sympathized strongly with him—most strongly—and fully
                  appreciated the distress and embarrassment which such a demand must occasion. I
                  told him that some circumstances had brought the whole facts within my knowledge,
                  and had also given me a very considerable influence over the claimant. That
                  influence I was most desirous to exercise for his advantage, and for yours, my
                  dear madam. I explained to him that in the hope of being of mutual service, and of
                  alleviating the distress which such a demand would occasion, if publicly pressed,
                  I had prevailed upon the claimant to intrust her whole case to me at the outset,
                  in order that I might bring it privately before Mr. Harsford, and give him an
                  opportunity to test the justice of the claim, and to refute it if possible, or if
                  not, to propose some terms of settlement if he thought best, which would not
                  involve the publication of the facts. I laid the proofs of her case before him. My
                  hope was that his acute and experienced mind would be able to detect some flaw in
                  the evidence upon which she relied, or that his recollection might supply some
                  counter proofs by which the whole might be shown to be an imposture. But this hope
                  was disappointed. Mr. Harsford, though most reluctant, of course, to entertain the
                  idea, was satisfied at length that the claim was founded in fact; and being once
                  satisfied of this, he possessed too much honor, and too high a sense of justice,
                  to desire to evade or escape a reasonable acknowledgment, and such a reparation as
                  should be consistent with your rights, my dear madam, and the welfare of yourself
                  and his children. In short, I arranged with him, at his own request, that the
                  matter should stand open a few days, as he wished to make some proposal
                  contemplating a private arrangement of
                  the difficulty. Thus matters stood at the time of his most unexpected, most
                  afflictive death. It is possible, however, that he has left some minute of his
                  wishes in respect to the case."
               The gambler added this sentence in an inquiring tone, as if he would ask the
                  question that his words suggested. He looked at the ladies for a reply, but they
                  sat silent, too much surprised and grieved, it would seem, to speak.
               "If he has not," continued the gambler, "it will rest with you, of course, to
                  treat the claim as you think best. There is one consideration, however, which is
                  new, and which relieves the difficulty of some of its most serious and perplexing
                  points. The first Mrs. Harsford has no longer any thing to gain in respect to
                  social position or future situation in life by pressing this claim publicly.
                  Before this she had a strong temptation before her in these respects, but now the
                  utmost substantial benefit she can realize by the most pertinacious course of
                  proceeding would be the recovery of a portion of Mr. Harsford's estate; of the
                  provision he may have made, say by life insurance or otherwise, for his family. I
                  can not encourage you to hope that you could ultimately succeed in resisting her
                  right. But it would be in your power to put her to great delay and expense in
                  establishing her right. This being the case, it will be easy for you,—the claim
                  being now reduced, as I have already said, to a mere pecuniary one,—to effect a
                  compromise, if you should be disposed to propose one. Of course it is not for me
                  to suggest any thing of this sort. I do not even know accurately what sum the
                  claimant would be entitled titled to receive upon an absolute proof of her right;
                  still less can I suggest what it would be wise or right for you to offer her. If I
                  were honored with your full confidence in respect to the situation of Mr.
                  Harsford's affairs, I might perhaps advise you, but not at present. But if I might
                  suggest, there are many reasons why so delicate and important an affair should not
                  be intrusted to the knowledge of many friends, if it is to be arranged by private
                  settlement. The circumstances are now known only to me, to you ladies, and to the
                  claimant herself. Need they go further? Can you not confide in me as a faithful
                  and disinterested friend of both parties? I can assure you of my most earnest
                  desire to protect your rights and secure your welfare. With this distressing and
                  most extraordinary claim I can not sympathize. I have indeed only acted in it in
                  the hope that by so doing, I might, to some extent, protect the interests of
                  cherished friends."
               And the benevolent and disinterested gentleman paused again, looking to Mrs.
                  Harsford for some expression of her sentiments.
               "Oh, dear! dear!" began that good lady, wringing her hands in a querulous and
                  irresolute distress. "Oh dear! dear! dear! This is what comes of marrying a
                  widower. I always said I should come to trouble if I married a widower, even if he
                  had no family. Charlotte, my love—"
               But Charlotte, upon whose mind some gleams of light were now shining, bringing the
                  truth out of these mysteries, so long dark and incomprehensible, interposed before
                  her mother could complete the sentence.
               
               "Mother," said she, rising to leave the room, "do not speak of this yet. Wait a
                  moment. I think father left something which may explain this. Wait a moment till I
                  return, and do not express any opinion while I am gone."
               She stepped hastily into the hall.
               Silence prevailed for a moment. Mrs. Harsford sat mentally bewailing her anxieties
                  and troubles, recalling the brilliant matches which she might have made, if she
                  had not been entrapped by Mr. Harsford, and if divers other gentlemen of her
                  youthful acquaintance had only offered themselves for her acceptance. The gambler
                  at length spoke.
               "If I might be so free as to say it," he commenced, "your daughter, although a
                  very lovely young lady, seems too inexperienced to—"
               But at this moment the door opened, and Charlotte, who had bounded quickly up the
                  stairs and back, returned.
               "You will excuse my asking one or two questions, sir, but I wish first to identify
                  this claim with one which I think my father had in mind before he died. If we are
                  quite assured that it is the same, I think my mother will be prepared to arrange
                  it promptly. You spoke of proofs which you submitted to my father. Was a miniature
                  of the lady among those proofs?"
               "Yes, Miss," replied Arent, "it was undoubtedly one of the strongest links, as
                  your father recognized it at once."
               "Is this it?" she asked, taking from her pocket the faded morocco case which she
                  had found in her father's study, and holding it for his inspection, yet holding it
                  so that he could not without impoliteness repossess himself of it.
               "Yes," said the gambler, at once, "it is."
               "And your name then is,—I suppose,—Mr. Arent?"
               "Yes," said the man, "I am glad your father made some mention of the matter, as it
                  is so much more agreeable to know his wishes."
               "That is quite sufficient sir," said Charlotte, returning the miniature to her
                  pocket. "I knew the original of that portrait quite well. Mrs. Temple, quite a
                  near neighbor of ours. She was the first Mrs. Harsford's sister. She is dead, now,
                  however. She died a few days after my father. But little Benjamin is well,—should
                  you like to see him?"
               "The devil!" ejaculated Arent.
               And he was glad enough, between the quiet contempt of the daughter, and the
                  irresolute agitation of the mother, to slip out, and make good his departure.
               "My poor father!" said Charlotte to herself, "if he was persecuted by that man,
                  there was more excuse for him than I thought."
               As there will be no further occasion to mention Mr. Arent in the course of this
                  narrative, it will be as well to take leave of him at this point. Some pretty
                  vigorous proceedings being quietly set on foot by the friends of Mrs. Harsford, to
                  bring him to detection and punishment, he thought it prudent to leave the city for
                  a time. He spent an interval of some
                  years in a series of trips upon the Mississippi river, where he learned some new
                  modes of doing business, and acquired and lost large sums of money. He at length
                  settled down in New Orleans, as I have recently been informed, where he still
                  flourishes, and where any stranger visiting the city may easily enjoy his
                  hospitable attentions.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               A PRISONER'S GUESTS ARE WELCOME.
               MATTHEW in prison found his only solace in Roselle's companionship. She soon
                  became a favorite among the custodians of the place, who assisted her to find a
                  comfortable, though humble lodging near by, and allowed her to visit her brother
                  freely from day to day. Matthew was closely confined, and was not allowed some
                  privileges accorded to those who were imprisoned for petty crimes; but his blind
                  sister's presence alleviated the austerity of his imprisonment, and created a
                  certain sympathy and interest in his behalf in the breasts of all who saw her
                  feeling her way back and forth to his cell. As for her thoughts respecting the
                  difficulties in which her brother was involved, she did not know the whole truth
                  nor care to inquire about it. She thought she could do no good in that way. Her
                  brother had told her he was innocent, and that they never could prove him guilty,
                  and this was enough for her. She devoted herself to making as cheerful for him as
                  possible the long, dull days which passed while he was waiting for his trial. She
                  brought in little luncheons for him to eat, and newspapers for him to read—things
                  which without the magic of her presence
                  he would never have enjoyed there. At first from grateful affection for her, and
                  to cheer her up, he began to rouse himself by strong effort from his depression
                  and anxiety, and he pretended to enter into her efforts with pleasure. From this
                  it was not long before her kind cares and attentions occupied his mind and drove
                  away from time to time the anxieties which filled it. The songs which she sang to
                  him in a low sweet tone, as they sat together in the cell, charmed away many
                  hours. Matthew's generous nature did not long permit him to be merely the
                  recipient of her kindness, and at last obtaining one of the books in raised
                  letters, such as the blind decipher with their fingers, he beguiled many of the
                  days of his confinement, in teaching her the new art of reading.
               Marie Montecabella too, was a pleasant visitor to Matthew's cell. She had the idea
                  at first that Matthew was a very terrible fellow, and brave as she was, she did
                  not at first care to go too near him, but finding Roselle there, so familiarly at
                  home, she at first ventured in a little way at the door, and stood studying the
                  prisoner's countenance while she talked with the blind girl; and at length she
                  came to feel quite acquainted with Matthew himself. She had been liberally paid by
                  Matthew for her kindness to Roselle on that afternoon of their first meeting on
                  the pier, and the two girls soon became warm friends. Little Marie came every
                  morning to Roselle's lodging to lead her upon her usual walk to the prison, and to
                  aid her in any errands she wished to do.
               Roselle once or twice urged Matthew to send for some lawyer, who might make a
                  defense for him. He explained to her that he did not know any one upon whom he
                  could rely; he told her the stories he had heard of the professional gentlemen who
                  frequent the prisons, and into whose hands he was sure, he thought, to fall if he
                  invited legal counsel.
               "Besides," said he to his sister, "it is all true enough in the main,—the facts
                  they state. Only I did not know there was any poison in the cigars. I shall be
                  acquitted for want of sufficient evidence, but everybody will believe me guilty, I
                  suppose, and we shall want what little money I have got left, to take care of
                  ourselves with, Roselle."
               Roselle was not very well satisfied as to the prudence of this conclusion, but it
                  was her brother's will.
               Before he had been many days in prison, Matthew received a visit from Widow
                  Hopley. She had come indeed when she first heard of his imprisonment, but had
                  arrived at an hour when visitors were not admitted, and the troubles she had
                  meanwhile been contending with, and which had ended in her being entirely
                  dispossessed of her home, and turned quite adrift upon the world, were a
                  sufficient explanation of her apparent neglect in delaying for some days to return
                  again. This poor widow, now homeless, who came to pity the prisoner, began,
                  singularly enough, to congratulate him almost, in her secret thoughts, upon his
                  cell; and to think that she could make herself quite comfortable, if she only had
                  a room like that, rent free. True, it was small, but then a small room was better
                  than none, and though the walls were
                  stone, they were so brightly white-washed that they looked cheerful. The window
                  indeed was very small, and queerly shaped too,—a mere slit in the thick wall,—but
                  then nobody could look in at it, which was an advantage. The location of the room
                  was not very agreeable, but then when the stout door was shut, that would no
                  longer be a drawback.
               Still, if the authorities had offered her the corresponding room adjoining, on the
                  usual terms, and board gratis, besides, I doubt whether she would have accepted
                  it, especially if the fact would have been likely to be put in the newspapers.
               Time as it passed did not brighten Matthew's hopes. His solitary and inactive life
                  wrought upon him the commencement of those dreaded effects which such a sudden
                  confinement always has for active and vigorous natures. He sickened and pined. The
                  ailing of his cramped and unexercised frame cast a gloomy shadow over his mind,
                  and discolored all his thoughts, and as the days passed away his energy and
                  hopefulness gradually died within him. Roselle observed with pain the progress of
                  this change, but Matthew rejected plans which she suggested for his assistance,
                  and indeed, in his depression, came almost to reject her sisterly sympathy. Day by
                  day he came more and more to realize the event which at first seemed to him merely
                  the shadow of some terrible dream. He tried to assume a cheerful air, for Roselle,
                  but in truth his heart sickened at the Present, and shrank from the more dreadful
                  Future. The time appointed for his trial, however, approached rapidly. Justice in
                  New York, though traditionally blindfolded, had not commenced that game of
                  Blindman's Buff which of late she has been playing to the great amusement of the
                  adroit culprits and the alarm of all honest men. Matthew began to see her sword
                  suspended over him, and he trembled.
               It was in this frame of mind that he received a visit from a person he had not
                  expected to see,—Arabella Mayes.
               Arabella had to her own surprise and terror found herself an important actress in
                  a drama she could neither understand nor evade.
               It was not until after she had frankly explained to the officers of justice, her
                  recognition of the person who brought the box to the door, that she learned what
                  its fatal contents were, and how terribly her ready identification bore upon
                  Matthew Caraby's fate. When she reflected that her testimony in identifying him as
                  the bearer of the box was an indispensable and chief link in the chain of evidence
                  by which the guilt was to be fastened upon him, she was filled with an
                  indescribable pain. In her grief she reproached herself with a thousand things.
                  Her visit at Mr. Harsford's; her carelessness in suffering Matthew to depart
                  without an explanation; her turning back with the accursed box, instead of
                  hastening at once after him; her admission of the fact that it was he, before she
                  knew what the consequences of such an admission would be; and deeper in her heart,
                  and more sore than all these, lay the recollection of that first wretched quarrel
                  which her pride had caused, and had not
                  even yet suffered her to explain to him.
               But the thought of the Past was not so poisoned with reproaches as that of the
                  Future was with fears. Constantly there came before her mind the picture of
                  Matthew arraigned, and guarded in the narrow box which her imagination depicted as
                  his place in court, while she herself stood in the witness box, confronted with
                  him, and was compelled to complete the proofs of his guilt;—proofs which would be
                  imperfect without the links she must supply, but after she should speak, would be
                  clear and complete. This scene she thought she could never endure. She knew it
                  would be useless to refuse to speak, she could not now conceal what she had
                  already disclosed. The oppression which she felt in imagining this scene brought
                  indeed a gleam of momentary relief in the half recognized thought that her powers
                  would not sustain her to utter one word against him.
               "They may bring me into court, they may put me on the stand," she said to herself,
                  "but when I see him there, I shall have no breath to speak."
               But after all there was no comfort in this alternative, and the conviction which
                  forced itself more and more upon her mind as the day of trial approached, that she
                  was after all the one who would be irresistibly compelled to supply the key-stone
                  in the arch of proof on which his condemnation would rest, was a haunting fact
                  that no effort could expel from her mind.
               From time to time also, her heart overleaped the ominous events of the past few
                  weeks, and went back again to the pleasant scenes of their attachment; its
                  beginning; its growth; its strange, yet delightful solicitudes; its tedious
                  separations and joyful meetings. The happy life that the lovers had just begun,
                  rose before her imagination in painful contrast with the unfortunate offense she
                  had given, and the fatal consequences which had ensued. And now she, who a month
                  ago would not concede to his reasonable demand a word of explanation, would be
                  ready to die for him she thought, if that would only retrieve the error of her
                  foolish pride. Yet the hour was steadily approaching when her own lips must
                  perhaps seal his doom. As to his guilt, she could not suffer herself to raise that
                  question. He was impetuous, she knew; but revengeful, never. It was not for her to
                  doubt his innocence,—not for her, but for whom he would still have been happy at
                  home, but for whom he would never have been compromised in the mystery of the
                  merchant's death. She did not for a moment entertain the belief, which
                  nevertheless her own testimony must establish in the minds of every one else.
               Harassed with these thoughts, Arabella, who saw no escape for herself or for
                  Matthew, awaited the result. As the time approached, she sank into a despondency
                  almost as deep as Matthew's despair.
               It was but a short time before the dreaded day, when a new thought of hope entered
                  Arabella's mind. She saw, or thought she saw, a possibility of safety for Matthew.
                  If she could but be privileged to close her own lips, the peril might be
                  averted.
               There was a trying perplexity in respect to the expedient dient that presented itself to her. It required
                  from her a step from which she shrank. Under no lighter compulsion would she have
                  dared it. But at length goaded by the thoughts I have endeavored to portray, she,
                  without consulting any one, prepared to visit Matthew in prison. This indeed was
                  no easy matter. But her resolution was taken; and when she had dared to purpose
                  it, she no longer hesitated in its execution.
               This was the visit which Matthew, now downcast and despairing, was destined
                  unexpectedly to receive.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               IT IS HARD TO READ MEN'S MOTIVES IN THEIR CONDUCT.
               I PERFECTLY agree with the reader in the suggestion that this was a rash thing to
                  attempt; a thing that ought in general to be impracticable—an interview between
                  the witness and the prisoner. The scheme was in its very nature one which Arabella
                  did not dare to confide to any one. She knew that any friend would dissuade her
                  from executing it; perhaps prevent her by interposing obstacles. She therefore
                  undertook it alone. Having previously studied well the locality of the prison, she
                  penetrated one morning that dismal region of the city, so scarred by poverty and
                  crime, and safely reached the prison door. She did not know by what pass-word or
                  permission she could hope to succeed in gaining admission to Matthew; that was a
                  point on which she had no means of gaining information beforehand. Fortunately,
                  however,—perhaps it was essential to the success of her expedition,—she met upon
                  the threshold Roselle, who, with her little guide, was about starting upon one of
                  her usual morning walks. Making herself known to the surprised blind girl, whom
                  she had several times met at Enneton
                  and Harsford's Mills, she begged that she would lead her to Matthew with as little
                  delay as possible, and without disclosing her name. Roselle readily complied.
               As the heavy door was shut and locked behind her, after she passed into the
                  court-yard, Arabella felt more keenly than ever the venture that she was taking.
                  It was a bold step to take, this visit, in itself; but when she considered the
                  interview which she contemplated, and thought of the errand which had brought her,
                  all the risks of the adventure sank into insignificance compared with what it
                  would cost her to try this last resource. She had not however now put her foot
                  forward to take it back again. She passed on after Roselle, who, in turn, clung to
                  Marie, and in a moment or two reached the door of the cell. Thanks to Roselle's
                  well-known face, they were at last suffered to enter without such scrutiny as
                  should lead to suspicion.
               As Arabella stepped over the sill of the door and lifted her vail, Roselle and
                  Marie turned again and departed on the errand in which they had been interrupted;
                  while at the same instant Matthew rose, and, struck with surprise, stood gazing at
                  his visitor. By an instinctive prudence neither uttered the other's name; but one
                  who had watched the quivering lip of the prisoner, or the coursing tears which
                  fell fast from his visitor's eyes, would have discerned that silence did not
                  bespeak indifference, but rather the most keen and conflicting feelings wrought to
                  the highest degree of excitement.
               "Ah! I did not expect this," said Matthew.
               These words, which were merely an expression of the surprise which, in his apathy
                  he felt but slightly, at seeing her, she understood as a half reproach.
               "Indeed it is very kind of you," he added, perceiving from her countenance her
                  disappointment. "It is more than I could have expected or hoped."
               "I have wanted to see you Matthew, oh! very much," replied Arabella, taking the
                  rude chair which Matthew placed for her. "Since our last meeting—"
               Matthew was silent.
               —"I have been very unhappy."
               "It is not for you to lament now, Arabella," returned Matthew, with a somber
                  smile. "It is better as it is after all, is it not?"
               At this commencement, so unpropitious, for it showed how far Matthew's thoughts
                  were from being prepared for that in which she had hoped he might even anticipate
                  her, Arabella in turn became silent.
               Matthew, who could not penetrate the object of this visit, which must have cost
                  her so much effort, and in which she could scarcely have been sure of a cordial
                  and grateful welcome, was made even more distrustful by her silence.
               "I confess I think it might be a great deal better than it is," she said, at
                  length, "if we could only have the time before us again. I want to say, Matthew,
                  how sorry I am for what I said and for what I did that night. Ah! do not excuse
                  me. I can not excuse myself for what I said, and still more for what I did not
                  say. I was not so utterly hard as I seemed. It was on my very lips to speak, but I
                  had been wrong, and I was too proud to
                  own it. I was very unhappy then, and I have been ever since. More unhappy than I
                  can tell, since I have seen what has followed."
               "I thank you, Arabella," said Matthew, "for this proof of the goodness of your
                  heart. Do not weep. You have come notwithstanding my trouble and disgrace to bring
                  an apology that I did not look for. I assure you I appreciate your kindness. I
                  forget every thing that you could wish to retract. Perhaps I was unreasonably
                  wounded. Now I will forget all. Your words are a thousand times grateful to me.
                  They come from you, free and happy, to me, imprisoned and disgraced. I shall
                  treasure them."
               "Free and happy!" interposed Arabella; "I should be more happy if I were not so
                  free. I hope you will forgive me. And trust me. Oh! if you could only trust
                  me."
               As the two sat together side by side, yet facing each other, there was strikingly
                  evident a great change which a few weeks had wrought in them. What a contrast
                  between this scene in the cell and that in which they had participated upon the
                  piazza.
               "Oh, if you could only trust me."
               There was an imploring look in Arabella's face, which Matthew did not
                  understand.
               "I forgive you from my heart. Though indeed I have no longer any thing to forgive.
                  I did not consider that I parted with you to carry away any hard feeling. It was
                  an equal consent."
               "I never will suffer my pride to rule me so again. Never. Can you believe me? Can
                  you trust me?"
               Matthew receiving again that beseeching look, did not know what to say. He did not
                  yet understand that Arabella wished not merely to confess the error but to retrace
                  it.
               "Trust you?"
               "Ah! I have been so unhappy since then. I wish it never had happened."
               "I thank you again Arabella for your kindness so unexpected, in saying this. It is
                  not that you retract an unkindness. You show me that I mistook you, that you were
                  not unkind, as I thought you were. Rest assured that all will be forgotten.
                  Whatever may be the result of my troubles, I thank you. It is all the more kind of
                  you since my fate is so uncertain, and since you yourself are involved in these
                  circumstances which go against me."
               "Matthew! Matthew! These terrible stories! This dream!—This charge!—I do not
                  listen to it. I do not think of it."
               "I thank you Arabella, indeed I do, with my whole heart. It makes me happier that
                  there are those whom I may still call my friends; and that they still have faith
                  in me. And you especially, who—will—"
               "I know what you would say," exclaimed Arabella. "Matthew, I would rather die than
                  utter one word there."
               "Do not be distressed. I can save you that pain," said Matthew.
               Arabella looked up in surprise.
               "I will admit it. When they call you I will ask them what they want to prove, and
                  I will admit it."
               
               "But Matthew, what will become of you if you admit it? You must not. You must not.
                  Never! Never!"
               "There is no other way. It is certain to be proved."
               "Ah! if we could only avoid that."
               "I thank you with my whole heart, Arabella, for your consideration; but I have
                  thought it all over, and there is no help for it. It is the truth. There 's no
                  helping the truth. Roselle says I'm desperate about it. If that 's being
                  desperate, I am. When they come to that part of it I shall admit that. Then they
                  will not make you testify."
               "That will never do. Besides, perhaps there is a better way."
               "A better way? What do you mean?"
               "Will you answer me one question, Matthew?" said the girl, finding that the whole
                  heavy burden of her plan was thrown upon herself alone; yet shrinking from it.
               "He will not understand me," she said to herself, "because he is in trouble and
                  disgrace, and he thinks he ought not to claim me again until he is clear."
               "What is the question?" asked Matthew.
               "If I had come to you before this—trouble—had happened—and said what I have said
                  now, and asked that—it might be forgotten, what—would you have said to me—then,
                  when you were free?"
               "Just what I have said," replied Matthew, "except that I could not have thanked
                  you so earnestly and heartily as I do now. I should not have seen so much of the
                  goodness and nobility of your heart."
               "Matthew," she said, after a pause, "I have come to ask something more than
                  forgiveness. Something more."
               "More? Something more? Any thing I can do or say? Ask; my dear Arabella."
               "When you came away, I offended you, and besides that we separated. I want
                  forgiveness for the offense; and I want—I want—to be no longer separated."
               This sentence, begun in embarrassment and completed in confusion, was uttered with
                  so much resolution and yet timidity, that Matthew knew not how to reply to it. Its
                  utterance was earnestness itself, and in her suspense at Matthew's silence, the
                  poor girl, thinking she had gone too far, turned away the face that was covered
                  with a burning blush.
               These words for the first time revealed to Matthew, though as yet only
                  imperfectly, Arabella's purpose in coming. They took him wholly by surprise.
               I suppose that ten years passed in the ordinary experiences of life would not have
                  taught Matthew so much of the generosity and fidelity of which human nature, in
                  its better phases, is capable; would not have tended so strongly to give him a
                  renewed faith and trust in woman, as did these few timid, blushing, beseeching
                  words from Arabella.
               He was at this moment in the best of all moods to learn such a lesson, not merely
                  because he was somewhat broken in spirit by his confinement; this would have been
                  as likely to make him despairing as any thing else; but he had reason now to be
                  distrustful of himself. He had come to
                  the city with the best intentions. He had made the most honest and earnest
                  efforts. He had done his utmost to attain a useful and honorable success, by
                  perfect fidelity to every duty, and by diligent labor for the prosperity and
                  welfare of those with whom he was connected. Yet how had he failed. It was not
                  merely that he was thrown into prison on an unjust charge—that he could have borne
                  easily enough; but the thought that mortified his confidence in his old views of
                  life was this, that the very endeavors he had made to attain unusual fidelity and
                  unusual usefulness had been the attempts which had rebounded most fatally upon the
                  welfare of those he sought to benefit.
               A man who thought only of his own interests, and this was all that Matthew
                  supposed most men considered, would have been satisfied if he could withdraw his
                  own little deposit from the Iroquois Bank; and would have then left it to fall
                  about the ears of its proprietors and creditors without further anxiety or
                  concern. Matthew, through a genuine though perhaps an erroneous impulse of
                  generosity, had desired to save some one beside himself, but circumstances had so
                  directed this intention that the final result of his attempt had been to overwhelm
                  Mrs. Hopley in ruin. A careless and indifferent brother would have hoarded or
                  squandered his earnings, and suffered his sister to remain in her rural home. But
                  Matthew, making his sister's welfare, and his hope of a benefit to her sight, his
                  first consideration, had enticed Roselle to the city, only to meet embarrassments
                  and difficulties, cares and anxieties of the most dangerous and serious
                  description. A clerk who should quarrel with his employer, and vacate his
                  situation in the morning, would ordinarily, Matthew supposed, do as little work as
                  might be for the rest of the day. Matthew had striven to exhibit an increased
                  fidelity to his work, till the last moment of the day expired, and the scenes of
                  the last hours of his employment had only served to involve him in the terrible
                  fate of a criminal. He began to see, therefore, that he could not in all cases
                  safely judge motives by the results of conduct. Arabella, whom in the excitement
                  of their misunderstanding he had thought to be a fickle-hearted, selfish girl,
                  faithless to every consideration but her own advancement, who had accepted his
                  attentions because his was the most eligible offer she could expect in the circle
                  of her acquaintance, and who had been ready to break faith with him on flimsy
                  pretexts, at the moment she saw a possibility of securing a lover of greater
                  wealth and higher position;—how could he assume to be sure that his judgment of
                  her was just? How could he know after all but that her affection for him was pure
                  and true, her purpose kind and faithful, and her regret over the misfortune of
                  their separation as sincere as his sorrow for the evils he had unintentionally
                  caused? How did he know but that she had been trying, through all that dialogue
                  upon the piazza, in some mistaken way to evince her regard for him as sincerely as
                  he had been endeavoring during the last few weeks to protect the welfare of Mrs.
                  Hopley, secure the comfort of his sister, and advance the prosperity of Mr.
                  Harsford?
               
               These were the thoughts which were predominant in Matthew's mind just at that
                  moment when the vailed figure stepped into his cell, and dropping her vail,
                  disclosed the dearly loved features of Arabella. I did not tell the reader this at
                  the time, because I was afraid that Arabella might overhear me; and I saw that
                  Matthew was not then willing that she should understand his feelings. But now that
                  he is ready to speak freely to her himself, there can be no harm, I suppose, in
                  letting the reader know.
               "Arabella!" said Matthew.
               She raised her eyes confidingly to his. He passed his arm around her waist, drew
                  her form closely to his side, her lips to his—Well, if that sentinel turnkey, who
                  every now and then paced loungingly through the long gallery, noting that all was
                  right in the various cells, had happened to look through the grated door behind
                  them at that moment, he would have seen what would have surprised him, I rather
                  think.
               But Matthew was very well aware that he was a discreet man, who knew that it was
                  not always the prisoners who paid him best for the little favors and
                  accommodations he procured them, who needed the most watching. As for Arabella, do
                  you suppose she had come all the way from Brooklyn to the Tombs, to think about
                  turnkeys?
               "Arabella!" Matthew said again. "My dearest Arabella, you are a hundred times
                  kinder to me than I deserve. I never can forget,—never,—your generosity. I was
                  wrong. Much more so than you were, for I adhered hered to it more pertinaciously.
                  I misunderstood you, and misjudged you. I thought you were willing to break faith
                  with me because you were pleased with the attentions of your new acquaintance, and
                  thought him seriously desirous of winning your regards, and that you preferred him
                  to me."
               "Matthew! Matthew! it was never so. Not one moment."
               "I know it now, my dear Arabella. I understand it now. But that was where I
                  misjudged you. I was to blame. Do you forgive me, my darling?"
               "It is not for you to ask that of me, Matthew;" answered the girl; "of me, who was
                  first in fault. If I had met you as I ought and given you the explanation you
                  asked, and which you had a right to ask, you never would have thought so."
               "I was unkind in more than that, Arabella! I ought never to have spoken of it to
                  young Glovering. I never should have done it if I had not been angry."
               "I know that, Matthew. You never would have done it if I had not provoked you; so
                  that I think nothing of it."
               "Then you let me take all that I said back again, do you, Matthew?" continued
                  Arabella, after a moment's pause, "and give me back the dear promise I
                  rejected?"
               "Oh! Arabella!" replied Matthew, "how can I do that? I confess my unkindness and
                  injustice. I freely forgive and forget all that seemed unkind in you. I assure you
                  of my renewed and continued affection; affection tion far stronger than ever before, because I have
                  now so much more reason to admire, to trust, to love you than I had before. I
                  rejoice more than I can express, to know that notwithstanding all that has
                  befallen me, you love and trust me still. But how can I say more? How can I permit
                  you now to reëxchange with me those promises which once passed between us?
                  Now,—while I lie under this accusation? Ah! Arabella, you are far too dear to me
                  for me to think of involving you in my disgrace."
               "But you will come free of it yet, Matthew. It will all pass away."
               "It will then be time enough to speak more of this. Now I ought not to say more
                  than that I love you with all my heart; and rejoice to believe that you still love
                  and trust me. If I come through this trouble so that I have left an honest name
                  and a place among my fellowmen, I shall know to whom to come, whom to ask for the
                  blessing of a love which I do n't deserve, but do know how to prize and to return.
                  If my misfortunes are irretrievable I shall cherish the remembrance of your
                  kindness and generosity to the latest day of the few months they will allow me. I
                  shall know that you will believe me innocent whatever others may think. But until
                  I can come free of this charge, you must be free of any pledge or promise made to
                  me. Do not seek to change this resolve. It is what I ought to say,
                  indeed, Arabella. Nothing but that thought could induce me to say it. For
                     I—love you."
               Arabella hesitated. She had yet a more generous, a more loving thought in her
                  heart than she had uttered; more than she could easily bring herself to utter.
               Matthew saw the working of her thoughts partially reflected in her countenance. He
                  could only reply to her look by saying:
               "Ah! Arabella, this is not the time to say more."
               "Why not?"
               "It is useless. There is nothing to do. This is not the time. There is little
                  hope, for me, but disgrace. Do you think I can consent to draw you—you whom I
                  love; you who have been so generous and self-sacrificing towards me—within the
                  shadow of it?"
               "Ah! but there is every thing to do. This is just the time. Of all times this is
                  the one."
               "Generous girl!" said Matthew to himself.
               "This is the time," she repeated, seeing his hesitation. "The very time. Next week
                  may be too late."
               "But think! Wait till you see."
               "Matthew! I wait for nothing. I care nothing for the result. I am ready. Why put
                  it off when this is of all times the very one?"
               "How? Explain yourself."
               "Ah! can you not understand me? Ah! how shall I explain what I would? Matthew I am
                  going to tell you a secret. Forgive me, and forget it if it does not please you.
                  Shall it be sacred?"
               "It shall be sacred."
               She saw in his eyes the same pledge that his words gave. She knew she might trust
                  it to the utmost.
               "I wish to say that I—"
               She turned her throbbing head back, and leaned her forehead upon his shoulder; it
                  was but a touch of the forehead, timid
                  yet trustful, just enough to avert her face from his sight, to bring her voice
                  nearer to his ear, and to show her confidence in him.
               "Ah, Arabella," he said, "do not fear me."
               "There was a man once in Enneton," said Arabella, "who shot another. It was a long
                  time ago. They would have punished him if they could, but they could do nothing to
                  him because—"
               "Because what?"
               "Because his wife was the only witness of their meeting. She saw it; but nobody
                  else could prove it. They do not allow a wife to testify against her husband."
               Matthew looked down in amazement at the head which was bowed upon his arm. Now for
                  the first time he understood his companion's thought, and appreciated the
                  self-sacrificing generosity of her affection.
               "And you Arabella," he said, after a pause, "you would—"
               "Yes I would," she interposed, without waiting for him to finish the inquiry which
                  he hesitated about completing. "Yes I would," and she looked up timidly into his
                  face.
               That timid look was a rare thing with her, usually so brilliant, quick, confident,
                  and flashing with her proud eyes.
               "Yes," she continued, "I have thought that if I were your wife after all;—and soon
                  enough,"—and she dropped her head again to its resting place, "I should not have
                  to testify, and you would no longer be in danger."
               I suppose there never was a man in a happier embarrassment rassment than was this
                  young prisoner, as he sat with the fair witness for the prosecution leaning her
                  head lightly on his shoulder.
               He was silent for some time. Arabella knew that he was not accustomed to change
                  his expressed purposes and opinions except very deliberately. So long as he
                  remained in thought, therefore, she sat in hope.
               "My dearest Arabella," he said, "it is impossible for me to express how much your
                  generosity affects me; how much you have endeared yourself to me by what you have
                  said. But I ought never to think of such a thing. Supposing they acquitted me.
                  They would believe me guilty, and would believe you were my accomplice. We must
                  wait and hope. We must trust each other, and trust in God. If—"
               "If what, Matthew?" Arabella asked, as she raised her head and sat upright.
               "If they only get at the whole truth—"
               "And if—"
               "If they do not? Ah, we need not talk about that now. It is too soon yet."
               Arabella felt that this decision was final, because she felt that it was right.
                  She rose to go. Her eyes were filled with tears, yet she smiled resolutely through
                  them, as she received and returned the affectionate embrace and kiss with which
                  Matthew bade her "good-bye," and passed out into the little gallery before the
                  door; and Matthew saw her no more.
               Matthew, his heart swelling with many conflicting emotions, threw himself upon his narrow couch.
                  Never before had life and liberty seemed so precious; never yet had they seemed so
                  distant and unattainable. Now that this last expedient, so singular, so bold,
                  brought to him with so much perseverance and affectionate courage, was rejected,
                  he felt more than ever the peril in which he stood.
               But there was a scheme of which he as yet had not thought, which was destined to
                  present itself to his mind with some prospect of deliverance.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               THEY WILL HELP YOU BEST, WHO AT THE SAME TIME HELP
                  THEMSELVES.
               ABOUT a week before the trial Roselle came into Matthew's cell one morning as
                  usual with the newspaper for him to read.
               From this paper he learned, for the first time, that Mr. Harsford had insured his
                  life largely just before his death, for the benefit of the members of his family.
                  It had not been one single insurance, but several, and it now transpired that the
                  applications for insurance had been made by Mr. Harsford during the week or two
                  immediately previous to his death.
               "Ah!" said Matthew to himself, "that is what I did not know before; that makes a
                  difference. I did think the cigars were poisoned before they came to the office,
                  and that I carried them there without knowing it, but I see now how it may have
                  been. Now if I manage right I can get the insurance companies to defend me. It
                  will be worth their while to look into the matter thoroughly at all events.
               "Roselle!"
               This was an exclamation addressed to his sister, who now sat upon the lower corner of his cot intently
                  engaged in spelling with her fingers some of the simple words in her
                  spelling-book.
               "What, brother?" she replied, turning her face toward him, as if she could indeed
                  see him.
               "Are you tired?"
               "No, brother; not if there is any thing more I can do for you."
               "When is Marie coming back?" inquired Matthew.
               "Right away. She has only gone round to the fruit store. Is there any thing you
                  want us to do?"
               "I should like to have you go away down town, of an errand for me. I could send
                  Marie alone, I suppose, but you could do the errand better if you would go with
                  her."
               "Well," said Roselle, "we will go the very moment Marie comes back. Ah! here she
                  is."
               For just at the instant when Roselle spoke Marie appeared in the passage outside
                  the door.
               "Yes, here I am," she said, speaking through the iron grating which was often
                  swung to in front of the doorway of the cell, when the thick plank door was
                  required to be left open for a time; "what do you want of me?"
               "We're going of an errand, Marie," said Roselle, "an errand away down town. Are
                  you ready?"
               "Yes," said Marie, "I should like to go. Where is it?"
               "It is rather a hard errand, I am afraid," said Matthew. "Do you know where Wall
                  street is?"
               "Oh, yes," said Marie, "I go there very often with my basket, to sell things in
                  the offices."
               "Do you know about the offices?" said Matthew.
               "No," said Marie. "There's a great many of them, banks and things, but I do n't
                  know much about 'em."
               "Do you know any insurance offices?" asked Matthew.
               "I know there are a good many," said Marie, "but I do n't know much about
                  'em."
               "Then I suppose you do n't know where the office of the Muniment Insurance Company
                  is. Stop, let me see if I have got the name right," and he looked at the
                  newspaper.
               "No," said he, "Monument—Monument Insurance Company, that is it. I suppose you do
                  n't know where that office is; do you, Marie?"
               "No," said she, "I do n't know any thing about it."
               "Do you know what the Directory is," said Matthew, "and how to look out names in
                  it?"
               "Yes," said Marie, "when I can spell them. I think names are pretty hard to
                  spell."
               "Well, the first thing," said Matthew, "for you to do, is to go down Center street
                  till you come to a store where there is a Directory. Look out the name of the
                  Monument Life Insurance Company. I will write down the name for you. No, stop! I
                  will give you the paragraph from the newspaper, you can read it better in
                  print."
               So saying, Matthew creased and tore out a little slip in the paper which Roselle
                  had brought him, and handed it to Marie.
               "That is the name," said he, pointing to the words in the little paragraph which
                  she held in her hand; "look out that
                  name in the Directory. Do n't look among the names in the first part of the book,
                  but turn over to the end. There you 'll find the courts and the express companies,
                  and the banks, and the churches, and the newspapers, and the insurance companies,
                  all put down in separate lists. I think there 's a separate list of life insurance
                  companies, but I'm not sure. At any rate turn over carefully till you find the
                  insurance companies, and then look down the list until you find the Monument
                  Company, and see where their office is. If you can't find it yourself, most likely
                  the man at the store will find it for you, if you ask him. When you have found out
                  where the office is, then carry Roselle down there.
               "Then, Roselle," continued Matthew, addressing himself more particularly to his
                  sister, who, however, had been an attentive listener to these directions given to
                  Marie, "your part of the errand will come. Tell them you want to see the
                  president. If he is not in, ask to see one of the other officers,—ask for the
                  secretary or one of the directors. Can you remember those names?"
               "President—secretary—directors," said Roselle, reciting the lesson for her own and
                  her brother's assurance. "Oh, yes. That is easy."
               "That is right," said Matthew; "if they are all busy, and can't attend to you,
                  wait a little while till one of them is at leisure. Then tell him that I want to
                  have the president or some other officer of the company come up to see me. Tell
                  him I am Matthew Caraby, and am put in prison on the charge of poisoning Mr.
                  Harsford. He will know about me, I dare say," he added bitterly. "Tell him I can
                  give him some information that will help the company about their policies. Ask him
                  to bring the company's lawyer with him, and to come as soon as they can. Can you
                  remember all that?"
               "Oh yes," said Roselle.
               And the two girls, their simple preparations being made, started upon their
                  errand.
               "Monument Life Insurance Company," said Marie to herself, as the iron grating was
                  swung open for her to go out.
               "President,—secretary,—directors," soliloquized Roselle, as it swung back again
                  after their departure.
               If Matthew had been less fortunate in his messengers, it is probable that his
                  project might have failed. A brisk, smart, capable, active, energetic young man,
                  such as you would choose to make his way through the hurry and noise of Wall
                  street, and the selfish bustle of a great corporation's office, would have walked
                  straight down to the door, and tripping lightly up the stair-case, would have made
                  his way by instinct to the president's desk, would have spoken to him politely in
                  the midst of his writing so as to lose no time, yet so as to give not the least
                  offense by the interruption, would have preferred his request in a modest yet
                  distinct, clear, ear-catching manner, would have received a blunt, though civil
                  refusal from the busy dignitary, would have bowed handsomely, would have made a
                  neat retreat, just as the president was saying to himself, "Smart young man that,
                  just the fellow for an insurance messenger," and would have been back at Matthew's
                  cell, as cheerful and active as ever,
                  and all ready for the next errand; and all this he would have done in half an hour
                  or three quarters at the furthest. Roselle and Marie, however, had no such
                  business tact and aptitude as this. They started in timidity, proceeded in
                  inexperience, and returned in good fortune.
               They were not long in finding, by the aid of the Directory, the location of the
                  office. They were much longer in threading their way down through Center street,
                  and along the crowded and narrow side-walks of Nassau, to the building which they
                  sought. Climbing up the well worn stair-way to the second floor, and entering the
                  rooms of the company, where Roselle's quick ear could detect the tread of many
                  busy feet and hum of many voices, the blind girl felt that her part of the errand
                  had indeed begun.
               Roselle could not see the apartment into which Marie now led her; she could not
                  see its large windows, its rich, though well worn carpet, its mahogany furniture,
                  and the railing of the same wood which parted off the outer court of the visitors
                  from the sanctum sanctorum of the clerks and book-keepers. She could not see the
                  young faces of clerks and messengers, nor the middle aged and gray-haired heads of
                  the older men around her. What needs it therefore that I should describe these
                  things to the reader? Can not you imagine them as well as poor blind Roselle
                  could?
               Marie guided the blind girl up toward the most accessible of the clerks, who stood
                  upon a little raised platform in front of a high desk; and, by way of
                  introduction, said to him, timidly:
               "Here is a blind girl that wants to speak to you, sir."
               "No," said the man, waving his right hand in a negative way, and without looking
                  up from the great folio in which he was casting up accounts, "we can't give you
                  any thing."
               "We do n't want any thing, if you please, sir," said Roselle, "we only want the
                  president."
               "No, girls, no," reiterated the clerk, in a peremptory tone, "go away, we have got
                  nothing for you."
               "No, sir," said Roselle, "it is we who have got something for you. We 've got a
                  message."
               "Message!" said the man, now looking up from his book for the first time, and
                  scrutinizing his visitors through a pair of silver-bowed spectacles.
               He was a sharp, weasel-eyed little man, and his optical apparatus, eyes and
                  glasses together, appeared to be contrived for the express purpose of penetrating
                  directly through the dress and superficial person of an applicant for life
                  insurance, into the interior anatomy itself, and there detecting those germs of
                  undeveloped disease which should oblige the company to reject the risk, or warrant
                  them in charging a double premium. He bent this patent, double convex, microscopic
                  gaze upon Roselle, as she turned her sightless eyes toward his voice. As she could
                  see nothing of the sharpness of his look, it did not embarrass her in the least;
                  and as Marie considered all this to be Roselle's part of the errand, she was not
                  abashed. As these two bright and placid countenances, illuminated by enthusiasm
                  and eager hope, gazed toward the clerk,
                  the optical apparatus just mentioned showed itself capable of giving dissolving
                  views, for the frown which at first it had conveyed, melted into a look of doubt
                  and inquiry, and this again into a certain expression of sympathy.
               "You have got a message you say?" said the man, inquiringly. "Who for?"
               "For the president, sir," said Roselle. "President—secretary—or directors."
               "Monument Life Insurance Company," added Marie.
               "Who is it from?" said the clerk.
               "It 's from my brother," answered Roselle. "It 's about some life insurance. He
                  could n't come himself, because—"
               The clerk ran his eye along the row of desks to the further end of the room. There
                  in the corner, at a royal desk and in an imperial easy chair, sat an elderly
                  gentleman, reading a newspaper. He was the only person in the room who seemed to
                  have nothing to do but to do what he liked, and as he nodded his bald and
                  glistening head, on the back of which only a few locks of silver hair remained,
                  over the columns of his paper, he seemed to be the sun of a great planetary system
                  of life insurance, wheeling his subordinates around him in their various orbits by
                  the mere attraction of his own gravity.
               The clerk pointed him out with the end of his pen to Marie.
               "There is the president," said he, "and if you want to speak to him now 's your
                  chance."
               So saying, he leaped back again upon the ladder of figures which he had been
                  running up when the girls had interrupted him, and in an instant was half way up
                  to the sum total of "three hundred ninety-seven—seven and carry thirty-nine;"
                  while the two girls threaded their way along toward the president's desk.
               As they stood before him he was just folding the paper to get at a new column,
                  creasing it upon his knee with the palm of his right hand.
               "Well girls," said he, "I guess we can't do any thing for you to-day. You should
                  n't come so often."
               "We do n't want any thing given to us," said Marie, determined that her companion
                  should not be dismissed as a beggar. "This is a blind girl, sir, if you please,
                  who wants to talk to you about insurance."
               "About insurance, hey?" said the president, looking up with a benignant smile.
                  "Well, what is it? Do you want to be insured?" he added good humoredly.
               "No sir," said Roselle quite seriously. "I wanted to give you a message about
                  this."
               And she reached out to him the little bit of newspaper which Matthew had cut
                  out.
               The president took it and glanced over it. "Well," said he, nodding his head,
                  "that 's correct, I guess. Yes. Mr. Harsford was insured with us. What about
                  it?"
               "Why sir, my brother wants to see you about it."
               "Oh, you are Mr. Harsford's daughter, I suppose. Your brother had better come
                  himself. Tell him he must furnish us with the usual proofs of death, and a power
                  of attorney from his mother, and we shall be ready to pay the amount as soon as the ninety days are
                  up. Stop, I 'll give you some blanks."
               "No sir," interposed Roselle, hastily, as the president was about to strike a bell
                  upon his desk. "No sir, that 's not it. I am not Mr. Harsford's daughter, at all,
                  sir. I am Matthew Caraby's sister, sir. And he wants you to come and see him. He
                  would have come himself, sir, but he can't, you know, because—"
               "Matthew Caraby's sister? What, the young man that has been taken up for—er—"
               "Yes sir," said the blind girl, "that is he. He is my brother. And he wants you to
                  come and see him very much, if you please, sir."
               "What does he want to see me for?" asked the president.
               "I do n't know exactly, sir," said Roselle. "It 's about the insurance. Mr.
                  Harsford's insurance. He told me he could tell you some things about the insurance
                  that would help the company. He would have come himself, if he possibly could, but
                  he 's in the Tombs, you know, and they won't let him. So he sent me to ask you if
                  you would please to come. He said the president, or the secretary, or the
                  directors, and the lawyer. Bring the lawyer with you, if you please, sir."
               The president looked reflectingly at the window for a few moments, and then back
                  again upon his visitors. "And who is this?" said he, nodding to Marie, but
                  speaking to Roselle, "this little girl with you? Is she your sister? She does n't
                  look like you at all."
               This was true enough. Between the slight form, and pale, ethereal face of Roselle,
                  heightened in its pallor by her black dress, and the chubby frame and ruddy face
                  of little Marie, no one could imagine the least personal resemblance.
               "No sir," said Roselle, "she is Marie; she is my little friend."
               "But I do n't see," said the president, "that your brother could possibly have any
                  thing to say to me that would do any good, even if I were to go up and see
                  him."
               "I do not know what it is," said Roselle, "but it is something very
                  particular."
               The president did not know what to do. To ask him to withdraw the presence of his
                  gravity from the system around him, and leave the clerks to rush madly from their
                  orbits, and make asteroids of one another in the passageways, for want of the
                  controlling influence of his presence, was asking a serious sacrifice; but there
                  was something in the spectacle which the blind girl and her picturesque, if not
                  beautiful little guide presented, which won extremely upon his attention and
                  sympathy. He inquired still further into the particulars of their story, and
                  caused Roselle to repeat again her errand in the presence of some other gentlemen
                  whom he called into consultation, and finally sent for the attorney of the
                  company, asking his attendance. The attorney coming in person in answer to the
                  request, and the interest and curiosity of the two gentlemen combining with other
                  considerations to induce them to this course, they called a carriage forthwith,
                  and placing Roselle and Marie, whom they humorously termed the ladies, upon the
                  back seat, they themselves took the other, and were driven rapidly towards the
                  Tombs.
               
               Arrived there, Matthew thanked them for their kindness in coming, expressed a hope
                  that their time would not be lost, and proceeded at once to business. The mere
                  fact of having something to do which called forth his powers, revived his spirits,
                  and all the cheerfulness that had been repressed within him for many days past
                  came out now in an unusual flow of good spirits in the excitement of the effort he
                  had undertaken, to secure in his defense, by ingenuity and tact, a powerful
                  assistance, and such as he could not pecuniarily compensate.
               "Gentlemen," said he, "I suppose you are aware of the outline of my case from the
                  newspapers. It will be unnecessary for the present for me to tell you any thing of
                  the details of the case, but the fact is I was in Mr. Harsford's employment. I was
                  his clerk. He died very suddenly from poison. I was innocent of any knowledge of
                  it. I did not know it till I was arrested; but the circumstances are very hard
                  against me."
               "Have you had no counsel?" interposed the attorney.
               "None, sir. I have had offers of assistance, but I found out what they meant, and
                  I would have nothing to do with them. I am a stranger in the city, and I do not
                  know who I can trust among the lawyers, and after all I do n't suppose I have
                  money enough to begin to pay one. Still I hope you will not have lost your time by
                  coming to see me.
               "I see to-day that Mr. Harsford insured largely in your company."
               "Yes," said the president.
               "Do you expect to have to pay the loss?"
               "We always pay our losses sir, always. Some of the other companies contest them
                  sometimes. We never have done it yet."
               "How much was your risk on his life?"
               "Ten thousand dollars."
               "And you expect to pay that?"
               "Certainly. When it 's due. It 's two or three months yet. Why should n't we? When
                  a man dies so, do n't you think his family need their money as much as if he died
                  a natural death? Certainly, we always pay our losses."
               "I 'm glad it 's a good large sum," said Matthew.
               "Why?"
               "Because it 's all the fee I 've got to pay."
               The attorney laughed.
               "If that will pay you for defending my case, I should like to have you take hold
                  of it."
               The visitors looked at each other with astonishment, and then at the prisoner with
                  the pity which we always feel for one, the balance of whose mind has been affected
                  by terrible suffering.
               "You do not understand me," added he. "What I mean is this. My idea of this death
                  is that Mr. Harsford committed suicide, and, just before the fatal act, effected
                  these insurances to provide for his family. I never saw it till this morning, but
                  now it 's all perfectly plain to me. If I am convicted, and they seem to be sure
                  enough of it now, you will have to pay the insurance. If I am acquitted on the
                  ground that it was a suicide, you never will be called on for a cent. You do n't
                  pay men who die by their own hands.
                  That's what I mean when I say that that ten thousand dollars is all the fee I
                  have. I have some little money, not more than enough to pay the small expenses. If
                  necessary it is at your service, but I do not suppose that there is enough to
                  begin to make any compensation for so important a case."
               The president and the attorney retired, if turning around at two paces distance
                  and talking in a whisper can be called retiring, and conferred together for some
                  time. At last, after many words from the former, and much nodding from the latter,
                  they turned again to Matthew, and asked him to give them his account of the
                  case.
               "Do I understand," said he, "that you undertake my defense; that is," he added,
                  seeing the hesitation, "if you find I have any sort of defense—if after you have
                  heard it you think I may be innocent?"
               The attorney looked at the president. The president nodded almost imperceptibly.
                  The attorney said, "We will see that you are defended."
               "They will do it," he said to himself, while the attorney looked to the president
                  for instructions, "if I can show them there 's any chance of success. The old
                  gentleman is proud of never contesting any losses. They can afford to defend me
                  better than to wait until the company is sued, and then defend. For if they beat
                  in my case it will settle the whole thing. And if they fail, why nobody will have
                  it to say they contested a policy. They can see that as well as I can. I can trust
                  their word if they say 'yes.'"
               Meanwhile the president nodded almost imperceptibly to the attorney.
               "Yes, sir," said the attorney, addressing Matthew, "if you can furnish us with any
                  tolerable grounds for supposing that this death may have been a suicide, we will
                  see that you are well defended."
               Matthew then gave his visitors a rapid but clear account of the events of his
                  acquaintance with the deceased merchant, beginning with the letter he wrote from
                  the Mills and closing by stating that he was arrested on the steamboat as he was
                  going up to meet and stop his sister, who was on her way down, and for whom he had
                  no home here, after Mrs. Hopley's disappearance.
               "There is one very important circumstance you have omitted to mention," said the
                  attorney, quietly. "I have understood the prosecution are prepared to prove you
                  bought the poison."
               "I!" cried Matthew in astonishment.
               "You! At Clarrick's drug store Saturday afternoon, after your quarrel."
               "I did. I did. I see it now. He sent me for it. Mr. Harsford did. That very day.
                  He gave me a memorandum or prescription. It was when he first came in to the
                  office that morning. He stopped at the other desk in the outer room, and wrote
                  something on a paper, and folded it up, and wrote Clarrick's address on the
                  outside of it, and told me to go to Clarrick's when I went out and get it for him.
                  I thought it was only some little prescription and did n't read it. Yes, I bought
                  it. I bought it for him. He gave it to me before we quarreled."
               
               "But you did not buy it till afterwards?" said the attorney, incredulously.
               "No, I did not. I went in to speak to him as soon as he was alone; it was before I
                  went out; and one word led to another till the end of it. I did not go out of
                  errands till afternoon, and then I got it, but when I came back Mr. Harsford had
                  gone. Then I tied up the little white packet with the cigar box, when I carried
                  that up to the house."
               After another short conference between the president and the attorney they went
                  away; the latter promising to come again in the afternoon to consult more fully on
                  the details of the evidence in the case. He said there was no time to be lost.
               From this hour Matthew began to hope, though he saw as yet more of hope than of
                  expectation. He understood his own case himself now;—whether other people could be
                  made to understand it, when his lips were to be sealed and his explanation not
                  permitted to be heard, was another question.
               He did not sufficiently reflect that, excepting in his own knowledge, which he
                  could not legally be allowed to utter, there was no particle of the evidence that
                  did not point to him,—to him, as the murderer.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               A PAIR OF RED SPECTACLES WILL SET THE WORLD ON FIRE.
               EVEN if all those twenty thousand persons who, on that bright December day
                  appointed for Matthew's trial, said to each other that it was a delightful
                  morning, had looked out upon the beauty of the air and sky with one pair of eyes
                  possessing all the keenness of forty thousand optics,—if they had inhaled the
                  cool, crisp morning air at one breath,—if feeling one undivided sensation of
                  exhilaration, they had said with one voice, "Delightful morning!" their combined
                  and accumulated testimony would not have outweighed the evidence which the
                  countenances of Matthew and his sister gave to the fact that it was an anxious and
                  unhappy morning.
               When every thing is to be lost by a failure, and nothing except a former liberty
                  to be gained by a success, Hope is not so inspiring as when the prize is some new
                  blessing, never yet attained, and the thought of failure has not a sting of
                  Despair.
               About ten o'clock in the forenoon Matthew was conducted from the prison to the
                  court room. Entrance was with difficulty procured for him by the officers, through a narrow side-door, beset by a
                  crowd of bystanders, who could not gain admission to the hall itself, and yet
                  desired to satisfy their curiosity with a sight of the young criminal as he
                  passed; and at length he gained his seat in the room within. Here he found one of
                  his counsel awaiting him, prepared with books and papers on a long narrow table.
                  His associate, he said to Matthew, would be in, soon. Meanwhile Matthew looked
                  around upon the scene. The hall was crowded with men; singular men, with one
                  feature, Eyes. Eyes. Eyes everywhere. The slight noise of his entrance at the
                  little side-door had been the signal for the attention of all. A thousand Eyes he
                  saw. Other features were insignificant; forms and figures were invisible; but Eyes
                  sat all around him. Eyes leaned forward upon him. Eyes walked toward him. Eyes
                  stood up and peered over other Eyes to see him. Eyes pointed him out to other
                  Eyes, and the other Eyes nodded back that they saw him. Eyes on the floor within
                  the bar. Eyes in the rising seats beyond toward the door. Eyes in the gallery
                  above. Eyes in the jurymen's seats, and when he turned away in the other
                  direction, Eyes from the judge's bench looked down upon him. Eyes everywhere.
                  Nothing but Eyes. Some of them glanced at him with careless pity. Some gleamed
                  upon him with predetermined hostility. Some few glared with a thirst for
                  vengeance. Some merely gazed with a mean and impertinent curiosity upon his
                  person. Some gloated with a morbid interest in his fate. There were not wanting a
                  few that glowed with a real sympathy and glistened with a tearful hope. And in
                  among the witnesses in an open space beyond the judge, where several ladies sat
                  apart, he thought he could see glittering from beneath a double vail the Eyes he
                  knew and loved so well.
               Some few others he could recognize, though but very few. His best friends, too
                  anxious, too keenly suffering with him to witness the scene, watched and waited
                  apart. For the most part the familiar faces were not lighted with cheering or
                  friendly expressions. There was Mr. Warrack, the confidential clerk, who was from
                  the first suspicious of him, and now, as he saw from his look, full of evil real
                  and imaginary, to utter against him. There was the old porter whose friendly smile
                  Matthew had so often elicited, but who now sat as if all the Roman virtue of ages
                  were concentrated in his grey head to enable him to tell all he had heard,
                  conjectured and dreamed, without fear or favor. Over beyond the jury, at the end
                  of the room most remote from his seat, was a little gallery, and up in the front
                  seats of this gallery some noisy boys sat, crowding each other, and going through
                  that process of pushing, counter-pushing, nudging, kicking and resisting, which is
                  as necessary to settling boys compactly in a short seat as effervescence is to the
                  union of soda powders. Among these Matthew caught sight of a familiar little face,
                  pale and thin, which surmounted a considerable expanse of collar quite out of
                  proportion to the diminutive shoulders that supported it; the face of little
                  Benny.
               By this time the space within the bar, which was at first quite open, was densely
                  filled. Matthew's counsel were now conferring together not far from him. The insurance companies interested had made
                  common cause of his case, and he had the satisfaction of feeling that, thanks to
                  his ingenuity and adroitness in attaching himself to their interests, he was to be
                  ably represented in the contest that was to ensue, whatever might be the result of
                  that contest.
               Hour after hour of the dull preliminaries wore away; Matthew watched with intense
                  interest the tedious steps, unimportant to the reader, by which the court was at
                  last prepared to enter upon the trial. First there was secured an ordinary degree
                  of silence on the part of the people by dint of extraordinary noises on the part
                  of the officers. This interesting diminuendo occupied many minutes. Then by the
                  officers' incessantly standing up to require it, the lawyers within the bar were
                  prevailed upon to sit down. Then a crowd of jurymen, previously enticed or driven
                  to the spot, were encaged and were sifted down by the counsel until twelve men of
                  the requisite qualifications—who had not read any thing about the case, and had
                  not heard any thing about the case, and did not know any thing about the case, and
                  had not thought any thing about the case, and did not know that they could form
                  any opinion about the case—were found, and were thereupon sworn to "well and truly
                  try the case." They being all comfortably seated and ready to proceed, it was now
                  high noon, and the court considerately took a recess of fifteen minutes,
                  apparently for the purpose of eating a cracker and an apple, and reading a
                  newspaper. This preliminary having been settled, (except the crumbs and the core,
                  which were given to an officer, as his perquisites, I suppose,) the confusion
                  which had arisen during the recess was quieted by the same homeopathic treatment
                  as before, and the cause begun in good earnest.
               The counsel who conducted the prosecution, sustained his high reputation for
                  ability and eloquence, and added much to it, by his powerful address, in which he
                  laid the revolting case, as he called it, before the spectators, and, among
                  others, the jury. He nominally addressed his remarks to the twelve men who
                  composed the latter body, but as he warmed with his subject he gradually turned
                  toward the spectators who crowded the rest of the room, and the latter part
                  especially of his eloquent and stirring appeal was aimed with enthusiasm at the
                  whole audience, and especially at three gentlemen who sat writing as fast as they
                  could at a table immediately before the judge. Matthew innocently supposed they
                  were the clerks of the court making record of the proceedings, but he was
                  afterwards informed that they were the reporters who were taking the orator's
                  speech for the newspapers.
               In the course of his opening the counsel stated succinctly what were the salient
                  points of the chain of evidence, which unimpeachable witnesses for the People
                  would produce, and which chain, he said, would bind the guilt of this terrible
                  murder upon the neck of the smooth-faced young prisoner who sat before them, so
                  irresistibly, that not all the brilliant array of legal talent of which the
                  prisoner had availed himself, could find any way of eluding it. That chain of
                  evidence was so perfect, so painfully complete, that not all the tears of
                     sympathy which artifice could extort
                  could corrode its links,—not all the acute technicality, in which he would concede
                  his learned friends were far his superiors, could find one flaw in its
                  continuity,—not all the sharp, hair-splitting logic, filing ever so keenly, could
                  cut it asunder under the eyes of the court. That chain, which would so inevitably
                  encircle the prisoner's neck, these twelve men should draw so tight, and should so
                  securely lock with final proofs, recently discovered, of so deep and damning a
                  nature, that not all the sophistries of interested counsel, with whole
                  corporations at their backs, could draw the bolt; and not all the lubrications
                  which the commendations of kind and weak people could supply, should enable even
                  this glib fellow to slip his head out of its collar.
               At this peroration, seeing the speaker stop to breathe, the officers cried out, by
                  way of caution, their stereotyped order, "Silence!" whereupon the
                  crowd, taking the hint, set up a buzz and rustle of applause that caused the very
                  judge to knock fiercely on his desk; the orator meanwhile wiping his brow and
                  looking around on his admiring audience, and smiling at the futility of the
                  efforts to still the plaudits he had earned.
               Then came the testimony.
               The case was not a complicated one, and as the witnesses were mostly known to be
                  fair-minded people and told the truth, the defense, for a wonder, did not badger
                  them a great deal with cross-examination.
               
                  Mr. Warrack was the first witness called, after some simple formal
                  proofs of Mr. Harsford's death had been put in. He testified to the quarrel which
                  he had overheard on Saturday forenoon. He was in the outer room. Was not
                  listening, O no, but he heard what was going on. The voices were very loud and
                  angry, especially that of the prisoner; heard him threaten the deceased. Did n't
                  know what he threatened him with, but thought that he threatened him with a ruler.
                  Heard the prisoner strike the desk with the ruler, and afterwards the ruler struck
                  very heavily on the floor. The ruler was a very large square ebony stick. Did not
                  think either of the blows hit the deceased; supposes that the prisoner missed his
                  aim, but should think the blows were heavy enough to have killed a man if they had
                  hit him fairly. He did n't go into the room while the prisoner was there. He
                  thought it would be safer not to interfere. Was not afraid, O no, only the
                  deceased had asked him to leave the room. Did not think of any danger at all. In
                  fact was just about getting ready to go in when the prisoner came out. He did not
                  say any thing when he came out, but went straight to his desk. As to the words the
                  prisoner used in threatening the deceased, witness could not swear to the exact
                  words, but the prisoner said that "he 'd do it if he had to go through all the
                  courts of justice in the State for it," or words to that effect. What he was going
                  to do witness did not know. Suppose he meant kill him.
               At the time of Mr. Harsford's death, the prisoner had been in his employment about
                  a week. He had applied to Mr. Harsford in the first instance for employment. The
                  first application was by letter; afterwards he called at the counting-room. The
                  witness was about to relate that Mr. Harsford had told him to keep a sharp
                     lookout upon Matthew as he was a
                  suspicious character, and he had only engaged him on account of his having some
                  claims which deceased could not well resist; but the defense objected to the proof
                  of Mr. Harsford's conversation with witness; and this evidence was withdrawn.
               The witness continued. The deceased made on Saturday several business appointments
                  with various persons to meet him on Monday. Knew he intended to come down to the
                  counting-room on Monday, because he overdrew his bank account Saturday, and was
                  not able to make it up that day, and he said he would be down early Monday, and
                  make it right, then.
               
                  John, the errand boy, testified that the deceased brought in a box
                  of cigars that forenoon and told him to take it up to the house that night. The
                  prisoner inquired about it in the afternoon after the other clerks were gone, and
                  offered to carry the box up himself and let witness go early. Witness accordingly
                  went away at about five. Left the prisoner all alone when he went.
               It was proved by both these witnesses that the prisoner went out shortly after the
                  quarrel to do some errands, he said, and was gone some time, This was about the
                  middle of the afternoon, and was the only time he was absent from the
                  counting-room during the day.
               
                  A cigar dealer was called to the stand, who testified that he kept a
                  store a few doors from the deceased's store. The deceased occasionally had bought
                  cigars from him. He was very particular indeed about the quality; so that the
                  witness recollected distinctly their transactions. He sold a box to deceased on
                  that Saturday day morning. It was a small box. The box now shown to him by the
                  counsel for the prosecution was the identical box. There could be no doubt about
                  it. The cigars were made by himself;—his best;—they were marked Havana, but that
                  was one of the customs of the trade. He made them himself, and they were pure.
               By comparing the hour named by this witness, and that named by John, it was
                  evident that the deceased brought the box directly from the shop to his
                  counting-rooms.
               
                  A gentleman Matthew had never seen before, testified that he was a
                  neighbor of the deceased and knew him well. Witness called on him at his
                  counting-room on that Saturday. Saw a box of cigars there. Deceased said they were
                  some he had just bought, and thought were good. Deceased gave the witness a bunch
                  of them. They were good. Witness smoked them, the whole bunch, during that night
                  and the next forenoon. Did not feel any ill effects of it. Was accustomed to smoke
                  a good deal. Knew a good cigar as far as he could smell it. That box now shown him
                  was the one he saw; no doubt of it. It was open on the deceased's desk when the
                  witness came away.
               Just as he was leaving the room the deceased called him back, and asked him to
                  come in again and see him on Monday. Monday noon. Deceased did not say why, but
                  desired him particularly to call.
               
                  Mr. Clarrick, druggist, testified that about three or four o'clock
                  on that Saturday, the prisoner came to his store, and purchased a small quantity
                  of morphia. That drug was in a fine
                  white powder. Witness remarked the prisoner particularly, for he seemed to be
                  agitated or perturbed. He appeared to be in a hurry. It was a cool day, but he
                  seemed to be warm as if with running. Witness put up the drug for him himself. Did
                  not remember the quantity. Witness marked "Poison" upon it, and then
                  put it in an outer wrapper which had no mark upon it.
               In answer to questions from one of the prisoner's counsel, this witness added that
                  the prisoner did not ask for the drug by name, but handed him a slip of paper, and
                  asked him to "put up that," as if it were a prescription. The name of the drug was
                  written in the paper. Did not recollect whether the paper was folded up or not.
                  Did not recollect whether the prisoner looked at the paper or not. The witness had
                  not brought the paper with him. The paper had been lost or destroyed. It was not
                  kept among the prescriptions, but was thrown with the waste papers. Such bits of
                  waste paper as that, in the store, were thrown into a box, and used to kindle
                  fires, etc., etc. A thorough search had been made, at request of prisoner's
                  counsel, to find the paper, but it could not be found. It had undoubtedly been
                  destroyed. Could not say what sort of a hand-writing it was written in, but should
                  know the paper again if he saw it.
               This witness's testimony as to the selling of the drug to the prisoner, was
                  corroborated by the examination of his two clerks, who were in the store at the
                  time.
               
                  The porter employed by the deceased in the warehouse house was
                  called next, and testified that at six o'clock on that Saturday afternoon he had
                  shut up below stairs and was coming up to the counting-room to fasten the shutters
                  there when he met the prisoner with a bundle under his arm. It was the same size
                  as the box of cigars now shown, and the witness should think it might have been
                  that very box done up in paper.
               
                  Miss Arabella Mayes was called. Matthew had endeavored to carry out
                  his purpose of saving her from the necessity of responding to this call; but he
                  was somewhat curtly reminded by his counsel, that the insurance companies had
                  undertaken his defense for their benefit as well as his own, and that he must
                  permit his advisers to conduct the case as they saw fit, if they were to conduct
                  it at all. He found himself therefore helpless. Arabella's testimony, however, was
                  very straight-forward and simple. With delicacy and tact, but with frankness, she
                  narrated the brief meeting which took place between herself and the prisoner at
                  Mr. Harsford's door upon that memorable Saturday evening.
               Matthew was surprised at the degree of composure with which she was able to submit
                  to the examination she had striven so much to avoid. Her unreserved and
                  unqualified identification of the prisoner as the bearer of the fatal box,
                  contrasted strongly with her evident sympathy for him; and the contrast gave a
                  terrible weight to her testimony.
               By the testimony of servants, this same box, unopened, was traced
                  from Arabella's hand to that of the deceased, who took it to his study. No one had
                  entered his room that night, so that no
                  person could have touched the cigars.
               
                  Several physicians being called one after another, testified
                  substantially as follows: They had been called in almost immediately after Mr.
                  Harsford was found dead. They made the usual post mortem examination. The system
                  appeared, in general, to be in a healthy state, with the exception of a slight
                  congestion of the brain. There were no other symptoms of natural disease which
                  could explain the death. All the vital organs were sound. They were shown the half
                  burned end of a cigar, which was lying upon the floor, at the head of the sofa. It
                  was picked up by one of themselves on their first visit, and kept for examination.
                  It was afterwards carefully examined, and it was then found that the leaves had
                  been separated, and a white powder scattered amongst them. That powder was
                  subjected to the usual chemical tests, and conclusively shown to be morphia. It
                  appeared to be introduced in considerable quantity; as much, probably, as would
                  admit of rolling the cigar up again in compact shape. If the whole cigar were
                  filled in proportion to the part which remained, there would have been much more
                  than necessary to produce death. They ascribed the death of Mr. Harsford, without
                  hesitation, to the administration of the drug by means of the cigar. There could
                  be no doubt that death might be produced in that way. None of them recollected any
                  case of poisoning by that method, but it was doubtless possible. The poison would
                  not operate entirely, perhaps not chiefly, by infecting the smoke of the cigar,
                  but the powder in the part of the cigar which was put in the mouth would be
                  imbibed directly. A great deal would depend on the kind of poison used. The salts
                  of morphia would be imbibed more readily than the pure alkaloid. If it were
                  desired to counterfeit a natural death, morphia would be better selected than
                  almost any other, in one respect, that the post mortem appearances were very
                  indistinct. The only trace of the action of morphia, which could be depended upon,
                  was a fullness of the blood-vessels of the brain, and this appearance was
                  presented in some of the forms of apoplexy. It was very difficult to distinguish
                  poisoning by the various preparations of opium (of which morphia was one) from
                  apoplexy, unless by the attendant circumstances. If the end of the cigar had not
                  been found, it would have been difficult to say whether the death resulted from an
                  apoplectic attack or by an excessive opiate. Mr. Harsford was not at all of an
                  apoplectic habit. Under the circumstances there could be no 
                     douht
                     doubt
                   that the death was caused by the drug.
               This is but the outline in the briefest form of the mass of circumstances
                  accumulated with indefatigable industry by the counsel for the prosecution; and
                  all of which, not only in their intrinsic nature but in the truthful coloring of
                  most of them, coming from intelligent and in the main trustworthy witnesses, bore
                  with a resistless effect upon Matthew's case.
               When the counsel announced that their case was closed the jurymen looked at each
                  other in satisfaction at the prospect of no defense and a speedy verdict. It
                  becoming noised abroad among the crowd that that was all the testimony timony against the prisoner, the crowd,
                  who had grown weary and inattentive to the scientific testimony of the medical
                  witnesses long before their examinations were ended, evidently thought that it was
                  quite enough.
               Matthew himself was half convinced that the terrible chain, which the counsel had
                  flourished in his opening speech, was already about his neck; his head grew
                  confused and Eyes became predominant again all over the room. In a moment,
                  however, he became aware that his counsel had arisen to address the jury, and
                  summoning again his self-possession, he fixed his attention upon the progress of
                  the cause.
               Matthew was destined, however, to feel a sad disappointment in the address of his
                  counsel.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               'TIS A FAIR DAY WHEN THE SUN BREAKS THE CLOUDS IN GOOD
                  SEASON.
               MATTHEW, I say, was destined to feel a sad disappointment in the speech of his
                  counsel.
               The enthusiastic declamations of his adversary had filled Matthew with vague and
                  uncertain apprehensions, and had revived all his fears. He now waited impatiently
                  for the opening of his defense, to witness a brilliant sally upon the enemy which
                  should meet him face to face, and drive him back with threatening gestures and
                  commanding voice, and triumphantly discomfit him and put him to rout with his own
                  weapons. He expected to hear a thrilling speech from his own advocate; one which
                  should touch every heart and reduce the thousand Eyes to tears. He had made up his
                  mind that nothing but an outburst of eloquence outsoaring the eloquence of the
                  prosecution could save him. He looked for such an appeal as a young lawyer always
                  makes according to the novels; when, being intrusted with his first cause (always
                  a case of vast importance and almost insuperable difficulty), he succeeds by sheer
                  force of his rhetoric, and consequently is crowned with the congratulations of all
                  his friends, and immediately ately
                  afterwards marries his client by way of fee for his services,—the client of course
                  being a young woman, fair to behold and amply endowed with this world's goods.
               But his legal friend displayed no capability for this kind of success.
               What was not therefore Matthew's surprise when he saw his counsel step around as
                  near the jury as he could conveniently get, without disrespect to his adversary
                  and the court, turn his back upon the thousand Eyes, and address himself in a
                  plain, conversational tone to the jury, as if the matter in hand were some trivial
                  circumstance of the moment.
               He spoke so indifferently that Matthew, although he sat very near, actually had to
                  lean forward to avoid losing any word, in the confusion which prevailed in the
                  room. General curiosity, however, soon caused silence, and the room was quiet
                  again. There was then no longer any difficulty in hearing.
               "May it please the Court, and you, Gentlemen of the Jury," said the counsel,
                  settling himself very comfortably in an easy, unconcerned way against the edge of
                  the table behind him, "I think this is altogether one of the most singular cases I
                  have ever known. I think," he continued, speaking slowly and with great
                  seriousness, and looking from one juryman to another, "that there can be no doubt
                  that this young man has got into a very embarrassing position."
               While the speaker pauses an instant to note the effect of this singular
                  commencement, I should avail myself of the opportunity to say that this man was
                  one of the most adroit and acute of advocates. From the beginning of the case he
                  had been watching the effect of the evidence upon the minds of the jury; and he
                  knew too well the uses and abuses of that fervor of address which is called
                  eloquence, to display his powers in that respect now. He employed this quiet,
                  conversational tone and style, and assumed this air of carelessness, in order to
                  put his own thoughts and those of the jury in harmony for a starting point.
               "These witnesses," he continued, "have told their stories, and, in general, with
                  every appearance of having told the truth. That is as to their facts.
                     Don't you think so? Well, I 'll not be certain; some of them may
                  have a little personal feeling,—may have exaggerated somewhat. The impressions and
                  opinions some of them have managed to express are evidently not reliable. But I
                  think that in the main, so far as they have stated facts, they are pretty nearly
                  right. I mean their manner impresses me so. At any rate, they are all very worthy
                  people, and I shall not contradict what they have said. These facts, such facts as
                  they happen to know, certainly look pretty strong. Therefore I say, as I said
                  before, that the case looks very bad against the young man."
               The speaker was fast getting a surprising reputation for fairness and impartiality
                  with the jury. If he had been a judge he would have been more pompous and
                  dignified; but he could not have been more unbiased than he now appeared.
               "Because you see, gentlemen," he proceeded, "in investigating such a case as this
                  we have several difficulties. First
                  place, the secrecy of the act; the crime, whether murder or suicide, is apt to
                  have been committed so that no one has any positive knowledge of it. Second place,
                  the people who know any thing about the circumstances are generally strongly
                  interested. They generally take sides violently. Lastly, of the two persons who
                  alone know the real truth, one is dead, the other is not permitted to speak. There
                  he sits. But his mouth is shut. We must find out what we can in some other way.
                  You have no way of finding out what he knows, unless we can find some one else who
                  knows just the same thing. If we can't do that you can't hear it. He can tell it
                  to me, but I can not tell it to you.
               "But that does not make so much difference in this case, for I suppose the fact
                  is, that he knows no more about the matter than we do. Some little minor details
                  he might correct, perhaps, but as to the main facts stated,—not the tremendous
                  damning facts, strong as proof from Holy Writ, which my eloquent friend talked
                  about,—but the plain, simple, every-day circumstances told us by the witnesses,—I
                  suppose about these simple facts there is little doubt. The buying of a drug. The
                  carrying a box of cigars. The letting an errand boy go an hour earlier than usual.
                  The quarrel with a nervous and irritable employer, and a sudden dismissal from
                  employment. All these things, gentlemen, are natural and simple incidents that
                  happen every day in our lives. There is not one of us who has not bought drugs
                  again and again,—poisons too,—and never known what they were; yes! and ten to one
                  the wiseacre that sold them knew no better either. This is the worst of their
                  facts, and I 've done as terrible a thing as that, before now.
               "You see, gentlemen, it is not the facts themselves that prove any thing against
                  the boy, but it is the peculiar and unusual combination of the circumstances,
                  followed by the death, that casts suspicion on him.
               "That is all; but that 's not enough. You see, all we have reached thus far is
                  this: assume that the young man had a desire, a deliberate purpose, to destroy his
                  employer, assume that to start with, then we have ascertained this: he
                     might have bought the poison, knowing it to be such. He might have
                  put it into the cigars. He might have carried the cigars to Mr. Harsford's house
                  with this purpose. And Mr. Harsford might have died in consequence. These
                  circumstances do not prove the prisoner did do it, but only that he
                     might have done it. That 's clear enough, is n't it?
               "But I do n't think that is enough.
               "No; I suppose the court will tell you that the law requires that they should show
                  not only that the deceased may have died by the hand of the
                  prisoner,—they 've shown that, we would have admitted that,—but they must show
                  something more. In every case of this sort they must prove, first, an adequate
                  motive for taking the life, second, an opportunity to take it,—and third, they
                  must exclude, by proof, every reasonable hypothesis which could explain the death
                  consistently with the prisoner's innocence. In other words, they must show that
                  the deceased could not have died at that time and in that way by any other
                  means.
               
               "Now you can see the bearings of the various facts they have shown. The quarrel in
                  the counting-room they rely on to show a motive. I won't stop now to
                  discuss whether they proved motive distinctly enough, but supposing the quarrel
                  was violent enough and the circumstances were sufficiently serious to do that,
                  there is where those facts would come in, in working up the case. They would show
                  the motive and that 's all.
               "Then they must prove an opportunity. There is where the facts about
                  the drug and the cigars come in; the buying the drug, the staying at the office
                  alone, the carrying the cigars up to the house—all these things do n't go to show
                  that the young man intended a murder, but only that he might have committed it, if
                  he had intended it.
               "But they 've got to prove something more than this. They 've got to exclude all
                  other explanations of the death. They are not bound to demonstrate absolutely that
                  it is impossible the death should have been caused by any other means; that would
                  not be fair to require. But, if they do not prove directly that this young man did
                  it,—and they do not, but only that he might have done it,—then they must also show
                  that it is not reasonable to suppose that any one else did it.
               "They know this as well as I do.
               "This was what they were trying to do when they put those questions to What 's his
                  name, the clerk there, Mr. Warrack, about Mr. Harsford's business appointments;
                  and when they proved the appointment which he made with the other witness. They
                  knew that so far as the other facts go, in a legal point of view, it would be just
                  about as likely that this man committed suicide as that he was murdered. They
                  wanted to show that he had appointments for Monday, because they thought you would
                  infer that he could not be intending suicide meanwhile.
               "They 'll have to prove something better than overdrawing a bank account, to make
                  him very anxious to meet the cashier on Monday morning. I 'm very glad they proved
                  those facts, because you see every particle of truth helps along.
               "It 's because we do not know the whole story that we are in this perplexity.
               "If the druggist had only saved that scrap of paper and brought it here, so that
                  we might see in whose handwriting it was, that would help us too."
               These sentences, uttered conversationally, colloquially, with a remarkable
                  directness and pointedness of manner, grasped the attention of every one of those
                  to whom he so quietly spoke. Turning from one juror to another, as he proceeded,
                  he had dwelt upon each, and, as it were, conversed with him, until each man felt
                  the personal influence of the speaker's mind.
               "I do not know that I have much more to say at present, before I call some
                  witnesses. I 've only a very few. I propose to prove the excellent character this
                  young man has always borne, and to give you some better insight, if I can, into
                  this quarrel, of which we have had a sort of outside, eavesdropping account, and
                  also to give you some idea of the character and true position of the deceased, so that you may better be
                  able to judge if it is improbable that—he would commit suicide for instance.
               "In the first place, though, before any evidence, I had better give you an outline
                  of my idea of this matter. I can't prove it all. I 'm not bound to prove it all. I
                  will tell you what is our supposition of the cause of this death, and then I will
                  show you the evidence which corroborates that view, and makes it seem to me very
                  improbable that this young man had any idea of what was going on. Then if you
                  think there is a reasonable possibility that the death happened in the way we
                  suppose it did, that will raise a reasonable doubt as to the prisoner's guilt, and
                  you must acquit him."
               The advocate paused a moment, but soon recommenced, speaking now very
                  deliberately, and in a sort of monologue or soliloquy.
               "I imagine a merchant in great embarrassment. He has been living fast.
                  Speculating. Building. All sorts of irons in the fire. He keeps a-going, till at
                  length he is fairly cornered. He borrows everywhere. He uses other people's money
                  in underhand ways, and so gets into awkward positions. His troubles make him
                  unscrupulous, and at length he gets into a very tight place. Well, he must have
                  money, and plans various expedients to raise it, and is all the time beset with
                  embarrassments, anxieties and cares; all the time getting deeper into the water,
                  and all the time struggling harder and harder to hold his head up higher above
                  it.
               "I see this man growing nervous and thin with his trouble. At last his creditors
                  rise to pursue him; and one gets judgment against him, and another gets judgment
                  against him; and another, one Saturday afternoon, obtains an order for his arrest;
                  for his arrest in a suit for issuing false and fraudulent securities. The deputy
                  sheriff comes quietly down with the papers in his pocket and calls upon the
                  merchant."
               The room became perfectly still. The last pair of the thousand Eyes left Matthew
                  now, and were fixed upon the speaker, who, standing carelessly against the table,
                  wielded adroitly the most ingenious of all forms of eloquence, a spell by which
                  all who heard him were bound, yet never knew it. This was the critical time of his
                  effort; and though his external manner was simple and natural, one who understood
                  the secret of his skill, and realized the enormous power which he wielded over
                  hearers unconscious of his influence, would have seen in his keen, steady eye, the
                  intense excitement he felt in this scene, and would have perceived in his
                  deliberate utterances, his delicate modulations of voice, now no longer colloquial
                  and familiar, but growing more and more ideal and imaginative, the care with which
                  he presented every thought and weighed and placed every word.
               "I see now," continued he, "that this merchant finds his expedients at last
                  exhausted. He is at the end of his career. He knows it very well. The deputy calls
                  on him. They sit together in the counting-room. I hear the merchant, who trembles
                  with terror at the near approach of the disgrace which impends, bargain with him
                  for more time; for a day or two. Such things can be done, I regret to say, gentlemen; and the officer
                  goes away.
               "Before he goes, gentlemen, he makes an appointment to meet this merchant
                     again on Monday. When I hear this, I begin to understand it."
               The grasp and power with which this speaker seized upon every minute circumstance,
                  and gave it a new and unexpected aspect, rendered every passage of his remarks a
                  new surprise to his hearers. Matthew himself found his flesh creep, as he began to
                  realize for the first time the truth of this interpretation now so vividly flashed
                  in successive revelations before him. He wished that this low-toned, quiet,
                  indifferent man were only eloquent. Oh! if he had but an arm of power, and a
                  tongue of fire, to give adequate utterance to such throbbing, burning thoughts as
                  those with which his simple words filled his hearers. Matthew did not know that a
                  gesture or an outburst would have broken the charm. To have made any signal of the
                  power he was wielding would have been to put himself above the case, and open an
                  impassable barrier between himself and the minds of the jury.
               In the same low tone he continued after the short pause during which Matthew
                  groaned in spirit with these anxieties.
               "But I imagine that this man has recently insured his life. He is a husband and a
                  father, and would like to leave welfare behind him. It is necessary, therefore,
                  doubly necessary, that he should die, and that he should die so ingeniously that
                  the true cause will not be discovered covered, or at least so that if the fatal
                  agent is known, the hand that administered it may never he suspected.
               "I imagine that this man is also maddened with other troubles than those I yet
                  mentioned; with others, gentlemen, deeper, darker than any of these. A startling
                  and mysterious claim has just been preferred against him in behalf of one whom he
                  has for twenty years, and with good reason, believed to be dead. This claim is a
                  wicked imposture; but it is devised with such diabolical ingenuity, and sustained
                  by such a peculiar conjuncture of corroborating circumstances, that he is led to
                  believe it must be true; and it is pressed upon him with such relentless
                  pertinacity that he thinks it can not be evaded. If he had money it might be
                  satisfied; but it is money, gentlemen, which this merchant can no longer command.
                  Without it, he can see no prospect in the future but disgrace and misery for
                  himself and for those dearest to him; for this abominable scheme of scoundrels
                  threatens not merely to abate his prosperity, but to blacken his own name, and
                  make outcasts of his family. Under the pressure of such a distress, one which I am
                  about to explain more fully to you in a few moments, this man resolves to die.
               "I see him buying a box of cigars. His taste is keen. He can tell the flavor of
                  all the grades. He knows at a whiff the true aroma. He will touch none but the
                  best.
               "I do not suppose that this man, with so exquisite a taste, is to be smoked to
                  death unawares by a poisoned cigar, and never once detect the stench of its deadly
                  fumes. I do not suppose he fails to recognize the odor of the drug. I do not suppose it would be possible
                  to foist upon him drugged tobacco in place of the pure weed, and he not detect the
                  scent, and detect the taste, and detect the broken appearance of the cigar.
                  Poisoned he might be by himself, but not thus by another. The doctors were not
                  asked as to this point by my learned friend. We shall have some
                  medical testimony on this point to offer in our turn, gentlemen.
               "I imagine that when a certain friend drops in upon this merchant at his
                  counting-room that morning, he gives him a bundle of cigars out of this very box.
                  He commends them highly to his friend. Perhaps his wish is that if the question
                  ever comes up, there may be those who can testify to the purity and excellence of
                  the article.
               "He requests his friend, just as the latter is about to leave, to call in and see
                  him on Monday. He gives no reason, but insists on making an appointment. If he had
                  made a dozen such it would not surprise me. Often when a man contemplates suicide,
                  he feels a strong desire to conceal his tracks.
               "He sits down, as I see him, and deliberately overdraws that bank account which he
                  knows he can not make good. He has no purpose whatever of returning to face this
                  dishonorable debt, when he has no money, is not going to
                  have any money, and knows that he can not get any money. I do not
                  imagine that after this man leaves the counting-room he ever will come back.
               "I can see this harassed and guilty man, early in the day, sending one of his
                  young men for the drug which he desires to use. He does not go himself, nor send
                  by any one who might probably be recognized; but avails himself of the services of
                  one, a stranger in the city, unknown, unlikely to be recognized, and less likely
                  than any other to be afterwards sought out and questioned in regard to such a
                  matter. Oh! too unwary and compliant youth. Too obedient! Why did he not quarrel
                  one day earlier, and cut himself off from this connection before this desperate
                  and unscrupulous man should use him as a tool, and leave him to this fate?
               "This young man is generous and rash. His nearest and best friend has been
                  defrauded by this needy and ruined merchant, and he seizes the first opportunity
                  to make a demand for reparation. He enters his employer's presence with a just
                  indignation, but a heated judgment. The manner and tone of his employer inflame
                  them both. Thus he is unconsciously and unfortunately drawn into a scene which
                  marks him in the minds of overhearers as his employer's enemy. Then with the heat
                  of the dispute still upon him, this young man, faithful to duty still, though
                  excited and disturbed, goes to the drug store. He hands the folded slip to the
                  druggist. His thoughts are anywhere but upon his errand. He takes the offered
                  packet almost without thought, and returns."
               The speaker felt that his failure was certain, unless the theory of the defense
                  should be so vividly and keenly depicted, and so fully received into the minds of
                  the jury, that the few slight, frail matters of evidence which should be given in
                  corroboration, might only be requisite to anchor in their minds the conjecture
                  which with so much minuteness he was
                  gradually unfolding. He scanned closely the faces of his listeners one by one, and
                  watched anxiously for the signs of his progress.
               "I see now," he continued, "that this employer has gone home. The cigars are to
                  follow him. This young man faithfully waits at the counting room until the last
                  moment of his alloted service. Without apprehension of evil, he gives liberty to
                  his associate instead of claiming it himself. He has those relations with the
                  family of his employer which render him quite willing to present himself at the
                  house once more before he leaves the situation and goes beyond the circle of their
                  knowledge. He volunteers to do the simple errand at the house. He reaches the door
                  and there unexpectedly meets a young lady. There are reasons in their past
                  acquaintance why they can not meet without mutual embarrassment and disturbance.
                  In his perturbation he turns away hastily and in confusion, and disappears.
               "I see the fatal box pass from hand to hand, till it reaches that of the expectant
                  merchant. He shuts himself with it into his room."
               As the speaker reached this point, his eye completed again the circuit of the
                  twelve intent faces before him. He saw by their expression that while they
                  followed him with intense interest, it was not with that credence, that faith so
                  to speak, which he had labored so hard at the outset to establish, and which was
                  so essential to his success. He paused but for one moment; though in that moment
                  his mind, long used to quick action, flashed a searching thought along backward
                  through the whole length of the imaginary narrative he had been pursuing to see if
                  he had omitted any incident or failed to turn any to the best advantage. But there
                  was no time to lose. He wiped the drops of perspiration that singularly stood upon
                  his cool face, and resumed.
               "And now, gentlemen, he is alone. I imagine this desperate and wretched man now
                  shut up by his own hand to his destruction. The fatal moment approaches. He takes
                  out a cigar from its place. Its fragrance is exquisite to his keen sense. He takes
                  up the poison. With these in his hands he is ready.
               "His wish is, gentlemen, his blasphemous wish is to counterfeit one of those
                  terrible, inexplicable, sudden deaths by which God Almighty, on rare occasions,
                  strikes a man lifeless, never leaving a mark or a scar upon his body, to tell the
                  hand or weapon or disease which did the work. With this wish he has contrived this
                  ingenious but ineffectual attempt.
               "I imagine that with his own hand this wretched, unhappy man inserts the poison
                  into the cigar. He unrolls its layers and scatters the fatal powder through it. He
                  rolls it up again and—"
               "Yes, sir! That was it! That was truly it! I saw him;" cried a little voice from
                  the gallery. "I saw him do it! He did!"
               And then, dismayed and terrified at the confusion which his almost unconscious
                  outcry had caused, little Benny, for it was his voice which startled the room,
                  shrank back into his seat.
               The whole room rose. The thousand Eyes were shot at him. The jurymen leaped to their feet and
                  clambered upon their chairs to look up for the voice. Men trod upon each other and
                  climbed wildly towards the door to see the speaker who had thus come to the rescue
                  of the defense. Matthew fell helplessly against the table; conscious of all the
                  scene, but unable to move in his excitement.
               The lawyer alone stood quietly where he had been standing. He turned his head but
                  that was all. Bewildered, astounded, by this singular childish cry, he trembled
                  with the fears which overwhelmed him. The spell was broken. Was it an over excited
                  imagination responding to his too highly wrought picture which by this word,
                  intended for assent, had defeated his effort? Or was it an unexpected deliverance
                  for this almost hopeless case? A voice that had some truth to utter as yet unheard
                  and unknown.
               Under the intensest excitement, but preserving a calm exterior, the counsel waited
                  until by his direction the officers stationed in the gallery made search, and the
                  light form of the little cripple, who was weeping and wild with terror, was lifted
                  over the balustrade, and handed carefully down over the front of the gallery,
                  where he was received above the crowd; a hundred arms being outstretched from
                  below to meet him. Thence he was borne or rather passed along through the excited
                  throng, towards the witness' stand; where he was at length placed. Amazed and
                  terrified by the strange treatment he had received, and by the excitement which
                  his almost involuntary exclamation had occasioned, he now cowered down upon the
                  floor, shrinking from any touch and avoiding as best he could the wondering gaze
                  of the throng that hung over him from every side.
               As Matthew's counsel turned around to look down at this strange witness who had so
                  unexpectedly appeared, the prosecuting officer uttered half to himself, half
                  aloud, some sharp remark about "dramatic effect."
               "Silence!" said the quiet lawyer, speaking now for the first time in an elevated
                  voice. "Say what you think best, aloud, with your head up, when your turn comes,
                  but drop none of your hints and inuendoes. This is serious business."
               To these words, uttered in so imperious a tone by this calm and plain-spoken man,
                  the eloquent one had no reply to make. He sat playing with his package of papers
                  as if he had not heard what was said.
               "Mr. Officer," said the prisoner's counsel, who though his back was now turned
                  upon the jury, took care that they should hear all he said, "take the lad up to
                  the judge; if he knows any thing, we will hear it in good time."
               "Why, dear me," said the learned and eloquent counsel for the prosecution,
                  addressing his learned friend, "you do n't expect to swear that child, do you? He
                  can't know any thing, not even the nature of an oath."
               "If he knows the nature of an oath," retorted the other, "he will be sworn. Then
                  if he knows any thing about the case he will tell it, and I shall make what I can
                  of it, and if he does n't, he won't, and you can make what you can of that.
                  Meantime, gentlemen," he continued, addressing dressing the jury, "if you will indulge me for a
                  few moments, I will go on with my witnesses. I had just finished what I was
                  intending to say when I was interrupted."
               While this by-play was going on, the child was lifted again, and brought to the
                  steps that ascended to the judicial platform. Holding on by the officer's hand he
                  climbed the steps, and in a moment he stood by the side of the judge's chair, and
                  behind the judge's long desk, where only his thin face and broad collar were
                  visible to the thousand Eyes which now fascinated him as they had before
                  fascinated the prisoner.
               There was a few minutes' pause while the judge, in an undertone, conversed with
                  the child, and the counsel put a few hurried questions to his client. Both judge
                  and counsel arrived in a few moments at very nearly the same result, viz.: that
                  the child was a near neighbor of Mr. Harsford's, that he knew him and knew the
                  prisoner, and that he knew, or might know, some circumstances which would bear
                  upon the case. Matthew, who felt that consciousness of innocence which assured him
                  that whatever Benny might know, it was far more likely to tell in his favor than
                  against him, was eager to have the child examined. And accordingly, when the
                  judge, raising his head and addressing the counsel, said:
               "The child seems to have knowledge of some facts which may have a bearing upon the
                  case, and I should think you would do well to examine him,"
               —the counsel replied:—
               "It is precisely what we wish, if your honor pleases; and I think we will see what
                  he knows first, and then if it proves unimportant it will not interrupt the course
                  of the testimony I had proposed to introduce."
               "One moment! if the court please," interrupted the eloquent friend; "before that
                  child is examined I should be glad to have him questioned as to the nature of the
                  oath he is to take. He looks young and not over intelligent. I hardly think he can
                  be competent."
               "I scarcely think it can be necessary,"—the judge was commencing,—when Matthew's
                  counsel interposed.
               "Oh! I trust your honor will put the boy to all proper tests as to his competency.
                  It will be more satisfactory I think to both sides."
               "What is your name, my lad?" said the judge, acquiescing in the request thus
                  preferred, and turning towards Benny.
               "Temple, sir. Benjamin Temple."
               "And you live, you say, near Mr. Harsford's house?"
               "I used to, sir, right against his back garden, before mother died."
               "Do you know what an oath is?"
               "Yes, sir," said the child; "it is swearing."
               "Do you ever swear?"
               "No, sir," said the boy; "it is wicked."
               "Who told you it was wicked?"
               "My mother, sir,—and Miss Harsford."
               "Did you know that when they want witnesses to tell the truth they have them take
                  an oath?"
               "Yes, sir, I knew that."
               "Who told you that?"
               "Mother told me."
               
               "When did she tell you?"
               "Why, they had a court trial about me once, sir. It was when I hurt my leg. Mother
                  went down to court to tell them how I got hurt, and you see, sir, she said it was
                  Tuesday, and she really thought it was Tuesday, sir; she really thought so; but
                  after she got home I reminded her; I reminded her that it was Wednesday. Then she
                  was afraid that it was a perjury. So she had to go down to the court afterwards to
                  tell the court it was Wednesday. But the court said it was no matter. That was how
                  I came to know, sir. Mother told me all about it."
               "What did she tell you?"
               "Oh, she told me about the court, and about the judge, and how they got a Bible
                  for her, and gave her an oath to tell the truth, and how wrong it was for her to
                  tell any thing that was n't true."
               "Do you know what a lie is?"
               "Oh, yes, sir. It is telling what is n't true on purpose."
               "Is it right or wrong to tell lies?"
               "Oh! it is wrong, sir. Did n't you know that?"
               "Suppose you should tell a lie; what would happen to you?"
               "God would punish me," said the child, solemnly.
               "Suppose I should give you an oath here and now to tell the truth, and you should
                  tell a lie, what would happen to you then?"
               "God would punish me," said the child, "and the policemen would take me up, and
                  make perjury of me. But I should n't do so."
               "You may swear him," said the judge, leaning back in his chair.
               And the clerk administered the oath, and seated Benny in a chair upon the witness'
                  stand.
               "Now, my lad," said Matthew's counsel, stepping up as near the witness' stand as
                  he could easily get, "do you see these twelve gentlemen here?"
               "Yes, sir," said Benny.
               "Well, they want to know all about Mr. Harsford,—every thing. Never mind any body
                  else, but just these gentlemen in the yellow chairs. Do n't be afraid of any
                  thing. Nobody will hurt you. All you have got to do is to tell the truth, and if
                  it helps us any, everybody will be much obliged to you. Now, in the first place,
                  tell me how old you are."
               "I am almost ten, sir," replied the child, in a low and timid voice.
               "I am afraid you do n't speak quite loud enough, Benjamin. Look over to that
                  gentleman in the white coat, sitting in the furthest chair—do you see him?"
               Benny looked along in the direction in which the lawyer pointed, and saw an
                  elderly-looking man in a light-colored gray cloak. He was the furthest removed of
                  all the jurors from where Benny sat.
               "Yes, sir."
               "Well, I want him, very much, to hear all you say. Speak as if you thought he was
                  a little deaf, and you wanted to be sure and make him hear."
               Benny raised his voice instinctively, and almost without knowing it, and spoke now
                  quite distinctly;
               
               "I am almost ten years old now, sir," he repeated.
               "Where do you live, Benjamin?"
               "I do n't live hardly any where now, sir. Miss Harsford is taking care of me,
                  until she can find a place for me to live."
               "How long has Miss Harsford taken care of you?"
               "Ever since my mother died, sir."
               "How long ago did your mother die?"
               "Oh, it was about—a good while ago, sir. It was just after Mr. Harsford's
                  burying."
               "Has Miss Harsford been taking care of you ever since then?"
               "Yes sir," said the child.
               "And where did you live before your mother died?"
               "I lived with my mother, sir."
               "Did she take good care of you?"
               "Oh! yes; I 'm sure she did."
               "Where abouts did you live, when you lived with your mother?"
               "We lived right opposite Mr. Harsford's back garden, sir."
               "Did you ever see Mr. Harsford?"
               "Yes sir."
               "Where have you seen him?"
               "Oh, I have seen him walking in his garden, sir; and I have seen him at his
                  office, when I went to sell papers; and once I held his horse for him in front of
                  his house, and he gave me two pennies, and he asked me how I was going to 'vest
                  'em, or something, and then he laughed, because I said I did n't know what he
                  meant."
               "Did you ever see this gentleman before?" asked the counsel, pointing to
                  Matthew.
               "Oh yes sir. He is Mr. Caraby."
               "When have you ever seen him?"
               "Oh, I have seen him at Mr. Harsford's office, and he went up to my mother's, and
                  I saw him in Broadway one night, and I guess I 've seen him some other times
                  besides. Mother used to wash clothes for him."
               "Did you know Mr. Harsford was dead?"
               "Yes sir."
               "Well now, Benjamin, tell these gentlemen all you know about Mr. Harsford's
                  dying."
               Benny hesitated.
               "I do n't know any thing about it, sir," he said, "not any thing that I know
                  of."
               "Do n't you know any thing about it, at all?"
               "No sir. I do n't think I do."
               The counsel paused a few moments, to try to gain some clue for further
                  questioning.
               At length he resumed.
               "Did any body tell you to come here this morning?" he asked.
               "No sir," said the child; "they told me not to come."
               "Who told you not to come?"
               "Miss Harsford told me I 'd better not come. But I told her I wanted to come very
                  much, and she said I might come if I chose; but she advised me not to. She was
                  afraid I 'd get crowded, and hurt my foot."
               "But you decided to come, did you, notwithstanding?"
               
               "Yes, sir."
               "What made you want to come?"
               "I wanted to see a court, sir."
               "Was that all the reason?"
               "Yes, sir; except I thought I should like to see Mr. Caraby's court."
               "Did any body say any thing to persuade you to come?"
               "No, sir, I persuaded myself."
               "Who did you come with?"
               "I came with some boys I knew up there, sir, (pointing to the gallery,) because I
                  did n't know the way."
               "Oh, you came with those boys, did you? and did they get you a seat up there?"
               "No sir, they crowded me off the seat, and I fell down."
               "Are you the boy who spoke out up in the gallery just now?"
               "Yes, sir. I am very sorry. I will never do so again."
               "Oh! it was no harm, Benjamin. You must not think we find any fault with you.
                  Think a minute, now. What was it you said? Tell me it over again."
               "I said, 'That was it, sir. That was it, for I saw him.'"
               "Well now, Benjamin, tell us what it was that you saw."
               "I saw him fixing the cigar, sir,—just as you said. Pulling it open and putting a
                  powder in it, and rolling it up again."
               "You saw that?"
               "Yes, sir."
               "Well now, Benjamin, I want you to tell these gentlemen just what you saw; all
                  about it."
               "Well, sir, you see my mother was sick, and I staid up 'most all night because I
                  was afraid to go to bed, and because she wanted me to give her the water to drink,
                  and so I kept going to the window to see if it was n't beginning to be morning,
                  because you see, sir, we had n't any candles. So while I was at the window, Mr.
                  Harsford came to the window; and—"
               "Stop a moment; what window did Mr. Harsford come to, the same one you were
                  at?"
               "No sir, his study window over in his house. And he opened his window and looked
                  out. He stood looking out a good while, and I watched him."
               "What did you watch him for?"
               "Because I was thinking whether if he should look over at me, I should dare to
                  halloo out and ask him to tell me what time it was. You see I wanted to know very
                  much what time it was, because my mother was so sick. Well, sir, then he staid
                  there a good while, and looking out to see if it was n't most morning I suppose,
                  or else to get himself cool, I do n't know which, and then—and then he fixed the
                  cigar, sir, and then he went back, and that is all I know, sir."
               "Stop a moment, Benjamin, we shall want you to tell us a little more about this.
                  How did you see him so well? Was n't it dark?"
               "Why you see, sir, it was pretty dark in our house, because we had n't any
                  candles; but Mr. Harsford had his
                  gas-light burning, and so the light shone on him very bright, and so I could see
                  him very plain."
               "Did you see him have a cigar?"
               "Yes, sir. After he had stood there a good while he took it out of his pocket. At
                  first I did n't know what it was, but then he put the end of it in his mouth, and
                  I saw it was a cigar. Then he unfastened it somehow with his penknife, and spread
                  it out pretty flat, and then laid it down somehow, and then he pinched up
                  something with his thumb and finger and sprinkled it in, and then he rolled it up
                  and went away; and that is all I know, sir."
               
               These details of Benny's narrative were sufficient to bring an entire revulsion of
                  feeling over Matthew's mind, already over-strained with the long-continued
                  pressure of anxiety and excitement. He sank backwards in his chair utterly unable
                  to notice or understand any thing more than that the truth was revealed. As a man
                  falls backwards, dazzled and blinded by a sudden flash of lightning in the night,
                  so Matthew's powers of mind seemed over-whelmed and quenched for the time by this
                  brilliant gleam which thus shot down and dissipated forever the darkness and
                  mystery in which he had stood involved. He was dimly conscious of a light of
                  surprise and pleasure dancing in the thousand Eyes around him; of some further
                  questions put to little Benny; of some little discussion between the judge and
                  counsel; of some further formal proceedings; of somebody's saying, "What's the
                  matter, what's the matter?" of a call for water; and that his counsel
                  was bathing his forehead; of somebody's asking if he felt better; of somebody 's
                  saying "Not Guilty" in a loud, official voice; of a great rising and confusion of
                  people getting up to go out; of many people crowding around him, and shaking hands
                  with him, and wishing him joy, and others saying "Do n't crowd him so much,
                  gentlemen, let him have a little more air;" of the judge coming down from his
                  desk, and saying he was very glad the truth was found out in time; of his counsel
                  asking him where he lived; of his saying "at Mrs. Hopley's," which only seemed to
                  puzzle them; of his being helped into a carriage, with Mrs. Hopley and Roselle on
                  the other seat, and the president of the insurance company at his side;—but when
                  he was safely seated on the sofa, in one of the little rooms which Mrs. Hopley had
                  secured for him and Roselle, with his sister by his side, and the good widow
                  bustling about to get some tea, then he began to understand how it all was.
               A day or two passed before he sufficiently recovered from the excitement of these
                  scenes to feel really like himself again, or to enter upon the details of any plan
                  for the future. But the main outline of his purpose was already fixed. Indeed,
                  from the first hour when he began to realize, in prison, that he might be
                  released, this purpose sprang and grew up intertwined with his hopes, and
                  inseparable from them.
               Now that his hopes had been so amply fulfilled, and he found himself vindicated,
                  beyond all doubt or question, against the charge under which he had nearly
                  despaired, it was with great joy that he looked forward again without out uncertainty to his purpose. There
                  was but one shadow upon that joy. The shadow was the thought of the lonely,
                  bereaved, and beggared condition of the widow and daughter of Mr. Harsford. Of
                  James, he then thought but little; but his mind constantly reverted to the
                  darkness which enveloped the earthly future of Charlotte and her mother, and the
                  pain which a natural sympathy would cause him was peculiarly heightened by the
                  peculiar relation which his fortunes had borne to theirs.
               It was easy to resolve, as he did, to share with them the prosperity which he was
                  determined to earn; but it was not so easy to decide how he should offer them
                  assistance, after he should have acquired the means of so doing.
               But there were matters of more immediate solicitude.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               BETTER A BAD BEGINNING AND A GOOD ENDING, THAN A GOOD BEGINNING AND
                  A BAD ENDING.
               THE first step on which Matthew decided, after the trial, was to return with
                  Roselle. If his trial had left doubt in the public mind as to his innocence, he
                  would have been strongly impelled to remain in the city and face the obloquy, but,
                  as it was, he could leave with a fair name, and Roselle's wishes and a certain
                  other consideration induced him, at least, to postpone fixing his residence in the
                  city.
               But before he left town, he received a letter addressed in a strange hand. It was
                  a simple business letter, to the mind of the writer; but it would be hard to
                  measure the sensations with which Matthew read it, or Roselle heard it. It was a
                  brief letter from a lawyer at the West, communicating the fact that about a month
                  previous their father had died leaving a large property, which, it was the object
                  of the writer to suggest, Matthew should claim. Those in whose hands the custody
                  of the estate was, were evidently intending to make the most of their position,
                  and Matthew's interests required immediate attention.
               For years, the father's name had been scarcely mentioned tioned. between the children, his existence had
                  been almost nothing to them, yet now, that natural and irrepressible affection
                  that his indifference and neglect had repulsed, broke forth in deep grief. Years
                  of neglect could not entirely efface from their generous natures the instinct that
                  now mourned his loss and cherished his memory. As for the property, they had read
                  the letter many times with tears, before Matthew began to calculate about that,
                  and then his calculations were somewhat singular.
               "You must go West immediately," said Roselle.
               "Very soon," replied Matthew, "but not immediately. There are some other things to
                  do first. It was a month ago, he says. There is nothing to do now but to see to
                  the property. That is important, but there are—"
               "Ah! I can finish the sentence for you. You think there are things of more
                  importance than that."
               Roselle could not see, so Matthew blushed with impunity.
               "Yes," said he, "I will go and see Miss Harsford. I have wanted to see her before
                  we left town. Now I will go."
               "And Arabella?" said Roselle, inquiringly.
               "Ah! I forgot to tell you last night when I came in. This letter put our
                  conversation all out of my head. I went to the house where she had been staying,
                  but she had gone home."
               Whether Arabella thought that it was fair that Matthew should take as much pains
                  to see her now that he was free, as she had taken to see him when he was in
                  prison, or whether she felt that having once so irresistibly assured him of
                  her constancy she should better please him by awaiting him quietly at Enneton than
                  by meeting him again in the city, I can not say; but she had already flitted home,
                  and when Matthew had gone to see her in Brooklyn he found nothing but a note.
               On the same day with this conversation, Matthew went to the Harsford mansion to
                  see Charlotte. He found the house in disorder. Creditors were rapidly undermining
                  the old home, and already the day was set when it should fall about its inmates in
                  the ruin of a sheriff's auction.
               The sight of Matthew, overpowered Charlotte with the painful thoughts that were
                  inseparably connected in her mind with him. She was still more affected when he
                  spoke.
               "Miss Harsford," he said, "I thought I could not leave the city without seeing
                  you."
               "I assure you," replied the young girl, "I thank you for coming. These are
                  terrible scenes. They stupefy me."
               "You will believe me," said Matthew, after a pause, "when I try to say how much I
                  have thought of your distress, and how sincere a pleasure it would give me if I
                  could be of any assistance to you."
               "None, I thank you. I believe there is nothing that can be done. We shall leave
                  here very soon. Mother is going to her sister's in Philadelphia. They have invited
                  her to make her home there. They are all very kind to us. There is nothing that
                  can be done."
               "And James?"
               "Ah! do you not know? He has gone. He went day before yesterday. He has gone on a voyage. He
                  went suddenly, and he will be gone a long time I fear."
               "And you are left alone?"
               "Oh, no. I am going to Grandfather's at the Mills."
               "And is there nothing—"
               "There is nothing, Mr. Caraby."
               "I thought if I could do any thing you could not confer a greater pleasure upon me
                  than by permitting me to do it. The thought that you would not hesitate would give
                  me great satisfaction."
               "Ah, Matthew," she exclaimed, "pardon me if the associations of these scenes make
                  me appear different from what I ought. I understand your kindness. I should not
                  hesitate to ask you if there was any thing left to be done. But I am going away. I
                  want to get away from all these scenes and every thing that reminds me of
                  them."
               "Well," said Matthew, as he rose to go, "I am glad to hear what you have said, for
                  I am largely indebted to you, and I hope very soon to have the means of paying
                  you. You and your mother."
               "What!"
               In answer to Charlotte's exclamation Matthew explained the means he had resorted
                  to to procure a defense, and that he had succeeded by defeating the insurances.
                  "Now," continued he, "I have just been informed that I have some property left me,
                  and I am glad, for I can do soon what I did not expect to be able to do for some
                  time,—make it good to you, in part at least."
               Charlotte, without understanding a great deal about business, saw clearly enough
                  that however generous such a course might be, there was no justice in it.
               "No," said she, "you owe us nothing. The debt is the other way. The question is
                  settled now, I suppose, and you have saved us the labor and expense of asserting a
                  claim which we could not maintain. I can not hear of any such plan. It is very
                  generous in you to purpose it, but I should be wrong to let you think of it.
                  Please never to mention it again. I thank you from my heart for your kindness; but
                  there is no need of any thing of the sort. The less I have to remind me of this
                  past month the sooner Time will help my trouble. Goodbye."
               "Poor girl!" said Matthew, as he went away, "I am afraid she will never find much
                  happiness in any thing I can do."
               Matthew was in some degree mistaken. It was true that Charlotte had been so
                  shocked by the fate which had overtaken their family, and bewildered by being left
                  alone and penniless, that every thing that served to fasten her thoughts upon that
                  fate rekindled the pain which it inflicted, and she was relieved when Matthew left
                  her presence. Yet she was not indifferent to his sympathy and kindness, and was
                  prepared without hesitation to call upon his friendship in any exigency in which
                  his assistance might be needed.
               Mrs. Harsford was soon established with her relatives, where she lived some years
                  a quiet and retired life, occasionally receiving visits from her daughter, and she
                     was gladdened once before her death
                  by the return of her son.
               As Charlotte had given Matthew to understand, James Glovering had run away to sea.
                  And that was the end of him, you think? Not at all. Rather, it was the beginning.
                  For I have noticed that of all good beings with bad reputations, this same sea is
                  the best, with the worst. She is rated as idle, useless, cruel, treacherous. The
                  landsmen, being in the majority upon the earth, have it all their own way about
                  her reputation; and all unite to deplore her doings, while they wonder at her
                  power. To her they attribute all the indolence and immoralities of the shore, and
                  her name they put as the symbol of all deceitful cunning, and heartless, pitiless
                  force.
               But after all, the sea is your true reformer. Other reformers scheme and
                  theorize;—constantly settle principles, but rarely descend to individual want and
                  welfare. But the sea agitates to a purpose. Just as she patiently absorbs and
                  washes up all the debris of the coast, and maintains herself a perpetual fountain
                  of purity for shore and atmosphere, just so she takes upon her motherly bosom all
                  the delinquents of all the land, and maintains a perpetual school for their
                  instruction and reformation. She never complains of the pupils we send her, but
                  takes them as they come, scum and dregs. All the indolent boys, and all the bad
                  boys; all the ignorant boys, and all the rash, adventurous boys; all the boys who
                  are so fond of excitement that they can not be kept in bounds on the land, and all
                  the boys who are so a to exertion that they can not be made to
                     ea on the land where it 's not so plenty as at sea; all the
                  boys whose parents can not manage them, and all the boys who have no parents to
                  manage them,—in short, all hard and hopeless cases for whom the earth seems to
                  have no further chance, and whom terra firma rejects indignantly, the sea takes
                  up, kindly. She has a hope for every one. God be thanked for her! And if she does
                  not reform them all, she keeps her pupils for the most part out of mischief,
                  except in vacation time when they get ashore again, and again go astray. But a
                  goodly portion she does work wonders with. They come home from time to time. She
                  sends them, to show their progress. They come robust in health, that went puny and
                  debilitated. They come active and enduring, that went indolent and shrinking. They
                  come clear sighted, that went with dim, aching eyes. They come men of decision,
                  that went uncertain and irresolute. They come open palmed and generous, that went
                  with close fists. And some come reverent, humble and prayerful, that went profane
                  and Godless.
               And James Glovering has gone to sea. Then there is some hope of James Glovering
                  after all.
               The same night after Matthew's interview with Charlotte, he started with Roselle
                  up the river. If fidelity were the only virtue of the historian it would become my
                  duty to pause and give an account of the journey in order that it might prove as
                  tedious to the reader as it did to Matthew. It will suffice, however, to ignore
                  distance and time, as he would have done if he could, and wait for him at
                  Enneton.
               
               Arabella was at home. A bright fire blazed in the family room. Grandmother sat in
                  the corner, which of late had become her home as it were—a home within a home.
                  Arabella's seat was at the center-table, where lay her writing desk and an open
                  volume. She herself was oftener at the window than in her seat. When she looked
                  towards the village it was because she was expecting her father from the Post
                  office. When she looked the other way, down the road, it must have been because
                  she wondered whose sleigh-bells those were, jingling so merrily in the distance.
                  In the course of the half hour that she spent after tea, this evening, alternately
                  at the window and at her seat, she heard several sleighs approach. The slow
                  jogging bells seemed to have no attraction for her. The quick ringing bells made
                  her heart beat quick; and when at last, after many disappointments, there suddenly
                  came within hearing, a chime of bells quicker, merrier, more dashing and dancing
                  than all before, and the crack of the whip and the sound of the runners skimming
                  over the hard road, and the horse's feet rattling helter skelter over the little
                  bridge below the yard, were heard, the very speed of the approaching traveler
                  inspired Arabella's hope, and up went the window, and she looked out just in time
                  to see this reckless driver dashing around the corner into the yard, and stopping
                  short, at the very last instant, against the piazza.
               I said the traveler stopped—I was wrong. Strictly speaking it was only the horse
                  and sleigh that stopped, and barely in time too; but the traveler leaped from his
                  seat and ran up the steps with the same momentum with which he had been riding,
                  and at the same instant Arabella, opening the front door, found herself clasped in
                  his arms.
               Many eccentric things may be pardoned in one who is in love, it is said. As for
                  Matthew, the excuse was doubled and twisted strong for him. Life and liberty had
                  suddenly been thrust upon him, and with them came the revival of a once
                  disappointed affection. Into whatever enthusiastic excesses he may have run on
                  this occasion, you and I would have looked on, not with the embarrassment of
                  superfluous third parties, but with all the joy and sympathy of
                  congratulation.
               After all this, when Mr. Mayes came in a little while later, it is not to be
                  supposed that Arabella had any longer any occasion for asking him if he had
                  brought her a letter.
               That was a long evening by the clock, though a very short one by the heart.
                  Indeed, this allowance should be made, that the evening began late. In the first
                  place, there was a warm greeting in the cold hall, and this took longer than you
                  would suppose, owing to the young people having entirely forgotten that it was the
                  hall, or cold either; then there was a greeting with grandmother, which was long,
                  because she wanted to hear all about it right away, but was hard of hearing and
                  could not, which infirmity happily saved Matthew from being sent back, in
                  imagination, to prison for the rest of the night; and then there was a warming
                  before the big fire, where Matthew sat in a great arm-chair, with its ruddy smile
                  upon his feet, taking out the frosty air from them, and with his face turned toward Arabella, who sat at his side
                  and looked up into his face, and her radiant smile was upon his heart, he felt it
                  there; and then she accidentally made the discovery, as they sat there quietly,
                  that his hands were cold,—nothing very remarkable about that,—but it caused a
                  great deal of rubbing and chafing of his hands, in turn, between her soft warm
                  palms, to which Matthew submitted with, I must say, a very good grace. All this
                  took place amid the most lively conversation. Then Mr. Mayes came in, and there
                  was a diversion of thought for another greeting, and a consultation about the
                  horse, which he proceeded to take in charge. Then came supper, in which some of
                  Arabella's coffee, with cream of Enneton, and smoking hot biscuit, with the butter
                  and honey of Enneton, completed for Matthew the comfort, which both enjoyed with
                  grateful hearts; and with all this it was nearly nine o'clock when they were
                  seated by the fire again to begin the short evening which remained.
               A day or two after this scene Matthew went West, where he remained a short time,
                  and secured the just interests of his family there. He found that his father's
                  second wife had died several years before, and as there had been no children of
                  that wife, the estate devolved to Matthew, and his brothers and sister. The
                  inquiries which he instituted, and in which Mr. Sneyer exerted his best abilities
                  for once on a pleasant errand, to discover Matthew's brothers, were unsuccessful.
                  George, who had been sent abroad, as already mentioned, had perished on the
                  voyage. Charles has never yet been heard from. But if he should read this book,
                  let me assure him that if he will send his address to Mr. Matthew Caraby at
                  Harsford's Mills, "he will hear of something to his advantage."
               In course of time there was a wedding party at Mr. Mayes', and Arabella Mayes
                  became Mrs. Matthew Caraby. For several years Matthew made visits to the West, as
                  the business of the estate required, but he did not remove thither. Though he has
                  never said it to his friends, I conjecture that he might have gone, had it not
                  been for Roselle, who would find it a great task to acquire in a strange community
                  that familiarity with persons and things which was necessary to make her home a
                  happy one. A little time before the wedding Matthew went into business at
                  Harsford's Mills. He had found that Mr. Japhet Sackett, considering that he had
                  all his life postponed pleasure to business, was now desirous to give pleasure the
                  preference for the rest of his days. In other words, he was disposed to sell out.
                  As Matthew was familiar with the business, and knew himself to be capable to
                  conduct it with advantage, a bargain between them was soon struck. A new sign soon
                  announced to the villagers that Matthew Caraby had succeeded Japhet Sackett. And
                  as Matthew possessed the rare faculty of uniting pleasure with business, and of
                  entertaining both these guests at once, he not only prospered surprisingly, but
                  enjoyed himself highly in his new employment. He is now a rich man for Harsford's
                  Mills. He still lives in the little white cottage in which he first commenced
                  house-keeping, and his front door yard is now usually ornamented with one or two, or sometimes three
                  young Carabys; and the lavish manner in which crackers and squibs are fired
                  outside of that house on the Fourth of July is only exceeded by the profuseness
                  with which stockings are hung up within the house on Christmas Eve.
               Roselle lives with her brother. It has been found that nothing can be done for her
                  sight. But Matthew has bought her the best piano he could find, and she has a
                  whole library of books in raised letters. She spent a year at an asylum for the
                  purpose of learning some arts and occupations which she could not be taught at
                  home; and now she has a hundred means of occupying herself with enjoyment, and
                  increasing the happiness of those around her. She is the self-appointed teacher
                  and governess of the young Carabys, and there proves to be one advantage in
                  placing children under the teaching of a blind girl;—she must teach them to do
                  right without being watched.
               The Widow Hopley yet lives, and thrives, and flourishes. One of the first things
                  which Matthew did with wealth was to set her up in a new baking establishment at
                  the old stand, with money enough to be independent of everybody but customers.
                  When Matthew and Arabella go to New York they always pay her a visit, and on their
                  return she always loads them with wafer cakes, ginger-snaps and the like, for
                  certain juvenile friends of hers at Harsford's Mills.
               I shall not tell the reader what became of Benny, nor give any idea of the
                  fortunes and destiny of Marie Montecabella. How Matthew insisted upon relieving
                  Charlotte lotte of the charge of Benny's maintenance,—how he took him to live in
                  his own household,—how he caused a simple surgical operation to be performed which
                  nearly removed his lameness,—how he sent him to school at the Mills,—how stout and
                  brown Benny grew up to be,—how he is to go into the store next summer,—how it is
                  his secret ambition to "go apprentice to a painter" when Mr. Caraby removes to New
                  York, as Benny verily believes he one day will,—how Matthew and his wife brought
                  Marie to their house one autumn for a winter's schooling,—how much she and Benny
                  studied together,—how they devised an innocent plan of epistolary correspondence
                  for their mutual improvement in chirography and composition,—of all these things,
                  and the things which they foreshadow, I shall not now speak; though I know they
                  would be very interesting.
               Charlotte found a happy employment in teaching. She began quietly, by taking a
                  district school, much to the surprise of everybody. Her success was such, that
                  when people began to talk about establishing a High School, of which she should be
                  the principal, everybody wondered why Harsford's Mills never had a High School
                  before; and everybody thought it was a capital idea. There was the very building,
                  too, the old Bank, which had been through various vicissitudes since it left off
                  being a Bank and became an honest building. There were some who thought it would
                  prove too small, and they were right, as the event proved; but it was a capital
                  place to begin in; besides, being vacant now, it was obtained by the new High
                  School committee on favorable terms. As for Matthew, some talkative people were of opinion that
                  he was very backward in this work and did not make himself as conspicuous as he
                  ought. To tell the truth, nobody seemed to know who first started the idea of the
                  High School, and everybody wondered how the committee succeeded in raising such
                  unheard of sums for its foundation. If Matthew knew any thing about that, Matthew
                  knew how to keep his own counsel, I suppose.
               Whether Charlotte formed any conjectures upon this point I am not prepared to say;
                  but this I know, that there was no one among all the visitors that came to her new
                  halls, that she received with such peculiar gratification as she did Matthew and
                  Arabella in their frequent visits; and there was no one else whose presence
                  elicited from her eyes those two twin tears of gratitude and joy which were the
                  unseen tribute she paid in silence to his presence.
               As for Charlotte, the cares of her work sat lightly upon her. Such was the
                  affection she inspired in her pupils and her assistants that I verily believe she
                  thought it easier to teach than not to teach. As she grew in experience and
                  learning, she grew in grace, dignity and beauty.
               From time to time her brother James returns from sea, spending a few weeks on
                  shore between his voyages. The rough experiences of life at sea have somewhat
                  improved his character, and he is cordially welcomed by Charlotte, and for her
                  sake, if not for his own, by all her friends. In person he is much improved, being
                  grown stout and brown. When he arrives in New York Matthew goes down to bring him
                  straightway up to Harsford's Mills, that he may spend such time as he has at his
                  own control among friends who will take thought for his true welfare, and at a
                  distance from those temptations and dangers which the city thrusts before the
                  seaman when on shore. Matthew contrives many rural excursions and sports for the
                  amusement of the young sailor, and the two young men are often better companions
                  for each other than any one who had been witness of the memorable piazza scene
                  would ever have believed possible.
               Although Matthew assumed the principal charge of Benny's maintenance, Charlotte
                  never forgot the promise she had made to the dying mother. She watched his growth
                  and education with the kindest solicitude; and if he ever accomplishes his
                  ambition to be a great painter, he will owe quite as much to Charlotte's later
                  instructions as to his mother's early teachings.
               A year and more ago, Matthew and Arabella called at the High School on the first
                  day of the spring term. This time Aunt Roselle came with them, holding by the hand
                  Master Caraby, the oldest of Matthew's family, who was about to become the
                  youngest of Charlotte's pupils.
               "There, Miss Harsford," he said, after her greeting with the family was over,
                  "there he is. We did not intend to bring him till next fall, but," continued
                  Matthew, with the slightest possible air of humor, "we find that we must lose no
                  time if we would have him under your charge. So here he is."
               
               It takes a good deal to disturb the quiet self-possession of a good teacher; but
                  there was a perceptible embarrassment in Charlotte's smile as she replied, that
                  there was time enough yet; and she seemed to speak to Roselle and her new
                  pupil.
               "You will not think that I am not sorry that we are to lose you," said Matthew, as
                  they came away, "when I say that we wish you joy with our whole hearts, and all
                  the happiness which the brightest future promises you."
               What it was that was going to happen to Charlotte Harsford, and who was to gain
                  when "Harsford's Mills" lost, is something which I can not be expected to explain
                  here. I am not a shrewd man—not particularly shrewd. But I know too much to write
                  all I know in one book.
            
            
               THE RELIC.—AN EPILOGUE.
               ON a certain summer afternoon two young men walk leisurely upon the shore of a
                  Northern Lake. They are accoutered for a hunting excursion, but it is clearly an
                  expedition of pleasure merely; and nothing seems further from their thoughts, at
                  present, than hunting.
               One is tall and erect, the other short and slight of frame, yet well knit and
                  robust, and bronzed by exposure.
               They behold before them a lake which lies spread out in the valley of the
                  mountains. On the South this lake stretches away nearly as far as the eye can
                  reach. On the North it is surrounded by a dense forest, through which the road, by
                  which it appears these travelers have approached the spot where they stand, winds
                  along around the lake on the North-East side. Having left the road these young men
                  are now sauntering through the forest, towards the North, and not far distant from
                  the very shore of the lake.
               "Matthew!" says the shorter man, who walks with somewhat of the gait of a sailor,
                  "it might have been hereabouts that she reached the shore."
               "Yes, James," the other replies, "it might have been; though to my thought she perished on the ice. In
                  such a storm, how could she have reached the shore?"
               "Very possibly. Then there would be no trace left after the ice had thawed. That
                  may explain why all searching was in vain. I had not thought of that," responded
                  James.
               The two take seats in silence upon a fallen tree.
               They look through the somewhat sparse and scattered trees before them, upon the
                  water of the lake, which lies bright and shining beyond the edge of the forest,
                  and which is, to their imagination, at the moment, the tomb of her of whom they
                  speak.
               The Western Sun sinks downward, approaching the horizon. His beams, reflected from
                  the crest of every ripple on the surface of the lake before them, present a
                  thousand glittering points to their view.
               It may be imagination; but James thinks he sees another glittering point half hid
                  in the grasses and mosses upon the bank before them. He sits musing curiously upon
                  this dew-drop, or speck of shining stone, which appears in the side of a small
                  mound where the grass grows more soft and green than elsewhere around.
               He steps forward, in a musing, abstracted way, and mechanically searches for this
                  glittering point, whose glitter had vanished as he moved. He kneels before the
                  mound, to see more closely.
               A moment passes without voice or motion.
               "Matthew!" he exclaims, "come here!"
               His companion hastens to his side. As he draws near, James extends to him a
                  dust-incrusted ring, which they inspect in turn. It is a wedding ring. On its
                  inside surface they decipher the scarcely legible inscription:— 
                     
                        Alexander & Martha.
                  
               
               With gentle hands they search the mound in silence.
               Nothing but dust!
               This relic alone remains.
