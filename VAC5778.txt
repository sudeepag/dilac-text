            It was once said of a very charming and high-minded woman that to know her was in
               itself a liberal education; and we are inclined to set an almost equally high value
               on an acquaintance with the writings of "George Eliot." For those who read them
               aright they possess the faculty of educating in its highest sense, of invigorating
               the intellect, giving a healthy tone to the taste, appealing to the nobler feelings
               of the heart, training its impulses aright, and awakening or developing in every mind
               the consciousness of a craving for something higher than the pleasures and rewards of
               that life which only the senses realize, the belief in a destiny of a nobler nature
               than can be grasped by experience or demonstrated by argument. In reading them, we
               seem to be raised above the low grounds where the atmosphere is heavy and tainted,
               and the sunlight has to struggle through blinding veils of mist, and to be set upon
               the higher ranges where the air is fresh and bracing, where the sky is bright and
               clear, and where earth seems of less account than before and heaven more near at
               home. And as, by those who really feel the grandeur of mountain solitudes, a voice is
               heard speaking to the heart, which hushes the whispers in which vanity, and meanness,
               and self-interest are wont to make their petty suggestions, and as for them the
               paltry purposes of a brief and fitful life lose their significance in the presence of
               the mighty types of steadfastness and eternity by which they are surrounded, so, on
               those readers who are able to appreciate a lofty independence of thought, a rare
               nobility of feeling, and an exquisite sympathy with the joys and sorrows of human
               nature, "George Eliot's" writings can not fail to exert an invigorating and purifying
               influence, the good effects of which leave behind it a lasting impression.
            
               Boston Transcript.
            
            Few women—no living woman indeed—have so much strength as "George Eliot," and, more
               than that, she never allows it to degenerate into coarseness. With all her so-called
               "masculine" vigor, she has a feminine tenderness, which is nowhere shown more plainly
               than in her descriptions of children.
            
               Saturday Review.
            
            She looks out upon the world with the most entire enjoyment of all the good that
               there is in it to enjoy, and an enlarged compassion for all the ill that there is in
               it to pity. But she never either whimpers over the sorrowful lot of man, or snarls
               and chuckles over his follies and littlenesses and impotence.
            
               Macmillan's Magazine.
            
            In "George Eliot's" books the effect is produced by the most delicate strokes and the
               nicest proportions. In her pictures men and women fill the foreground, while thin
               lines and faint color show us the portentous clouds of fortune or circumstance
               looming in the dim distance behind them and over their heads. She does not paint the
               world as a huge mountain, with pigmies crawling or scrambling up its rugged sides to
               inaccessible peaks, and only tearing their flesh more or less for their pains. * * *
               Each and all of "George Eliot's" novels abound in reflections that beckon on the
               alert reader into pleasant paths and fruitful fields of thought.
            
               Spectator.
            
            "George Eliot" has Sir Walter Scott's art for revivifying the past. You plunge into
               it with as headlong an interest as into the present. For this she compensates by a
               wider and deeper intellectual grasp.
            
               Examiner.
            
            "George Eliot's" novels belong to the enduring literature of our country—durable, not
               for the fashionableness of its pattern, but for the texture of its stuff.

            ANTHONY TROLLOPE'S WORKS.
            Anthony Trollope's position grows more secure with every new work which comes from
               his pen. He is one of the most prolific of writers, yet his stories improve with time
               instead of growing weaker, and each is as finished and as forcible as though it were
               the sole production of the author.—N. Y. Sun.
            
            Mr. Trollope's characters are drawn with an outline firm, bold, strong. His
               side-thrusts at some of the lies which pass current in society are very
                  keen.—Congregationalist, Boston.

               CHAPTER I.
               ROUGE-ET-NOIR.
               THE music swelled joyously out again, and the dancers began their dizzy rounds
                  with the fresh energy inspired by Strauss's most bewitching waltz. The bright
                  toilets of the women, as usual, presented so odd a contrast to the sombre garb in
                  which custom arrays the masculine race on festive occasions, that a fanciful
                  person might have compared the scene to a troop of gaudy butterflies entangled in
                  the embrace of wicked black wasps, from which no effort of the filmy-winged
                  creatures could set them free.
               It was the ball-room at Baden Baden, so I need attempt no description; the
                  generality of people in this age of pilgrimages are as familiar with it as with
                  their own libraries—a good many of them more at home there, perhaps; and those to
                  whom fate has denied the privilege of absolutely standing within the enchanted
                  precincts, know it nearly as well from photographs, and the endless summer tours
                  wherewith travelers insist upon inflicting the public, in spite of loud and
                  prolonged remonstrances from that much-suffering body.
               Milly Crofton sat in the shadow of plump Mrs. Lawrence's voluminous draperies,
                  and, with the enviable faculty of eighteen, was able to admire the brilliant
                  spectacle, though she was only there for a short time as a looker-on. It was
                  fortunate that she had youth enough to find amusement so easily, otherwise the
                  last half hour might have dragged rather heavily; for Mrs. Lawrence had stumbled
                  on an old acquaintance, and the two were so deep in conversation about matters
                  which dated at least twenty years back, that neither the good-natured lady nor the
                  antiquated bean—long resigned to flesh and lumbago—remembered that they were
                  scarcely doing their duty by the young woman. But Milly bore the forgetfulness
                  patiently, in spite of the fact that patience did not rank among her chief
                  virtues, and that she belonged to a nation whereof the youth of both sexes are
                  popularly supposed to enforce their wishes and whims upon their elders without
                  compunction, and to find a ready submission on the part of the antiquated
                  generation.
               Milly was a charming specimen of the prettiest type of American girl: dazzling in
                  complexion, with a profusion of soft blonde hair, eager blue eyes like a child's,
                  a mouth which could pout or smile, perfect as to hands and feet, and with that
                  indescribable elegance which is a more fortunate gift even than beauty. I think
                  she is not exactly my heroine—certain dyspeptic critics insinuate that I have a
                  bad habit of not contenting myself with one—but I am very fond of her, and could
                  not resist these few words of personal description.
               There she sat, listening absently to the unwearied hum of Mrs. Lawrence's voice,
                  and the stuffy tones of the ancient beau, which sounded as if he spoke through
                  layers of turtle steak, and watching the dancers while her tiny feet unconsciously
                  kept time to the music. Presently two men paused by chance near the spot, and
                  continued an audible conversation in French, which roused another train of thought
                  in Milly's mind. One of the mustached creatures had just come from the
                  gaming-tables, a winner, it appeared, and his companion was endeavoring to
                  persuade him not to tempt Fate further on this occasion, but rest contented with
                  the brief favor she had shown.
               I am sorry to confess it, but straightway the Devil put a horrible idea into
                  Milly's soul—I wish I could say a new one, but the Devil had whispered that
                  thought on the first evening she set foot in the place, and during the last three
                  days had never grown tired of presenting it to her. Heretofore Conscience had
                  driven the tempter away without difficulty, but now, though a very well brought-up
                  young person. Milly grew a little tired of Conscience and her admonitions—you know
                  our best friends, unfortunately, are often somewhat wearisome! The ill-regulated
                  and improper longing to try her luck at the tables rose once more in Milly's
                  heart, growing stronger as she remembered—still the work of the imp, of
                  course—that tonight would be her final opportunity. In the morning she was to
                  return to the dullness of Vichy and the charge of her rightful chaperon, and the
                  gayety of Baden would appear like a dream.
               Milly did her best to struggle against the temptation, but most of us have
                  occasionally discovered that a prolonged combat with desires leaves us so
                  weakened, that in the end we are as had off
                  as if we had not fought at all—unless our guardian angels are kind enough, in
                  spite of the failure, to count the effort in our favor. This was Milly's case; she
                  began to feel really desperate. If she persevered in crucifying her own
                  inclinations, she should certainly go frantic with regret when too late. She tried
                  to be shocked at her own wickedness, but did not succeed very well. She remembered
                  her dignified aunt away off in New York, by whom she had been intrusted to the
                  care of some distant connections for these four months of wandering. The very idea
                  of Mrs. Remsen's horror, if she could see her at this moment, and know what was in
                  her mind, sent Milly into a fit of silent, nervous laughter. The Devil and
                  Conscience strove awhile longer, and once Conscience was near gaining an ally. The
                  ancient beau made an effort to depart—Milly saw it, and was half glad in the midst
                  of her disappointment, as she thought that now she should be put beyond the reach
                  of temptation. But Mrs. Lawrence unintentionally aided the Devil by detaining the
                  decrepit bean.
               "Don't leave us," she said, "we want to sit here; Milly enjoys watching the
                  dancers—don't you, Milly?"
               "Oh yes," Milly answered; then Conscience pricked her, and she added, "but don't
                  stay a moment on my account." This was a triumph, but a brief one, for her
                  monitor, because straightway the tempter offered Milly a hurried picture of the
                  green tables, the eager players, the flash of the gold pieces, while the tones of
                  the croupier rang in her ears, and the chink of the napoleons as they fell on the
                  board, and she said, breathlessly, "though I like being here, I could stay all
                  night."
               Conscience retired in disgust, probably feeling that nothing further could be done
                  to aid a young woman so hopelessly fascinated by the snares of the enemy.
               "Dear little Milly," Mrs. Lawrence said, patting the girl's shoulder with one
                  hand, while she held the beau fast with the other. "And so the story was true, Mr.
                  Noyse?"
               The antique sat down again. The pair plunged into a fresh torrent of talk, the
                  more absorbing because it was the raking up of an old scandal about some mutual
                  friend, and had to be whispered in order that it might not reach Milly's maiden
                  ears. They were good for half an hour—the young lady was certain of that. She
                  caught words enough to know of what they were talking: it was a fearfully long
                  story; she remembered having heard it whispered by cronies of her aunt's while she
                  was supposed to be busy with her drawing. Children hear every thing nowadays; the
                  mercy is that they do not comprehend; though the freedom with which they discuss
                  all sorts of subjects causes ill-natured people to give them credit for knowledge
                  which they are far from possessing.
               Now or never! If she slipped away at once, she could make her venture and get back
                  by the time the history ended. If she hesitated, this grand opportunity of doing
                  something preposterous and appalling was not likely to recur. She was quitting
                  Baden—almost on the eve of quitting Europe, and a return was not probable. It was
                  a misdemeanor so out of the common, and so fearful, that; now the instant for
                  decision had arrived, it looked perfectly irresistible. What a horribly delightful
                  secret to confide to her intimate friends when she reached home! They might be
                  able to tell of stolen interviews—mysterious flirtations—astute dupings of
                  maternal guardians—but how tame the records would sound in comparison to her own
                  exploit! Actually to have gambled at Baden and to have won—for she should win, she
                  knew that! She decided at once that, with the improper gains, she would purchase a
                  bracelet which she had lately admired—a marvelous beast with more legs than a
                  centipede, and as many eyes as Argus, only composed of rubies, and turquoises, and
                  various other stones, and no two eyes made of the same gems. What were insipid
                  flirtations, no matter how forbidden, to a wickedness like this?
               Oh, she must go—she should get wild if she waited another instant—that idea of
                  overwhelming her girlish friends by the confession of her enormity had been the
                  tempter's crowning stroke! She rose from her seat—whispered to Mrs. Lawrence that
                  she must seek the dressing-room because there was something wrong about her
                  multitudinous tresses. "Don't stir," she added; "it is only a step; I can get
                  there and back without any body's noticing me."
               The color flamed into her cheeks, and the words nearly choked her; for she was a
                  truthful little thing, and had not yet acquired the habit—only too common among
                  her elders—of acting lies. Mrs. Lawrence nodded, without pausing in her rapid
                  whispers, rather glad to have the girl absent for a time, because she had arrived
                  at the most exciting point of her narrative, and it required a great effort to
                  keep her voice sufficiently subdued, so that no syllable should reach her young
                  companion.
               Milly fled into the dressing-room first, because she knew that from thence she
                  could escape unperceived. I suppose that, at this juncture, conscience flew off
                  with a shriek from the contaminated purlieus of Baden. It is not probable there
                  could chance to be, at the same moment, two persons worth worrying over in that
                  home of dangerous delights; so, after this dismal failure, there was nothing left
                  for Conscience but to fly away to her celestial home, and weep over the downfall
                  of humanity.
               Milly allowed herself no leisure to think; she drew her white opera-cloak more
                  closely over her shoulders, and sped on so eager to gain the goal of what she
                  considered her diabolical desires, that each room seemed a thousand miles long,
                  and the green tables a whole world away. Poor little Milly—I mean, wicked little
                  Milly—it was very wrong; but, at the risk of appearing to encourage the younger
                  generation in impropriety, for the life of me, I can not help laughing ing at the
                  importance which the transgression assumed in her eyes. Nor was the freak in the
                  least in keeping with her usual conduct. She had a genuine dislike, growing out of
                  her thorough delicacy, to any thing that looked "fast," or sensational. She had
                  led the quietest possible life, under the care of a relative far stricter in her
                  ideas than modern guardians in general. She had read few of the romances which are
                  only too much in vogue; daily newspapers—those curses of American homes—she had
                  been taught to avoid; indiscriminate intimacies with girls of her own age were
                  even unknown to her. In numberless ways, she was fresher and more child-like than
                  most damsels of eighteen. Even her heart had never, in the slightest degree,
                  awakened, and so helped her on toward the tumultuous season of womanhood. She had
                  never had experience of a single flirtation; never found a temporary hero, except
                  in books; and, usually, her heroes were evolved out of the wise histories Aunt
                  Eliza had obliged her to read. I am quite aware that she will appear a very tame,
                  uninteresting animal to young ladies learned in the lessons acquired out of hours,
                  in boarding-schools, familiar with dramatic novels, and accustomed to criticise
                  plays from the Gymnase. But I must write down the facts as they really were, even
                  at the risk of depriving this one instance of depravity, on Milly's part, of all
                  interest in the minds of the youth of to-day.
               This very visit to Europe had been made under circumstances which would have
                  denuded the idea of any charm, to most girls, and rendered the reality an
                  unendurable penance. The Crittendons were distant connections of Mrs. Remsen's;
                  and, the previous winter, Mrs. Crittendon had suffered from a tedious illness,
                  during which Milly had so often cheered the invalid by her bright presence, that
                  when, in the spring, the physicians ordered a sea-voyage, and a sojourn of two
                  months at Vichy, Milly's society had been begged as a great favor. It would be a
                  dull, stupid undertaking, old Mr. Crittendon confessed; but he pleaded so
                  earnestly, that Milly could not have refused had the stupidity presented itself
                  ever so strongly to her imagination.
               She had a week's sojourn in Paris, a little wandering about Germany, then Mrs. 
                     Crittondon
                     Crittendon
                   was seized with an acute return of her malady, and they hastened at once
                  to the Baths. The time had not hung heavily on Milly's hands; she had no
                  excitement, made few acquaintances; but every thing was so new and strange, that
                  the quiet sojourn did not fill her with the weariness and disgust which they would
                  have roused in the bosoms of many of her sex.
               It was the first week in August now; only a fortnight before, Mrs. Lawrence,
                  having indulged in one of her frequent visits to Europe, strayed into Vichy, and
                  proposed taking Milly, for a few days, to Baden. Mrs. Crittendon was much better;
                  and both she and her husband insisted that the invitation should be accepted.
                  Milly had private doubts of her aunt's approval—if that lady could know she was to
                  be trusted to the care of Minerva Lawrence—for, in spite of her wise baptismal
                  appellation, and her forty-five years; in spite, too, of her having been, from
                  childhood, Mrs. Remsen's friend, that dignified person had a very slight opinion
                  of Minerva's wisdom and prudence. However, it was not a case for Milly's decision,
                  and she submitted with a good grace to that of her elders, wild with delight at
                  the idea of seeing the famous place, and certain that Mrs. Lawrence would prove an
                  agreeable companion, if not a trustworthy chaperon.
               And this was the result! In her most insane visions—if a mind so well regulated
                  could be supposed to indulge in such—Mrs. Remsen would never have dreamed of
                  Milly's sinking into so deep a pit, even under Minerva Lawrence's guardianship. It
                  is difficult to see how the good soul could be blamed; but this would not have
                  saved her from condemnation, could the appalling scene have been made visible to
                  Eliza Remsen.
               Milly Crofton hurried through what seemed the endless suite of rooms, and at last
                  found herself at the entrance of the apartment down which the rouge-et-noir table stretched its sinuous length. It
                  appeared to her that she had taken so much time to reach the spot, that she should
                  already be missed; but this thought gave her no inclination to go back. Many
                  girls, more capable of mad freaks than Milly, would have hesitated on the
                  threshold; but she was rather an odd compound; childish as every body thought her,
                  there was a force of will at the bottom of her character which kept her determined
                  and unshaken, now that she had fairly yielded to the temptation.
               It was already late, and the room was crowded to excess. Of all places in the
                  world where she could have ventured, perhaps there was none in which her
                  appearance, unaccompanied, would have attracted so slight notice. The whole vast
                  throng was too eager and engrossed to give her a single glance. People were either
                  trying to push their way toward the tables, surrounded by rows three and four
                  deep, or they were coming away with faces flushed by success, or hurrying out of
                  sight of the spell which, in many instances, had lured them on to ruin and
                  despair.
               Men and women from every civilized nation under the sun were gathered there; the
                  nearest realization possible to the scene the Tower of Babel must have presented
                  might be gained as one listened to the subdued hum of conversation, subsiding into
                  a complete silence near the tables; for even the spectators were too much occupied
                  for speech, and only the croupier's voice, or the quick chink of gold pieces,
                  interrupted the stillness.
               Nobody appeared to see Milly; and she was equally oblivious of the crowd. To get
                  to the board—to throw her stake upon it—that was the only thought in her mind. She
                  had put her purse in her pocket while
                  dressing—not with a premeditated intention to play; but she chanced to see it on
                  her table, where she had carelessly left it—her boxes were locked, and she ready
                  to go—so she seized the purse and hurried off in obedience to Mrs. Lawrence's
                  impatient summons; for the good soul was the most restless woman alive, and never
                  could bear to wait an instant.
               Every thing seemed to favor Milly's wrongdoing. As she got near one end of the
                  tables, the circle was broken momentarily by a man pushing his way rudely out of
                  the press, with a muttered curse upon his luck. Milly was too busy to look at him,
                  or she might have started back in horror at the white face, the rigid, set
                  features, and the anguish of the dilated eyes.
               The next morning, when the chill, gray dawn broke over Baden, the guardians of the
                  night found a prostrate body lying in a lonely part of the grounds—a pistol by the
                  white hand which still clutched at the turf it had torn up in final agony—a stream
                  of blood oozing slowly from the left temple, and staining the grass. But the
                  tragedy has nothing to do with my story, and it was not a sufficiently uncommon
                  one to cause more than brief wonderment.
               Milly only saw the broken cordon of human beings
                  through which, by a quick movement, she could reach the tables. Another second,
                  and she stood so close, that her hands touched the fatal board. She held her purse
                  in her fingers—poured the gold it contained into her palm. There was not a large
                  store—only five or six napoleons—but as Milly was far from rich, she knew too well
                  the value of money to have regarded it, at a cooler moment, as a small sum. She
                  was acquainted with the manner of playing; the morning she arrived, the ancient
                  beau Noyse had shown her the gambling-rooms, and explained the mysteries of the
                  game—that is, as well as he was able.
               Milly had no space to reflect, or grow frightened; she was elbowed and pushed; no
                  one seemed to regard whether she was old or young; then out rang the hoarse voice
                  of the croupier, "Faites votre jeu,
                  messieurs!"
               Milly flung a napoleon upon the red—she had won. She was too sorely agitated to
                  remove her winnings—to think at all—and, somehow, the sight of the gold gave her a
                  sensation of terror, for the first time since she entered the room. A few seconds
                  more, and her stake had doubled—trebled—quite a pile of yellow pieces lay before
                  her. She became conscious now that those close about her were watching—some voice
                  advised her, in French, to retire her gains—she could not do it—she was too much
                  alarmed—she only wanted to get away—but the crowd had closed too thickly for any
                  possibility of retreat.
               A few added instants of indecision, while the table swam before her eyes—then she
                  heard the cry, "Black wins," and saw her hoard swept away. She uttered a little
                  exclamation—it was a kind of rage that took possession of her. If, an hour
                  previous, any body had told her that anywhere in her life she could feel such
                  emotions as beset her now, she would have laughed in scornful unbelief.
               She dashed another napoleon upon the board—lost! Still another followed—lost! I am
                  ashamed to write it—she had two left in her hand; she flung them both down—saw
                  them both swept away!
               As she raised her eyes she saw a man—a young man—standing opposite, and regarding
                  her with a cold glance of wonder and disapproval. It only needed this to make her
                  humiliation complete. How she got out of the throng she could not tell; but she
                  was free, and trying, with tear-blinded eyes, to find her way back to the
                  ball-room—tears of bitter shame, such as it was right she should shed, but—as I
                  fear would have been the case with any of us—tears of anger, too.
               She took the wrong turn—found herself in an apartment that she did not recognize;
                  and before she could flee, a tall, black-mustached man was bending over her, and
                  saying in French,
               "Don't be afraid; we never eat pretty girls; I'll take care of you, my little
                  one."
               He actually touched her arm; she neither shrieked nor ran—simply waved him off,
                  and said, in a voice which was calm in spite of her terror,
               "Let me pass."
               He was making an effort to detain her; before she could realize any thing, a
                  strong hand pushed him violently back against the wall; and when Milly could see
                  clearly again, his face was quite black under that iron gripe which had seized
                  him.
               "Don't, please, don't!" she cried.
               The chevalier released the Frenchman, pointed to the door, and, after an instant's
                  hesitation, the animal retreated, probably not caring to risk a second embrace
                  from his antagonist.
               In the midst of her alarm, Milly could see distinctly enough to know that the
                  gentleman who had protected her was young, and evidently either English or
                  American. She was trembling from head to foot; past tears now—but she said,
                  piteously,
               "I want to get back to the ball-room; I have lost my way."
               "Allow me to show it you," he said, offering his arm with grave courtesy.
               He led her through the chambers in silence. Half dead as she was, a new fear broke
                  over Milly's mind. She stole a second glance at his face—it was the countenance
                  she had seen watching her as she fled from the tables. What must he think—but she
                  was too cold and lifeless to care much. She was filled with horror and remorse as
                  disproportionate to the magnitude of her offense as could well be perceived;
                  besides this, she was sane enough to remember that she had lost the sum put by for
                  the purchase of a present for Aunt Eliza.
               Milly felt that there was nothing left but to die—she certainly had disgraced
                  herself to all eternity—she would have liked to confess to somebody, any body—tell
                  just what had led her on—it seemed as if there would be a kind of relief in
                  putting her dismal secret into words. Again she stole a look at the handsome,
                  grave face beside her—perhaps with some wild, childish thought of telling her
                  story then and there, stranger as he was. But, fortunately, they had reached the
                  ball-room—Milly saw Mrs. Lawrence and the beau, evidently seeking her. She pointed
                  to them, half whispering,
               "Oh, what will they think! I—I ran away into the other rooms—first—first—I thought
                  I could get back before they missed me."
               The gentleman smiled, half compassionately, half in amusement: looking at her more
                  closely than he had before done, he saw how young she was.
               "Is that the lady you were with?" he asked.
               "Yes—I—"
               "Mrs. Lawrence is an old friend of mine," he continued; "I don't think she will
                  scold."
               "That—but—I wouldn't like her to know about—that I was—spoken to— Oh dear, I want
                  to go home."
               She was half sobbing now, and the stranger appeared a little afraid of a scene. At
                  this instant the beau perceived Milly, and hurried up with Mrs. Lawrence; and the
                  two began to exclaim and question.
               "Why, Milly Crofton, you frightened me half to death—where on earth have you
                  been?" cried the lady; while the beau nodded and gurgled, and grew scarlet with
                  excitement. "Good gracious, Mr. Halford, I didn't know you were in Baden! Where
                  did you come from—it is—ages— And you joined Milly—"
               "Miss Crofton lost her way, and I had the good fortune to meet her," he answered,
                  speaking Milly's name as composedly as if he had been familiar with it for the
                  last ten years.
               "Why, however did you manage, Milly! Oh mercy, I know—you turned out of the wrong
                  door—you poor dear! Never mind, we'll go home—there, there, don't mind," said Mrs.
                  Lawrence, too busy soothing the girl's agitation to wonder how or when she could
                  have known Mr. Halford. Milly was horribly angry at her own childishness; but she
                  could scarcely keep her tears from falling, and words were an utter
                  impossibility.
               "She'll be glad to get away," pursued Mrs. Lawrence, putting her hand on Milly's
                  arm. "And when did you come to Baden, Mr. Halford?"
               "Only yesterday, and am off early in the morning. I came to spend a day with some
                  friends, but am returning to Paris at once."
               He glanced so meaningly toward Milly, who was shaking from head to foot, that even
                  Mrs. Lawrence discovered he thought it her duty to take the poor child away
                  immediately; so she hurried the ancient Noyse off, only stopping six separate
                  times, according to her habit, for more last words with Mr. Halford.
               Milly caught a bow from the stranger, a grave, kindly smile, and the next thing
                  she could remember, though she walked on steadily enough, was finding herself in
                  the carriage and hearing Mrs. Lawrence and the antique still in animated
                  conversation.
               "But goodness me!" cried the chaperon, rushing back into Milly's chamber that
                  night, after getting partially undressed, "I forgot to ask—how on earth did you
                  happen to know Kenneth Halford? He hasn't been in America these ten years."
               "I didn't know him; he—he—"
               Here Milly's latest shred of composure gave way, and she sobbed until Mrs.
                  Lawrence forgot every thing in the necessity of quieting and putting her to
                  bed.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               MILLY'S ADVENTURE.
               TWO days later, Milly was safe under Mrs. Crittendon's guardianship; and the visit
                  to Baden seemed a dream—one of those horribly fascinating dreams which are half
                  nightmare, and the more interesting from that touch of the terrible. Milly could
                  not dismiss that last evening's exploit from her mind; it filled her with shame
                  and remorse; and she would have given a great deal had there been some one to whom
                  she could reveal her fault, and from whom she might receive the severe lecture and
                  penance due to so enormous a transgression.
               But she kept her own counsel; to attempt a confession to her friends was a simple
                  impossibility; her exaggerated view of the case made her dread their pronouncing
                  it unpardonable. She knew that they were rather strict in their ideas, and had
                  visions of being deserted on the spot—at least of their telling Aunt Eliza—and
                  what would befall her then was too awful to contemplate. The next winter was to
                  witness her presentation in society; if Mrs. Remsen were to learn what she had
                  done, there would be an end to that hope. The mildest retribution she could
                  imagine as likely to happen was banishment to a convent; and straightway there
                  rose before Milly a picture of herself with her pretty hair cut short, her face
                  half hidden under an unbecoming coif, and the chanting of dreary psalms the chief
                  occupation of her life. Not that the vision had the slightest show of reason for a
                  basis—Milly knew that well enough—but she had just been reading an old novel where
                  a similar fate befell the heroine; and the convent imprisonment suggested itself
                  to her mind as the method of punishment her relative would adopt, though it is
                  probable that even to fancy a good church-woman capable of such Papistical
                  wickedness would have offended Aunt Eliza more than the original fault which Milly
                  deplored so bitterly.
               She might in safety have cased her conscience by an avowal to Mrs. Lawrence;
                     but, in her most tragic moments, Milly
                  could not help feeling confident that the frivolous Minerva would laugh and treat
                  the whole affair as an excellent joke. So she kept her own counsel; but the secret
                  preyed upon her night and day till she felt like a woman in a romance going about
                  with a history and a mystery which made an invisible ban between herself and
                  others of her age; and it was all inexpressibly horrible, though with a certain
                  sensational interest about it which was painfully agreeable.
               It frightened her sometimes to remember that her secret was not wholly in her own
                  keeping. Mr. Halford had seen her at the tables—she was sure of that—the
                  recollection of his grave face watching her was clear in her mind, though, at the
                  moment, she had thought as little of him as she did of the crowd around her. If
                  she should ever meet him again! the idea was too dreadful, and she always got away
                  from it as fast as possible, though it would return with sullen persistency, and
                  she often dreamed of him sitting on a throne, in the traditional stage-dress of
                  Richard III.—only the effect was slightly marred by his always wearing a
                  smoking-cap on his head, instead of a crown—and Aunt Eliza dragging her up to the
                  foot of the judgment-seat, to receive sentence. Here, again, the grotesque mixed
                  itself up with tragedy; for Aunt Eliza invariably appeared with Joan of Are's
                  mailed coat over her crinoline; and Milly would be conscious, in the midst of her
                  own agony, that her feet were bare, and that her only garment was an old
                  yellow-flannel dressing-gown, which had belonged to her nurse, and which she had
                  not recollected for years until it thus thrust itself into her visions.
               She seemed so dull and languid, that the Crittendons reproached themselves for
                  having allowed her to stay so much confined, and, as Mrs. Crittendon's health was
                  fully restored, decided to make a journey to Geneva. Mrs. Lawrence—always glad of
                  society and change—accompanied them; and Milly enjoyed the expedition so
                  thoroughly, that her remorse ceased to torment her so constantly. It was somewhat
                  late for a visit to Chamouni, but Mrs. Crittendon insisted that the rest of the
                  party should go, while she remained comfortably in the quiet city; and her husband
                  yielded to her wishes, after the commendable habit customary with American
                  husbands.
               They reached Chamouni in the evening; and the next morning, at the first peep of
                  dawn, Milly was up, and out, to catch a glimpse of Mont Blanc, and repeat
                  Coleridge's poem, as any girl barely eighteen ought to do—an innocent enthusiasm
                  we wise older people would give the world to be capable of, however much we may
                  laugh at it.
               The day after, they mounted on mules, and rode off to the Mer de Glace; and Milly
                  was in such extravagantly high spirits that her companions caught the infection;
                  and if Mrs. Remsen could have heard Minerva Lawrence's shrieks of laughter and
                  nonsensical talk, she would have regarded that plump body with more pitying
                  contempt than of old. Milly never once remembered her dismal secret, and the day
                  was one of unclouded enjoyment until the return, during which her unusual
                  excitement made her a little reckless; and, encouraged by Minerva's approval, she
                  insisted on urging her mule forward more rapidly than was prudent, in spite of the
                  expostulations of the guides.
               Of course, I brought her out to Chamouni on purpose to meet with an adventure:
                  conscious that my story is not likely to prove very romantic, I am glad to crowd
                  all the incidents I can into these opening chapters, consoling myself for their
                  lack of novelty by the fact that they actually occurred. So Milly urged on her
                  mule, and Minerva laughed and applauded; the guides spluttered admonitions in
                  French and German; and good Mr. Crittendon was too much engaged in keeping himself
                  secure in the saddle, and wondering what could have tempted a man of his years,
                  weight, and tender flesh, to trust himself upon such an instrument of torture, to
                  pay much attention.
               On went the willful girl; and at length the mule, roused out of her customary
                  staid behavior, either became infected with something of her rider's excitement,
                  or else determined to give the young woman a lesson which should serve as a
                  warning for the future. Two of the guides were occupied with Minerva, who, however
                  much she admired Milly's courage, was far from imitating it, and shrieked
                  dolefully each time either of the men tried to quit her side. The third was busy
                  assisting Mr. Crittendon; the fourth hurried after Milly, uttering counsels and
                  prayers in French, and breaking them, at intervals, with awful German oaths, each
                  of which was at least a yard long. Away dashed the mule—she owned the poetic name
                  of "The Morning Star"—and, though she did not attempt to sing, seemed inclined to
                  emulate the swift motion of that planet. Milly would have checked her course now,
                  but it was too late; the Morning Star had taken the bit between her teeth, and
                  pranced on down the narrow path. Milly did not shriek: she was frightened, but
                  glancing back, saw that her guide was in hot pursuit, and tried to believe that he
                  would overtake them in time to prevent danger. The path made a sharp turn—the mule
                  stumbled—a shriek broke from Minerva's lips, echoed by the guide, which roused Mr.
                  Crittendon to a sense of Milly's peril. It was only the work of a moment, long as
                  it takes in the description. Milly was conscious of a lightning-like thought that
                  this was death—her dazzled vision caught the immeasurable depth, with only a few
                  feet of the path between her and it, and that so steep that, once over the side,
                  nothing could stop her swift descent into the chasm. Every thing slid before her
                  eyes as if she had already commenced that terrible fall; she could not cry
                  out—could only remember that there was no help—watching always the shining snow,
                  while a thousand sights from the old life in her far-off home rose, like phantoms,
                  between her and the great white depth.
               The mule struggled—recovered herself—dashed on—a second turn—a quick curve—the
                  abyss frowned below, without even a ravine to break the immeasurable distance!
                  Then new shouts and cries—blind, sick, and faint, Milly became aware of a party
                  approaching up the path—another instant, and she knew that the animal's speed was
                  checked, and she lifted from the saddle. When her senses came back, she was lying
                  on the ground, her head supported in Minerva's lap; Mr. Crittendon was fairly
                  wringing his hands; Minerva in hysterics; the guides performing a sort of
                  red-Indian dance of craze and fright: the only quiet object that met her eyes was
                  the sad, grave face which bent toward her—the face of the man who had witnessed
                  her crazy exploit at the gaming-table.
               The girl's first connected thought was that it would have been better to go with
                  Morning Star straight over the precipice than be saved by this man, and forced to
                  remember the secret which he shared. But a second glance at the countenance showed
                  it so full of anxiety, that she rather forgot her longing for death, and was able
                  to laugh, soothe Minerva's hysterics and Mr. Crittendon's distress, and utter a
                  few broken expressions of regret.
               "And where on earth did you come from, Mr. Halford? Oh, Milly, Milly! I believe my
                  hair has turned gray with fright!" moaned Mrs. Lawrence, coming out of her
                  hysterics to gratify one of the strongest instincts of her nature—curiosity. "The
                  first thing I saw was you holding that dreadful beast's Bridle, as if you had
                  flown up the precipice."
               "Not exactly," he replied. "I reached Chamouni just after you had started this
                  morning, and proposed to these gentlemen to overtake you. We should have done so,
                  but one of our party was indisposed, and we had to leave him at the last chalet;
                  but, after all, we reached you at the right moment."
               Milly, lying with her head on Minerva's lap, listened to the explanation, glancing
                  long enough at the other men to perceive that they were three young Englishmen,
                  evidently fresh from the University, and of course, too youthful to possess the
                  slightest interest to the eyes of eighteen.
               "There never was any thing so fortunate, Halford!" said Mr. Crittendon, shaking
                  his hand warmly. "If our little girl had—I mean, if it hadn't ended as it has—
                  Bless me, that brute of a mule ought to be killed at once!" he added, finding that
                  to finish the sentence he had begun caused a suspicious gurgling in his throat,
                  and anxious, like most people, to avoid dramatics.
               "At all events, there is no harm done," Halford said, cheerfully. "The next thing
                  is to get Miss Crofton back to the inn."
               "I am not in the least hurt," Milly answered, trying to raise her head, but
                  feeling so dizzy and odd still that she decided to relinquish the effort. "I can
                  ride easily enough. Don't be anxious, Mr. Crittendon. Oh, I am so sorry to have
                  frightened you all!"
               "We are very glad to be quits for the fright, Milly," he replied. "But how can we
                  manage, Halford? We ought to have a litter, or something."
               "Mercy, no!" cried Milly, rather impatiently, raising herself this time, while the
                  color came back to her checks; and the three youths, huddled together at a little
                  distance, like a covey of frightened partridges, wondered that any thing human
                  could look so pretty, and straightway became her victims for the moment. "I can
                  ride perfectly well; poor old Morning Star was not to blame for stumbling."
               "You sha'n't ride her!" squeaked Minerva. "The awfullest brute—why those guides
                  ought to be hanged for keeping an animal of the sort. She's fitter for a menagerie
                  of wild beasts than any thing else."
               Poor Morning Star stood with her bridle held by one of the guides, her cars
                  drooping, her head down, with so ludicrous an expression of shame and wonder on
                  her visage. that Milly began to laugh—then stopped quickly, lest she should cry
                  also.
               "Miss Crofton can take my mule," Halford said: "a wooden one couldn't be safer.
                  I'll ride Morning Star."
               He ordered the guides to change the saddles, talked cheerfully with Minerva and
                  Mr. Crittendon, tried to put his three youthful companions at their ease, and
                  distracted the general attention from Milly with a kindly tact which she fully
                  appreciated.
               "But you were going on up," Mr. Crittendon said.
               "No, our friend's little illness hindered us so long that we decided to put off
                  our expedition until another day, and only came on to meet you."
               "We shall be uncommonly glad of your company down," Mr. Crittendon replied. "I'm
                  rather old and heavy for these sort of expeditions—especially when it comes to
                  taking charge of young ladies."
               "Please—" began Milly, thinking that his words implied a slight reproach; but he
                  interrupted her.
               "My dear, it was not your fault; and if it had been, I'm too happy to see you safe
                  to lecture. All the same, I shall be very glad if these gentlemen will go back
                  with us."
               The three youths came sufficiently out of the bewilderment into which they had
                  been thrown by Milly's pretty face, added to their constitutional shyness, to
                  express a proper delight at the privilege.
               By this time Milly could stand and walk about, and announced herself quite ready
                  to continue the descent. She did not speak often to Halford, though she was
                  longing to thank him for his kindness; but she grew afraid and ashamed whenever
                  she recollected their first meeting, and was anxious to depart.
               
               The ride down passed in the most commonplace manner. Halford did not even beg the
                  happiness of walking beside Milly, as a man would have done in a novel; and it was
                  certain that he could scarcely have taken as good care of her as did the chief
                  guide, who stalked sternly along at the mule's head, and made a movement to catch
                  the bridle if Milly so much as looked up, apparently suspecting her of an
                  intention to attempt a second escapade. Mr. Crittendon and Halford kept near each
                  other; and the youths were able to talk to Minerva, since she was not that (to
                  them) most formidable of created beings—a young girl. So Milly had a rather silent
                  ride, and ample time for numerous reflections—so absorbing, that she forgot to
                  admire, as diligently as she ought, the wonderful panorama spread out before her
                  eyes. On reaching the chalet, they found that the invalid had entirely recovered
                  from his indisposition, and had returned to Chamouni without waiting for his
                  companions. Scarcely a word was exchanged between Milly and Halford during the
                  whole ride; and before they reached the inn, the feeling of restraint and shyness
                  had arrived at such a pitch that she only sought to escape from his presence.
                  There was a strong probability that, with the usual inconsistency of human nature,
                  she would proceed to hate him because she had placed herself in a somewhat
                  questionable position in his thoughts—that is, if he was inclined to pass harsh
                  judgments on a girl of her age.
               Finding that Mr. Crittendon had invited the party of gentlemen to dine with them,
                  Milly informed Mrs. Lawrence that she was too weary to sit up another moment, and
                  retired to her room. She was at once punished for her half fib; Minerva would not
                  leave her till she had forced several infallible remedies on her, and given orders
                  to her maid to look in upon Miss Crofton every fifteen minutes, lest she should be
                  taken with a fainting-fit, or spasms, or some other feminine malady requiring
                  attention.
               "Spasms!" cried Milly, ungratefully, in great scorn. "As for fainting, I never did
                  such a thing in my life—really—and I am not likely to begin now."
               She spoke as if she were at least three-score-and-ten, according to the habit of
                  her age.
               "Oh dear me, you were as white and limp as that handkerchief, when they laid your
                  head in my lap," moaned Minerva. "Oh, Elise!"—this to the maid—"you never saw any
                  thing so dreadful in your whole life! Did I tell you exactly how it all
                  happened?"
               She had—at least fifteen times since they got up stairs—but the well-trained
                  attendant was ready to listen again, and express suitable alarm in voluble French,
                  and such English as she could muster.
               "Of course, you've told her," said Milly, irritably; for her nerves were too
                  sorely disordered for her to emulate the Parisian's patience.
               "You are trembling this moment; you must have some red lavender," pronounced
                  Minerva, rushing to the little medicine-chest which she always carried with her,
                  and which was the horror of her friends.
               "I can't swallow another thing," pleaded Milly. "I only want to get to bed—I'll
                  have some tea later."
               "Oh, but the lavender would set you up at once," urged Minerva. "You're all of a
                  shiver; just like a—a—what is the word? Elise, what is it shakes and shakes
                  always?"
               "I did not forget for the moment," returned Elise, staring at her mistress as if
                  she thought it was a conundrum proposed for her solution. "There is the—how you
                  say in English—gélée des prids de veau—that
                  shake and shake ever."
               "No, no, how stupid!" said her mistress. "Dear me, the word is on the end of my
                  tongue."
               Elise looked helpless, but stared at the lady as if trying to get a glimpse of her
                  lingual adornment, in the hope of seeing the desired word. "I was never good at
                  the calembours," she said, meekly.
               "The woman's mad!" cried Minerva, spreading out her plump hands and laughing
                  heartily, then breaking off to add, "Hush, hush, Elise! you mustn't make a noise;
                  Miss Crofton's nerves won't bear it."
               The Frenchwoman, who always moved like a cat, and spoke in the lowest of
                  monotones, stood aghast at this undeserved charge; and the whole thing was so
                  ridiculous that Milly began to laugh and sob and shake more violently. Minerva
                  flew about in great agitation, knocked over every light object within her reach,
                  upset her medicine-case, and created the confusion that well-meaning people
                  usually do in the presence of an emergency.
               "If you'll only leave me alone for a while," sobbed Milly, throwing herself on the
                  bed. "Please—please—just for half an hour. I shall be perfectly well then."
               "Why, of course, of course," said Minerva. "Elise, don't worry the poor thing; how
                  can you? Now here's the lavender. Milly; I'll set it on the table; here's a spoon:
                  don't tease her, Elise."
               Milly was ready to promise to swallow the whole medicine-chest, if her friend
                  would only leave her alone; and having exhausted every means of good-natured
                  torment that suggested itself to her mind, Mrs. Lawrence departed, driving Elise
                  out before her as if the docile woman had been some mischievous animal not to be
                  trusted for an instant.
               The door closed, Milly turned her head on her pillow with a long sigh of relief;
                  but in an instant the rusty hinges creaked again. Mrs. Lawrence put her head into
                  the room and exclaimed, in an unearthly whisper,
               "Milly, Milly, I've found the word—aspen! Of course; I said it was just on the tip
                  of my tongue—aspen, to be sure! Now, Elise, don't make a noise; step softly; you
                  don't know what weak nerves are."
               This time she absolutely departed, and for a long hour Milly was left to herself,
                  and, having finished her cry, could go comfortably to sleep. Then Elise, the
                  light-footed, brought her a delicious dish of tea and a tiny bird; and Milly felt
                  much better, though she instructed the maid to tell Mrs. Lawrence that she meant
                  to go to bed at once, and sent her good-night, that she need not be disturbed by a
                  second visit.
               Milly sat at her window, looking out over the narrow valley, and watched the gray
                  twilight settle into the gloom of evening. The last faint glow died from the
                  highest mountain peaks—a few stars shot up into the sky—a soft, velvety darkness
                  settled about—the murmur of unseen water-falls came up through the distance, and
                  there Milly sat, and wondered, and dreamed, sorely perplexed between her gratitude
                  to Kenneth Halford for this day's deliverance and her irritated recollection of
                  the night at Baden, which really seemed to make it her duty to detest him with
                  great energy; it was the only means of escape from that overwhelming sense of
                  shame.
               However, fatigue subdued her at length; she was forced to put by both remorse and
                  her unsettled feelings, where Halford was concerned, until another season, for she
                  was so sleepy that she could scarcely see to undress.
               At her age, and with her perfect health, a night's quiet sleep was sufficient to
                  remove every trace of the weariness left by her previous day's excitement. She
                  rose early, had a cup of coffee in her room, and went out for a long walk, before
                  the substantial breakfast which Mr. Crittendon always expected to have at
                  precisely half-past eight o'clock.
               In this world Fate seems to have a special pleasure in confronting us with the
                  very persons whom we could most wish to avoid; and the truth of the remark was
                  proved in Milly's case this morning. She walked about the hamlet for a while,
                  returned toward the hotel, and took the path up to the field from whence she had
                  once watched Mont Blanc in the gray dawn. Some one had reached the best point of
                  observation before her; a single glance showed who it was, and she would have
                  retreated; but, in her reverie, she had walked so close to the spot that the sound
                  of her footsteps roused Kenneth Halford, and he turned toward her with a
                  pleasant-enough smile, though, polite as he was, Milly fancied she saw in his face
                  that he would have preferred his solitary musings to any companionship.
               "I hope you are quite recovered from yesterday's fatigue, Miss Crofton," he said,
                  "and have had a good night's rest."
               "Thanks, yes," she answered.
               "At your age one does not require long to get over fatigue, and sleep comes very
                  easily."
               "Bless me," thought Milly; "he talks as if I was about ten years old, and he
                  Methuselah, at least."
               "You leave for Geneva this afternoon, Mr. Crittendon tells me," he went on,
                  evidently thinking her silence rose from shyness, and wishing to put her at
                  ease.
               That idea made Milly more vexed than ever; she only bowed carelessly, by way of
                  answer, and turned to study the king of mountains, glorious in the early morning
                  light, with his robe of clouds and diadem of snow.
               "I suppose you have already quoted, 
                     
                        "'Hast thou a spell to stay the morning star
                        On her swift course, O bald and sovran Blanc!'
                     
                   he said, with what seemed to her a sort of superior smile.
               He had not given the words exactly—there was a slight satisfaction in this, as it
                  gave her an opportunity to smile in her turn.
               "I have made a mistake, I suppose," he added. "You see it is a long time since I
                  studied Coleridge."
               "And why did you suppose him fresh in my mind?" Milly asked, unadvisedly, still
                  rather in the mood for warfare.
               "Because he is usually a favorite with very young people," he replied; "not but
                  what he ought to be with us older ones, only, as we get on through the world,
                  there's less leisure for poetry-studying."
               "You speak as if you were old enough to be Mr. Crittendon's grandfather," said
                  she, conscious that the words sounded almost rude, and, worse, that her evident
                  irritation was a convincing proof of extreme youthfulness, but not able to check
                  either.
               "I am not sure that, at least, I mightn't almost be yours," he answered, with a
                  pleasant laugh.
               "Do you think me about ten?" she asked, with a small violence which she felt to be
                  very undignified, but could not repress.
               "Perhaps one might add ten or eleven years to it," he said; and it was plain that
                  he had a certain satisfaction in her vehemence, which made her look prettier than
                  she knew.
               "I am eighteen," exclaimed Milly, trying to speak disdainfully, but succeeding
                  poorly. "At least, I shall be next week," she added, forced on to the concluding
                  confession by a prick of her uncomfortable conscience, that would never let her
                  alone.
               "It's a very nice thing to be eighteen," he said, gravely.
               Milly hesitated whether to reproach him with looking old, or sneering at his
                  claims. She decided in favor of the latter, as he was a handsome man.
               "I should scarcely suppose it was long enough since you passed that season to have
                  any great regret," said she.
               He laughed outright—a slow, musical laugh, but it irritated Milly's nerves
                  sorely.
               "What age should you give me?" he asked.
               "Really, we have fallen upon a very American train of conversation," returned she,
                  with another attempt at disdainfulness. "English people say we can never talk two
                  minutes without bringing up that subject."
               
               "Mayn't we claim our little peculiarities as well as other nations?" demanded he,
                  in the same teasing way. "But you've not answered my question! Perhaps you are
                  afraid of hurting my feelings, by putting on too many years."
               "You may be twenty-six," said Milly, regardless of conscience now.
               "What a nice bit of flattery that would be, if I were only fifty, instead of
                  three-and-thirty," he replied, laughing again.
               Thirty-three was exactly Milly's pet age for her heroes; she felt a little
                  softened toward the man; besides, though the face was rather sad and worn, it
                  showed no lack of youth; and, much as Milly detested boys, she hated wrinkles
                  worse.
               "And you are going back to America soon," he said, dismissing the subject of years
                  so suddenly, that Milly, given to fancies, wondered if their conversation had
                  roused some sad thought in his mind. "It is almost ten years since I came
                  away."
               "It must be delightful to travel as you have done," Milly said; for she knew that
                  he had held a diplomatic appointment in Egypt, and written a rather wise book,
                  which, naturally, she had not read.
               "Still, I should be very glad to see home again," he replied. "I say home, though
                  I have nobody left who could make it such."
               These words, quietly as they were spoken, touched Milly; she was a sympathetic
                  little soul, and any thing in the shape of sorrow or sadness appealed to her at
                  once.
               "You live with your aunt, Mrs. Remsen, Mr. Crittendon tells me—I used to know her
                  years ago, and her eldest daughter—I believe she is Mrs. Ramsay now."
               "My cousin Adelaide—oh yes," Milly said, rather indifferently; for it was
                  difficult to attempt interest where that lady was concerned.
               "Didn't you like my aunt very much? She is so good!"
               "A woman to respect and admire greatly," he said. "I believe I used to be rather a
                  favorite with her as a boy. I wonder I never chanced to see you in my visits."
               "Oh, aunt never allowed the children in the drawing-room—that was her law—then,
                  while Adelaide reigned—" Milly stopped, remembering that it would not be nice to
                  find fault with her cousin to a stranger. "Don't you mean to go back to America?"
                  she asked.
               "Some time—I have thoughts of returning to Egypt—I don't know that there is any
                  thing to take me to my old home."
               Milly was conscious of a vague feeling of disappointment, though, for the life of
                  her, she could not have told why; but the feeling rose, and her perception of it,
                  in some odd way, reminded her that she had meant to hate this man. On the heels of
                  that thought came the recollection of their first meeting. The color flamed into
                  her cheeks, a startled expression crept into her eyes. She glanced quickly about,
                  and some wild desire to run away and hide herself started up in her mind. While
                  playing with a pretty Alpine weed he had plucked, Kenneth Halford watched her
                  furtively. He was a peculiar man in many respects, and his intuitions were almost
                  as quick and unerring as a woman's. He knew as well as if she had put it in words,
                  what the reflection was that disturbed her. He began to talk—of his travels—of a
                  Nile journey—of Greece. Milly grew interested, and showed that books had made her
                  perfectly familiar with the scenes of which he spoke. The conversation glided
                  naturally to other subjects—pictures—the new novels—certain old and beloved poets,
                  whom the startling geniuses of the past ten years have not wholly banished from
                  men's memories.
               They strolled slowly along, talking in the most animated manner; and when they
                  approached the hotel, Halford was astonished to find how quickly the time had
                  fled, and what a sympathetic, intelligent companion Milly proved; for, like many
                  men between thirty and thirty-five, he was given to regarding girls as only a
                  superior sort of dolls, incapable of any thing beyond an interest in their
                  toilets, and a weak attempt at flirtation. One exception to this sweeping
                  condemnation he always made—that is, when he allowed himself to recall the
                  solitary instance—but that was as seldom as possible; for stern, old, and
                  practical as he considered himself, these ten long years of absence had not wholly
                  obliterated the memory of a bitter pain and wrong received at the hands of the one
                  girl whom he had weakly believed so different from the generality of her sex.
               While he was mentally wondering at the rapidity with which this last hour had
                  flown, Milly was indulging in a second's reflection too, but a less pleasant one
                  than his. Again the gambling-room at Baden rose before her eyes—herself standing
                  by the green table—clutching her little store of gold with one hand—the rush, the
                  whirl, the dizziness—and this man's grave face watching her. She felt no anger
                  now; she only remembered that they must part in a few hours, perhaps never to meet
                  again; and she could not bear to let him go without attempting, if not an excuse
                  for her conduct, at least an expression of her shame. What must he think of
                  her—composed and careless as she had been this past hour—unconcerned as though
                  their first meeting had been under the most decorous circumstances! She was ready
                  again to run away and hide herself; but she would not yield to such cowardice—she
                  would do what was right without delay. If she could not change his opinion of her
                  terrible act, at least he should see plainly how bitterly she regretted it.
               "Mr. Halford!" she exclaimed, stopping short, as they neared the house.
               Her voice sounded so odd and labored, that he turned toward her in surprise. She
                  had grown pale, and her changeful eyes were unnaturally bright with pain.
               "You are not well," he said, anxiously; "you have walked too far! How careless of
                  me to forget that you were not strong just now."
               "No, no," she said, eagerly; "it's not that—it's— Oh, there's something I want to
                  say, and I don't know how to begin."
               "Come sit down on that bench," he said; "you must not stand any longer."
               "No—I'd rather walk about—it's easier," she replied, in the same breathless
                  fashion, though never for an instant faltering in her resolve. "I want to tell
                  you—I want to say—"
               "Take time, Miss Crofton," returned he, smiling kindly. "I am not a very
                  formidable person—"
               "I'm a fool," broke in Milly; "but I will not be so silly! I— Oh, it's too
                  late—see! they are coming."
               Halford followed the direction of her eyes; as usual, an interruption had arrived
                  at a critical moment. The three young Englishmen were close upon them, and Halford
                  had to engage the trio in conversation, and afford Milly an opportunity to
                  escape.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               THE EXPLANATION.
               MR. CRITTENDON came down to breakfast somewhat tired, and indisposed for exertion,
                  after the unusual fatigues of the previous day; and Mrs. Lawrence, who delighted
                  in nothing so much as having a friend at hand with some slight ailment, upon which
                  she could exercise her medicinal skill, insisted on their remaining at Chamouni
                  until the next morning.
               "Your wife will not really expect us before," she said, "and I don't like the idea
                  of your undertaking the tedious drive until you are thoroughly rested. I'll look
                  out some remedies—I've just the thing for you, I am sure."
               He hesitated somewhat—perhaps as much from a dread of Minerva's doctoring as any
                  thing else; but just then, from her seat in the window, she saw Milly conversing
                  with Halford and the young Englishmen, and pointed out the group to the old
                  gentleman.
               "She would enjoy the day, I know," said Mrs. Lawrence; "and she's such a dear
                  little thing, that one likes to give her pleasure."
               "The best child in the world," pronounced Mr. Crittendon; "as unlike modern young
                  ladies in general, as if she had been brought up in another planet."
               "Oh, that comes of Eliza Remsen's absurd ideas," returned Mrs. Lawrence,
                  impatiently; "she always was the most crochetty woman that ever lived. But I'm
                  very fond of Milly, and it would be a kindness to her to stay. The young people
                  can go off on some expedition, and I'll go too; and you can rest comfortably."
               The restless body was as eager as a girl for amusement, and enjoyed the idea of
                  remaining, on her own account; though it is only justice to add, that she would
                  have staid as willingly in any case, if it could have obliged one whom she
                  liked.
               "We'll call it settled," said she, triumphantly.
               "Yes, if Milly wishes."
               "Oh, put it on that ground, and she'll say go. You must tell her you
                  need rest, and indeed you do. Let me see—Sepia—no, scarcely;" and she put her head
                  on one side, and contemplated him with an air of as profound wisdom as if she had
                  received her degree at the Sorbonne. "Perhaps Ignatia—what do you think?"
               "Thanks—I dare say that would answer as well as the other," he replied, secretly
                  indulging in an old-fashioned contempt for every thing in the shape of homeopathic
                  remedies.
               "Oh, good gracious, don't speak like that! It's very important to choose the
                  exact— But I'll watch you," she added, leaving her first sentence unfinished,
                  after a confusing habit she had. "By the time breakfast is over, I can decide. No
                  sense of fullness in your head—"
               "Bless me, no!"
               "Ah, so much the better—that might mean apoplexy, you know," said Minerva,
                  cheerfully. "No numbness in your right knee?"
               "Never had any sensation of the sort in my life," returned the old gentleman, with
                  indignation.
               "Good!" pronounced Minerva, still in her doctorial tone. "No danger of
                  paralysis—"
               "I wonder if they ever mean to allow us any breakfast," interrupted Mr.
                  Crittendon, giving the bell-rope a vigorous pull, as a slight relief to his
                  ruffled feelings.
               "Phosphor," muttered Minerva," eying him meditatively.
               "Perhaps—or camomilla—though, in case of slow digestion—"
               "If those wretches below stairs will only give me some food, I'll engage to digest
                  it," he broke in again, unable, in spite of his momentary irritation at Minerva's
                  awful hints in regard to possible maladies, to repress a smile at her look and
                  attitude.
               The breakfast-tray fortunately appeared just then; and Milly's entrance, a moment
                  later, put a stop to the conversation; though, every now and then, the old
                  gentleman felt Minerva's professional eye upon him, and knew that she did not mean
                  to release her prey.
               "Milly," said Mrs. Lawrence, as the young lady came in, "we're not going back to
                  Geneva until to-morrow."
               "That is, if you would like to stay," added Mr. Crittendon, as he held out his
                  hand, by way of a morning salutation.
               "But you must not do it on my account," Milly answered.
               "No, no, my dear; I'm a little tired after yesterday's jaunt," he said; "and our
                  good friend there has persuaded me I need rest."
               "Aurum!" cried Mrs. Lawrence, in a sort of Eureka tone, looking up at the ceiling
                  as if in consultation with some invisible
                  spirit. "No—I think not! Hyoscyamus—maybe."
               "It sounds as if she were calling up ghosts by their names," Milly wickedly
                  whispered in Mr. Crittendon's ear; and the old gentleman was delighted to laugh at
                  his friend's follies as a return for the unpleasant suggestions she had thrown
                  out.
               "Milly's scoffing at my skill," cried Mrs. Lawrence. "Never mind—she can't deny
                  that my medicines always do her good. Now come and pour out the coffee, like a
                  good child."
               Milly was pleased at the idea of remaining another day: now that she had made up
                  her mind to speak to Mr. Halford about her transgression, she longed to have the
                  opportunity before leaving, and his conversation during their walk had banished
                  the feeling of irritation toward him. He entered the room while they were at
                  breakfast, and Mrs. Lawrence hastened to inform him of their change of plans.
               "So you must propose something to amuse Milly and me," she said.
               "I am quite ready," he answered. "There are several places to visit—you'd not mind
                  inviting my friends?"
               "Delighted, of course! The more the merrier! Milly, Eliza Remsen vows that all
                  proverbs and old sayings are vulgar; but she can't hear me; so, no matter."
               Milly paid no attention; she was accustomed to Mrs. Lawrence's little flings at
                  her aunt, and Mrs. Remsen's open condemnation of Minerva's follies. She knew that
                  neither would let any body else abuse the other—it was a privilege of friendship
                  only to be shared between themselves.
               Halford gave the ladies a choice of several expeditions; but Mr. Crittendon
                  insisted that Milly must not attempt too much.
               "You look a little pale, my dear," he added.
               The color rushed into Milly's cheeks as she remembered the agitation at the close
                  of her morning's interview with Halford, which had brought her into the house so
                  tired and pallid; but he carefully averted his eyes, and went on talking with Mrs.
                  Lawrence, apparently unconscious of Mr. Crittendon's remark.
               With much discussion, and numerous impossible proposals from the namesake of the
                  goddess of wisdom, it was decided that, after an early luncheon, they should ride
                  to a beautiful water-fall several miles from the village. Halford departed in
                  search of his friends, to delight and terrify them by the news that they were to
                  be again thrown into feminine society; and Milly sat down to read the latest
                  newspaper to Mr. Crittendon. Mrs. Lawrence disturbed the old gentleman frequently
                  by breaking in with exclamations of pleasure at having found the precise remedy to
                  suit his case, and invariably adding, in the same breath, that it would not
                  answer. Finally, she rose to go up to her room and search her beloved
                  medicine-chest and consult her favorite authority, pausing at the door to ask,
                  abruptly,
               "Your feet are not cold, Mr. Crittendon?"
               "Never, ma am," said he, with the severest glance over his spectacles that his
                  kind old eyes could manage.
               "I wish they were," sighed Minerva; "then I'd say aconite."
               "Try it all the same," returned he, curtly.
               "Mercy on us—the idea!" shrieked Minerva. "It's by just such carelessness people
                  do harm—I'm prudence itself." Then, with a fresh relapse into her professional
                  voice—"Your heart is all right."
               "So my wife says," answered he, resignedly.
               "Oh now, don't jest—these are always serious matters!" said Minerva, with
                  ludicrous earnestness. "Just answer me one question—you never had a touch of
                  rheumatic gout in the chest?"
               Mr. Crittendon did not even look up; he signed Milly to go on with her reading;
                  and Minerva, perceiving that her old friend's patience was worn threadbare, wisely
                  took refuge in flight.
               "I've known her, girl and woman," said Mr. Crittendon, slowly, tapping his fingers
                  on the table, to emphasize his remark, "ever since she was years younger than you,
                  Milly! She was always the best creature in the world, and the greatest fool—my
                  dear, she hasn't changed an iota in all that time."
               He refreshed himself with a pinch of snuff, and recovered his good-humor; while
                  Milly, as soon as she could check her laughter, continued her perusal of the
                  newspaper.
               Luckily for Minerva's peace of mind, before the hour of their departure arrived,
                  she was enabled to make her decision in regard to the remedies Mr. Crittendon
                  required. She covered his table with tumblers containing a few drops of liquid
                  medicines in water, tiny bottles of infinitesimal pills, and gave him scores of
                  numerous and contradictory directions in regard to taking them. He promised
                  whatever she wished—people always did promise Minerva any thing and every thing
                  where her medicines were concerned—and she set off in high spirits. The expedition
                  proved a complete success. The two ladies rode, and the men walked beside them;
                  and there was any quantity of chatter and gayety. Even the shy University men came
                  out in a surprising manner; and the most venturesome of the three actually
                  perpetrated a compliment to Milly; but it was afterward agreed between his friends
                  that he had taken too much bottled ale before leaving the inn; and, indeed, at the
                  time, they did not hesitate to whisper in his ear sundry cautions about exposing
                  his natural imbecility more than he could help. However, he set all that down to
                  the score of envy, and always looked back upon that afternoon as the crowning
                  success of his youth, confidently believing that he had made an impression on the
                  mind of the young American girl which could never be effaced.
               Masculine vanity is almost without limits; but the vanity of a shy man invariably
                  surpasses that of any other.
               There were several parties of tourists at the inn, and among them young people of
                  Mrs. Lawrence's acquaintance, whom she invited to join the expedition; so that
                  they mustered a tolerable company at the moment of departure.
               It was a glorious day, and the water-fall—like the scenery through which they
                  passed to reach it—so beautiful that no human words could convey the least idea of
                  its loveliness and grandeur.
               Halford's manner to Milly was simply perfect. She was able, at times, to forget
                  that she had any confession to offer, and, in her enjoyment, blossomed into such
                  beauty, that even he, unimpressionable as he considered himself in these days, was
                  absolutely astounded. It was an afternoon that Milly would never forget to her
                  dying day, though, at the time, she had no perception that it was more to her than
                  a thousand other seasons of pleasure. Long after, when she was so changed from the
                  blithe, childish Milly of this period that she scarcely recognized herself as the
                  same person, she used to look across the black stretch of storm and tempest which
                  swept between her and that season, and marvel why Fate should have been cruel
                  enough to lead her blindly out into the glory of that vanished morning. But no
                  premonition disturbed her now; she rode on, merry, happy, infecting the others
                  with her gayety, until Kenneth Halford forgot that he had long cherished a cynical
                  contempt for unreasoning and unreasonable enjoyment, and yielded to the spell of
                  the hour as entirely as if he had been a boy of eighteen, instead of a stoic of
                  three-and-thirty. He regarded her as a mere child; but it was that very
                  childishness which made her society so agreeable, since, as far as cultivation by
                  study was concerned, she was superior to girls in general.
               A pleasant, idle, unprofitable day; but it fled only too quickly; and through the
                  gorgeous sunset they journeyed back to the inn, with Mont Blanc flaming in the
                  distance, and the changing hues of the mountain ranges fairly making the eyes ache
                  with a sense of beauty. They lingered so long, that the last marvelous rose-tint
                  had faded and the soft twilight lay about as they approached the inn. Milly and
                  Halford were a goodly distance behind the others. Some slight mishap to her
                  saddle—the undoing of a buckle or other trifle—necessitated her dismounting while
                  he arranged it, and he had called to the others to go on, they would not be many
                  moments late.
               He had walked by her side during the whole homeward journey, and their talk had
                  strayed so far from Milly's dreary thoughts of the previous night, that no
                  recollection of them remained in her mind. It had been a rare pleasure to Halford,
                  this whiling her into conversation; an agreeable surprise that she had
                  ideas—strong, vigorous ones, too—and her very simplicity and Utopian fancies
                  rendered the discovery more delightful. He smiled sometimes, compassionating her
                  childish ignorance; yet he liked to see it, and thought to himself what a pity
                  that she could not always remain thus—that the years must change her till she
                  became like the rest of dull mortality; till her eyes lost their mistful
                  innocence, her voice its joyous ring; till, saddest of all, she would live to
                  laugh in bitter scorn at the beautiful fancies which were sacred truths to her
                  now.
               While lifting her into her saddle again, he chanced to say,
               "So you really go to-morrow."
               He was about, man-like, to add some non-sensical words of regret; but the change
                  in her face checked him. His remark had recalled the dark secret—she shivered, and
                  grew pale—looking at him so like a frightened child, that he longed to comfort
                  her.
               "What is it?" he asked.
               "I had forgotten," she said, nervously. "Tomorrow—we are going to-morrow—I shall
                  not have another opportunity to tell you—"
               "I don't think you need to tell me any thing," he answered, kindly. "Perhaps I can
                  imagine what it is—I assure you there is no need."
               "I must," she said, hurriedly; and he appreciated and admired the courage with
                  which she fought down her terror in that determination to do what she considered
                  right. "You—you— Oh, Mr. Halford—that night at Baden!"
               "Don't think I mean an idle compliment, Miss Crofton—it was a very pleasant night
                  to me, since it gave me your acquaintance."
               "You're very good," she said, with a piteous quiver of her lips, and a trembling
                  in her voice which showed how difficult it was to repress her tears. "I don't
                  deserve it—I thank you so much!"
               "Then there's an end," he replied, anxious to spare her pain.
               "No—not till I have told you—I may never see you again—and I couldn't bear to
                  remember always that you thought ill of me—"
               "I am not likely to do that," he interrupted.
               "But you must—you can't help it," she continued, struggling hard to keep her voice
                  firm. "I don't know what I can say to set myself right—only I didn't think—I—"
               She could get no further; she had to turn her head away for a little, and he saw
                  her clench her hands in rage and disgust at her own weakness—that very weakness
                  which he found so bewitching. He still hoped to spare her somewhat; so he
                  said,
               "But you were not to blame for missing your way, or for the rudeness of that
                  brute."
               "Oh, it's not that—you know—that is just because you are kind-hearted, and want me
                  to believe you didn't see me. But you did—afterward I remembered your face so
                  distinctly—looking at me in such a grave, disapproving way. Oh, it makes me so
                  ashamed—ashamed!" she cried, covering her face with her hands.
               He kept his hold of the mule's bridle, and walked slowly on, saying, in a soft,
                  kind voice,
               "You exaggerate the whole thing so much,
                  Miss Crofton! I don't think I looked any serious disapproval—at least, I did not
                  feel it."
               "Oh, don't try to treat it as a joke—don't," she said; "that makes me feel worse
                  than any thing."
               He saw that the only kindness he could show was to speak seriously of the matter,
                  and allow her to ease her mind by full avowal.
               "I have no inclination to do so," he replied. "I am sure you would never have gone
                  to the tables, had you thought how it might appear."
               "Indeed, indeed, I would not! I don't know how it came about—I was bored in the
                  ball-room, because there was nobody I knew, and I thought about playing—it seemed
                  to me I should go wild if I didn't! I never thought about the people—or the
                  wickedness—it seemed such a mere trifle! It wasn't till I had played, and was
                  going away—just as I saw you—that I came to my senses; for I do think I was
                  crazy—I really do."
               "Now is that all?" he asked.
               "Yes—you see it's no excuse! I might talk a week, and I could not make you
                  understand why I did it—I don't know! But oh, I have suffered so—it's not the
                  being found out—do believe that, though it's awful to appear bold and fast—but to
                  have done it!"
               "Your trouble is quite punishment enough," he said; "the harshest judge could not
                  wish you more. Now let me tell you—and I mean it—you have brooded over the thing
                  until it looks much more important in your eyes than it really is."
               She shook her head.
               "You want to comfort me!"
               "I mean to tell you the exact truth—I shall not try to palliate your conduct—that
                  would be a false kindness, in your present state of mind."
               "I feel so wicked!" sighed Milly.
               "My dear Miss Crofton, very few people ever go to Baden without throwing a
                  napoleon on the board once—your feeling in regard to the matter was what every
                  body has. I have many a time seen men let their daughters tease them into
                  permitting one trial. I don't think you did right—"
               "It was awful!" parenthesised Milly.
               "If you had told Mrs. Lawrence, she would have gone with you; and old Noyse would
                  have played for you—it was very wrong to go alone—but, fortunately, nobody
                  recognized you except myself; and I am glad I was there, since it will be better
                  for you to have told some one, instead of brooding longer over your secret."
               "What must you have thought!"
               "I will tell you frankly. I am a rather censorious person—not fond of young
                  ladies, and given to harsh judgments in regard to them—admit that my opinion was
                  likely to be as severe as possible."
               "Tell me," she said; "I'd rather know."
               "My first thought, when I saw your face—how oblivious you were of the crowd—was
                  just this: That little girl deserves to have her ears boxed; but she has not the
                  slightest idea what she is doing; she is neither hold nor fast; she's just a
                  child, and has escaped from her friends for a minute to play, they are the ones to
                  blame, in point of fact. There—is that very dreadful?"
               "And are you really in earnest?" demanded Milly, looking up at him with searching
                  eyes.
               "On my honor," he replied; "and those are words I never use lightly."
               There were a few sudden tears on Milly's cheek, but her face lost its troubled,
                  frightened expression.
               "I know it was very wrong," she said, humbly; "but it's a good deal to think that
                  it didn't make me look so degraded and wicked as I thought."
               He could not repress a smile; she uttered the exaggerated expressions without
                  thinking in the least what they implied.
               "It did not," he said; "and if it didn't sound like lecturing, I would tell you
                  that you may be glad to have done it: the remembrance of that night may often keep
                  you from real imprudences, such as so many of us have to regret."
               "Oh dear, I'll never be bad again!" cried Milly. "Why, it isn't nice a bit."
               "A very happy conclusion to have arrived at so easily," said he, laughing. "Now
                  you don't mean to sit in sackcloth and ashes any longer, I hope!"
               "Indeed, telling you has done me a world of good. Do you think Aunt Eliza ought to
                  know?"
               "I should say not, decidedly," he replied. "It was an act that can have no
                  consequences; so, having spoken of it to the one person who was a witness, there
                  is an end."
               He had to look aside to conceal the smile of amusement at his own grandiloquent
                  phrases; but Milly received them seriously, and drew a deep sigh of relief.
               "I have so dreaded to speak of it," she said.
               "I am very glad you have, since I am able to clear up your ideas a little about
                  the enormity of the affair."
               "I shall always be ashamed," continued Milly: "but I needn't think about it all
                  the time—I really felt I ought, by way of punishment."
               Halford, remembering how humanity in general get away from all recollection of
                  wrongdoing, drown it, bury it in any way, could but wonder afresh at the childish
                  creature so ready to accept the penance she considered her due.
               "You have had punishment enough," he answered. "Promise me that you will forget
                  the whole thing. Come, as I have been your judge, I have a right to insist upon
                  that."
               "If I may—if I ought!"
               "You ought, I assure you; there is nothing so hurtful as to grow morbid by
                  dwelling on errors that have been fully expiated."
               She smiled, dried her eyes, and stretched out her hand impulsively. "I thank you
                  very, very much," she said; "and I don't mean ever to be wicked again."
               Somehow, in looking at her, there rose before his mental vision that image which
                  it had been for years the study of his life to shut out—the face of a girl not
                  much older than Milly at this moment, but very unlike—more matured, more
                  beautiful—already, in many things, a thorough woman. But he had loved her—believed
                  in her—and the end had been that her conduct sent him a wanderer over the earth
                  for a long season, almost depriving him of any possibility of faith.
               Why did that ghost rise now out of his buried past? For years that season had been
                  only a memory—why should Alice Berners's face haunt him now? Unconsciously, he
                  called her by the old name, then remembered that she had not borne it since her
                  girlhood—only a few brief months after listening to his vows, she had exchanged it
                  for another, that ought to have been, he considered, a badge of shame, since she
                  had sold herself, her truth, all that renders womanhood pure and noble, for
                  wealth.
               Milly's voice roused him from his reverie. They were nearing the hotel, and once
                  more she uttered her thanks for his kindness. His mood had changed; he was glad
                  the day had come to an end; why should he interest himself in this child, who,
                  innocent as she seemed, would probably live to wring some honest man's heart?
               "You have given me a very pleasant day, Mr. Halford," Milly said; "I am so, so
                  much obliged."
               He bowed silently; his face looked rather grave and stern.
               "I'm afraid you are tired," she said, a little timidly. "I have wearied you with
                  all my chatter."
               There was no resisting the she glance, the fleeting smile. Halford came resolutely
                  out of his dark thoughts, and thrust those troublesome memories aside, the more
                  vexed at their resurrection because he knew they were only memories. The old love
                  was dead as Pharaoh—if to-morrow he were to stand face to face with the woman
                  Alice Berners had become, she would have no more connection with that past dream
                  and pain than the first stranger he met.
               "It is for me to thank you, Miss Crofton," he said; "I have not enjoyed any thing
                  so much in ages as our expedition."
               "Do you stay here long?" she asked, as they approached the inn.
               "Perhaps a week yet. I am rather an idle man just at present, and it is a pretty
                  place to be lazy in—unless the recollection of this afternoon makes it seem
                  dull."
               "It has been very nice," she said; and he saw that she did not even notice the
                  little old complimentary speech. "How fortunate you are, to be able to
                  travel."
               "You would like to stay longer in Europe?"
               "Oh yes, and see Italy and Greece! Still, I shall be glad to get home—it seems a
                  long time—and next winter will be my first in society," she added, with kindling
                  eyes.
               "I am sure it will be a pleasant one," he said. "I wish there was a probability of
                  my being there to witness your triumphs—I don't believe they will spoil you."
               "I should think not," replied she, gayly; "I shall get rid of this childishness
                  every body laughs at."
               "I hope not," he replied, seriously; "keep it as long as you can."
               "So you don't think of going back?" she asked.
               "My plans are very undecided—at present I can not tell. Will you promise not to
                  have forgotten me, if I should come?" demanded he, with a certain mock earnestness
                  he might have shown had she been in years the child she seemed.
               "Indeed I shall not," she answered, frankly.
               "Ah, but will you be glad to see me?" he persisted.
               "Very glad," she said, as frankly as before—and there was not a tinge of added
                  color in her cheeks—repeating her words with so much earnestness, that she quite
                  forgot even to be shy.
               "I shall recollect that," returned he, still with the playful voice and smile
                  wherewith he would have listened to and answered a child. "Here we are at the
                  inn—our pleasant day is over."
               "It has seemed very short," sighed Milly.
               "Say good-bye now," he urged, holding out his hand before helping her to descend.
                  "The other good-bye will be before all those people, and not count. Remember, you
                  have promised not to forget me, and to be glad if I do appear."
               "I shall remember," she replied; and for the first time her eyes sank under his,
                  and a deepened pink tinged her cheek.
               She slipped past him as he lifted her from the saddle, and ran into the house—the
                  bright day had come to an end.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               THE HAUNTED CHAMBER.
               THE sun stole through the parted curtains, and lighted the room cheerfully; it
                  quite put the fire out of countenance by its rays, roused sweeter odors from the
                  blossoming exotics, and excited the cardinal bird to a loud, triumphant burst of
                  song.
               It was the brightest possible American winter's day; a sufficient suspicion of
                  snow had fallen during the night to bring out the sledges of half the youth of New
                  York, and the tones of the bells rang gayly up to the chamber as the fanciful
                  equipages dashed on toward the Park with their joyous occupants. It was the
                  prettiest room of the prettiest house that Murray Hill could boast—charming and
                  luxurious enough to be the home of a fairy princess; and within its quiet sat the
                  owner and designer of this elegance—a woman so beautiful, that, for several years, her name had been in two continents
                  a synonym for loveliness and grace. There she was, leaning back in a low,
                  easy-chair, her violet dress enhancing the delicacy of her complexion; the
                  luxuriant masses of bronze-tinted hair, banded back from her forehead, catching
                  golden gleams in the sunlight; her great brown eyes gazing absently before her,
                  and the glorious face, which had worked such havoc in countless hearts, a graver
                  and sadder one than those who were only familiar with it as it looked in the
                  world's sight would believe it could ever become.
               The last room, and the last presence, to be haunted by a skeleton; yet there was
                  one there—a grim, pertinacious skeleton, which had dogged Mrs. Marchmont's
                  footsteps for weeks; grown so familiar to her vision, that sometimes she wondered
                  how it was possible he could have escaped the observation of others. He followed
                  her home from last night's ball—haunted her troubled dreams; and this morning,
                  when she left her chamber, and came out into this sunny apartment, half
                  dressing-room, half boudoir, there he was, awaiting her, more lively and animated
                  than ever. He grinned among the scarlet and white flowers, danced about the pure
                  statue of Innocence which some Italian sculptor had sent as a homage to her
                  beauty, and was so jubilant and ubiquitous, that she almost thought he must have
                  hunted up half a dozen of his bony brethren to disturb her. His companionship
                  transformed the regal chamber into a sepulchre—made the sunshine hideous, and the
                  bird's notes a shriek of despair to her ears. She rose at last, and swept the
                  velvet draperies down over the casements, that the softened gloom might leave his
                  society a little less odious than it was in the full daylight.
               The bronze clock on the mantel struck twelve. She had risen earlier than usual
                  this morning, to be ready for the visitor whom she expected; but he had not
                  appeared—no summons had come—no one had intruded upon her since the model French
                  maid stole quietly out, wondering a little, in her dull fashion, what could have
                  made her lady so very matinal after the fatigues of the previous night, which she
                  knew had comprised a dinner, the opera, two balls, and a supper at
                  Delmonico's.
               No visit—not even a letter—and the clock struck twelve! This woman had been all
                  her life so petted and worshiped, that a crowned queen could not have been more
                  indignantly surprised that any mortal should venture to keeping her waiting; and,
                  of all persons in the world, that Richard Faulkner should be guilty of this
                  presumption. She had told him the evening before that she should expect him;
                  actually motioned him to her side in the face and eyes of the whole ball-room to
                  whisper her commands; hating herself and him because the order had to be half an
                  entreaty; shivering inwardly, as she had learned to do within the past month, at
                  the smile on his false mouth, and the mockery which she perceived, or fancied at
                  least, under his affectation of respect. Every thing about him was so hateful—the
                  very scent of hyacinths which always clung to his dress, rendered the beautiful
                  flowers abhorrent to her. She could tell the sound of his foot-steps among a
                  hundred, and no matter how crowded the room, how much occupied she might be, was
                  sure that she felt his odious presence the moment he entered, long before he could
                  bring his bold looks and fulsome flatteries within her reach. How she hated the
                  man! she acknowledged the sentiment to herself, and it was the first time such
                  feelings had ever been wakened in her soul toward any human being—she had not
                  believed her nature capable of them. But she did hate him, with that most active
                  form of repulsion born out of distrust and dread. She admitted this, too, at
                  last—she was afraid; and the very vagueness of her fears rendered them the more
                  unendurable to her impatient temperament.
               As if for the express purpose of allowing that dread to assume a tangible shape
                  and increase, he neglected this morning to obey her imperious request. This was
                  his reason—she felt certain of it—and the fears deepened, and the skeleton danced
                  until the suspense and inaction became worse to bear than the blackest news his
                  deceitful lips could have uttered.
               It was an odd secret which gave those two a certain community of interests during
                  this season. People had marveled somewhat that she, coquette as she was, could
                  have taken leisure from the scores of her victims to subjugate Dick Faulkner, in
                  spite of the fact that his successes in Wall Street made him, to a certain extent,
                  a power in these days. Naturally, they attributed her conduct to her boundless
                  love of power—her unwillingness that any man, however doubtful his position or
                  morals, should escape her thralldom; but even when she knew him better than now,
                  Alice Marchmont would as soon have dreamed of flirting with a cobra as this
                  monarch of the Gold-room and share-market. Her most intimate friend had no
                  perception of the truth. That she, with her reputation for vast wealth, could be
                  troubled by business embarrassments, did not occur to any one, though her name was
                  a by-word even in Paris for extravagance; and Worth averred, during the last days
                  of the Empire, that when Madame Metternich herself turned ruefully away at the
                  price set on some fresh emanation of his genius, the famous American beauty was
                  ready to seize it, and add a still larger bribe to prevent any sister-woman
                  obtaining a duplicate of the costume.
               She had been running a mad race ever since the days when she threw off her widow's
                  weeds. She had dashed along the road to ruin in a triumphal chariot, stimulated to
                  increased speed by the plaudits of the crowd that bowed in adoration about her
                  course. There was no one to exercise the slightest restraint over her actions; no
                  one to offer advice; and she had the most delightful ignorance in regard to money,
                  beyond spending it lavishly so long as it could be obtained. Now' when a person's
                  ordinary expenses are nearly double that person's income, and there are a thousand
                  extraordinary expenses weekly indulged, it is not surprising that the unfortunate
                  should at length be brought to understand the fact that there is an end to all
                  things. Mrs. Marchmont found herself overwhelmed with debts; absolutely badgered
                  and bothered by the trades-people who had been, at first, so happy to do whatever
                  lay in their power to minister to the petted, luxurious life which was regal
                  indeed in its triumphs and glitter. She only knew that she could borrow money, and
                  she did, of course paying exorbitant rates of interest, and adding more and more
                  to the reckoning which loomed beyond. Actually, she did not think of the future.
                  To queen it in society—to be noted for her lavish expenditure—to have every man
                  she met at her feet—to make prudent people's hair stand on end with horror, yet
                  force the whole world to admit that whatever she did was charming—she had thought
                  very little beyond these determinations. Very little, save when something in her
                  soul fretted and moaned, and she grew dissatisfied and wretched over the emptiness
                  of existence, and thought how different her destiny might be if she had only grown
                  up under other teachings than those of her girlhood—had been left her youth and
                  love, and all that was gone forever.
               But such regrets only rendered her more imprudent. Like the rest of us, she
                  contented herself with blaming her relatives—fate—any thing and any body—instead
                  of trying, so far as in her lay, to set straight the thwarted life even then. She
                  hurried on and on—or allowed herself to be carried blindly forward—until, during
                  the past summer, she reached the consummation of her folly. She was at Newport,
                  and Dick Faulkner and his wife were there—Dick Faulkner, grown famous of late
                  through his successes in Wall Street, and so notorious for his vices, that one
                  could not easily understand how husbands and fathers were able to tolerate his
                  presence near their womenkind. But, unfortunately, many of the male guardians
                  afore-said were so deeply interested in Dick's bubbles and speculations, that it
                  was not possible to offer him the cold shoulder in a social way. Mrs. Marchmont
                  disliked the man, and would perhaps have set the example of treating him as he
                  deserved, had not his wife been foolish enough to oppose her on several occasions;
                  and Mrs. Marchmont could not resist amusing herself at the vicious creature's
                  expense. She tormented her by graciousness to Dick; and though that was bad
                  enough, no harm need have come of her unworthy caprice, had she not been seized
                  with the idea of making the man useful.
               Several times she had—like most people during the past ten years—indulged in a
                  little gambling, done under the pretty and respectable name of speculation in
                  stocks. Some Wall Street broker had taken "flyers" for her, and she had called the
                  pleasant gains fairy gold, and, before she was aware, developed a finely-grown
                  taste for the excitement. Knowing less than nothing of business, she had only
                  vague ideas that, if she bought certain stocks, or allowed Faulkner to buy them
                  for her, and he turned them over—whatever that mysterious process might mean—she
                  should be certain to win thousands, and all in a moment; no tiresome waiting—that
                  was the most satisfactory part of the alluring vision.
               Any terms which placed him on a familiar and confidential footing with Alice
                  Marchmont were pleasant ones to Faulkner. He divined her wishes at the first hint,
                  and entered into her plans with great eagerness. Positively, while still at
                  Newport, he handed her an amount which put her mind at ease for the rest of her
                  stay, by settling a modistés account that was nearly as long as one of
                  Mademoiselle do Scudery's romances, and showed more imagination in embroidering
                  plain facts. And all Alice had done was to give him an inconsiderable sum. Oh, at
                  this rate, she should soon not only be free from worry, but there was no end to
                  the delightful possibilities which might occur. Dick Faulkner certainly was not an
                  agreeable person to admit into her circle; but in those days he was respectful,
                  almost shy in his manners; and a doubt that the time might come when she should
                  find it difficult to keep him in order, never occurred to her; for Alice prided
                  herself, like so many women, on the fact that no man had ever dared to utter a
                  word—however plainly he might betray his feelings in his face—which could cause
                  her annoyance. She prided herself on this always, during her married days, as if
                  it presented an excuse for her flirtations. She forgot, as women do in their love
                  of adulation, that to go near enough the verge of propriety for a man to have an
                  opportunity of entertaining wrong wishes, was a degradation, and a stain upon her
                  soul, as real and ineffaceable as if she had listened to vows which ought never to
                  reach her ears. But she did not think of Dick Faulkner in any other light than as
                  a person who might be useful—whom she repaid sufficiently by the honor of leading
                  her to her carriage, or holding her bouquet while she danced.
               Of course, she began the season's campaign in the maddest fashion, on the strength
                  of her successes and brilliant visions. Winter was more than half over now, and
                  she discovered that not only were her debts doubled, but loss after loss had
                  followed, until she owed Faulkner a sum so large that she dared not reckon it, and
                  had no more idea how he was to be repaid than she had what was to become of her
                  after the rumbling in every direction burst in one grand earthquake.
               But dreadful' as such reflections were, there was a worse fear in her mind, roused
                  by the change in Faulkner's manner as the weeks went on, and day by day she found
                  herself more deeply involved in the web of his countless schemes. This man, once so respectful, almost
                  timid, had dared to treat her in a way which forced her to contemplate the
                  possibility of reaching a crisis when the charmed atmosphere which had hitherto
                  enveloped her life should be sullied by the disclosure of a disgraceful
                  secret.
               So far she got in her thoughts this morning; then could endure her solitary vigil
                  no longer. The skeleton leaped higher in his hideous dance, and grinned with more
                  appalling malice. She rose quickly and rang the bell—Pauline the patient appeared
                  in an instant.
               "Are there no letters?" her mistress asked. No letters whatever; but if madame
                  pleased, it was one o'clock, and Miss Livermore and her sister were below.
               "That is nothing to me; they are Miss Portman's friends," Mrs. Marchmont
                  replied.
               But if madame pleased, Mrs. Townley's carriage had just driven to the door, and
                  Miss James was with her. Evidently it did not please madame, for she said,
                  impatiently,
               "I don't know why they come at this unholy hour; it is not my day—I don't think
                  I'll see any body."
               "But madame has forgotten—I beg madame's pardon—they were all invited to
                  luncheon," returned Pauline in a deprecating voice, which was an annoyance of
                  itself.
               "So they were—I did not remember it; very well, I will go down. And no letters—you
                  are sure?"
               "Ah, madame!" cried Pauline. If she had talked a week, she could not so eloquently
                  have expressed her sense of injury at the doubt implied of her faithfulness by
                  this repetition.
               "Yes—you would have brought them at once—you never forget any thing," her mistress
                  said, kindly.
               The very depth of darkness to which her fancies had plunged during the last hour
                  brought a reaction. Faulkner's silence was a good sign—this very morning the
                  long-delayed rise in that wonderful stock of which she had hoped so much, might
                  take place. It had been only a matter of time—Peep-of-Day was sure to succeed—it
                  had glittered too famously to be a mere bubble! At this moment, perhaps, Dick
                  Faulkner was bidding it up in the Board—too busy to recollect her note. Before
                  night she should have news—good news; for if only the expected rise took place she
                  should gain thousands upon thousands. Her debt to Faulkner would appear the
                  veriest trifle; not only that, but her other embarrassments could be cleared away.
                  She would take her fairy gold and rest content—nothing should ever tempt her into
                  another speculation. Faulkner would slip naturally back into his rightful place—a
                  man to be cavalierly smiled upon—invited, perhaps, to her general parties—but in
                  no way to have a closer connection with her life.
               She was too variable in her moods for the Frenchwoman to feel the slightest
                  surprise at the sudden change which came over her face; though, familiar as she
                  was with its beauty, she could not help wondering at the loveliness of the smile
                  that beamed upon her.
               "I'll go down to the people, Pauline—I hope I'm not hideous this morning?"
               The Parisian could only lift her hands again—language was too inexpressive just
                  now. Mrs. Marchmont laughed, and passed down into the room where her guests
                  waited, as charming in words and manner as if they had been a group of men to be
                  subjugated, instead of members of her own sex.
               "This has been the longest morning I ever spent!" she exclaimed; and there was
                  such sincerity in her tone that they believed her, females though they were, and
                  actually thought she had been anxiously anticipating their arrival. "Now who has
                  any news—I am famished for something in the way of novelty."
               "There's a great stir in Congress over Hamilton's Bill," said the elder of the two
                  old maids, who prided herself on reading the political journals, and liked to
                  present the opinions she gleaned therefrom.
               Mrs. Townley and Miss James looked distressed at once—if the ancient cat got off
                  on that theme, there was an end to all enjoyment.
               "Is there, indeed?" demanded Mrs. Marchmont in the most interested voice, as she
                  gave her two despairing friends a mischievous glance. "You must tell us about it—I
                  never find time to read the newspapers."
               The two butterflies showed their trouble still more plainly, and the antique
                  virgin at once assumed her oracular attitude, and prepared to pour forth a flood
                  of eloquence; but Mrs. Marchmont had no intention of permitting that.
               "Yes, you must tell us," she continued, quickly; "your views on political matters
                  are always so lucid and correct, dear Miss Livermore; but we'll save them for
                  luncheon. I'm only a silly, frivolous creature, though I do admire wisdom—at a
                  respectful distance—and what I want first is gossip—I always mean gossip when I
                  ask for news—I'm insatiable in that line."
               The butterflies brightened into smiles of relief—the present demand was quite
                  within the scope of their powers, and more than a recreation—the serious business
                  of their lives. But before they could commence either of the half-dozen stories
                  which they always had on hand, Miss Portman, seldom as she spoke, felt it her duty
                  to defend her relative from that self-imposed injustice.
               "My dear," she quavered, "how can you say such things!"
               "Oh, I adore gossip—it's of no use for me to deny it! Do you think I am willing to
                  believe people are so much better than I know I am? It's such a relief to hear of
                  all sorts of weaknesses and lapses on the part of one's friends."
               "I'm sure every body's friends give sufficient opportunity," said Mrs. Townley,
                  laughing.
               "Oh, you feel malicious this morning," returned Alice; "now that's delightful!
                  Among us, we'll not leave a human creature a shred of character by the time
                  luncheon is over—apropos, there's Ferguson to announce it."
               They followed her into the breakfast-room, and she continued—
               "Now Miss Portman is just as crazy for news as I, though she does pretend to be
                  virtuous—you know you are, Adeliza."
               The meek, elderly lady was a distant connection of the late Mr. Marchmont's, who
                  lived with the beautiful widow and played propriety—a creature so quiet and
                  inoffensive, that I must describe her at once, lest I forget the fact of her
                  existence. Alice was kind to her pale shadow of decorum, and tried often to give
                  her a share in conversation; but Miss Portman invariably waved off the opportunity
                  with a little nervous gesture, and had nothing beyond a weak smile, and faint
                  ejaculations to offer. She was one of those persons born never to be of any
                  consequence—not even recollected; still, she evidently had a use in the world,
                  since dashing young women without natural protectors require a show of
                  companionship.
               She was as mild and timid as a mouse; and indeed she rather looked like one—a
                  Chinese mouse at that, if the small animals there follow the example of Celestial
                  humans, in having their eyes turn up at the corners. Her voice, too, assisted the
                  resemblance—a sort of quavering, hesitating squeak, all the odder from the fact
                  that she was tall and straight, and so stiff that strangers often mistook her
                  shyness for dignity, and were afraid of her. I have nothing for her to say or do,
                  because she never said or did any thing; and perhaps the best idea I can give of
                  her is to repeat an anecdote with which Mrs. Marchmont once convulsed her friend
                  John Worthington. The poor woman had vexed her one evening by sitting a little
                  party through where every body else talked—just a little knot of Alice's
                  agreeables—upright and patient as a ghost, smiling painfully at intervals, but not
                  so much as uttering a strangled squeak when caught in the trap of other people's
                  conversation.
               "Dear Miss Portman," said Alice, "I wish you could help play the hostess rather
                  more—it would relieve me a great deal."
               "My love," returned she, in a deprecating tone, "what more could I do?"
               "You best of old souls! Look energetic; go about among the tiresome creatures, and
                  talk to them."
               "My dear," she answered, in a voice which began to quaver ominously, for she was
                  sensitive to a shadow of reproach, "I am sure I smiled whenever any body told a
                  story! I said excellent to Mr. Worthington's anecdote, though I did not understand
                  it—for I have the highest respect for him—and I changed my position twice."
               "So," said Alice, in repeating the conversation, "I kissed her, and told her she
                  was a duck, and that her positions were both beautiful."
               After that, it was a standing joke among Mrs. Marchmont's intimates to ask her if
                  she had changed her position lately; and dear Miss Portman always smiled when she
                  heard the question addressed to her relative, because she saw that there was a
                  jest intended, though it had no special signification to the placid pool she
                  called her mind. So now, when Alice appealed to her, Miss Portman gave the
                  requisite smile, and changed her position immediately. Mrs. Marchmont had done her
                  duty, and could leave the poor soul at peace for a time.
               "The last news I have heard," said Mrs. Townley, "is that you are to marry your
                  French baron."
               "Bless me, that's stale," returned Alice; "people have said it now for ten days; I
                  must give them something new! I always feel injured if the reports about me don't
                  change at least twice a week."
               The idle stream of chatter went on; but though she played her part admirably, Mrs.
                  Marchmont had leisure to think of other things. Her morning's uneasiness
                  occasionally recurred; each time she heard the door-bell, she fancied that it
                  might be the expected letter; but it did not come. The baron's name, too,
                  suggested fresh thoughts; for once flung into the conversation, it was bandied
                  about for several moments. The creature had fallen helplessly, dazed at the first
                  sight of her—there might be worse fates than becoming a baroness—she had never
                  before contemplated the possibility except in jest; but with this new fear of Dick
                  Faulkner in her mind, any chance which would take her completely out of her
                  present life possessed a certain charm.
               When she could listen again, a new name had come up—she caught it—a name no one
                  had mentioned in her hearing for years. How it carried her thoughts back into the
                  past—into the days of her girlhood, when she had been full of hopes and dreams
                  rudely dashed out of existence by hands stronger than her youthful will.
               "Is 
                     is
                     it
                   possible!" the elder Miss Livermore exclaimed. "Kenneth Halford back—I
                  wonder I had not heard of it."
               "Oh, he only landed yesterday; I dare say, though, Mrs. Granger has already
                  secured him for her ball—she's the most inveterate lion-hunter, that woman,"
                  returned Mrs. Townley.
               "So Kenneth Halford has come home," pursued Miss Livermore.
               "How odd!" added her sister. "Did you hear, Mrs. Marchmont?" she continued, with a
                  meaning inflection of voice.
               Mrs. Marchmont had been busy giving some whispered direction to Ferguson; she
                  turned now, and said,
               "I beg your pardon! There's a new plat on my
                  mind that I begged the chef to try! Who has come
                  back?"
               The virgin sisters replied together, one in a voice that squeaked, the other in a
                  deep barytone.
               
               "Kenneth Halford."
               "What a resurrection!" laughed Mrs. Marchmont.
               "I don't remember him," said Miss James.
               "Oh, he was rather before your time," observed Mrs. Townley, "and mine too; for I
                  lived in Albany in those days; but I recollect all about him; yes, indeed—eh, Mrs.
                  Marchmont?"
               "He is a very old friend of mine," she said, as composedly as if the significant
                  tone had been lost upon her.
               The ancient virgins laughed, and Miss Portman looked distressed. "Dear me, what is
                  it?" cried Miss James, nearly wild with curiosity at once. "There's some mystery,
                  I'm sure!"
               "None that I know of," returned Mrs. Marchmont. "I said he was an old friend; I
                  shall be glad to see him again."
               "Shall you, really?" demanded the younger sister, while the elder chuckled,
               "Oh yes! a very old friend; I think we all remember."
               Mrs. Marchmont never allowed any human being to attack her without making the
                  reckless person sorry. She paid a few compliments to the man of whom they had
                  spoken, as calmly as if he had been an indifferent acquaintance, instead of the
                  one love of her girlhood; then she asked Miss Livermore, "Is it true that your
                  cousin, Mrs. Grayson, is coming home?"
               The old maid colored, well tanned as nearly sixty years had left her complexion,
                  and stammered out such answer as she could find, while her sister choked herself
                  with a glass of water, and Mrs. Townley and Helen James enjoyed their distress.
                  Mrs. Grayson had not set foot in her native country for more than five years; and
                  this story of her return, which had lately spread about, was misery to every body
                  connected with her; for she had long before gone so far over the pale of
                  propriety, that her memoirs would have filled three volumes.
               It was a cruel thrust, and Alice felt ashamed a moment after it was dealt. She
                  tried to atone by overwhelming Miss Livermore with attentions, and actually forced
                  the others to endure a long recital of the spinster's views in regard to the
                  political state of the country. Once mounted on her hobby, it was difficult to
                  unseat her. She pranced over into England—descended upon humiliated France—pointed
                  out the duty of Victor Emanuel—and even penetrated into Russia, and galloped a
                  little about Poland, before she could be checked.
               Two or three men called while they were at the table, and were allowed to enter;
                  the reunion was as pleasant and gay as any festivity always was in Alice
                  Marchmont's house, and the morning wore on. It was a terribly long one; she
                  fervently wished her guests at least in the frozen regions over which Miss
                  Livermore had pranced on her hobby-horse; but there was no trace of fatigue or
                  preoccupation in features or manner. She laughed and talked, dazzled and flattered
                  mon and women alike, able as ever to make either friend or foe admit that she was
                  the loveliest and wittiest of her sex.
               The day drifted on; but no message came from Faulkner. At one moment she was able
                  to believe it a good omen; at the next, her dark forebodings would start up with
                  new force, and it seemed impossible to wait in this passive inactivity. So many
                  other thoughts, too, in her mind—this new idea in regard to the baron; and as she
                  contemplated it, his studied manner, his long-winded compliments, appeared more
                  wearisome than ever. And Kenneth Halford back—it seemed strange that he should
                  have returned at this precise juncture. But he was nothing to her; it could only
                  be a pain to see any ghost rise out of that dead past which often—when she had
                  leisure to look back—seemed so beautiful through the mists of distance.
               No message—no letter! The day got on—at least she should find Dick Faulkner at
                  Mrs. Granger's ball. There were other duties to be performed before she got there;
                  a dinner—a reception by one of the stateliest of the old Knickerbocker families,
                  people who despised such mushrooms as Mrs. Granger and her set. It was a long time
                  to wait before she could get within the man's reach—his detested, odious presence;
                  and to wait with even a show of patience was a lesson Alice Marchmont had never
                  learned.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               AT A BALL.
               MRS. GRANGER gave her ball that night; and it was one of the most brilliant of the
                  whole season. Among all the faces there, Milly Crofton's was the freshest and the
                  fairest girl-face to be seen, and her enjoyment of the evening something for older
                  people to marvel at, it was so unalloyed. It had been altogether a bright,
                  charming winter, though perhaps misanthropic sages would have pronounced it a
                  somewhat unprofitable one; but Milly was troubled by no such doubts. Very charming
                  it had been, with its balls, its operas, its pretty new dresses, and the pleasant
                  success which her introduction into society proved. Mrs. Remsen was too wise to
                  allow her to rush about until she wore the first freshness off her face and
                  thoughts, as so many girls do, before their opening season is half over, and the
                  experienced lady understood, too, the wisdom of making her charge a little
                  difficult to get at—among the earliest to leave places of amusement, and to be
                  carefully guarded from detrimentals who only meant flirtation, instead of serious
                  business.
               Milly had returned from Europe early in the autumn, and brought with her the
                  prettiest possible wardrobe, which wise Aunt Eliza had instructed Mrs. Crittendon
                  to purchase in Paris, and to which that lady had made many charming additions on
                  her own account. The elderly couple were sorry to give the girl up, but it was
                  decided that they must go to Havana for the winter, and Mrs. Remsen would not hear
                  of Milly's accompanying them. She found her niece so much improved and beautified
                  by her foreign travel, that she was anxious to exhibit her to society, and her old
                  love of managing and match-making rose with new keenness in her mind.
               She was a born match-maker, this smooth, plausible lady: it is a firm belief of
                  mine that all women have a genius for something; and match-making was Mrs.
                  Remsen's specialty. She had been at the business for years, yet always managed so
                  artfully that nobody ever thought of calling her by the odious name which less
                  astute feminines receive with much less reason.
               She had married off numberless relatives and friends long before; two of her
                  daughters were already provided for—brilliantly, so far as wealth and position
                  went, and fortunate, besides, in the personal character of their husbands. One of
                  the pair had been intellectual, and almost strong-minded; oddly enough, she was
                  the pretty daughter. The other—Adelaide Ramsay—was ugly, and not over-furnished
                  with brains. Things ought to have been differently arranged; the intellectual
                  young lady should have given up the pretty face to the dunce; but Mrs. Remsen made
                  the best of matters. The discrepancies between looks and tastes only amused her,
                  and rendered her more determined to outgeneral destiny. She succeeded, and people
                  considered her the most fortunate woman in the world, and held her opinions in the
                  highest respect.
               She had still three daughters on her hands; but two of them were children yet, and
                  Maud, the elder, a year younger than Milly Crofton, and doomed to retirement for
                  the present—a fate against which the young lady stoutly rebelled; for she was the
                  most unpromising charge that Mrs. Remsen had ever possessed. Indeed, the mother
                  confessed to herself that Maud was an idiot; but she promised to be a pretty one,
                  and there was still the hope left that another year might soften her asperities of
                  character somewhat, or, at least, teach her to conceal them under a polish of
                  manner which Mrs. Remsen felt to be sadly wanting. But at present her mind was
                  occupied with Milly Crofton. Milly was the only child of Mrs. Remsen's
                  best-beloved sister, and had been treated with the same affection and interest
                  that the lady bestowed upon her own daughters; indeed, she was fonder of Milly, at
                  the bottom of her heart, than she was of the elder members of her own brood. She
                  had a habit of always looking things straight in the face, and did not try to
                  disguise from herself the fact that Milly, childish as she was, possessed more
                  head and heart than her two put together; and she was glad to see that the little
                  ones resembled their cousin much more than they did their sisters.
               She had done her best to make Milly's winter successful; and it had proved so,
                  though Mrs. Remsen began to fear that the season would end without the girl's
                  being engaged and settled, and she had not looked forward to giving her a second
                  chance. Maud's turn must come next year, and she could not afford the expense of
                  two young women to dress and take out. However, she had not opened her lips to
                  Milly. If nothing better offered, the child must accept an elderly man, as each of
                  her own daughters had done, or else resign herself to Charley Thorne, a young
                  fellow with any quantity of money and no brains to mention. But the idea was a
                  disappointment to Mrs. Remsen; cold and worldly as she was, she would have been
                  glad to see Milly live the girlish romance suitable to her age—but a wise one,
                  with a rich man—if possible, a famous one—for the hero. She felt a little vexed
                  with destiny for not having thrown any such in the way, and sometimes wished that
                  she had been rich enough to take Milly back to Europe for a year. She knew, of
                  course, of the acquaintance with Kenneth Halford; Mrs. Lawrence had told her how
                  much he appeared struck with Milly; and it seemed a pity that fate, after
                  commencing the acquaintance between the two in a sensational and poetic manner,
                  should have provided no materials for a closing act. Halford had not a vast
                  fortune, but he was rich; and, added to that, had already acquired an enviable
                  reputation, both as a diplomatist and as a man of letters. Mrs. Remsen felt that
                  destiny had treated her ill, and chafed accordingly. But the very morning of Mrs.
                  Granger's ball, she discovered that she had been hasty in blaming the much-abused
                  old dame—Kenneth Halford had actually returned—fate had once more brought him
                  within the sphere of Milly's influence; and before she returned home, Mrs. Remsen
                  had arranged the finale of the romance to suit herself. She did not mention the
                  news that had reached her; she only made sure that Milly wore her prettiest
                  Parisian dress—which had been saved for some especially grand occasion—and saw
                  that the girl was looking more lovely than ever.
               "Will I do, aunty?" Milly asked, as she entered Mrs. Remsen's room for inspection,
                  after her toilet was finished.
               Then it was that Mrs. Remsen surveyed her critically, and decided that, so far as
                  young girls were concerned, not one who might be at the ball would compare with
                  Milly.
               "I never saw you look so well—I am content," she said, with a low sigh of
                  satisfaction, which Milly perfectly understood. Mrs. Remsen must have been in a
                  high state of contentment when she gave that peculiar sigh.
               Maud the rebellious happened to be in her mother's chamber, and, though not
                  particularly acute, she comprehended the meaning of the long-drawn breath; and
                  that sign of approval, added to Milly's beaming loveliness, was more than the
                  rebellious could endure.
               "Any body could look pretty in a dress like that!" cried she, with an acrimony
                  that made her mother shudder to think what an awful old maid she would be if some unfortunate man did not
                  prevent the catastrophe. "When I come out, mamma, I shall remember all the things
                  you let Milly get in Paris; Adelaide says that it's more than you ever did for
                  her."
               "I hope, at least, that Adelaide said it in a more lady-like voice," replied Mrs.
                  Remsen, calmly. "I beg, Maud, that you will not touch my powder—you will ruin your
                  complexion."
               "Oh, I'm of no consequence," cried Maud, spitefully; "nobody is, except
                  Milly."
               "You are cross to-night, Maud," said Milly, laughing, too happy to pay much
                  attention to her cousin's ill humor.
               "I'm nothing of the sort," asserted Maud.
               "If you must contradict, at least do it in a lower tone, I beg," said her mother,
                  resignedly, quite aware that a little quiet contempt was a more effectual way of
                  subduing the young woman than any assertion of authority. "Also, let me set you
                  right in one particular, and Mrs. Ramsay, too—Milly's own money paid for her
                  winter's wardrobe; we had saved a good while for that express purpose. When your
                  day for ball-dresses comes, I hope you will receive a little of the attention
                  Milly gets so freely on all sides, and I should like to think that it would not
                  turn your head any more than it does hers."
               Maud gave the footstool at her feet a vicious kick; she pretended that it was
                  accidental; but her mother and cousin knew that if ever a kick was given with
                  malice prepense, this was the time.
               "We will say good-night to you, Maud," said Mrs. Remsen, with awful courtesy; and
                  Maud departed.
               That silly little Milly could not bear to have her in an ill temper, so kept her
                  aunt waiting while she sought Maud and coaxed her back to amiability—a state of
                  affairs only to be arrived at by a present of a large packet of bonbons and a
                  neck-ribbon; and then Maud grew radiant, only assuring her cousin that the new
                  French dress was not nearly so becoming as mamma pretended to believe.
               Mrs. Remsen and Milly set off for the ball; and as soon as she entered the rooms,
                  the girl was so beset by partners and flatterers, that the aunt's anticipations of
                  triumph were fully realized. Kenneth Halford was not present; but before she had
                  been five minutes there, Mrs. Remsen contrived, without asking a question, to
                  learn that he was expected. Mrs. Granger had heard of his arrival, and immediately
                  pounced upon him on the strength of an old acquaintanceship, that she might be the
                  first to exhibit him since his return to his former friends, possessed of the
                  twofold advantages of wealth and position.
               Mrs. Remsen was as kind as ever to Charley Thorne; but as he hovered about Milly,
                  teasing her for more dances than she had a right to give to one man, talking a
                  great deal of nonsense in a merry, happy fashion, that lady allowed herself to
                  think what a poor, weak, frivolous boy he was, and how much better it would be if
                  he were compelled to work, instead of being led into numberless follies by his
                  great fortune.
               Milly danced and enjoyed herself greatly; and at the end of a galop, as her
                  partner led her back to her seat, she saw a gentleman conversing with her aunt;
                  and though his back was toward her, and she had no idea that the person of whom he
                  reminded her was within a thousand leagues and more of the spot, her heart beat
                  fast, and she did not venture to look again lest she should be convinced of her
                  mistake. It was very natural that Kenneth Halford should have been often in her
                  mind, from the peculiar circumstances of their acquaintance; but she was
                  unconscious how persistently her thoughts had dwelt upon that season, or of how
                  much consequence it was in her life.
               But in another moment the well-remembered face was bending toward her, and the
                  low, soft voice said,
               "Miss Crofton promised not to forget me; I hope she has not forgotten her
                  pledge."
               "I am so very, very glad to see you," Milly answered, through her blushes and
                  smiles. "I saw you as I came up, but thought that I must be mistaken."
               "And I saw you, too, while you were dancing," he said; "but I knew that I made no
                  mistake."
               Mrs. Remsen smiled amiably, and joined just enough in the conversation, until some
                  friend sat down beside her and began to talk, and she was able to leave the pair
                  to themselves for a little, having made sure that Milly was looking and behaving
                  just as she ought.
               "I had been renewing my acquaintance with your aunt," he went on; "she was good
                  enough to remember me."
               "Oh yes; when I spoke about you to her, she said that she always liked you very
                  much."
               "Then you did remember to speak of me?"
               "I should be very ungrateful if I had not," Milly said.
               "Oh, I'll not be remembered out of gratitude," returned he, gayly. "But you
                  promised to be glad to see me if I came home."
               "When did you get here?" Milly asked, instead of replying to the words, though her
                  face rendered an answer unnecessary.
               "Only the day before yesterday. We had a passage as smooth and pleasant as if it
                  had been June. Now tell me what you have been doing—have you enjoyed your
                  winter?"
               "Yes; it has been very nice indeed."
               "I am glad of that! I imagined that it had; for I met Mrs. Lawrence this morning,
                  and she told me so much about the admiration you received, that I was half afraid
                  I might find you altered."
               "What a very weak head you must give me credit for possessing," Milly said,
                  laughing.
               "I don't know if that would be a sign, only I liked to think I should find you the
                  same."
               "And I am," she replied; "I'm not very nice, but I don't think the winter has done
                  me any hurt; I have been very happy, and they say happiness is good for
                  people."
               "I am sure it is—at least for you."
               "Have you come back to America to stay?" she asked.
               "My movements are uncertain; I shall be here until spring, at least. I must see
                  how I am treated by you and the rest of my friends, before I decide to stay
                  longer."
               Milly thought how pleasant it would be to meet him at balls and parties—to have
                  him visit at the house; but her reflections did not go beyond those simple
                  details.
               "I have not danced in a long time," he said; "would you dare try this redowa with
                  me? I may be very awkward, I warn you in advance."
               But Milly was not afraid, and he led her off, while Charley Thorne, once more
                  trying to get into her neighborhood, watched the proceeding in silent wrath, and
                  decided that, of all prigs with an immense opinion of themselves, this man was the
                  worst.
               "And he must be no end of an age, too," thought Charley, with the natural scorn of
                  an American youth of one-and-twenty for any body who had gone a decade beyond that
                  season. "The idea of his dancing—why he's old enough to have the gout! I can
                  remember seeing him when I wore petticoats; and he was old then."
               But the fossil, as Charley wished to believe him, certainly had not forgotten how
                  to dance; and when the music ceased, he stood by Milly and talked until somebody
                  came to claim her according to promise, and Charley found no opportunity of
                  getting near. Halford conversed with Mrs. Remsen for a few moments, and then
                  sauntered away through the rooms; but he did not dance, except that once with
                  Milly.
               Charley Thorne felt it his duty to watch this man, about whom he was inclined to
                  fancy something dark and mysterious; and whether dancing or uttering the little
                  remarks which he fondly believed conversation, he always had an eye upon Halford.
                  He saw him approach Milly several times in the intervals of the dances; and at
                  last, when it came Charley's turn to have another waltz with her, this fellow
                  positively kept near and chatted with her each time they stopped to rest, and, to
                  make matters worse, was civil and good-natured to Charley himself, which the boy
                  felt was more than he could endure.
               "I don't see what he's here for," Thorne grumbled to Milly, as they were whirling
                  about again like two Dervishes; "he's old enough to have seen the folly of such
                  amusements, you know—why, he might have danced with your aunt when she was
                  young."
               "Who—old Mr. Edmonds?" asked Milly, innocently.
               "No; that Halford! I say, I don't see that he's so very stunning, that they need
                  all make such a row about him."
               "Oh, I don't know; I haven't thought," replied Milly, with half-unconscious
                  deceit. "But you are cross to-night; you don't dance half so well as usual"—this
                  last remark a little feminine scratch, which she could not resist the pleasure of
                  giving him, as a punishment for his impertinence in regard to Halford.
               Poor Charley had but three strong points—dancing, skating, and billiards; it was
                  rather hard to be accused of falling off in the very one of the brief list upon
                  which he most prided himself.
               "Why, Miss Jones said she thought I was a better stepper each time I took her
                  out," he said, pathetically.
               "Very well; if you think Miss Jones's opinion more likely to be correct than
                  mine—" began Milly; but he interrupted her with an indignant gurgle and moan.
               "You know I don't; I think nobody's opinion of so much importance as yours."
               "But when it comes to hearing Miss Jones quoted in defiance to me!" cried Milly,
                  laughing; for it was all play to her, and she really had no idea that the poor
                  fellow was as wretched as his limited capacities would permit. "I really can not
                  allow that; Miss Jones is the bitterest enemy I have in the world."
               "Oh, by Jove, that's strong, you know!"
               "But true! Didn't she, the night of Mrs. Lawrence's tableaux, try to spoil my pale
                  blue dress by wearing a bright blue, and ruin my poor little seed pearls—or the
                  effect of them—with her great monstrous things, that look like so many blisters?
                  Of course she's my enemy; I'm astonished that you should ever dance with her or
                  look at her."
               "I won't," gasped Charley, "if you tell me not."
               "Don't be a goose," said Milly; "of course, I was only laughing at you."
               She had known Charley Thorne all her life, and considered herself much the elder,
                  though he had three years the advantage, in point of fact. It was nice to have him
                  an obedient slave; but it never occurred to Milly that be could be foolish enough
                  to get in earnest, or expect her to regard him as other than an old playmate and
                  friend.
               "You laugh at me a great deal," sighed Charley.
               "Of course I do; it's good for you! But don't you see that the people are all
                  stopping, and the music, too? We can't hop about here with no accompaniment, for
                  the general amusement!"
               Fate was not kind to Charley Thorne tonight. They had not taken ten steps, when
                  they met Mrs. Granger and Kenneth Halford; and that lady said,
               "Oh, Milly, do show Mr. Halford the conservatory; I want him to decide about the
                  Egyptian thing."
               Charley Thorne wished her dead and embalmed along with the Pharaohs; but, as if
                  not content with having stabbed him to the heart, she turned the knife round and
                  round with fiendish pleasure.
               "I want you too, Mr. Thorne," she said; "you have not been presented to my
                     little cousin from Washington, and I
                  wish you to know her."
               Charley could only bow and grind his teeth.
               "You know what Mrs. Faulkner said, Milly," pursued the lady, "about it's not being
                  Egyptian—we can easily settle the question now."
               She sailed away, bearing the unfortunate youth with her, who cast one last
                  backward glance for the express purpose of driving himself to despair by seeing
                  that Milly did not even notice his departure.
               "By Jove," thought Charley, "I feel like one of Owen Meredith's poems! I'd like to
                  set my bull terrier on this old woman."
               "You are to show me the conservatory and the Egyptian thing; it's not a mummy, is
                  it?" asked Halford.
               "No; it's a plant with a dreadfully long name; but it's very pretty," Milly
                  said.
               So they walked out of the ball-room, through a salon, and entered the
                  conservatory, talking gayly as they went.
               The arrivals had long been over. Most persons who danced had already worn the
                  freshness of their enjoyment; and the greater portion of those who had not, had
                  probably grown as weary as people do, night after night, in the performance of
                  their duty toward society. It was, therefore, vexatious to hear a name announced
                  with great energy by the domestic guardians outside, and to see Mrs. Marchmont
                  enter, in the full splendor of her beauty. The perfection of her dress though, was
                  the greatest injury—a satin robe that matched, in hue, her amber ornaments,
                  covered with floating tulle draperies of the same tint, caught up here and there
                  by diamond sprays, which sparkled like dew-drops among the fleecy folds of
                  lace—the whole effect so airy and light, that the costume looked rather as if
                  woven out of sunset-colored clouds, than composed of materials within the reach of
                  ordinary mortals.
               Naturally, nine out of ten of the women could have strangled her with serene
                  satisfaction, including the hostess, who received the tardy guest with such sweet
                  smiles and rapturous greetings. Straightway there was a crowd of men about her;
                  for, whatever female nature might think of such wiles and "affectations," it was
                  not to be expected that any masculine fancy could resist this incarnation of
                  freshness and grace, appearing so unexpectedly in the midst of the heat and
                  turmoil.
               Mrs. Granger's house was large; at the end of the suite of drawing-rooms there was
                  an apartment extending the whole breadth of the mansion, which, like a sensible
                  person, she called a ball-room—forcing the word down her acquaintances' throats at
                  the point of the bayonet—thereby pleasing the young people and saving the expense
                  of a carpet. I did not give you this bit of information with any idea of filling
                  in a page of upholstery items—only to show you just where Mrs. Marchmont found her
                  hostess, so that you might understand the position. She stood in fair sight of the
                  dancing world and the throng moving about the salons; there chanced to be a pause
                  in the music as she entered, so that nothing of the effect was lost.
               Of course, the women knew that the late arrival had been a premeditated business;
                  but I think that each feminine heart must have bowed in wondering consciousness of
                  defeat and a secret acknowledgment of a superior power, when she had the audacity
                  to avow it. Mrs. Granger said, in the sweetest possible way,
               "What makes you so late, dear? I had entirely given you up, and was dreadfully
                  disappointed."
               "It was quite like an entrance in a play," added Mrs. Faulkner, who chanced to be
                  standing close by, with as near approach to a sneer as she ventured to
                  indulge.
               "That was what I wanted," returned Mrs. Marchmont, coolly, and in a voice audible
                  to those about. "I had a new dress just from Paris, and knew it would have double
                  the effect if I came in when every body was warm and tired."
               She said it with such arch malice, made her greetings right and left, to women and
                  men, so pleasant, that no masculine at least but would have scouted the idea of
                  her confession being serious; and, as I said, her own sex had to acknowledge her
                  profound generalship, and admire, however much they might detest, her on account
                  of it.
               So there she stood, in that marvelous dress, with a group of the best men in the
                  rooms about her, in the very zenith of her beauty and grace, and her witty and
                  terribly heedless tongue more unmanageable than usual. She would not dance
                  yet—after a while, perhaps; really, she would not promise! She never kept a list,
                  and promises always led her into trouble! But as she swept away on somebody's arm,
                  for what she called a tour of inspection, she could not resist giving Mrs.
                  Faulkner a needle-thrust in payment for her impertinent speech.
               "Is your husband here?" she asked.
               "No; he is coming, though—at least he told me he would," Mrs. Faulkner was obliged
                  to answer, as amiably as she might, though succeeding so poorly in hiding her
                  annoyance, that the by-standers smiled.
               "I am so glad—I think he will come—I came on purpose to see him," retorted Mrs.
                  Marchmont, with a cool deliberation which caused the fingers of her discomfited
                  adversary to tingle with an unlady-like desire to attack her then and there.
               Having punished her antagonist—a bad habit of hers—Mrs. Marchmont floated off;
                  really, what with the dress and all, it is the most applicable word. Mrs. Faulkner
                  solaced herself by whispering to their hostess,
               "She is the most outrageous flirt I ever saw."
               "Oh, I don't know," the other replied, of course having hugely enjoyed the defeat
                  of her sharp-nosed ally. "People say that; but she is so frank and open—still, I
                  can't make her out."
               Neither could Mrs. Faulkner; for all that, she was excessively jealous of her
                  husband, and had every reason to be; but though Mrs. Granger could not exactly say
                  it to the wife, she was thinking that Alice Marchmont, at the culminating point of
                  her popularity and success, would be little inclined to go any great lengths on
                  account of a man like Dick Faulkner.
               The music burst out again, the whirl recommenced, and Mrs. Marchmont was a star of
                  such magnitude that the freshest face of the season paled before her splendor.
                  Perhaps that belonged to little Milly Crofton, who returned to the ball-room on
                  Kenneth Halford's arm, at the summons of the dashing galop. They had not witnessed
                  Mrs. Marchmont's entrance; for it was just before she appeared that Mrs. Granger
                  had asked Milly to take Mr. Halford into the conservatory, that he might decide
                  whether the abomination in the way of a huge water-plant was really Egyptian, as
                  asserted by the florist, to whom she had paid "shekels of gold" for the unsightly
                  thing. Mrs. Faulkner had declared her friend cheated, and there had been several
                  warm arguments between them, conducted with such ill-nature on the part of naughty
                  Dick's wife that the remembrance afforded an addition zest to Mrs. Granger's
                  enjoyment of the scene wherein Alice Marchmont had so effectually worsted the
                  jealous lady.
               Milly and Halford had staid in the conservatory much longer than was necessary, so
                  far as their errand was concerned. Had any body peeped in, the pretty picture they
                  presented, standing among the flowering vines, might have suggested a flirtation;
                  yet nothing could have been farther removed from such dangerous trifling than
                  their talk. Halford was telling her of his first voyage up the Nile, of a visit to
                  the Pyramids, and other expeditions, which scores of books rendered stale years
                  ago, though, coming from his lips, the account sounded so new and interesting to
                  Milly that she drew him on to such lengthened details that he was forced to smile
                  at his own egotism.
               The sound of the music floating into the quiet of their retreat reminded Milly
                  that she should inevitably receive a lecture, if Aunt Eliza noticed her prolonged
                  absence.
               "We must go back," she said, with a little sigh. "I wanted to hear how the day
                  ended."
               "Indeed, I beg your pardon for making my story so long," he answered.
               "I think it's ever so much nicer than any thing in your book," she said,
                  heedlessly.
               "Have you actually done me the honor to peep into that heavy volume?"
               "I read every word of it," returned Milly, pouting. "Did you think I was too great
                  a baby to understand it?"
               "By no means; but what with statistics and all, I fancy it must be very tiresome
                  work to wade through it."
               They were in the ball-room now, and Milly did not answer; she had no mind to tell
                  him with what eagerness she had perused the book, not even skipping the figures,
                  though she never stopped to wonder what gave her so unusual an interest in a work
                  of the sort.
               "Am I to have the galop?" he asked.
               "Oh no; it is promised; besides, Aunt Eliza never likes me to dance twice in
                  succession with the same person," she answered, with a little accent of regret
                  which Halford, man-like, appreciated, though he did consider her a mere child.
               "That is a very wise regulation of Mrs. Remsen's, though it might admit of
                  occasional exceptions," he said.
               "Do look!" exclaimed Milly, suddenly, instead of replying. "There is the most
                  beautiful woman in New York—in the world, I believe—Mrs. Marchmont! Did you ever
                  know her?"
               Kenneth Halford turned rather quickly, and glanced down the room; but before he
                  could speak, Mrs. Granger loomed upon them from one side, and Charley Thorne, to
                  whom Milly had promised the galop, rushed up on the other, and carried her off
                  with an air of injured and jealous proprietorship which would have amused Halford
                  in a less occupied moment. But he had no opportunity to pursue his scrutiny of the
                  lovely woman Milly had pointed out. Mrs. Granger was eager to hear his decision,
                  and fairly shook his arm in her anxiety to have her twice-repeated question
                  answered.
               "It is Egyptian, isn't it, Mr. Halford?"
               He recovered a proper sense of decorum—actually turned his back upon the
                  glittering vision which had startled him, and said, quietly enough,
               "The most Egyptian thing possible—Cleopatra herself was not more so."
               "Come and tell Mrs. Faulkner," cried she, in delight. "I knew it was; but she's
                  always so positive, and so ill-natured."
               She hurried him away in search of that lady, and announced her triumph in eager
                  phrases.
               "Egyptian be it," returned Mrs. Faulkner, with a provoking yawn behind her fan.
                  "It is ugly enough to be any thing. My dearest Clara, you really ought to have
                  supper—people are saying the most ill-natured things because it is so late—old Mr.
                  Yates was just wondering if you had forgotten to order any."
               "After two more dances," said Mrs. Granger, feeling that, since her victory, she
                  could afford to be oblivious of her friend's malice. "This is the young people's
                  night, and they'd rather dance than eat."
               Halford drew their hostess away; he disliked feminine squabbles; besides, he
                  wished her countenance in renewing an old acquaintanceship which his pride would
                  not allow him to postpone, because, to his secret self, any hesitation would have
                  appeared a confession of a weakness which for years he had disavowed.
               Alice Marchmont had been dancing, with due precaution in regard to the marvelous
                  dress, which, as usual in her case, escaped the accidents that befall other
                  women's diaphanous raiment on such
                  occasions. She had walked about, and made her presence duly felt everywhere; and
                  now sat in a sort of recess at the side of the middle drawing-room, holding her
                  little court, and queening it with that royalty of an hour which we are all
                  obliged to confess is so absolute, however loudly, out of the profundity of our
                  virtue and wisdom, we pronounce it not worth possessing.
               There she sat, and looked down the crowded rooms, wishing herself a world away,
                  while her conversation and repartees dazzled the group about her; wondering, too,
                  why the person whom, of all others, she wished to see, much as she had grown to
                  fear and detest him during the past weeks, did not make his appearance. Suddenly
                  even her weariness, her impatience, faded from her mind; even the dread which the
                  thought of Dick Faulkner roused, went too. She saw her hostess approach, leaning
                  on the arm of a man the sight of whom took her as suddenly back into her vanished
                  girlhood as if some enchanter's wand had caused the room, the crowd, and all
                  surroundings, to disappear like a scene at the theatre, and brought the lost life
                  up in its place.
               She knew him in an instant. She was standing in the wood, back of the old country
                  house where they parted on that autumn day. It was the strangest possible mingling
                  of effects. She could see so plainly each incident of that far-off scene—the blue
                  smoke curling lazily up from the trusted chimneys—the golden haze that beautified
                  the landscape—the carpet of gorgeous-tinted leaves beneath their feet—the wild,
                  eager eyes gazing into her own. She could catch the voice of the low breeze as it
                  murmured past, scented with the breath of the late blossoms—hear the crows calling
                  idly in the field below—the querulous complaints of the thrushes in the trees
                  overhead, loud in contention over their southward flight: the stillness and peace,
                  making itself so distinctly felt, in such painful contrast to the agitation of her
                  companion, and the dizzy whirl in her own brain, the mad voice crying out in her
                  soul, which she so ruthlessly silenced. Across it all came the present—the throng,
                  the gay music, and Mrs. Granger's voice, saying,
               "Dear Mrs. Marchmont, I have brought you an old acquaintance, who fears that you
                  may have forgotten him."
               Half-mechanically, she extended her hand—still with the odd inability to tell
                  where reality began or ended—and answered,
               "How do you do, Mr. Halford? Mrs. Granger excels in pleasant surprises."
               He replied; a brief, laughing conversation followed; then Mrs. Granger carried off
                  several of the dandies to attend to their duty, as she told them; and the others,
                  one by one, dropped out of the talk, and departed to find partners, or any
                  occupation they pleased, as men are forced to do on such occasions. There the two
                  sat; and it was like a bit of Alice's girlhood come back, only, all the while, she
                  was looking down the room, and wondering why that man did not bring his
                  disagreeable presence and his news, whatever it might be. Bad enough it would
                  prove, she had horrible fears; but nothing could be worse than the suspense which
                  she had endured during the whole of this dreadful day.
               "I feel as if I must be dreaming," Halford said. "That it can be you and I sitting
                  here seems impossible."
               Did he mean to be tender in the very outset? If so, what was she to do or say?
                  That was another question—in her peculiar position, one that startled her. Before
                  she could answer either interrogatory he spoke again, in the low tone that was
                  like the well-remembered voice, only with a difference. You shall often hear that,
                  and be disturbed thereby, in meeting unexpectedly some person who belongs to your
                  past, and, ten to one, for your sake and his, never ought to have intruded into
                  the present. The change which has come over the voice! the familiar tones
                  sometimes making your heart throb like a strain of old music, then dying out and
                  the other voice becoming audible—the slow, indifferent voice that the world knows;
                  sounding, as all our voices do as the years go on, as though the dust had got into
                  them and spoiled their ring.
               But Halford's next speech, following, in spite of my digression, so close upon his
                  first words that it seemed like a continuation to Mrs. Marchmont, only interrupted
                  by her quick thought, showed that, whatever his feelings might be—if indeed the
                  lapse of time had left him any—he did not mean to indulge in tenderness or
                  sentimental retrospection.
               "Am I to begin by congratulating you on your triumphs?" he asked.
               "Do you think it necessary?" returned she.
               "How can I tell? Certainly, you have achieved enough to offer the opportunity.
                  Well, triumphs and successes are pleasant things; and I know of none pleasanter
                  than those of a successful woman."
               Did she want him to be tender? She could not have told. At all events, she was not
                  pleased with that utter obliviousness of the season when he had warned her that
                  their separation would blight his whole life. Perhaps the sensation, which there
                  was not leisure to analyze, scarcely to avow, rendered her voice somewhat
                  satirical, as she said,
               "Do you wish to remind me that I have also to compliment you, and on real success
                  and worthy achievements?"
               "It did sound a little like it," he answered, quietly; "but it was not what I
                  meant."
               "Still, there is every reason," she continued. "You have been 
                     climbling
                     climbing
                   all sorts of difficult heights—"
               "Nothing worse than Mount Etna."
               "It was ill-natured of you to spoil my pretty speech," she said, laughing, but a
                  good deal irritated. "Besides, as a diplomatist, you ought to know that it is
                  unwise, as well as rude, not to hear people out."
               "Then I beg your pardon for crushing your intended compliments under Mount
                  Etna—may I hear them now?"
               "Too late! Indeed, though, I would have read the book you wrote while in Egypt,
                  only I came on a lot of horrid figures in the beginning, and they frightened me.
                  Why didn't you write a novel?"
               "You must remember that the work was written at the request of an archæological
                  society. I suppose a novel would scarcely have been as satisfactory to them,
                  though you might have found it more entertaining."
               "And did you like living in Egypt—blooming into a Consul-General at last?"
               "Neither was particularly agreeable."
               "But the reputation—the—"
               "Yes, I know; but this is an odd world, and we are such unaccountable beings! Is
                  any body satisfied?"
               "You should know better than to ask that question of a woman."
               "I thought women easily found contentment. Pleasure—admiration—"
               "Don't finish, please! You thought, and think, as most men do, that we are
                  children, to be pleased with any bauble which life may see fit to offer us."
               "Are you reading me so easily, after all these years?"
               "Only judging you by your sex in general."
               They were drifting into a style of conversation which he felt unsuited to the
                  perfect amiability and self-control he had meant to exhibit, knowing that at the
                  bottom of his heart there was no real emotion to disturb either his good-nature or
                  calmness, though it was natural enough that the old memories should flutter a
                  little. He hastened to speak, but, the moment the words were out of his mouth,
                  perceived that they were any thing rather than what he wished to say.
               "All these years," Mrs. Marchmont had half-whispered to herself; the repetition
                  was part involuntary, part because she had grown so consummate an actress that she
                  never could resist indulging in a dramatic point.
               "Some of them have been very dreary ones to me," he said, and immediately became
                  conscious that it was a silly thing to say to this woman, who was nothing to him,
                  whatever the girl she once was might have been to the boy he had long
                  outlived.
               But whether it was or was not an allusion to their buried past, Mrs. Marchmont had
                  no leisure to discover; their conversation was interrupted by a brace of men, each
                  of whom claimed her hand for a dance; half a score of others followed, and Halford
                  stood aside, and could watch what the world was ready to give in the way of
                  triumphs, if she thought them worth accepting. Perhaps he did wonder what she
                  thought, for he had loved this woman, loved her with the intensity of a first
                  passion, and, end how it may, that is always a serious matter—at least, for the
                  time.
               He had loved her, and life seemed at an end when they parted; he had gone through
                  the usual round of rage, anguish, contempt, studied indifference; and had finally
                  settled down into a philosophical view of the whole business; but he had not
                  forgotten. I beg you will not imagine that he had been pining and moaning during
                  these long years; people have not leisure for such amusements in this busy
                  century. Besides, she became a married woman soon after his departure, and,
                  according to his somewhat old-fashioned creed, he had no right to think about her,
                  only as he might of any other beautiful dream which had gone wholly out of his
                  life. It had been a memory for ages, as we count time nowadays, and nothing more.
                  Still, he was moved at the sight of her, and he could not help marveling if her
                  heart retained any recollection of the summer idyl, or, indeed, if she had a heart
                  left to be touched.
               There had never been any thing original in the story, though in its season it
                  seemed wonderfully fresh and new to them. They had loved each other as boy and
                  girl, and Alice was not much beyond eighteen when he was swept out of her horizon
                  by the stern decree of her sage relatives, who very possibly knew the beauty of
                  life's young dream, but knew the value of discretion and common sense, and
                  shillings and pence, still better. He had not known the whole truth until long
                  after; then it came to him by accident; but though it could change nothing, it was
                  at least a satisfaction to learn that she had not been so false and cold-hearted
                  as she appeared. Her mother and stepfather had actually employed threats to induce
                  her to give him up; besides, they appealed to her affection for her weak little
                  shadow of a maternal parent, and, into the bargain, she had tasted just enough of
                  the excitements of society to be influenced thereby, and had been reared with a
                  horror of poverty, in an atmosphere so artificial and false that the wonder was
                  she had any youth left, even at eighteen.
               So they parted her from her lover, and the rest followed naturally enough; but the
                  bargain was a more fortunate one for her, in many respects, than often happens.
                  Her husband proved good and kind; and though, while he lived, she never
                  appreciated him at his just value, she could look back now and see that she might
                  have made a good deal out of those wedded years, had she been wiser and less
                  selfish—less vitiated by the false creeds taught by her former pastors and
                  masters—less eager for excitement and adulation, and the thousand miserable
                  intoxications which make up a society life.
               But though Mrs. Marchmont occasionally glanced toward Halford, she could not tell
                  whether he watched her. He was a new arrival, and a lion of considerable growth,
                  and his hostess expected him to shake his mane and roar a little for the
                  delectation of her guests. He would not do that; but he was unable to avoid her
                  importunities, or the absurd flatteries
                  of the wild-beast hunters in general; so he strayed back into the ball-room where
                  the youthful generation reigned, and a "good stepper" was of more consequence than
                  the greatest hero or sage that the world could boast.
               He came face to face with Milly Crofton again—pretty Milly, beaming with smiles
                  and girlish enjoyment, so unconscious yet of her own feelings that she received
                  him with the same child-like frankness which had pleased him during their brief
                  acquaintance in Europe. She had seated herself to rest for a few moments by her
                  aunt's side; Charley Thorne still hovered about, and rather glared at Halford—that
                  is, as nearly as his cheerful boy's countenance could manage to do; for the state
                  of his mind where Milly was concerned, rendered him as clear-sighted in regard to
                  the danger of having this elder man intrude, as if he had been the wisest of his
                  sex.
               Mrs. Remsen—a perfect Napoleon in a small way—was quite alive to the triumph of
                  having the new lion distinguish Milly by attentions on this first evening of his
                  appearance, and cruelly sent poor Charley off on some errand to the dressing-room;
                  and Charley turned into a melancholy misanthrope at once, but could not avoid
                  going. Milly was too much occupied in listening to Halford even to notice the
                  reproachful glance Charley darted at her as he turned away, but Halford saw it and
                  smiled, though he was rather sorry for the boy, all the same;—there is nothing so
                  aggravating as the half-contemptuous pity men of thirty always bestow on youths
                  ten years younger than themselves.
               "Did I blunder so atrociously that you are afraid to give me another dance?" he
                  asked Milly.
               "You dance beautifully," she said. "But please don't ask me just because you think
                  I can't sit still."
               "I ask you as a great pleasure to myself. Don't you remember, I told you I never
                  indulged in fibs?"
               Mrs. Remsen had returned to her conversation with a sister dowager: she never made
                  the mistake of interfering and trying to aid, as so many chaperons do when
                  desirous that their charges shall produce a favorable impression; she knew that,
                  with a man like Kenneth Halford, just Milly's natural manner, her enthusiasm and
                  childishness, would be more successful than the art and worldly wisdom of a score
                  of ordinary women.
               So, when luckless Charley got back from his mission, he saw Milly whirling about,
                  encircled by Halford's arm, to the tones of the very waltz she had often saved for
                  himself; and the gay scene became a howling wilderness at once, and the troop of
                  dancers more ridiculous than a band of maniacs; and he would have liked to have
                  been Samson, that he might drag down the pillars and crush the whole throng.
               By the time the music ceased, people were making toward the supper-room, and
                  Halford conducted Milly. Mrs. Marchmont was there, but so far off that he only
                  caught occasional glimpses of her through the crowd. Mrs. Remsen forbore to damp
                  Milly's spirits by speaking until they were ready to leave the apartment; but then
                  she said, in her smiling way, that they must go home; and Halford's laughing
                  supplications only made her the more determined. She saw, what Milly did not, what
                  he had scarcely thought about yet himself, that the girl had produced an
                  impression; the surest means of heightening it was to take her away. Milly, who
                  knew that, in spite of Aunt Eliza's pleasant manner, her laws were as unchangeable
                  as those of the Medes and Persians, did not rebel, even forbore to plead for one
                  more dance—a self-restraint so unusual in a young lady that Halford was filled
                  with astonishment, and admired her the more, as shrewd Mrs. Remsen perceived.
               "I like my little girl to enjoy herself," she said, in an undertone, to the
                  gentleman, "but she will not if I allow her to make balls hard work, and I can't
                  bear her to grow like young women in general."
               "You are quite right," he answered. "Please don't forget that you have given me
                  permission to come and renew my old acquaintance."
               "We shall be very glad to see you," she said, cordially; and the smile with which
                  he turned toward Milly at the words consoled the girl somewhat for her
                  banishment.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               "PEEP OF DAY."
               AND all this time there had been but one thought in Alice Marchmont's mind—that
                  man, Dick Faulkner, did not appear. She argued hopefully from his dilatoriness; if
                  he could have brought her bad news, he would certainly have come long before. If
                  the doubts and fears which had been growing each day stronger in her mind during
                  the past month should prove mere fancies! If there should be a favorable turn, and
                  she found herself, free—above all, free in every way from him!
               The bare idea sent her spirits up to fever heat, and she looked more beautiful
                  than ever. It was just at this moment that Kenneth Halford approached her again,
                  and she unscrupulously deserted her most faithful adherents to bestow her
                  indescribable witcheries upon him.
               "Do you remember that?" she asked, suddenly, as the music burst out anew.
               "Perfectly," he replied. "Such an old, old air—it is like a strain coming straight
                  up out of the past."
               "And you still think it pretty?"
               "I remember once hearing it played by some street musicians in Naples," he said;
                  "I shall never forget how oddly it sounded."
               It had been their pet melody in the far-off dances; the waltz she had always kept
                  especially cially for him. There are the merest trifles connected with every
                  body's past, which never cease to move us, however completely important events may
                  have been blotted out of our minds. Certain sights and sounds—the scent of a
                  particular flower—an ancient proverb—the strains of a simple song—will stir a
                  chord deep in our souls, so long after the memories with which they are connected
                  have died, that we are forced to search our minds to recall the association.
               "Come dance with me," he said, quickly.
               "I thought you had grown too wise for such follies," returned she, laughing, yet
                  an instant after she sighed.
               He had been watching her, so brilliant and courted, till, between her present
                  glory and the recollection of the time when those white hands had lain freely in
                  his own, when those proud lips had trembled under his kisses, his head fairly
                  swam, though how much was real feeling and how much that vague sentiment born
                  somewhere between brain and heart, he could not have told. So they whirled round
                  and round to the bewildering music that possessed such hosts of reminiscences for
                  both, till it was natural enough that, when it ceased, they felt drawn near
                  together again, as if, in some mysterious fashion, the events of the intervening
                  years, which had worn channels in either soul that could never be effaced, had
                  been only a long, dark nightmare.
               "So like the old, old time," he said, as he led her to a seat. "I did not think I
                  had such capabilities of enjoyment left."
               He had not forgotten; the thought was very pleasant to her for the moment—whether
                  because her heart was really softened toward him, or the sense of power regained
                  intoxicating, she did not ask. A mingling of both feelings, probably. It is
                  difficult enough to tell what really moves other people and inspires their
                  actions, but to discover the motives by which we are ourselves actuated is, I
                  think, a problem beyond the skill of the greatest philosopher.
               "You have not told me yet that you are glad to see me," he said, as they sat down
                  to rest.
               "Have I not?" returned she. "Then I will now! I am very, very glad to see
                  you."
               She said it with a candor that was charming, and dangerous, too; and, as she
                  spoke, she was glad. He began to talk of the former days, not with any distinct
                  reference to feelings or events, but with the recollection of all that had been
                  hanging about each sentence. Mrs. Marchmont listened till the weary present faded
                  out of mind; the troubles and cares which beset her—the waste of time and talents
                  in the mad rush wherein she had lived, which looked so petty and despicable since
                  the clouds began to thicken—all vanished utterly under the spell of his voice. Nor
                  was he less moved; for it is perilous amusement, the going back over past days,
                  the wandering in buried paths side by side with the woman who ought to have been
                  your fate, and was snatched from you.
               "After all," he said, "life has nothing to offer like our first youth."
               Had any body told him, the hour previous, that he would make such an avowal to
                  Alice Marchmont, he would have scouted the idea with scorn.
               "But a man scarcely feels that," she answered; "life has so much to give him. It
                  is we poor women, who have nothing but our youth, that may well mourn over its
                  loss."
               "They told me always you were very gay and happy," he said. "I often heard your
                  name, but never except in company with those words."
               "Did you believe them?" she asked, almost in a whisper.
               She had not meant to utter the question; it escaped her involuntarily; she was
                  strangely softened by this meeting, and coquetry came as naturally to her as
                  breathing.
               "It was best to believe it," he replied; "there were seasons, at first, when I
                  could not have staid away had I believed otherwise."
               He had said more than he intended—more than he ought—for words were serious things
                  with him. He checked himself immediately; there had been no space to think, in the
                  suddenness of this encounter; yet he knew that it was the memory of the dead
                  dream, not an emotion growing out of the present, which moved him. Still, having
                  gone so far, it was difficult to retreat, especially as she sat silent, and he
                  could see the color deepen a little on her cheek. He did not recover himself so
                  well, or with so much ease, as a less honest man could have done, but said,
                  abruptly,
               "I did not intend to stray into all this Old-World talk; I think I am dazed yet
                  with seeing you."
               The first part of the remark was enough to allow the quick-witted woman to
                  understand his feelings as plainly as if he had put them into words, and she was
                  offended, as any one of her sex would have been. The close of his sentence might
                  be a slight salve to her vanity, unless it was a mere figure of speech—she did
                  wish to know whether it was; she would not go away and end the conversation, as
                  she had three minds to do—he should say more.
               "Not dazed enough to come to harm," said she, laughing. "I think you have prudence
                  and discretion sufficient to meet any emergency."
               No man likes to be told that he is prudent, particularly by a woman; indeed, nine
                  times out of ten, when a woman says it, you may consider it equivalent to a blow
                  if she loves you—as a taunt to draw you on, if she does not. Halford felt a sudden
                  rage which fairly lighted the old memories at his heart into a momentary blaze of
                  passion.
               "Would you be better satisfied if I made a fool of myself?" he exclaimed, hotly.
                  "I did not think you would have wished that! If you are doubtful about my having
                  suffered, be at rest—I did suffer, and I am not ashamed to acknowledge it."
               
               "Poor Kenneth!" she said, softly. "And I have suffered too—don't you believe it,
                  Kenneth?"
               "The old voice and the old name," returned he, in a more quiet tone, as if soothed
                  by it as he had often been in former times when some trouble arose. "I like to
                  hear you call me that—it sounds very sweet."
               "It makes me feel young again to say it," she said; "there are so few people left
                  now whom I call by their given names—so few to speak mine. Heigh-ho! how the years
                  fly and drag, both at once. Do you know I am almost eight-and-twenty?"
               "And I three-and-thirty."
               "But that is young for a man."
               "And you certainly have a decade to live before you will look even your present
                  age."
               "It is pleasant, at least, to be told so."
               "And you know that I never told you what was not true."
               "No; on you I could depend—the only person, almost, on whom I ever could. Oh, the
                  world is very false and hollow! The worst thing about living in it is that one
                  grows so too—perhaps in sheer disgust of wasting truth so uselessly."
               She looked very beautiful as she spoke, with that mournful smile on her lips, and
                  her eyes full of regret for something better and nobler than life had left within
                  her reach.
               "Very young people have a very different world," he said; "and we had ours in our
                  day."
               Truly, the words, and the possibilities they might imply, were sweet; it was like
                  a new feeling of rest to hear them. But Alice chanced to raise her eyes, glanced
                  down the room, and saw the man whom she had been so anxiously expecting. There he
                  was—handsome, hold, bad-looking Dick Faulkner, with a reputation which accorded
                  with the latter part of my description of his appearance. The sight of him brought
                  Mrs. Marchmont back to the present with a breathless sensation, as if she had
                  suddenly fallen out of a balloon from a vast height. What had she been doing?
                  Whither had they two wandered? They must come down to reality, to stern, hard
                  prose. She could not stop now to play with old feelings. If he were in earnest, so
                  much the more reason why they should pause where they were. As for her own
                  emotions—well, they were so confused that she could not pretend to answer for
                  herself. One thing was certain, she could neither listen, or be in love, or do
                  parlor-comedy, just then; the harsh exigencies of the present had returned. If
                  Faulkner should bring her good news—oh, who could tell what might happen in that
                  case—if she might only find herself free!
               She realized her madness more than ever during that instant of rapid, bewildered
                  thought; it was the only thing clear to her. Yes, one thing besides; she must
                  speak with Faulkner—must hear what he had to say—news of some sort was at hand.
                  So, in a breath, at sight of this odious wretch, she passed leagues out from the
                  phantom likeness of the glorious world in whose reality she had once dwelt with
                  this man by her side.
               She was very glad that an interruption came at the same moment. A quadrille was
                  over, people were seeking places to rest, and the recess was invaded. Almost
                  before she had done wishing for him, Dick Faulkner was leaning over her shoulder,
                  and talking in a way that seemed horribly impertinent, with these new fears in her
                  mind, though, in truth, it was his usual manner with all women. It displeased
                  Halford, with his fastidious taste, that she should appear even on friendly terms
                  with a creature like that. He could imagine no reason beyond her boundless love of
                  coquetry and dominion, and thought somewhat ruefully of the sentiment he had
                  talked, and began to regard her with a certain bitterness because she had proved
                  sufficiently fascinating to betray him into such weakness. He sauntered off,
                  joined a group of old friends, but for the life of him could not help watching
                  her, though now he was thinking what an idiot he had shown himself, and comparing
                  her tutored, guarded face with the innocent girl-loveliness of Milly Crofton.
               "You will break my fan, Mr. Faulkner," Mrs. Marchmont said, irritably, as Halford
                  moved away.
               "Who is that man?" he asked.
               "A very old friend of mine."
               "An old lover, you mean, I suppose," returned he, with his harsh laugh. "Nobody
                  wants him."
               "I meant just what I said," she retorted; "and perhaps you will allow me to choose
                  my own society."
               "Oh yes, if you choose me," he said, with that laugh again, which made her shiver,
                  and a glance from his cruel black eyes that filled her with such indignation she
                  longed to strike him.
               "Have the kindness to give back my fan before you break it."
               "I was trying to," he said, "that I might have the pleasure of presenting you with
                  a new one."
               "Thanks; I will keep this instead. You are very late in making your appearance
                  to-night."
               "Then you did think of me?" he asked, dropping his voice, and trying to render the
                  conversation confidential.
               "I saw your wife," she replied, audibly, "naturally, I thought of you."
               Two or three people heard the retort, and smiled; for Dick Faulkner and his spouse
                  led an existence, as all the world knew, to which purgatory would have seemed
                  agreeable in comparison. His eyes flashed, and Mrs. Marchmont remembered that she
                  could not affront him with impunity. She gazed in his face with her sweetest smile
                  and played carelessly with her fan—the slender, nervous fingers looked so frail
                  and white, as they closed over the ivory bars. She was thinking—and it was not
                  unnatural—that if it had pleased Heaven to make her a South Sea Island queen, and
                  Dick Faulkner had chanced to be shipwrecked on her domain, and she had her fingers
                  about his throat, just as she had them twisted over that pretty toy—
               Well, it was only a second's wickedness, and she did not even finish the thought;
                  and if you have ever felt yourself in the power of a person whom you knew to be
                  utterly faithless and base, I think it is possible that a likeness to Alice's
                  South Sea Island dream has flitted across your imagination.
               "You promised to dance with me," he said, his countenance clearing under her
                  smile, as any man's must have done.
               "Did I? Then I will; partly because I am a woman of my word, partly because—"
               Whatever the end of the sentence might be, it was lost to the by-standers; for he
                  led her away.
               "Partly because?" he repeated. "Will you finish?"
               "I don't want to talk nonsense," returned she. "Tell me how I stand—I could make
                  nothing out of your note—I have waited all day."
               "I can't tell you yet," he said, carelessly, "because I don't know myself."
               She uttered an exclamation of anger. It was too much, after her dreadful morning,
                  after this long night of anxious waiting.
               "Why can't you answer me?" she urged.
               "Because the market has not cleared! Don't be so impatient—one thing at a
                  time—what heavenly music!"
               He seized her in his arms; they were flying up the room to the merriest galop, and
                  more than one person was echoing Kenneth Halford's wonder that she could be on
                  terms of intimacy with that man, only they said it aloud, and added divers other
                  remarks, which would have stung her to the quick had she heard them.
               "What do you mean by the market not clearing?" she persisted.
               "Oh, I can't explain—the commonest term!"
               "I saw myself that Cumberland was up—"
               "Yes, and gold down! My dear Mrs. Marchmont, you are the most delightful woman in
                  the world, but I never can make you understand the intricacies of the
                  stock-market."
               She was furious. She had tried, during her whole acquaintance with him, to be
                  careful—had avoided places where he visited; and here, in the face and eyes of the
                  whole world, he had deluded her into dancing with him. Nothing but her belief that
                  he had news to give, and her own mad anxiety to hear it, could have induced her to
                  consent; and not one serious word would he speak—her head whirled with anger and
                  fright. To have his arm about her, straining her so close that it was more like an
                  embrace than any thing else; to feel his breath, heated with wine, burn her cheek;
                  to see his bold eyes fastened with a coarse smile upon her neck—oh, she should do
                  something desperate, if he did not set her free on the instant—astonish the crowd
                  by a shriek, or fairly attack him with teeth and hands, like a raving
                  Bedlamite.
               "I want to sit down!" she cried. "I tell you to stop—I'm tired—I will sit
                  down!"
               He knew very well why she had consented to dance with him, and that she stopped
                  because there was nothing to be gained by going on, and he cursed her in his
                  heart; while sharp-nosed Mrs. Faulkner looked on from a distance, and longed, in
                  her turn, to make a scene. There was nothing for it but to lead her to a seat, and
                  she paid no attention when he said,
               "Is it because you are dancing with me that you get so easily tired?"
               "Mr. Faulkner," she exclaimed, "I came to-night on purpose to see you—"
               "That repays me for every thing!"
               She gave him one glance of contempt which sent the blood to his face, callous as
                  he was; then she remembered—growing sick and faint to remember—that she dared not
                  treat him as he deserved.
               "I must know just how and where I stand," she went on. "This uncertainty is more
                  than I can bear! I have been reckless—crazy! I meant to buy a few shares—just to
                  gratify a whim—"
               "But you see you developed the taste," he broke in; "it was natural. Bless me, you
                  needn't be shocked at yourself; plenty of people indulge in such
                  speculations."
               "I am not talking about that. I have gone on losing here—gaining there—borrowing
                  on this—paying off something else—"
               "That Peep of Day proves such an awful sell," he said, with a careless shrug of
                  his shoulders, as she paused, from pure inability to articulate. "An awful sell,"
                  he repeated; and it seemed to her that he had a pleasure in adding to her
                  torment.
               The anxiety that had preyed upon her for so many hours culminated now in an
                  emotion which threatened to overcome even her wonderful self-control. There had
                  been a belief that certain stocks—this poetically named one among them—were doing
                  wonders; he had led her to think so; and she had soothed her wildest fears by the
                  hope that to-night she might find all well ended.
               "You have not sold the shares?" she asked.
               "Oh, bless you, every thing fell back so flat at noon—nothing to be done! But
                  don't get discouraged—a few days—"
               She stopped him with a motion of her fan.
               "I would as soon you talked about a few centuries," she said, with a kind of
                  sullen desperation upon her.
               He laughed outright, as if she had uttered the best jest imaginable.
               "Are you trying to annoy me?" demanded she, with a haughty anger in her face
                     which warned him that, if he went too
                  far, she would risk any thing to free herself from his toils.
               "How can you think it—how can you misunderstand me so? I am as sorry and anxious
                  as a man can be; but I know that it will end all right if you can only have
                  patience."
               "I am sick of the word!" she replied.
               "I assure you that the quality must be acquired, if you mean to have any thing to
                  do with Wall Street."
               "Only let me get out this time—"
               She did not finish; she would control herself. Dick Faulkner whispered the
                  incomplete sentence to himself, and added, in his thoughts,
               "Let you get out—ah, my pretty lady-bird, you're in a web one doesn't break so
                  easily!"
               "When do you think the other stock will take a turn?" she asked.
               "Oh, any moment; it's only that Locksley has cornered it, and the Walton men want
                  to drive him to the wall."
               The experience of the past months rendered the jargon intelligible enough to her.
                  She opened and shut her fan two or three times—one of the ivory sticks snapped—it
                  was a sort of satisfaction to break something!
               "Ah, ha, you'll have to let me buy the new one, after all," said he.
               "My first dividends will do that—if your belief is true," she replied.
               "I wish you would believe me, and so not work yourself up to such a pitch of
                  excitement; you will certainly be ill! Surely, you know how much I have your
                  interest at heart—that I would give my right hand, any day, to oblige you."
               This was the style of conversation in which he had indulged more and more of late;
                  it made her more afraid than any thing else that their business schemes were a
                  failure—this coarse, insolent flattery was so different from the respectful manner
                  of their first intercourse, when she had believed that he could be kept without
                  trouble at a proper distance. She could not endure it another instant! If she sat
                  there while his watch could tick once, she should inevitably astonish the crowd by
                  some mad attempt to strangle him. She took advantage of the first available man's
                  arm to escape, and left Dick Faulkner muttering certain energetic words between
                  his shut teeth which would scarcely have helped to compose her had she heard
                  them.
               She did not go home; late as it was, the throng had lessened little, and Mrs.
                  Marchmont seemed in her gayest mood. People called her mildest manners flirting,
                  but to-night she really did flirt with any man worth it, or in any quarter where
                  there was a sister-woman to be annoyed, until those who knew her best were
                  appalled by her genius in that line, and her recklessness in exhibiting it.
               In spite of himself, Kenneth Halford hovered about her; and, with her fears and
                  troubles biting like a nest of scorpions, it was torture to look in his face and
                  recollect all that lay between her and the time of which his eyes reminded her—to
                  look farther on, and see Dick Faulkner scowling at her, and recognize him as a
                  fate standing between her and any possibility of happiness which might ever offer.
                  She succeeded, at least, in rousing that latter individual to a pitch of fury, if
                  she did nothing else. But she had become too desperate to care—nothing could make
                  any difference now. She was in the state of mind which business anxieties are
                  liable to produce upon a person who understands little of its mysteries, and has
                  become involved in plans which glittered famously at first, and shrunk, one by
                  one, like pricked soap-bubbles, when first within the grasp. Added to that were
                  these other emotions—her fear of Faulkner—her disturbed feelings at meeting
                  Halford; either excitement, by itself, would have been enough to unnerve most of
                  her sex.
               She was a woman, too, and must get rid of her agitation in some way. In her
                  position, certain of her sisters would have been at home tearing their locks,
                  shrieking in hysterical spasms, and making themselves odious in the eyes of any
                  unfortunates doomed, by destiny, to take care of them. Other women might have been
                  able to look the whole matter in the face, already reaching forward to oases of
                  refuge, in the possibility of pecuniary and social ruin coming closer than was
                  agreeable. Mrs. Marchmont's way of enduring the suspense was different from
                  either. She had an odd feeling—ridiculous as she knew it to be—that this was her
                  last night in such scenes, and she would at least make it one for the world to
                  remember.
               The consequence was, that she waxed fascinating and imprudent beyond description
                  or belief up to the last moment; and if the elderly cats who appear to frequent
                  such scenes for the express pleasure of being horrified by coquetry and similar
                  performances—in which, since the memory of man there has been no possibility of
                  indulgence on their part—had never found reasons enough for belaboring Alice
                  Marchmont to their heart's content, she certainly gave them ample cause this
                  evening.
               But it came at length—a sudden, staggering blow. She had been certain that some
                  crisis was at hand; the presentiment had never left her during the whole day: it
                  was fulfilled as unexpectedly as if she had not believed herself, to a certain
                  extent, prepared. She was on her way out of the drawing-rooms; people were talking
                  to her on her passage; she encountered a fresh group near the door, and it was all
                  to go over again. She was saying the wittiest things imaginable, still with the
                  odd feeling that it was her closing triumph, and determined to dazzle to the last.
                  Dick Faulkner was hovering about her, Halford coldly regarding her from a
                  distance, scores of women whom she had roused to mutiny by her reckless poaching
                  on their manors eying her with bitter feminine malice, new admirers rushing up,
                  more chatter, more laughter; and in the midst of it fell the awful shock.
               Just behind her stood two elderly men, holding snatches of conversation not
                  intended for any ears besides their own; but Mrs. Marchmont's senses were in a
                  state of such nervous exaltation that she was able to see and hear every thing
                  going on about her, though talking all the time. She distinctly heard one of the
                  pair say to his neighbor,
               "If she was in for Peep of Day like poor Trevor, she wouldn't be quite so full of
                  life and spirits."
               "No, I rather think not! They say the whole thing has caved in," returned the
                  other, in the delightfully unconcerned tone in which people usually discuss
                  misfortunes that can in no way affect themselves.
               "Gone down as flat as your hand," was the answer; "and, what's more, it will never
                  come up—stock and company were both a humbug."
               "I said so from the first, but people would not listen! I'd not have touched a
                  share of it as a gift," said the first speaker, in a voice of conscious and
                  satisfied wisdom.
               Mrs. Marchmont knew that she kept on her way into the passage, but she was dizzy
                  and blind, and as she reached the foot of the staircase, Dick Faulkner whispered
                  in her car,
               "I am sorry you heard that—two old fools; but don't you mind in the least."
               He was glad in his heart, glad and exultant, for he was in a frightful rage with
                  her. She knew that he was glad; her quick perceptions caught the savage ring of
                  triumph through the attempted solicitude of his voice. She turned and faced him;
                  the rest of her courtiers had dropped a little back; they stood quite alone.
               "Is it true?" she asked.
               He hesitated; his features assumed an expression of regret and sympathy very
                  tolerably; but she saw the devilish smile that shone in his eyes.
               "Will you answer? Is it true?" she repeated; and there was more haughty impatience
                  than fear in the tone.
               "Yes—perfectly true," he replied, slowly.
               She stood still; the floor heaved and swayed so unsteadily to her sight that she
                  dared not stir.
               "I am so sorry," he continued. "I did not mean you to hear to-night. Don't you
                  know, I would rather have cut my right hand off than for this trouble to have
                  reached you?"
               The woman's mettle asserted itself—just then, at this crisis wherein even a strong
                  man might have been utterly overwhelmed, She looked Faulkner fall in the face; not
                  a muscle of her own quivered.
               "Will you tell me how much I have lost?"
               Again he hesitated—not, she was certain, from any kindly feeling—just from the
                  sort of instinct which leads feline animals to worry their prey before killing it.
                  She made a quick gesture: exaggerated as the comparison sounds, I can only liken
                  it to the threatening command some Eastern monarch might have given a rebellions
                  slave.
               "Ten thousand dollars, if you will know."
               He had dropped his sentimental tone; and though he spoke necessarily almost in a
                  whisper, the fierce rage her haughty assurance caused him sounded through it
                  distinctly enough.
               "That is, over and above the other?" she asked, still with her dilated eyes full
                  upon him.
               He bowed his head.
               She passed on up stairs without another word—without allowing him the satisfaction
                  of seeing the change which she knew had suddenly come over her face—the terror and
                  despair that at length forced themselves through the defiant composure she had
                  maintained. There were women in the dressing-room pausing for a last interchange
                  of scandals; they chattered and poured out a torrent of questions and bittersweet
                  compliments, and she answered at random, till able to collect her wraps and flee
                  beyond the sound of their odious frivolity. They, naturally supposing that her
                  only reason for haste was because they belonged to her own sex, abused her with
                  additional virulence, and did it well. If there ever is a surgical operation
                  neatly and thoroughly performed, it is the flaying of a sister by those gentle
                  proficients.
               Mrs. Marchmont hurried into the corridor, and at the head of the stairs met
                  Kenneth Halford.
               "I am just in time to see you down," he said, offering his arm. "I am sure you
                  must be tired to death."
               His voice sounded a little cold. He had not been so much charmed with her during
                  the latter part of the evening. Very beautiful and brilliant she might be; but
                  this woman with the crowd about her, saying careless things, with smiles for any
                  body that came near; worse than all the rest, with more than one man about her
                  whom he knew ought never to be tolerated by any good woman, was not the Alice of
                  the old time—had no connection whatever with the innocent girl of that season.
               Had he looked at her now, the pallor and dread in her face might have softened
                  him; but he kept his eyes averted as they walked on, and she continued a fire of
                  witticisms and nonsensical talk which sounded too much like the bonmots of a
                  modern novel to be agreeable to his hypercritical taste.
               "You may come and see me," she said, as they reached the lower floor. "You may
                  come to-morrow, if you like."
               He thanked her. She felt, rather than heard, the restraint and disapproval in his
                  tones. Through all her misery and nervous agitation, her temper flamed up. This
                  man was venturing to sit in judgment; he dared to blame her. In her best moments,
                  Mrs. Marchmont could not have borne that consciousness patiently; just now it
                  irritated her till she longed to do or say something that would shock him more
                  completely.
               "No, not to-morrow," she added; "I remember member, I am going out. The day after—no; what is it I have to do? Never mind;
                  we shall meet somewhere in the crowd, sooner or later. Good-bye till then, Mr.
                  Halford; you needn't take me out to the carriage; I want to speak with Mr. Duval;
                  he is one of my favorite knights."
               She knew he said something—she could not tell what—and drew aside. She had
                  succeeded in her wish of rousing his censure to a higher pitch, for the man whom
                  she beckoned toward her was of Dick Faulkner's stamp, and nothing but her insane
                  desire to be as reckless as she could manage would have induced her to accept his
                  arm. But he led her out in triumph—apparently, that is; for in reality she never
                  addressed a single word to him, or paid the least attention to his remarks. As he
                  placed her in the carriage, and turned away discomfited, Dick Faulkner looked in
                  at the window, smiling still.
               "I will come to-morrow," he whispered. "Don't worry yourself; there is no reason.
                  I have been cross to-night; you tormented me beyond endurance. Don't think about
                  the money; it is only to me; we can arrange it easily enough."
               The carriage was off; she thought—her senses were so bewildered and stunned that
                  she could not be certain—but it seemed to her that he had tried to kiss her hand.
                  She was shivering from head to foot, burning with fever at the same time, body and
                  mind alike threatening to yield under the awful crisis which had overtaken her;
                  yet, woman-like, all the way home she was not thinking so much of the evil tidings
                  she had heard, of the probable ruin which menaced her, as of the humiliating idea
                  that the lips of that horrible man had brushed her hand.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               SHOWING HIS HAND.
               MRS. MARCHMONT sat the next morning, waiting for her visitor—waiting beset by a
                  host of reflections and fears which were by no means pleasant companions for a
                  solitary hour.
               She knew well enough that Faulkner would come; to refuse him an interview would
                  only be to put off the evil day, and perhaps render any peaceable understanding
                  more difficult by rousing his evil temper and obstinacy. Besides, she could bear
                  any thing under heaven more easily than suspense; no words that he could speak
                  would prove half so terrible as her anticipations of the scene.
                  She had contemplated the worst possibilities so often during the past night, her
                  restless fancy had tormented her with so many different aspects
                  of the tête-à-tête, that to face the reality, no
                  matter what, would be a relief. If he were insolent, she could rise and leave the
                  room; if he— Oh, what folly to indulge in such thoughts! She owed him thousands of
                  dollars, and for the present there was no means of raising them in her power. He
                  could not be quite so vile as her fears during three weeks had caused her to
                  dread; there must be some trace of humanity in his nature! Whatever his intentions
                  were, she should be able by her tact to keep him from breaking through the
                  ordinary rules of decorum.
               That she should have lived to hold such reflections in regard to any man!—oh, no
                  wonder she clenched her hands and stamped her feet on the carpet, and wished that
                  she had died a year before! But she controlled herself, and, when he was
                  announced, was able to receive him without varying from her usual manner. Skilled
                  in seizing the slightest advantage in the fencing-match of a difficult
                  conversation, she had seated herself with her back to the light; and both attitude
                  and costume were as perfect as if she had set her heart upon fascinating the man
                  who, her intuitions told her, would force her to an open declaration of war before
                  the interview ended.
               "Ah, good-morning, Mr. Faulkner," she said, laying down her pen as if his entrance
                  had interrupted a real occupation, and pushing the gilded writing-table a little
                  away. "You are still alive after last night's fatigues, I see."
               "Oh, I can bear a good deal," he answered. "But you—I declare you women work
                  harder going to balls evening after evening—"
               By this time the door had closed—the stern domestic guardian was out of hearing.
                  She did not wait for the reasonable politeness of letting him conclude his
                  speech.
               "I have been waiting anxiously for you," she said.
               "That is a little consolation at least," returned he, with the smile which always
                  made her blood tingle. "I was afraid that my visit was unconscionably early."
               "I asked you to come," she said, calmly, ignoring the insolent freedom of his
                  first sentence.
               "Yes, and I made haste, for fear that you had been worrying yourself all night
                  over the talk of those two fools."
               "I always reserve my powers in that line until it is absolutely necessary to
                  exercise them," she replied; and all the while she was thinking—loathing herself
                  for the thought—how natural subterfuges and falsehoods had grown to her.
               "That's right," said he; "but you are the one woman I have ever seen who really
                  had a head! So you slept comfortably?"
               She caught his smile; she knew perfectly well that he was not deceived by her
                  manner—that he exulted inwardly at his ability to pierce through all her pretty
                  pretense of composure.
               "You have brought the papers—accounts—or whatever is the proper name, I suppose,"
                  she said, carelessly.
               "Upon my word," retorted he, with an irritated laugh, "you speak as if I were the
                  family solicitor, or an agent, or some cad of that sort."
               "I hope the ball has not left you in a bad temper," she answered, hating him the
                  more that she dared not persevere in her tone of insolent superiority.
               "If it had, seeing you would have dissipated it," he said.
               "Ah, that is very pretty; but it is too early in the day for compliments; like
                  jewels and perfumes, they ought to be reserved for full dress."
               "How neatly you always put things!" he exclaimed, with a coarse admiration that
                  made her shudder.
               "Then let me try to put my first question, which you seemed to think offensive, a
                  little more neatly, too," she said, leaning back in her chair and playing idly
                  with the bronze paper-cutter she had taken from the table. "Have you come prepared
                  to give me an exact statement of my affairs?"
               "How fearfully business-like you are this morning; I hardly recognize you," he
                  replied, laughing again.
               "It is time for me to be so," she said, quietly, though her fingers closed over
                  the hilt of the toy she held till the sharp ornaments cut cruel red creases in her
                  hands. "So there is nothing to hope from our brilliant scheme, Mr. Faulkner; Peep
                  of Day has vanished?"
               "There's no good in trying to deceive you, or to smooth matters—"
               "The plain truth will be the greatest kindness you can show; that is, if the plain
                  truth can be got at in our century," she added, unable, in spite of her dread, to
                  resist this little thrust.
               "I was completely taken in and duped," he said; "it's almost the first time such a
                  thing has happened to me since I commenced business."
               "Then you were not one of the originators of the scheme?" returned she, in a voice
                  nicely modulated between question and assertion.
               "I should think not; why, I explained that at first. They have let me in finely; I
                  shall have great difficulty to— But that's no matter! Your affairs are the
                  important thing just now."
               "I am sorry to appear selfish; but they are so to me, unfortunately, Mr. Faulkner,
                  at this moment. I have lost ten thousand dollars—"
               "But only to me; do understand."
               "Before that I had lost—what was it—five thousand?"
               "The exact amount is of no consequence—"
               "Excuse me; it is of the greatest consequence! Please to answer me; was it
                  five?"
               "And a few hundreds over," he said, peevishly. "But it is only to me; you have no
                  doings with any body else; your name does not appear! Why on earth will you
                  torment yourself about such a trifle?"
               "In your vast schemes fifteen thousand dollars may seem a trifle," she replied,
                  laughing a little, though her lips were dry and parched; "but it looks a large sum
                  to me."
               "I never want you to think about it," he averred.
               "That is very kind of you; but you must know it would be impossible. From the
                  first, I only meant to go so far as I could give you a margin in safety; I mean,
                  put securities in your hands—"
               "Yes, yes; it's all right!" he broke in, drumming with both hands on the table in
                  a nervous, excited way, new to her in her knowledge of him.
               "Unfortunately, during these last weeks I forgot my resolution—that scheme showed
                  so fair—I have been drawn on and on, till now—" she stopped to steady her voice,
                  which had begun to tremble—"I find myself deeply in your debt."
               "No debt at all," cried he. "I was duped—sold. I'll pay them for it before I'm six
                  months older, as sure as my name is Dick Faulkner!" he exclaimed, striking the
                  table with energy.
               But though he did annoyance and a desire for revenge well enough, Mrs. Marchmont
                  was not deceived. That gleam of infernal exultation was in his eyes still; her
                  woman's intuitions told her that he had a hand in this failure—whether to serve
                  some purpose where she was concerned, she should soon know.
               "What I want to do this morning," she continued, with her voice once more under
                  proper control, "is to see what arrangement we can arrive at in regard to my debt
                  to you."
               "The easiest in the world," he said, eagerly.
               "You mean you will be satisfied with a mortgage—"
               "I don't mean any thing of the sort," he broke in rudely. "Put the money out of
                  your mind; call the thing canceled. I'll give you a receipt this moment, if you
                  like."
               She half started forward in her chair; the proposal sounded so generous, that
                  though she did not dream of accepting it, she almost felt that she had misjudged
                  him. Again she caught the expression in his hold eyes, and knew that some insult
                  lay beneath this offer.
               "You are very kind," she said, regarding him full in the face now; "but in your
                  desire to spare me uneasiness, you go beyond what you know yourself to be
                  possible."
               "Not a bit," said he. "Come, call it ended!"
               He rose quickly from his seat; his face frightened her; but she leaned languidly
                  back, saying, in the gayest way,
               "Sit down, sit down; you are too impulsive by half for a business man, Mr.
                  Faulkner. Good gracious, if you treat all your creditors in this Quixotic fashion,
                  you will be ruined in a year."
               "Other people must shift for themselves; I am talking about what I am ready to do
                  for you," said he, doggedly.
               "And I thank you sincerely for your generous intentions, but must refuse them
                  distinctly," she answered. "Now, that point settled—only do understand how much
                  obliged, how grateful, I am—let us consider the best means of acquitting my
                  debt."
               
               She had a vague hope that, by appealing to his better self—if he had one—at least,
                  by this appearance of believing in his sincerity and good faith, she might be able
                  to keep the interview within the bounds where she had, with such difficulty,
                  managed to retain their intercourse during the past fortnight, in which the
                  business troubles had drawn her further and further into the net.
               "I don't want your gratitude," he said, quickly, almost roughly. She might have
                  thought him eager to escape the expression of her thanks, had not the light in
                  those bold eyes burned into her very soul, bringing a sense of humiliation and
                  dread which nearly overpowered her desperate courage.
               "But you must have it—sit down, please; you make me nervous twirling your
                  chair—and you must have your money, too."
               "Confound the money!"
               "Not in my presence, if you please," she said, with that haughty movement of her
                  head which had so often awed him in spite of his effrontery. But he did not mean
                  to be awed now; he had come to the house with a settled purpose in his mind;
                  neither her graces nor her histrionics should keep him from revealing it. He sat
                  down, though, as she had bidden him, more at a loss just how to act or speak than
                  he had ever been in his whole life.
               "Well?" he asked, anathematizing himself mentally for his own hesitation.
               "I want to explain. I have not the money to pay you now; you know that; for the
                  present, I could not raise the sum—"
               She stopped; she thought, she was almost sure, that he smothered a laugh. Her
                  first impulse was to rise and leave the room; but a second's reflection showed her
                  the uselessness of any such show of indignation. She was in his power; she must
                  submit to an interview, in order to arrange some means of freeing herself.
               "Why don't you go on?" he asked.
               "I am thinking what security I could best give you," she answered; and her voice
                  did not tremble, though the real thought in her mind was that she had none to
                  offer.
               "Finish what you have to say," said he, sullenly; "then I have something to say in
                  my turn."
               "The last few weeks have made you tolerably well acquainted with my affairs—"
               "Yes; tolerably," he said, as she hesitated; and there was no mistaking the sneer
                  on his face now.
               "But what you do not know is that I have a hope of—"
               She stopped again. What she had begun to say was, that she hoped to dispose of
                  certain Virginia lands she owned to a company—a tract of coal, lead, and oil
                  lands, which one day would be immensely valuable. There was a probability of her
                  disposing of them—retaining percentages—becoming really a rich woman; but, with
                  this new fear of him in her mind, she hesitated to trust him with the secret. If
                  her vague dread of his evil intentions—the bare thought of which, in spite of the
                  vagueness, made her abhor herself to think that she had lived to give place to
                  such ideas in her mind—were correct, he might find some method of hindering the
                  sale, invent lies to prejudice the company—no, she would not trust him.
               "You don't tell me what hope you have," he said.
               "I will; I want—"
               "Oh, now, let's have an end of this!" he cried, springing up from his chair again.
                  "I'll not have you distress yourself any longer about this silly business! Look
                  here, Mrs. Marchmont—Alice—cut my heart out, and stamp on it, if it will do you
                  any good—I love you—I love you!"
               He was close beside her, his eyes blinding her with their glow; and all her tact,
                  all her pride, did not save her from the unutterable humiliation of having Dick
                  Faulkner hold her two hands fast while he told her over and over that he loved
                  her; that for months he had thought of nothing else; that he must speak now, or he
                  should go mad! Alice felt sick and faint with terror and abhorrence. To flirt to
                  the extremest verge of prudence was one thing; to make some sister-woman insanely
                  wretched by bewitching her husband before her very eyes, was a recreation full of
                  delight. But a scene like this was very different, and something undreamed of in
                  Mrs. Marchmont's experience—as repulsive, indeed, to her whole nature as it could
                  have been to the most rigid puritan that ever lived. As I have said, she had
                  always so prided herself on the fact that during her wedded days no man ever
                  ventured to whisper a single word that could be construed into a liberty. Since
                  that, during this season of her widowhood, no married man among the many with
                  whose fancies she had chosen to play havoc had ever dared, even by a look, to
                  express any thing beyond knightly courtesy and entire devotion to her slightest
                  wish. Knowing this, she had never reflected that to receive such attentions was in
                  itself a degradation; but she would hereafter, forced by this insult to regard
                  flirtation truthfully. She had never dreamed how often the world had harshly
                  judged her, or that, as will frequently happen, among the numerous votaries at her
                  shrine, there had been more than one wretch base enough to atone for his lack of
                  courage and success by meaning smiles and dastardly insinuations.
               It is strange, but you can seldom persuade women that such reports, such cowardly
                  malice on the part of many men, are to be expected. Nor does the inability to
                  believe proceed from the fact that women are so truthful themselves; it is only
                  that to each woman it seems impossible that such slanders should come near
                  her.
               But there Dick Faulkner was at Mrs. Marchmont's feet; and his eyes looked straight
                  into hers till they seemed to scorch every pure feeling, every sense of feminine
                  delicacy, with their glance. Her first impulse was one of pure terror; her second,
                  a mingled horror and rage that disgrace should have ventured so near her petted
                  life. She forgot what she had done to help on this unpleasant position; forgot the
                  scenes through which she had gone this very morning with unfortunate
                  trades-people; forgot the debts that overwhelmed her on all sides; forgot that she
                  owed this reptile a sum which she was powerless to pay, and that her reputation
                  was at his mercy; forgot every thing in a burst of wrath and disgust, which, of
                  itself, proved that, in spite of her follies and wickedness—for extravagance is
                  wickedness—she had kept her soul womanly and pure.
               "Be good enough to let my hands go, Mr. Faulkner. We are not rehearsing for a
                  French comedy."
               These were the first words she spoke in return to the insane tirade which he
                  poured out, and they stung him worse than blows. She might have burst into
                  ejaculations of virtuous rage; he would only have considered them employed to lure
                  him on. She might have treated him to tears and piteous laments that he should
                  insult her weakness; they would have been a poorer and still more ineffectual
                  refuge. But to meet that cool, quiet contempt; to hear the indolent voice, as if
                  he really were not worth a scene—ah, she had touched him as scarcely another woman
                  in the world could have done. He dropped her hands, and was on his feet in an
                  instant.
               "Now sit down," she said, quietly, "and let me think what is to be done. Well—I
                  suppose you want your money, Mr. Faulkner?"
               She asked the question as indifferently as if there were nothing but the merest
                  business matters to arrange between them—as if she were not half out of her senses
                  with shame and passion, thinking that there was no act too terrible to commit, if
                  it could only free her for all time to come from the sight of this man.
               "Do you mean to insult me?" he cried. "Have you the heart to talk about money,
                  after what I have said?"
               He was trying hard to control his rage, to keep back the threats and imprecations
                  very near his lips, and essay the magnanimous and injured—that is, according to
                  his conception of the character.
               "I conclude the money must have been somewhat in your thoughts," she answered,
                  with a contemptuous smile. "It has been, and is, a good deal in mine, I assure
                  you."
               "I came to beg you not to think of it—to say that if the sum you owe me were ten
                  times the amount, I should be only too happy to be your creditor."
               "Yes, you told me that; I thanked you. It was very pretty and gallant on your
                  part," she said, laughing cheerfully, while her head spun round and round, and the
                  bare effort to think was like having a sharp knife thrust into her brain.
               "It came as my love does—from my heart!"
               "Stop, stop! We are in Wall Street this morning, talking over a purely business
                  affair. Wall Street knows nothing about hearts."
               "I was not aware that Mrs. Marchmont did me the honor to regard me as her
                  commission broker," he said, with an ugly sneer.
               "I considered you my friend," she replied, eagerly. "As such I have trusted you,
                  presumed upon your good-nature beyond all limits" (here she smiled again), "till I
                  dare say you have many times wished me and my small ventures at the bottom of the
                  Dead Sea."
               Her heart gave a little bound of hope, though she did now fully comprehend his
                  baseness; but she had been so accustomed to intercourse with gentlemen, that she
                  could not resist the idea of yet touching his generosity, since he must see that
                  the love-making was a failure.
               "I think I have shown myself your friend," he said.
               "Yes, yes; no doubt you meant for the best—"
               "Ah, you take to reproaches!"
               "No, Mr. Faulkner; but I do think you might have warned me—held me back—kept me
                  from being so overconfident."
               "I was afraid of your thinking that I wanted to save myself trouble; indeed, I did
                  not think at all, except about pleasing you."
               She had not expected this speech, after his conduct; perhaps she had been a little
                  unjust in her thoughts concerning him; he might not have pushed her on to her
                  present position to hold her in his power; at all events, so long as he kept to
                  the ground upon which he had shifted she was perfectly at home, and mistress of
                  the position.
               "I am sure of that," she said; "and it was very kind of you. But you remember
                  that, in the beginning, I told you I wanted to be business-like, if you would only
                  show me how. I wanted to try no ventures except such as I put money in your hands
                  to make a basis for."
               "But that you were only able to do while you confined yourself to little windfalls
                  for pocket-money. So purely a business arrangement as you contemplated—"
               "Ah, now you are angry; and indeed I had no intention of being rude. I only meant
                  that I did not wish to place myself under pecuniary obligations to any body; the
                  kindness and friendship I appreciated—you know I did—at a high value."
               What to make of this woman was more than he could decide. For years he had not
                  given any human being credit for possessing honesty or principle. He had looked
                  upon her as a woman hard to win—never to be won by him unless he paid very dearly
                  for the conquest. That in spite of her coquetry she could be pure and innocent, so
                  far as there was any possibility of wrong in her actions; that all this while she
                  had really believed he would content himself with doing her work and receiving a
                  few smiles and pretty words for payment, had never occurred to him."
               
               "I am sure you know this," she urged, when he did not speak, busy studying her,
                  and thinking the words I have set down. "Please say you did, Mr. Faulkner."
               She gave him one of her most dazzling smiles, and she looked very beautiful. The
                  instant's wonder and doubt left Dick Faulkner's mind. Was he to be done by this
                  artfulness, and laughed at for a fool—worse still, fail signally in what he had
                  believed would be his hour of triumph, in the very sight of the loveliness which
                  moved him as no beauty had ever before done? He had scarcely a decent impulse left
                  in his nature, and he loved this woman: I must use the word; it was his sort of
                  love, the strongest and fiercest he had ever felt or could feel, and a passion hot
                  enough to have tempted him to any extreme.
               "This is of no use," he exclaimed. "I love you, Alice! I'll do any thing you want;
                  only give me a kind word. My life is such a lonely one; I want to be loved! I have
                  purgatory at home; I—"
               She rose from her chair pale as death, her great eyes black with indignation; she
                  made a gesture which is indescribable unless you can remember Rachel, as Virginia,
                  ordering away the man sent to outrage her by insulting offers.
               "Leave the room!" was all she said; but she fairly hissed the words from between
                  her shut teeth. Her voice was little more than a whisper, but it would have been
                  impossible for human tones to have expressed more loathing and contempt.
               "Take care!" cried he, rushing into one of his furies; for, once excited, the
                  man's temper fell little short of insanity. "You have chosen to place yourself in
                  my power; you must take the consequences."
               "Oh, you coward!" she answered, in the same tone as before.
               "Don't you use one more such word! You told me in the beginning that you couldn't
                  raise this money. You are crippled with debts; I know more than you think. It
                  would be a pretty story that I helped you. Do you suppose any body is going to
                  believe the truth?"
               "You will know it," she replied; "and your knowing the falsehood would be my
                  bitterest revenge, where you are concerned."
               "You have chosen to defy me—"
               "Mr. Faulkner, I bade you leave this room! I knew you were base and despicable;
                  how utterly so it remained for you to prove."
               He caught the loose sleeve of her dress as she turned away, she was so beautiful
                  in her scorn. At that moment he would have gone straight down to purgatory for one
                  kindly glance.
               "I'd sell my soul for you," he exclaimed, huskily, "if you'd only let me love you;
                  I'd ask nothing, if you'll only give me one sweet word—"
               "Oh, this is worse than your threats," she interrupted.
               "I was mad to speak so. You know I would not harm you. No woman ever had the power
                  over me that you have; it is the blindest, the craziest infatuation—"
               "I can't put you out of my house," she broke in, feeling that unless she could end
                  this scene she must become a raving lunatic; "but I can leave you!"
               She had read of desperate creatures of her own sex committing deeds of violence,
                  and wondered if such things were possible; but at this moment Dick Faulkner's life
                  would not have been worth the purchase, if her hands could have laid hold of any
                  weapon with death in it.
               "Only listen to me," he pleaded. "I'll not stay; I'll not make you angry; but I
                  must speak just a word."
               "Let go my sleeve, then. I don't care to be addressed as if I were taken by a
                  policeman."
               She sat down again; her limbs were trembling so that she could not stand.
               "You are so pale; you—"
               "Finish what you had to say," said she, with cold contempt.
               It certainly was not easy to utter tender declarations, or dramatic remorse, under
                  such circumstances. He grew furiously angry again, and it had been many a day
                  since any thing so honest burst from his heart as the curse with which he cursed
                  her through his teeth. She caught the words, though in his rage he had not known
                  that they were more than a thought.
               "I think not," she said. "I am not a good woman, but I don't believe that I shall
                  have any thing so bad as a dwelling-place where your society would be
                  inevitable."
               "So you mean war!" he cried. "You want a battle, do you?"
               "There will be no occasion, Mr. Faulkner; you shall have your money."
               "That sounds well, but you know you couldn't raise one quarter of the sum to save
                  your immortal soul."
               She did know it, but something kept whispering to her that she could and should—to
                  set the time, even, when the payment should be ready.
               "In ten days you shall have your money," she said, slowly. "In the mean time, for
                  your own sake, if not for mine, you will be silent."
               "Do you think I am likely to tell—do you suppose me capable—"
               "In ten days you shall have your money," she repeated—still, as it seemed to her
                  in her frenzy, uttering words put into her mouth by some invisible power
                  extraneous to her will. "I—I am very tired now. Will you have the goodness to go
                  away?"
               "Shall I come here for it?" he asked, sullenly.
               "I want a written statement of every thing—you understand what I mean; I don't
                  know your business words—and I want a receipt. Yes, I suppose you will have to
                  come here."
               "And you mean that is the last time I ever shall, Mrs. Marchmont?" he demanded,
                  while an uglier frown darkened his face.
               "It is very possible, Mr. Faulkner," she answered swered, struggling back to her
                  usual indolent voice and manner, and sweeping him a slow courtesy. "Permit me to
                  wish you good-morning."
               There was nothing for it but to go quietly away; and Dick Faulkner yielded to the
                  necessity, not trying to add another word. He was gone, and Mrs. Marchmont had not
                  even leisure to yield to the hysterical spasms which were trying to overcome
                  her—the natural consequence of this prolonged suffering and excitement. She was
                  obliged to dress and go out; and it was not a pleasant part of town into which her
                  business led her, though during the past months she had grown only too familiar
                  with its appearance.
               The money—she must have the money; there was no other thought in her mind; the
                  money, the money!
               But it was not easy to impress upon her Israelitish friend whom she went to visit,
                  and in whose escritoire lay so much stamped paper with her dashing signature
                  attached, the necessity of lending it. Indeed, he pointed out with charming
                  candor, while putting a long ruler in and out of his sleeve, as if doing conjuring
                  tricks on a small scale, the utter impossibility of such a procedure on his part
                  under existing circumstances. He was so very quiet about the matter, so smilingly
                  persistent in his refusals, that his manner seemed only the last straw needed to
                  turn her brain.
               Sitting there in the dusty upper office where every thing she touched left its
                  impress on her delicate gray gloves and the small fortune, in the way of lace,
                  that decorated her dress, Mrs. Marchmont was brought face to face with the
                  startling fact that, as matters stood, she had even nothing available left to
                  mortgage, since the negotiations in regard to the Virginia lands had proceeded so
                  far that she could not incumber them at this moment. Nothing but somebody else's
                  very good name would assist her with her Hebrew, as he frankly, but mildly,
                  asserted. And the money to be raised within ten days; and, apparently, the only
                  way out of her difficulties to go quietly home and make a last investment in a
                  sufficient quantity of laudanum to send her out of Dick Faulkner's reach, at
                  least.
               It was not strange that some such dreadful thought flitted across her mind—if she
                  could be said to have a thought in the chaotic whirl of her senses. She was so
                  near mad, too, that she caught herself laughing at the horror of her maid when her
                  dead body was discovered; or perhaps the old relative who lived with her—prosaic
                  Miss Portman—would be the one to stumble over the cold carcass; and she would
                  shriek so dolefully; and people would talk and marvel. She knew she was laughing,
                  and her child of Israel looking a little oddly at her, but she could not restrain
                  herself. Yet all the while she was listening to his words, and saying over and
                  over, below her breath, the exclamation that had been the one conscious reflection
                  in her mind during her drive.
               The money—the money! She must have the money.
               She was capable of nothing beyond that weary repetition till across her dazed
                  brain struck the meaning of the sole hope held out by her Israelitish counselor.
                  Another name added after hers to the little bill—"the leedle pill," Moses's
                  descendant called it—might prove the "open sesame" required to free her from the
                  terrible dilemma.
               "A—what do you call it—an indorsement?" she demanded, sitting, suddenly, upright
                  in her chair.
               The Hebrew nodded.
               "If I can get that, you will give me the money?"
               "Why not, if the dame is edough?" he questioned in his turn, his peculiarities of
                  pronunciation rendered more remarkable than usual by an acute attack of
                  catarrh.
               "Somebody to indorse it—somebody to indorse it," she muttered.
               "Just so! Very leedle; then we have no troubles wid the pill."
               She left the office, and all the way home her thoughts roamed out among her
                  friends in search of some one who would possibly aid her in this emergency, and
                  fell back as wearily and helplessly as most persons must under such
                  circumstances.
               In all the world, among her hosts of acquaintances, she could only think of one
                  man who would assist her; but she felt that she could easier die than go to John
                  Worthington and make the confession which would be necessary.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               A HASTY WORD.
               THE season had been an unusually gay one, and from its opening Alice Marchmont had
                  allowed herself no repose, the leader of every species of fashionable dissipation,
                  till, had there been any person with the right to remonstrate, she must have
                  endured, in addition to her restlessness, the annoyance of expostulations and
                  reproaches in regard to her reckless conduct. Sometimes her old friend, John
                  Worthington—the only creature who ever ventured to scold her—did say a few warning
                  or sarcastic words; but he was not a society man, and at this period his
                  professional duties were so engrossing that he had little leisure to bestow even
                  upon her.
               And this week was worse than all the uncertainty that had gone before. The days
                  passed with frightful rapidity, filling her with horror and anxiety at their swift
                  flight, though they seemed endless as she looked back across their length. She had
                  herself set the term of probation—ten days—and six of them had already vanished,
                  and she was no more prepared to meet Dick Faulkner than in the hour when she had
                  so haughtily assured him he should have his money.
               
               How could she stay at home with the horrible phantoms which crowded about in her
                  loneliness growing more tangible each day! It was bad enough in a crowd; even then
                  she never knew when a sudden fear might check her laughter and blanch her
                  face—when some chance story or allusion might bring the horror of her position to
                  her mind. Worse than any thing, Dick Faulkner haunted her steps with his silky
                  smile, always watching her, she thought, with a certainty of triumph in his wicked
                  face which often made her so wild with dread that the ball-room floor would heave
                  like a sea under her feet, and the lights rock to and fro in a mist. No wonder
                  that even in those few days she altered rapidly in appearance, growing thin, with
                  deep, shadowy lines tracing themselves under her eyes, that only increased their
                  brilliancy. She was more beautiful than ever, but it was a beauty which would have
                  caused sharp anxiety to any body who loved her well enough to notice the
                  change.
               One man did observe it, and that was Kenneth Halford. Since the first meeting with
                  Mrs. Marchmont his feelings in regard to her had undergone many changes, most of
                  which were so inexplicable that he was often enraged with what seemed his own
                  weakness and fickle nature. Whenever the memory of the old days came up, he found
                  himself greatly touched by their influence; but he so utterly disapproved of her
                  rush after excitement, he so thoroughly despised half the men by whom she was
                  surrounded, and his strict sense of decorum was so deeply outraged by the gossip
                  which her careless conduct caused, that the woman herself was, at times, almost an
                  object of dislike. Often he thought that she wished—perhaps out of mere
                  coquetry—to subdue him by the power of those old associations; and then he grew
                  very bitter and hard toward her. Fortunately, just 'now, Milly Crofton was kept a
                  good deal at home by the illness of her cousin, so that Halford ran no risk of
                  being tempted into attentions which could disturb her peace of mind. The pleasure
                  of meeting the child again had been so great, that he was genuinely astonished.
                  Sometimes it fairly seemed as if she were the innocent creature whose love had
                  made his youth beautiful—that this dashing woman, with her ceaseless, painful
                  brilliancy, hard and cold and bright as the diamonds blazing in her hair, could
                  have nothing in common with the girl whose image had been so deeply impressed upon
                  his heart. Yet, perhaps an hour after indulging in such reflections, he would meet
                  Mrs. Marchmont, and the weariness and trouble his quick eyes read in her face,
                  some chance quiver of her voice, some frank appeal to his judgment, or pathetic
                  deprecation of his censures, would bring up—not the old love—but a feeling of
                  tender compassion which caused him for the time to believe she was not really
                  false and cold.
               He was in a singular state of mind; yet it was a phase' which many a man of his
                  age must pronounce natural. Mrs. Marchmont's manner toward him was the perfection
                  of caprice, and it was not possible to have the slightest clue to her conduct. If
                  this woman had indeed loved him through all these years; if, in spite of her
                  worldly life, the renewal of their acquaintance had brought the youthful dream
                  back in its freshness, and his conduct the first night they met had helped to do
                  it—must he not try to forget the past—to have faith in her? If not—if he could
                  become convinced that she was the heartless coquette he had striven in the
                  bitterness of his anger to believe—why, then, to love Milly Crofton would only be
                  like going back years and years, and taking up his broken hopes just where they
                  were brightest; and this woman would have no connection in his mind with that
                  season—Milly would be the realization of his boyish ideal.
               Little wonder that Mrs. Marchmont puzzled him. He could not know how his presence
                  at one instant gave her a feeling of protection, by bringing up the old days; how
                  in the next some softened look in his eyes, some familiar smile brightening his
                  lips, forced into her mind a recollection of the terrors which surrounded her; and
                  the bare thought that she dared not love any man filled her with rage and pain.
                  She could not bear to have him leave her, because, in her desolation, he was the
                  one link that connected her with the innocent past; and yet she could not allow
                  him to love her, because, even if she lived beyond these days of peril, the memory
                  of their secret would always remain, and leave her afraid of him. She could not
                  endure to lose his respect; if she had loved him better than in her girlish days,
                  it would have been easier to part than to run the risk of living till the hour
                  when some chance might make her reckless conduct known to him, and kill his
                  affection outright and forever. And even a knowledge of half the truth would do
                  it—she knew him so well—so firm, and with such rooted principles of honor; hard,
                  too, toward his own weaknesses and those of others.
               Let him love her? She dared not! With the stain of Dick Faulkner's insulting kiss
                  upon her hand; with the remembrance that, in her mad extravagance, her craving for
                  social distinction, she had bartered with this wretch smiles and coquettish words
                  in return for a share in his Wall Street bubbles, until he actually presumed to
                  believe that he was at liberty to present his passion to her eyes; that she had
                  expected—that— Oh, Alice could never go further in her thoughts! She so hated and
                  abhorred herself that she would strike the hand he had polluted with his kiss
                  fierce blows, overwhelmed by a sense of actual degradation and guilt. Besides all
                  this, the fact that her name was attached to scores of bills lying in the
                  money-lender's safe—that she was covered with debts, and, worse than any thing,
                  only a few days to elapse before she must raise the money to pay Faulkner.
               She love and be loved! The words would utter themselves in spite of her—not
                  connected especially with Kenneth Halford—rousing her to such misery, wrath, and
                  self-contempt, that she would fairly moan in her agony, wrestle the night through,
                  wonder if she should go mad before the dawn—lying, perhaps, on the floor just as
                  she had returned from some ball, blazing with jewels and costly raiment.
               One night, as she entered her opera-box, Halford chanced to sit where he had a
                  full view of her face; and the change was very plain to him. She returned his
                  salutation with a slow, difficult smile, and shrunk back into the shadow of the
                  curtains. Not obliged for the moment to talk, her countenance had not lost the
                  expression which she had brought out of her solitary chamber.
               Kenneth Halford was not that meanest of created beings, a man given to fancying
                  that women were in love with him. But it was not strange, considering the past,
                  and the manner in which she had treated him since his return, that, now perceiving
                  the sudden trouble in her face as she looked at him, he should wonder whether he
                  had any share in the pain which he read there. The idea brought him no pleasure;
                  it did not gratify his vanity, as would have been the case with many men; but his
                  strict sense of honor and justice made it impossible to put the thought aside. He
                  had committed a score of follies on that first evening they met; he must atone for
                  them, if necessary; he could not retreat from the position which he had then
                  assumed. On the instant up rose a vision of Milly Crofton's girlish prettiness and
                  innocence; he asked himself why, and found no satisfactory answer, since he still
                  regarded her as a mere child to be petted and amused, without any capability of
                  rousing a stronger sentiment in a heart so worn as his. He wished heartily just
                  then that he had remained in Europe; wondered testily if he should always be a
                  fool; but turned to glance again toward the box, and met Mrs. Marchmont's eyes as
                  she once more leaned forward from among the curtains. It seemed a sort of
                  invitation to join her—one that he could not refuse. He left his seat and made his
                  way through the lobbies to her loge, with his mind in a state of confusion very
                  humiliating to a person who prided himself, during these latter years, on having
                  arrived at such entire self-control that he was never to be shaken out of it, able
                  always to analyze his own emotions, know exactly what they meant, and how much
                  they were worth.
               With his hand upon the door-knob, he had three minds to turn back; but that stern
                  inward monitor of his asserted its power again, and held him fast. It was too late
                  to retreat, he must go in; if events justified his suspicions, he must continue in
                  the course he had begun. That she had once been false through weakness would offer
                  no excuse for trifling on his part; it would appear like an unworthy revenge for
                  the pain she had caused him in the old days; she had suffered enough without
                  having this humiliating idea added.
               "I thought you must have gone to the moon for wonderful discoveries, till I saw
                  you down yonder," she said, as he entered. "Indeed, you look a little as if you
                  had been, and had just returned, and were still dazed by your lunar
                  expedition."
               As he took her hand he could feel, even through her glove, how icy cold it was,
                  how suddenly its pulses leaped under his touch, and could see the quick rush of
                  color which tinged her cheeks. Certainly he could not be accused of vanity for
                  thinking that his appearance, the pressure of his fingers upon her own, had caused
                  this emotion; it was true, too. But how could he understand, or dream, what the
                  feelings really were which gave rise to her trouble? He could not imagine that,
                  when he came in obedience to her glance, and she felt that he had not been able to
                  resist her influence, there rushed upon her, like a flash of lightning, the
                  thought of all which kept her so far apart from him—that this possible awakening
                  of the faded dream must be subdued, crushed, rooted out, just as those terrible
                  recollections quelled it in her own heart. But she could not think; she would have
                  a little rest, talk of the pleasant things of her youth, and forget the present,
                  and the awful possibilities of the future.
               "Why hasn't one met you for several nights?" she asked.
               "I think I have had my share of balls," he replied; "and society here seems to
                  mean dancing insanely from one week's end to another."
               "Now don't be misanthropical or wise; you will have to wait several years yet
                  before you do either well," laughed she. "But why have you not been to see
                  me?"
               "Are you ever at home?"
               "What an unpardonable Yankeeism in a man who has lived so long abroad, to answer
                  one question by another. Come, we will have a course of interrogations, since they
                  please you! Have you been to ask whether I was or not?"
               "It is not very—"
               "Take care! Reply as if you were in the Palace of Truth—always supposing that any
                  thing masculine could enter."
               "I have not been to-day," he said, finding it difficult, in his present mood, to
                  smile and jest.
               "Yesterday, then?"
               "Not since the day before."
               She looked troubled again. Her first thought was, did he suspect—could any whisper
                  have crept out—or had Faulkner in his rage already begun to hint the scandals with
                  which he had threatened her? This was always her first dread now, when she
                  perceived, or fancied, the slightest change in any body's manner toward her.
               "I believe I have been busy," he continued; "at least, I have made a great
                  pretense of work."
               "And so satisfied your conscience," she replied, growing animated again just from
                  remembering how ridiculous her fear was. "Make an ample confession, and perhaps we will forgive
                  you—oh, Miss Portman?"
               She remembered that she had forgotten to give the spinster any opportunity of
                  waving the conversation away from herself, in her usual shy manner, and it was a
                  matter of conscience with Alice to do that once or twice in the course of an
                  evening.
               So now, hearing her name, the virgin turned from her contemplation of the stage
                  with her customary flutter and nervous gasping for breath.
               "I beg your pardon; did you speak, my dear?" she asked.
               "Yes; I'm always talking, you know, though, luckily, it does not amount to
                  much."
               "Oh, my love!" quavered the spinster, who never could bear that Mrs. Marchmont
                  should speak slightingly of herself.
               "I suppose that means you regret my folly," laughed she.
               "Oh, my love!" quavered the virgin anew, raising her voice half a note higher, so
                  that it sounded more than ever like the squeak of a mouse caught in a trap.
               "But where was I?" pursued Mrs. Marchmont. "I was asking somebody something—Oh, it
                  was you, Adeliza."
               "Asking me— Oh! yes, you were—I mean I heard you pronounce my name," returned the
                  old maid, struggling, after her habit, to be perfectly truthful and correct in her
                  assertions.
               "I was asking you if you thought we had better forgive Mr. Halford his numerous
                  sins and enormities."
               The spinster began to wave off the conversation with more than ordinary haste;
                  this style of talk was completely beyond her comprehension. She waved, and
                  gurgled, and looked so awfully stately, in the height of her embarrassment, that a
                  stranger would have believed her the most formidable old woman one could possibly
                  encounter.
               "I fear that Miss Portman thinks my enormities beyond the reach of pardon,"
                  observed Halford, unable for the life of him to resist laughing, and desirous of
                  affording himself a decent pretext.
               "Oh, Mr. Halford!" was now the squeak of the poor mouse.
               "Never mind," said Alice; "you can't think too ill of him; but you are not bound
                  to put your opinion in words."
               "Oh, my love—my love! When you know how highly I respect Mr. Halford—you are
                  jesting—pray, pray state that you are jesting."
               "I really can not jest on a subject so serious," returned Alice; "but, to relieve
                  your mind, I will admit that you like this wretched man very much; does that
                  content you?"
               The spinster sat up straighter than ever, and heaved a sigh of relief.
               "I'm sure I thank you exceedingly, Miss Portman," said Halford. "I wish you could
                  teach your cousin a little of your universal charity."
               Poor Miss Portman grew frightened and bewildered again, and waved and shook, to
                  keep from becoming entangled in the web of talk.
               "Don't abuse me to my relations, if you please; that's shabbier than any thing,
                  Mr. Halford," said Alice, good-naturedly coming to the old maid's rescue.
               Miss Portman took advantage of the interposition to lean forward and study the
                  stage attentively, wondering why she could not be let alone. But just as she was
                  composing her mind to be tranquilly deafened by the crash of the instruments,
                  Halford, fearing that his teasing remark might have annoyed her, felt it his duty
                  to address her once more.
               "They've almost reached the famous duet, haven't they, Miss Portman?"
               She looked back helplessly; she had seen the opera at least twelve separate times,
                  but had no more idea to what he referred than if he had asked her to explain a
                  page of Sanscrit.
               "I am sorry—I—"
               "Don't let him disturb your enjoyment," said Alice; "go back to your beloved
                  music; he only wants to get rid of my searching questions."
               Miss Portman changed her attitude. Really, this was likely to prove a very
                  fatiguing night—these young people were so thoughtless!
               "I wish I could be certain," she faltered, consulting the libretto.
               "It is of no consequence," Halford said, sorry now that he had disturbed her
                  again.
               He spoke to Mrs. Marchmont about some other subject; and this time the spinster
                  was allowed to resume her listening attitude, and retain it till her head buzzed
                  between the roar of the orchestra and her efforts to discover the hidden meaning
                  which she felt the music ought to possess.
               "Will you confess?" Alice asked Halford, anxious to keep their talk down to the
                  idle nonsense where she felt safest. "Only don't imitate 'Topsy,' and, for fear of
                  punishment, 'fess by inventing something."
               "I believe I have been cross," he said.
               "Bravo! That sounds more probable than men's confessions often do: with the world
                  in general—not with yourself, of course—because no man ever admits that there
                  could be any reason."
               He was vexed with her trifling. If she really cared for him, and was glad to have
                  him once more at her side, why did she treat him as she would have done any dandy
                  who chanced to be drawn into her orbit?
               "Do you always mean to tease me with persiflage?" he asked, in a tone that sounded almost ill-natured.
               "By which pretty French word you intend to tell me that I talk nothing but
                  nonsense."
               "Not that; but is one never to be serious, nor in earnest?"
               "Better not," she said; "much better not."
               "And yet one grows very weary of this surface life."
               "Only experience teaches us that it is dangerous to go below it," she replied.
                  "Very young people can afford to be in earnest—or what they believe so—but who
                  would have the courage for a second trial?"
               "That would depend on how much one had at heart the object to be gained. I don't
                  like to believe there is no possibility of happiness after one's past youth—"
               "Ah, don't let us talk about happiness," she interrupted. "One has dreams,
                  delusions—what you will—until the power of dreaming is lost; but where are we
                  straying to? Tell me what you are doing, Mr. Halford! Do you propose to give us a
                  new book this season?"
               Miss Portman was temporarily deaf and blind by this time; so this little dialogue
                  was lost upon her. She was a conscientious old soul, and, though she did not know
                  one note of music from another, always listened diligently to orchestra and voices
                  with an attention which people who considered themselves real lovers of harmony
                  would have done well to imitate. It was the good woman's creed that one ought
                  always to be gaining knowledge; so night after night she listened to Verdi or
                  Donizetti, gaining nothing apparently beyond a severe headache; but she had
                  constantly the hope of finding out what it all meant, and so did not regard the
                  time or pain as wasted.
               Halford looked eagerly at Alice again. Was she indeed afraid to talk seriously
                  with him? Was there that left in her heart which she feared to betray, dreading
                  lest it should meet with no return in his? Was she conscious that, in spite of her
                  worldliness, her nature still held capabilities of feeling and love, and was not
                  willing to risk trouble for herself a second time? He gazed so earnestly at her
                  while propounding these mental queries that she began to laugh.
               "Are you about to tell my fortune?" she asked. "Some old Frenchman, the other
                  night, professed his ability of reading the future by the lines on one's face. The
                  best of it was, he said it to Mrs. Stuyvesant."
               "I never saw any lines on her face except those made by India ink and rouge," he
                  answered, trying to do his part in the nonsense.
               "Now you are malicious! I left every thing to the imagination; but so few people
                  really know how to say ill-natured things well."
               She was too nervous this evening to be quiet; she chatted and laughed until, vexed
                  by the contrast between her light talk and the shadows in her face, he said,
                  abruptly,
               "I wonder—I do wonder if you are happy!"
               Mrs. Marchmont gave him a glance of keen reproach—not from wounded sentiment—only
                  it seemed so bitter a mockery for any human being to talk to her of happiness,
                  that, coming from his lips, it sounded like an absolute taunt; for she forgot that
                  he could possess no knowledge of the troubles which made her restless and
                  miserable.
               "I would change places with the first beggar I met in the street!" she exclaimed,
                  passionately. "I, happy! What do you mock me with such questions for? Oh, if only
                  men and women could have their lives back—if there were ever any possibility of
                  bridging the gulf that sweeps between them and their youth!"
               She stopped, and looked away across the house, wondering at her own madness in
                  speaking like this. She was not thinking, when she spoke, of any connection
                  between her past and his—not even remembering that he was the man who had loved
                  her in that youth which she lamented—only thinking of the dreariness, the
                  desolation, the horrors, which surrounded her at this moment. But what could he
                  imagine? He saw her grow deathly pale; saw the pain darken her eyes; perceived her
                  stung by his careless words into an utter forgetfulness of the artificiality with
                  which, in general, she so successfully covered her real feelings. It was natural
                  enough that he should be hurried by his regret and sympathy—his Quixotic ideas,
                  where women were concerned—into uttering an avowal which he had not meant to
                  speak—an avowal for which he knew perfectly well he should, in a calmer moment,
                  find no warrant whatever in his heart.
               "It is never too late to bring the past back when hearts remain unchanged," he
                  whispered. "Alice, do you remember—is the recollection of the old dream sweet to
                  you?"
               She gave him one startled look, suddenly recalled to a consciousness of the
                  dangerous ground upon which her outburst had led her. But before she could answer,
                  there was an invasion into the box, and Halford was forced to resign his place to
                  the new-comers. Among the men came Mrs. Marchmont's French baron. and she
                  proceeded to turn his poor head more completely by her smiles and words—a hot rage
                  and bitterness took possession of her—there was a horrible pleasure in tormenting
                  somebody in her present mood.
               The baron was exceedingly fluttered and charmed by the beautiful woman's marked
                  consideration, till, between his sentimental mood and the thought of the enormous
                  fortune for which report gave her credit, he regretted that there was no
                  opportunity of securing the prize then and there.
               Alice rushed from her maddening reflections back to the safeguards of folly; and
                  at length, sickened by the nonsense in which she apparently took her part with
                  such enjoyment, Halford made his bow and went away. She was glad to see him go;
                  any body who reminded her of the past—of all that she had sacrificed and lost in
                  her insane chase after excitement and distinction—was odious to her at this
                  moment. The dandies' absurd compliments—the baron's broken English, whispered
                  words of laborious flattery in his own tongue, his glances and sighs—were more
                  acceptable than any thing else. The whole was poor and miserable, empty as her
                  life; but it was safest and best. She could gratify her irritated temper by
                  laughing at his tenderness; and if there was nothing amusing in the dandies' jests, at least there was
                  the satisfaction of helping them to be ridiculous. She did not want such men as
                  Halford or John Worthington about her now; they were too clear-sighted; they
                  talked of things which frenzied her, by rousing thought and reminding her what a
                  wreck she had made of her life. The baron was better than that; he talked as if
                  she were a beautiful doll, without an idea beyond her toilet, or an ability to
                  appreciate a chapter of doubtful morality in a French novel. The dandies were
                  better with their stereotyped dress and appearance, their back-hair elaborately
                  parted, their attitudes so precisely alike, each bending slightly forward, hanging
                  to his hat with one hand, the other fingering his watch-chain—all uttering the
                  same interjections, and built so completely on one model that she felt as if there
                  were a puppet before her, which her dizzy eyes magnified into half a dozen. Even
                  young Bramwell's well-known remark, which she induced him to repeat, was better
                  than Halford's talk.
               "What a beautiful buff rose, Mr. Bramwell!"
               "Yaas; I always insist on that color; it is so difficult to dress a blonde, Mrs.
                  Marchmont!"
               So Halford left her, remembering, as he walked homeward, with a sensation of anger
                  and dread, that he had gone a step too far. Other men might have considered the
                  words which he had spoken the idlest possible figure of speech. Not so in his
                  creed—spoken to a woman whom he had once wooed. So he went home, thoroughly
                  dispirited and disgusted, recollecting Alice as she looked surrounded by her
                  butterfly admirers, and forgetting the change in her appearance which had lured
                  him on, as he ruefully recalled that whispered question. Besides, Milly Crofton's
                  image came up like a vision of rest, and he could not drive it away. Altogether,
                  Halford retired with an uncomfortable feeling that the world was out of joint, and
                  that he had been doing his best to put his portion of it in a still more
                  uncomfortable predicament.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               CLOSER AND CLOSER.
               HALFORD did not go in sight of Mrs. Marchmont the next day, nor the next; but he
                  by no means forgot the words which he had spoken, and was wondering how he ought
                  to act. It might have been a relief to him to know that Alice had forgotten ever
                  hearing his whispered question. She was too busy to give him, or any other
                  possible or past admirer, a moment's thought in any way.
               Busy with the graver matters of her life; and stern enough they were. There was
                  the worry of arranging a new influx of bills—holding consultations in regard to
                  the sale of her lands, from which she hoped so much, and growing sick with horror
                  at the new delays, as she remembered how the time was fleeting away. Besides these
                  affairs, rushing about in a vain attempt to raise the money she had promised to
                  pay Dick Faulkner, circumscribed in her efforts by the fact that she dared make no
                  trials in quarters where a suspicion could intrude into her world. Two days
                  passed, in which she lived through mental anguish enough to have lasted a
                  lifetime. Indeed, the second evening she was ill; she came home only in season for
                  dinner, having been again to her Jewish friend, with no better result than on the
                  first occasion, having tried to soften the hearts of sundry of his fraternity with
                  whom the experiences of the last year had made her acquainted, but failing as
                  signally as she had done with him. No effort was of any use; she had turned in
                  every direction, and was fairly brought to bay. Even to raise the sum required
                  upon her jewels was out of the question; her Israelite already had a lien upon
                  them, and twice a week made himself certain that such as he left in her possession
                  were safe, and the original stones. She had seen him, and his petticoated
                  associate—who good-naturedly allowed herself, in her visits, to be supposed, among
                  the domestics, a worthy widow in deep distress—so often examine the gems and
                  settings—touch them with their tongues, or attempt other tests familiar to the
                  initiated—that she fairly loathed the sight of the glittering baubles, and would
                  never have put them on only she feared that to appear without them would occasion
                  remark; and she had grown so afraid of rousing the least suspicion, that it was
                  almost a monomania with her.
               Kenneth Halford need not have feared that she spent the time dreaming of his
                  imprudent words. Her reflections would have been as prosaic as those of the most
                  determined money-worshiper in Wall Street, had not the dreadful skeleton dogged
                  her footsteps all day, and kept watch over her pillow through the whole night. No
                  hope, no gleam of light, and the time she had set for Dick Faulkner to claim his
                  money drawing closer and closer, and she helpless as a blind man bound in a
                  dungeon! Three days more, three short days; if at their expiration she had not the
                  sum in her hands, what would follow? It was the persistent iteration of that
                  question in her ears as she drove home, while the skeleton grinned beside her on
                  the seat of her clarence, which overwhelmed her so completely that she had to
                  throw herself on her bed and admit the plea of illness.
               Poor Miss Portman was terribly alarmed, and forced numberless potions upon her,
                  which. in her bewilderment, the old lady offered rather indiscriminately from any
                  bottle she chanced to lay hands upon. Suffering as she was—so near nervous spasms
                  that she dared not attempt to speak—Alice was conscious of tasting red lavender,
                  cologne, sherry, Miss Portman's favorite Mohawk bitters, not to mention tea, sal
                  volatile and various other remedies, in quick succession. For an hour Mrs.
                  Marchmont herself almost believed the illness a warning that a speedy means of
                  relief out of her troubles was at hand, and endured the agonies which only
                  diseased nerves can produce—agonies of which no human being sound in body and mind
                  can form the least conception. But the utter collapse of force and will did not
                  last long. The instant she could rise, it became impossible for her to lie there,
                  and wait even for death; and with the return of volition came the sense of her own
                  absurdity in believing that such a boon would be granted. The mere physical
                  restlessness induced by her state would have made it a relief to run, dance,
                  scream, until she fell blind and insensible.
               Toward midnight she got up, and, in spite of Miss Portman's tears, her maid's
                  expostulations, she insisted on dressing and going to Mrs. Lawrence's party.
               "I will go, my best of women," she said to her friend: "so you needn't waste your
                  breath in words."
               "You will kill yourself," moaned Miss Portman; and Alice burst into a fit of
                  hysterical laughter which increased the good soul's distress.
               "You shall stay at home," Mrs. Marchmont said; "I'll not drag you out, but go I
                  must; it is the best thing for me; I am not ill, only nervous—no reason for it,
                  either."
               "Not ill!" squeaked the poor Chinese mouse. "Look at yourself in the glass."
               "Oh, my dear, a little rice-powder will hide that! Now don't tease me; that's a
                  darling! Pauline, I am awfully pale to-night; so we'll intensify it; then people
                  will think I did it on purpose. Get out that new dress from Paris—the black
                  one—and I'll wear a few diamonds; I'll get those myself. You are always calling me
                  careless, my Portman; admire my attempts at improvement—I don't even let that
                  faithful Pauline keep the key of the safe where I have my ornaments and
                  papers."
               She laughed and jested while her toilet went on, and, in less than an hour from
                  the time when she lay writhing on her bed in the last of those nervous spasms,
                  entered Mrs. Lawrence's drawing-rooms, more peculiar-looking and beautiful than
                  ever, though with a face to have excited any body's pity who had time or
                  discernment to read it. Her dress added to the effect—of black lace, heavily
                  trimmed with jet ornaments; no trace of color except a broad green scarf; bands of
                  black velvet about her neck, and arms upon which blazed diamonds of great value—it
                  was odd and striking as possible, but utterly beyond criticism, even to feminine
                  eyes.
               One man at least noticed and read her countenance aright—that was John
                  Worthington, the man whom, of all the world, she most respected, and whose
                  judgment she most feared. He considered the gravity of his forty years somewhat
                  out of place in such scenes as the present, but he had come to-night to gratify
                  his niece. When he saw Mrs. Marchmont, he looked straight through the glitter and
                  the brilliant smiles, and knew that she was either suffering mentally or was very
                  very ill. He went up to her, and the first words he spoke were,
               "In the name of Heaven, what have you been doing to yourself?"
               "Putting on my prettiest new dress, and marking under my eyes with India ink," she
                  answered.
               "India ink never made those lines," retorted he; "nothing but sleepless nights and
                  hard pain ever did it."
               "That is all the gratitude one gets for frankness in this wicked world! I don't
                  suppose there is another woman here who would have made the confession."
               "Will you tell me what you have been doing?"
               "I thought I had just done you that honor."
               "Nonsense! I have not seen you for nearly a fortnight, and I never saw any body so
                  altered."
               "Very well; you have always told me I was the most capricious creature in the
                  world; what do you expect?"
               "I believe you would jest in your coffin," he said, rather severely.
               "After I had seen whether my shroud was becoming," she answered, unmoved by his
                  gravity, and laughing in a way which caused his stout nerves to quiver with
                  anxiety.
               "Have you had a doctor?"
               "No; and I'm not going to make my will, so I don't want a lawyer. Keep your horrid
                  questions for the court-room, and tell me why I have not seen you for an age."
               "I wish I had taken time to go and see you," he said, regretfully. "I would have
                  made sure that you did something for yourself."
               "I have done my best to-night in the way of dressing, and it's wicked of you to
                  destroy my confidence by abusing my appearance as soon as I arrive. But how on
                  earth does it happen that you are here?"
               "Partly to oblige Constance, partly that I remembered I had not seen you for some
                  time, and I wanted to know what you were doing. I felt certain of finding you in
                  this Babel."
               "Don't come to people's houses and call them bad names; it's not polite! Doing?
                  nothing, as usual."
               "Then it is time you did something, if this is the effect that a lack of
                  occupation has upon you."
               "Ah, now, let my looks alone," she pleaded, with a smile that it was difficult to
                  resist; "please be amiable."
               But though he smiled, he would not relinquish the subject, and said, with
                  gravity,
               "I thought you would treat me differently; I thought you would be frank and
                  honest—"
               "Don't go taking away my character! Yes, you may, on second thoughts; like most
                  people, I'd be glad to get rid of it."
               "Alice," he said, calling her by the familiar name, as he had been in the habit of
                  doing from her childhood, "there is something the matter! Either you are ill, or
                  some trouble has come upon you."
               
               "Trouble! Always the first thought with a lawyer! I have neither near relations
                  nor a mother-in-law. May I ask, what trouble would be likely to have the
                  impertinence to assail me?"
               "Then you are ill!"
               "How you do ring the changes! Oh, John Worthington, John Worthington, you've
                  buried yourself among your law-books till you are almost daff."
               He would have been vexed with her, only his anxiety prevented any such
                  feeling.
               "Alice," he said, "I thought you considered me your friend."
               "Dear soul, don't get sentimental! The baron gave me his arm up stairs, and he has
                  exhausted that style for the evening. You know my baron, don't you?"
               "Yes, I know him, and he's an ass! But don't you feel alarmed about my growing
                  sentimental."
               "He resents the bare idea as a slanderous aspersion upon his legal character; what
                  a delightful collection of long words!"
               "I do think that a friendship which dates back to your childhood—"
               "There's no such word!" she interrupted, for an instant breaking down in her part,
                  and giving vent to the bitterness in her soul. "Who has any friends—what does
                  friendship mean? Pleasant words—an exchange of dinners! Suppose trouble
                  came—nonsense, Mr. Worthington; I am not a girl to believe in romances; I am a
                  woman—a coquette—I have no heart, no ability to feel."
               "Yes, you have," he answered. "Ah, child—I may call you child—tell me if you have
                  any real anxiety or care?"
               "Yes; my bracelet is too tight! Didn't I do my bit of tragedy well?"
               She could not tease him into anger or drive him away.
               "You shall not vex me," he said.
               "Wouldn't do it for the world; I should have to beg your pardon. But now tell
                  me—I've a question to ask—a grave, legal question."
               He almost thought her serious for an instant, her face and eyes grew so
                  earnest.
               "Ask it," he said; "I will answer."
               She hesitated a second longer; the half-formed determination to speak freely which
                  he had seen in her countenance gave place to a provoking smile.
               "Shall I become a baroness? That's the question! Bless me, I do believe I'm
                  talking Shakspeare."
               "I thought you never boasted of your conquests," said he, sternly.
               "For shame, as if I were likely to! But it is my creed that a woman may marry whom
                  she wishes; so I might be a baroness."
               "Very well, be one, if you can, and the idea pleases you."
               "I declare, he is downright crabbed about it! After wanting me to ask advice, and
                  all."
               "I'll not be vexed," he said.
               "But I shall," laughed she, certain that he was about to speak seriously, and
                  longing to prevent it.
               "When I promised to be your friend—when I promised your husband that I would be—I
                  was in earnest. I should poorly prove my claim to the title, if I did not
                  expostulate with you upon your conduct."
               "I don't want a friend," she cried, her nerves exasperated to a pitch where she
                  could no longer control herself. Her haunting fear that some whisper had crept out
                  returned, and drove her so nearly wild that she hardly knew what she said. "What
                  do you mean, Mr. Worthington, by questioning and watching me like this? What do
                  you want to accuse me of?"
               "Questioning and watching, Alice!"
               "Oh, I beg your pardon; I did not mean it! I do believe I am mad. Please let me
                  alone! You are the only friend I ever had; don't hate me."
               "What an exaggerated word! As if I could lose my interest in you—my liking, which
                  dates so far back."
               "You might; nobody can answer for himself; you might."
               "Alice, you have some trouble; don't deny it."
               "No, no. Come away; we are too near the conservatory; the flowers make me ill.
                  Yes, that's it; I am ill—I mean I was! Mr. Worthington, I thought a while ago that
                  I was dying."
               He gave a sort of groan.
               "Don't be frightened! It was pure nervousness—hysterics—but it was like dying.
                  It's the life I lead; why, I work harder than a factory-girl."
               "You must be quiet; you are completely worn out, and can not go on as you have
                  been doing."
               "Yes, I know. I will be quiet, but not yet; I can't yet. There comes the baron for
                  his redowa— Oh dear! Where is Constance? Oh, I see her yonder; how pretty she
                  looks."
               Her partner came up, and she floated away. Mr. Worthington saw her dancing with a
                  smile on her lips, and the fools staring at her.
               When Mrs. Marchmont was able to think, she remembered how wildly she had talked to
                  her friend, making an idiot of herself, as she called it in her thoughts. To have
                  him, of all people in the world, watching and suspecting her; and she to give him
                  added grounds for believing that she had some trouble, by talking in that crazy
                  fashion. She could only comfort herself by thinking that what she had said would
                  not sound as it might have done from another person's lips. She was so much in the
                  habit of indulging in every extravagance in the way of language, appearing as
                  whimsical and capricious as she saw fit, that perhaps the painful impression would
                  speedily leave his mind.
               The baron was talking to her, inclined to be tender and pathetic, and she had
                  great difficulty culty to keep him from a downright declaration; and she did not
                  want that, at least now. Whom could she tell what might happen? Every possible or
                  impossible way out of her dilemma occurred to her. If stories did get abroad; if
                  Faulkner did sully her name with his vile aspersions, so as to make a residence
                  among her old friends unpleasant, then she might marry the baron at once—always
                  supposing she sold her lands and recovered her fortune—and get away forever. But
                  if she did not? And in two days more the period for redeeming her pledge to
                  Faulkner would arrive. Good heavens! she should be a raving lunatic before then.
                  At least that would settle matters; and she laughed again, till the baron asked
                  what amused her.
               "Only Mrs. Stuyvesant's turban," said she; "what a flamingo she looks!"
               "I do not know the flamingo," he answered, in his hesitating English. "But you are
                  of a great gayety to-night."
               "Yes; I never was in better spirits."
               "Hilass! and you have not the pity for me, and I sigh;" and here he did it
                  elaborately.
               "I wouldn't; it's bad for digestion! There, the music is stopping; take me to a
                  seat."
               She caught sight of herself in a mirror as they passed down the room: her cheeks
                  were flushed, and she looked quite a different creature from what she had on
                  entering. She could endure scrutiny now, even that of John Worthington; only for
                  the present she would avoid him, if possible. She was so near mad to-night that
                  there was no telling what she might do or say to rouse fresh wonder in his mind. A
                  group of men gathered about her, and rather crowded the disconsolate baron into
                  the background. Looking out from the circle. Alice perceived Kenneth Halford at a
                  distance, talking with Milly Crofton and her particular friend, John Worthington's
                  niece. A sharp envy of the youth and innocence of the two girls filled Mrs.
                  Marchmont's soul; she could have shrieked in agony as she reflected upon all which
                  lay between her and the season when she had been like them.
               Presently Dick Faulkner thrust himself in among the group about her, and she
                  thought,
               "You are the cause of every thing—oh, you reptile! How I do lie to myself; it was
                  not his work; just my own recklessness, my own wickedness, has done the
                  whole."
               Undeterred by her cool obliviousness of his presence, he got closer to her, joined
                  in the conversation, and at last absolutely asked her to dance. He knew that she
                  would refuse; still he could not resist working himself into a passion by running
                  the risk of being snubbed, as he called it. He was obliged to repeat his question
                  before she vouchsafed any consciousness of his having addressed her.
               "Won't you dance with me? You never did but once."
               "And once was quite enough," she replied, indifferent to the fact that there were
                  a number of people listening. "I heard the other day that your wife said I flirted
                  with you."
               "Oh, I think not," said Dick, looking rather sheepish.
               "Yes, she did; and it was ill-natured of her—very! Why, good gracious! I never
                  said she flirted last summer, when she danced every night with Howard
                  Conyers."
               Now every body knew that Howard Conyers was the only man ever known to get an
                  advantage of Faulkner in a bargain; but he did let Dick in for a large amount of
                  money, and then failed; and people said that Dick had been friends with him in the
                  hope that Mrs. Faulkner would flirt until she compromised herself enough to render
                  a divorce possible. Mrs. Faulkner said it louder than any one else, and of course
                  the world was ready to believe it; consequently, Mrs. Marchmont's little retort
                  caused Dick nearly to burst a blood-vessel with rage.
               Mrs. Marchmont turned, and saw Kenneth Halford standing near, and looking at her
                  very gravely. It was the style of speech to offend his sense of delicacy. John
                  Worthington would have said that she had served the scoundrel right, and have
                  liked her the better for her unmanageable tongue.
               "I suppose he is disgusted," she thought; "so much the better." Then she
                  remembered that he was the last link which connected her with her youth—to the
                  beautiful past; and with her usual inconsistency, her heart cried out, "I can't
                  let him go; I can't have him hate me; I can't!"
               She smiled at him, and made him come nearer; then she said,
               "I promised to promenade with you while they are doing the quadrille; we will go
                  now."
               So she took his arm and got away from her admirers, the baron sighing dolefully to
                  the last, and Dick Faulkner treating her to a parting menace from his black eyes
                  which made her shiver, desperate as she was.
               "You are thinking me the rudest woman you ever saw," she said, abruptly, as they
                  passed on.
               "Not that," he answered; "you could never be that."
               "And a story-teller into the bargain."
               "But since just now it was in my favor!"
               "I was dying to get away, and I knew those tiresome wretches would bang about
                  unless I said I had promised to promenade with you. One has to tell so many
                  falsehoods—it is loathsome! Ah me, what are you thinking? That I am not like the
                  Alice you remember?"
               He had been thinking that, and as he hesitated, she went on—
               "Oh, very unlike her. So that was your thought, Kenneth? Well, well, Heaven knows
                  you were right."
               It always softened him when she spoke the old name; and she knew it. Just then,
                  her wish was not to lose her power over this man—the one living memory of her
                  vanished life.
               
               "Sometimes I wonder if you are as much changed in reality as you seem," he
                  said.
               "Then I seem changed?"
               "You must feel it, I think."
               "Do I not? Sometimes I wonder too! Oh, Kenneth, life hasn't been kind to me—it
                  hasn't been kind."
               The familiar pathetic voice, the same mournful droop of the head—how it brought
                  the old time back! But even as he remembered, he chanced to glance toward the spot
                  where Milly Crofton was seated—looking the fresher for her brief seclusion—and she
                  seemed more like the dream he had lost, than this woman with all her witcheries.
                  Then he recollected somewhat ruefully the words which he had spoken two nights
                  before; and even with Mrs. Marchmont's hand resting on his arm, her wonderful eyes
                  fixed upon his face, he acknowledged to himself that if it were not for those
                  hasty words, he would go straight to Milly and rest in the peaceful influence she
                  cast about her, and so make amends to his fancy for the stern manner in which he
                  had forced himself to be only civil and polite on this first meeting after her
                  temporary retirement.
               But Mrs. Marchmont was speaking again; she had seen his attention wander, and she
                  wanted to fix his thoughts upon herself. It was partly because, in her excited
                  state, she felt a wild yearning for some human sympathy—partly that peculiar
                  dramatic talent, which often rendered it difficult, even for her, to decide how
                  much she felt or how far she was really in earnest.
               "Living is dreary work, Kenneth—oh, such dreary work! I am so tired sometimes! Do
                  you ever feel like that—I mean, feel that you would like to lie down and sleep
                  forever, without a dream to trouble you?"
               Here was an opportunity to say pretty things—serious ones too; conscience told him
                  that he ought to say them, considering what had passed on that night in the
                  opera-box. But he could not do it; whenever he saw Milly's girlish face, he knew
                  that the faded dream could never be taken up again by his heart, though he did not
                  really believe that it was Milly who stood in the way; only that to look at her,
                  and then look back at the woman by his side, was like comparing her present self
                  with the bright creature whom he had loved, and showing how little she now had in
                  common with his ideal. Still, the words he had spoken held him fast; they could
                  not be recalled; and never in his whole life had he broken even an implied
                  pledge.
               "You don't answer me, Kenneth! Do you think it is silly—did you never have such a
                  fancy?"
               "Sometimes, perhaps," he replied, and was ashamed to think how commonplace and
                  practical both voice and speech sounded, but, for the life of him, could do no
                  better. "But one is never well when one feels in that misanthropic mood. You have
                  been exerting yourself too much; you need rest."
               "Are you going to deliver a discourse on medicine for my benefit?" she asked,
                  laughing almost harshly. "Mr. Worthington has already given me one. What a nice
                  girl his niece is—I saw you talking with her and that pretty Milly Crofton. Ah,
                  there is a lovely, happy child."
               "She seems very happy and fresh."
               "And lovely?" she persisted.
               "Very pretty, at least," he answered; and the tone was so studiously careless that
                  Mrs. Marchmont perceived the effort.
               He was going from her too; she could not keep him; she was to have nothing of her
                  old life left. She knew perfectly well that, in the present chaos she had made of
                  her fate, she dared not claim even his friendship—she could not stop to think
                  whether, if her life had held no secret, she could have loved him, had he come
                  back with the old look in his eyes; but to lose him, the last tic to the broken
                  past—to be utterly alone in the darkness which had closed so hopelessly about
                  her—that was the pang! Her heart ached so keenly for an instant that, could he
                  have seen its workings, he might reasonably have thought that it was absolute
                  tenderness and love which moved her; but she knew well enough that it was nothing
                  of the sort. She wanted comfort, sympathy, and could ask neither; besides, her
                  illness and agitation gave her fresh craving for excitement, and these dramatics
                  had just sufficient foundation in reality to give them an interest.
               "You don't want to talk to me," she said, in a pretty way she had, when it pleased
                  her—almost as childish as Milly Crofton's, and not all acting either. "You may go
                  away, Kenneth; you don't care about me to-night."
               "You have not been like yourself," he replied. "I don't know the brilliant, witty
                  Mrs. Marchmont, you must remember."
               "Ah, you hesitated over the adjectives; you had a mind to apply harsher ones," she
                  said, piteously.
               "Indeed, I had not; don't misjudge me."
               "And be as forbearing with me, Kenneth."
               "I will; I promise."
               "That is good and kind—like yourself. So you don't know me as I am? Oh, there's
                  little wonder; sometimes I don't know myself. And Alice is dead, you think—poor
                  Alice! Do you believe she is quite dead, Kenneth!"
               "Heaven help me, I can't tell," he fairly groaned, in his bewilderment and
                  distress, unable to decide what was acting and what real—whether she loved him or
                  was coquetting—but remembering always the words which he had spoken, and that they
                  held him fast.
               "And I can not always tell," she replied.
               She was herself too much excited to remark any thing peculiar in his manner. Her
                  nerves had been so strained during these past days, that the wildest ravings of
                  tragedy would have sounded like natural conversation to her.
               "Why don't you speak, Kenneth?" she went on.
               "I think I was waiting for you to finish," he said.
               "What was I saying? One forgets so. Well, never mind! Something about
                  myself—always a tiresome subject."
               "Ah, that little attempt at humility will not succeed," returned he, trying to get
                  back to the safe ground of jests and badinage. "The world too long since accorded
                  you your rightful place."
               "The world—why do you speak to me about that? How I hate it! and what nonsense I
                  am talking," she added, making an effort to appear less exalted and odd. "You are
                  cold and stiff to-night; I suppose you are vexed with me."
               "No; why should I be?"
               "But you are," she persisted still, with the absurd desire—she told herself it was
                  absurd—to make him feel, when, if she were to succeed, she knew perfectly well
                  that she should flee in terror. "You are not the old friend to-night—and we can be
                  friends, can't we, Kenneth?"
               "I trust that we are so."
               "Only the other evening you were so good and gentle!"
               She did remember what he had said—she expected further explanation; then he could
                  not go back! And all the time she without the slightest recollection that he had
                  uttered more than words of the commonest compliment! If he had followed the
                  dictates of his conscience, and tried to speak, she would have stopped her ears
                  and run away, afraid to hear somebody cry out the exact truth in regard to her
                  position, just as she heard voices do in her dreams. This was neither a fit time
                  nor place for the question which he must ask—a question against which his soul
                  rose in rebellion—at this moment; but it was too late to think of that. He was
                  about to inquire if she would be at home the next day, when she spoke again
                  suddenly—-
               "I have just been thinking, Kenneth! Do you know, I believe that sweet little
                  Milly Crofton is more like the ideal you made of me than I was, even in the old
                  time. Were you thinking that—do you know what I mean?"
               "I don't find your sentence very clear," he answered, annoyed by the pertinacity
                  with which she brought the girl's name into the conversation, but trying to treat
                  her words as a jest.
               "Don't laugh!" she exclaimed. "Yes, do—on second thoughts. I want to dance. Will
                  you dance with me?"
               He looked at her in utter astonishment, and asked,
               "What ails you to-night? You are a perfect chameleon." Then he perceived how
                  deathly white her face was, its pallor only broken by a scarlet spot on either
                  cheek. "You are certainly ill," he added.
               "Ill? Nonsense! I am only making you acquainted with Mrs. Marchmont—you said that
                  you did not know her. Don't you mean to dance with me—after my asking you, too?
                  Have you forgotten that it is leap-year, Mr. Halford?"
               Then she sat down, for the simple reason that she could not stand another instant;
                  and he wondered if she were really offended with him. Not strange if she were, he
                  thought, after his cowardly hesitation to follow up his half-avowal; and he tried
                  to think how he might set matters straight. As for Mrs. Marchmont, she was only
                  thinking that, if she remained there quiet any longer, she should inevitably
                  scream, or indulge in a nervous spasm. When Halford raised his head, after that
                  moment's preoccupation, she had left her seat, and was taking the arm of some man
                  who had come up to claim a dance.
               "Good-bye, Mr. Halford," she said, with a light laugh. "Let me know when you come
                  back from the moon."
               She was angry, he thought; he must speak at the first opportunity. He went and
                  stood near the dancers, to wait until she should be at liberty again, and found
                  himself beside Mr. Worthington.
               "Come and dine with me to-morrow," that gentleman said; "I have asked a few
                  people. I am so busy in these days that I have scarcely seen you since your
                  arrival."
               Halford absently accepted the invitation, still watching Alice Marchmont; and
                  though he did not perceive it, Mr. Worthington's eyes were fixed upon her too. She
                  and her partner paused for an instant's rest. Dick Faulkner seized that occasion
                  to approach; he wanted a little revenge for the blow she had dealt him earlier in
                  the evening.
               "It seems an age since I have seen you," he whispered, while her partner was
                  answering a question addressed to him by some person standing near. "This has been
                  the longest week I ever spent."
               She never turned her head or vouchsafed the slightest consciousness of his
                  neighborhood; not a line of her face changed, not an eyelash quivered—a marble
                  woman could not have been more utterly regardless of his presence. Her calm
                  contempt enraged him to an extent that the harshest words could not have done.
               "At least I have not much longer to wait," he continued; "the day after to-morrow
                  will give me the pleasure of an interview. I shall be able then to see you without
                  all these tiresome people about."
               Her partner turned to her at this instant; she made a sign that they were to join
                  the dancers, and left Faulkner uncertain whether his taunt had produced the
                  slightest effect.
               Another moment, and Mrs. Marchmont and her partner whirled past the spot where the
                  two men stood watching her, and they heard her say, in a broken voice,
               "Stop; I am faint—stop!"
               Just as she was slipping slowly from the young man's hold, John Worthington caught
                  her in his arms.
               
               "It is nothing," she said; "let me sit down."
               Then, with one long, shuddering sigh, she fainted completely away, for almost the
                  first time in her life.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               THE OLD QUESTION.
               THE next morning early Halford sent to inquire after Mrs. Marchmont's health,
                  knowing the Chinese mouse was always visible at the most preposterous hours. Miss
                  Portman sent back a string of old-fashioned compliments and thanks, and the
                  information that her cousin was quite well. The good soul had not even been told
                  of the fainting-fit.
               A message from John Worthington also reached Mrs. Marchmont before she had left
                  her chamber; but he was himself waiting below, having called on the way down to
                  his office. She scribbled a pretty little billet, promising to dine at his house
                  that night, and giving him an opportunity to see with his own eyes that she was
                  entirely recovered, though only a few moments before his name had been taken up
                  stairs she lay on her bed staring out at the streaks of light which crept through
                  the silken curtains, loathing the sight of the new day, and wondering where she
                  was to find strength to rise and recommence her wild chase in search of means to
                  free herself from Faulkner's toils.
               Kenneth Halford had not spent a tranquil night, but never once during the long
                  hours had he wavered from his resolution. He was going to-day to ask Mrs.
                  Marchmont to become his wife. Argue as he would, he could not feel himself at
                  liberty to do otherwise, whatever another man might have felt under the
                  circumstances, though there was no glamour before his eyes which could help him to
                  believe that her consent could afford him a moment's happiness. This woman of
                  society, eager for adulation, with all freshness of feeling worn out of her
                  heart—this woman, who had been the idol of scores of men; who had smiled at them,
                  listened to their flatteries, allowed them to love her just for a gratification to
                  her desire for power; whose name, he had learned, even in the brief season which
                  had elapsed since his return, was a by-word for coquetry and extravagance—this was
                  not the wife he wanted. He detested society—could he hope that she would be
                  satisfied without its plaudits? Why, in her girlish days she had allowed herself
                  to be separated from him because she adored this hollow world—could he expect her
                  now to relinquish the excitements on which she had fed for years? There might be
                  moments when her fascinations would carry him back into the past, but they would
                  be brief ones, and their pleasure marred by the recollection that his ideal of
                  that season existed, though possessing no connection with her.
               This idea brought Milly Crofton again before his mind; and the position in which
                  he found himself in regard to Mrs. Marchmont showed him plainly what his feelings
                  were toward the young girl, child as he had tried to consider her. He thanked
                  Heaven the time had been so short—that he had kept aloof from Milly; so neither by
                  word or look could he have troubled her youthful peace. Pretty Milly! what an
                  image of rest her memory seemed! He went over and over each incident of their
                  acquaintance in Europe—recalled her child-like frankness and innocence; and they
                  appeared more beautiful than the charms of the most elegant woman that ever lived.
                  It would have been so sweet to teach her to love him—to watch that pure nature
                  develop in the sunshine of a first dream—and by his own folly, by a few hurried,
                  unworthy words, he had put that happiness out of his reach.
               He would go and see her first this morning. It was a silly thing to do—weak and
                  boyish; but after his long season of faith in himself, he found his confidence so
                  misplaced that he might as well admit his own shallowness, and he done. He had
                  never paid but one visit to the house; he would allow himself that pleasure a
                  second time. It would he a sort of righteous penance to torment his soul by the
                  sight of the peace and rest which he might have gained had he been true to his own
                  manly dignity and self-control.
               He found Milly seated at her embroidery, in the morning-room, the prettiest object
                  in all Mrs. Remsen's belongings—a little surprised at his appearance, but all the
                  more pleased on that account—with the softest blush on her cheek as she gave him a
                  quiet greeting, doubled in warmth by the sudden brightness in her eyes. Aunt Eliza
                  was just going out, and, as a friend was waiting, she could not linger.
               "I must leave Milly to entertain you," she said. "I've only time to say that I
                  hope you will not be such a stranger as you have been since you got back; one
                  never sees you except at parties."
               He bowed and thanked her, but, as he replied in some fitting words, remembered,
                  sadly, that his visits could not be made more frequent; no gradual gliding into
                  familiar intercourse, no pleasant study of Milly's mind and character, would be
                  possible now.
               He gave Mrs. Remsen his arm out to the carriage, and she said, very
                  graciously,
               "It is not my habit to allow my girls the American liberty of receiving visits
                  without my presence; but you are so old a friend, and I am so glad to see you in
                  my house, that I can't remember rules."
               Again he thanked her, and wished that he had gone straight on to his duty, instead
                  of coming hither to torment himself by a picture of contentment which could never
                  be realized. The carriage drove away, and he returned to Milly, fully determined
                  to be staid and sage, and leave her with the feeling that he was very elderly
                  indeed.
               "I am an idle man just now," he said; "so I thought I might allow myself the
                  pleasure of seeing you here in the quiet, where you look most at home."
               "Where I am most at home, too," she answered, with her sunny smile; "though I like
                  going out very much. But I can't get over feeling a little shy and awkward."
               "Those are not just the words I should have used," he said, in a gentle, caressing
                  voice he had—if I may employ the expression—it is the only one that serves; and,
                  somehow, that voice made common words sound sweeter than the elaborate compliments
                  of most men.
               "My aunt laughs at me," Milly continued, with the blush a little deepened on her
                  cheeks. "She says that another season will quite cure me of the shyness, at
                  least."
               "It will not change you much, I fancy," he replied, and then remembered that these
                  implied flatteries did not agree well with the reputation for wisdom wherewith he
                  meant to impress her. "Your cousin is quite well again?" he asked.
               "Yes; it was only a severe cold; but Maud is so seldom ill that aunty and I were
                  frightened; and Maud can't bear to be left alone when she is out of sorts."
               He looked about, and he looked at her. The room was very pretty, and suited to her
                  appearance; and she gave it an air so home-like! sitting there with her
                  work-basket and her book, sharing the footstool with her pet eat. Halford felt
                  that it would be dangerous for him to sit long in silent contemplation. He began
                  to talk of whatever came uppermost and easiest—of the story she had been
                  reading—her stand of flowers—the veriest trifles which make up ordinary
                  conversation. But gradually, in her pretty way—wholly different from the artful
                  tact of a practiced woman—she drew him on to talk of such things as she liked to
                  hear about: his travels—the strange countries of which she dreamed—forgetting the
                  restraint she sometimes felt in his presence, and unconsciously revealing her
                  simple tastes and pure fancies to the world-worn man.
               He gazed into her stainless soul until he had the sentiment of reverence come over
                  him such as one sometimes feels in a foreign land, when stepping suddenly from the
                  crowded, bustling street into the shadowy recesses of a cathedral, with the voices
                  of unseen choristers, and the veiled tones of the organ, stealing through the
                  stillness. It was a brief hour of rest to Kenneth Halford; then she herself
                  uttered the words which brought him back to the reality, and its cares.
               "I think you must be quite worn out with my ceaseless talk," he had said,
                  suddenly.
               "I like it so much! Nobody ever talks at all in that way—unless sometimes—but no;
                  she is so restless, and her wit blinds me like lightning—"
               "Who is that?"
               "Oh, Mrs. Marchmont; she comes to see us occasionally. I think I admire her more
                  than any woman in the world, and so does Constance—that is my dearest friend—Mr.
                  Worthington's niece, you know."
               "Yes, and a very lovely girl," he said, preferring to lead the conversation away
                  toward her. "So she is your special friend?"
               "Yes, indeed. We so often wonder if we shall ever learn to be in the least like
                  Mrs. Marchmont. Mr. Worthington says she has talent enough to write books or paint
                  pictures, if she would only have used it, but that she makes herself charming
                  instead, by bringing all her gifts into conversation."
               She had brought him back! He must not sit there any longer—above all, he must not
                  hear her talk about Alice Marchmont.
               "I have to thank you for a very pleasant morning," he said; "but I ought to
                  apologize for my unconscionable visit."
               His face looked gray and changed; Milly gazed at him with her eyes full of
                  innocent pity and wonder; then a sudden pang crossed her, which, if she had been
                  older and wiser, would have shown her at once how it was with her heart. Was it
                  the mention of Mrs. Marchmont's name which had caused this alteration in him? Did
                  he, too, care for this woman, who had the whole world at her feet—who seemed able,
                  by a single smile, to bring any man under her spells? Somehow, the idea struck
                  Milly unpleasantly; her lips retained only a very pale reflection of the smiles
                  with which she had listened to his conversation. Something, that almost approached
                  haughtiness, gave a new piquancy to her manner: with the inward question in regard
                  to Mrs. Marchmont had come the sudden knowledge that he only considered herself a
                  pretty child; and just at this moment Milly was not in the mood for such
                  treatment.
               It was not possible that, after her two romantic meetings with Kenneth Halford, he
                  should have occupied the same place in her mind that other men did. She had
                  dreamed a great deal about that last pleasant day at Chamouni, though she had
                  scarcely spoken his name—even to Constance. She was perfectly unconscious how
                  frequently his image had been in her thoughts. Fluttered and pleased as she was
                  when he so unexpectedly appeared again in her life, she had not been disturbed by
                  any idea of the truth; but it would only require a few annoyances like this to
                  teach her.
               "I hope you will forgive me for interrupting your quiet morning," he added, before
                  she had finished her swift reflections.
               "Oh yes; it has saved me the trouble of reading that tiresome book I had begun.
                  You have given me the cream of it without the tediousness."
               Was she trying to make speeches and indulge in epigrams, like the woman whom she
                  admired—to be satirical and witty? Halford would have liked to ask her not to do
                  it—to be always her simple, natural self. Then he remembered that he had no right to ask any thing of
                  her—no right to give himself in any way a prominent thought in her mind. He had
                  risen, but still lingered, though he knew that he ought to be gone.
               "What beautiful weather we are having," he said; "it reminds me of Italy. Do you
                  recollect how lovely the sunshine was at Chamouni?"
               The words—uttered from sheer idleness—recalled to Milly's mind all his kindness
                  upon their first meeting—the debt of gratitude which she owed him for what
                  followed in Switzerland. She felt ashamed of her momentary, vague irritation, and
                  wanted to make amends.
               "That was the pleasantest day I ever spent in my whole life," she said, with a
                  return of her pretty frankness. "I have not forgotten how kind you were to me, Mr.
                  Halford."
               "I wish it could have deserved the name," he answered, smiling to see how the
                  brightness and animation came back to her face.
               So they talked a little longer; then he went sadly away, and, as he descended the
                  steps, bethought him of his self-appointed duty. He would not go to Mrs.
                  Marchmont's house yet; he wanted an hour's solitude, and a brisk walk. He had done
                  a foolish thing in venturing into Milly's presence; but he had grown idiotic of
                  late: there could be no doubt of that.
               He walked on, thinking what a disappointment and failure life was—thinking that he
                  had no aim in view which would make the world's choicest honors worth winning: all
                  vain, morbid reflections; but they are common enough to all of us, after the first
                  glitter has rubbed off existence, and we see in their full barrenness the rocks
                  over which our pathway must lead—the path which years before showed bright and
                  glorious under the beautiful mists of youthful illusions.
               It was late in the day before Halford found himself at Mrs. Marchmont's house; but
                  be received the information that she was out. Her absence seemed a sort of
                  reprieve. He felt that the sensation was an added weakness, but could not repress
                  it. Fate, however, had no intention of indulging him in his desire to
                  procrastinate. By the time he reached the street, Mrs. Marchmont's carriage
                  stopped in front of him. He stepped forward, helped her out, and said,
               "I had just been sent away with the news that it was only known that you were
                  absent—the time of your return was beyond the foreknowledge of your Mercury."
               "My movements are always uncertain," she replied, languidly; for it was not easy
                  to speak at all. "You may come in now, if you choose to endure the society of a
                  very stupid woman."
               She did not want to be left alone; she felt like a child forced into the dark—any
                  companionship was better than solitude; even the effort to control herself would
                  do her good, for when the carriage stopped she was very near past the possibility.
                  Since early morning she had been out on the errand in which she had wasted so much
                  time during the past week. To-day's efforts had proved as useless as those which
                  went before, and there was no more space left for her to struggle.
               To-morrow Faulkner would present himself—to-morrow! On her way home she had
                  actually counted, watch in hand, the hours which lay between her and the crisis of
                  her fate; it had become an affair of hours! One faint hope left still wherewith,
                  until evening, she could keep her brain somewhat steady—that of receiving news
                  that an agent had succeeded in procuring the money. He had not been sanguine—in
                  her heart she knew that it was the merest, the most improbable chance—but she held
                  fast to it as the one slight barrier which kept despair aloof.
               So she was glad to meet any mortal visage at this moment; it was only half-past
                  four now, and she could not have an answer from her business man until six. It was
                  better that Halford should think her ill or crazy, than be left face to face with
                  her own soul.
               She preceded him into the library and sat down—tossed her bonnet on the console;
                  and the one glance into the mirror which she must have taken had she been called
                  to listen to her death-sentence, showed that her hair was not disarranged, nor her
                  features any paler than she had grown accustomed to seeing them.
               "Are you quite recovered from last night's attack?" he asked. "It seems a little
                  imprudent to have gone out."
               "I am perfectly well; I can't imagine what made me faint—indigestion, perhaps. One
                  always has dyspepsia at this season."
               "Miss Portman sent me word that you were better."
               "Yes, she told me of your message; it was very nice of you. My poor old cousin is
                  a tender-hearted goose, who thinks that the wind mustn't blow over me."
               "You look very pale yet," he urged; "I am sure you can not be well."
               "Never mind my looks," returned she, impatiently, "I am not ill." Then hearing the
                  irritation in her voice, she added, with one of her magical smiles, "What a temper
                  you will think I have grown! Never mind; I mean to give up my caprices. Admit that
                  you find me dreadfully gater—excuse the French
                  word—it softens it a little to my vanity."
               "Would you be satisfied, if I made the admission?"
               "No; don't say it, if you do think so. Please don't find me changed; I like to be
                  remembered just as I once was," she answered, rushing, in spite of herself,
                  straight to the verge of a dramatic scene.
               "But are you the same?" he asked.
               "Oh, don't ask me! Is any body the same? They talk of a physical change once in
                  seven years, that makes new creatures of us: why not a mental, moral, or immoral,
                  as you please? There's a question for the doctors! When I get leisure I shall
                  study the matter, and write a magazine paper on it."
               He laughed a little; but there was no lightness in his thoughts. He could not
                  decide whether she was all sparkle and hardness, like the diamonds for which she
                  had allowed herself to be sold years before, or had learned completely to smother
                  her feelings, because it was her only chance of peace and safety.
               "And talking of magazine papers," she continued; "do you mean to give us something
                  else—scientific, and learned, and awful?"
               "Indeed, I do not know; I am growing fairly ashamed of my own indolence and waste
                  of time."
               "Take care! I'll not have you give me covert thrusts under the guise of reproaches
                  to yourself. Wasting time—what is that line about rendering an account for each
                  idle word and hour? Ciel! what a list there must
                  be! Oh, that sounds irreverent."
               "And that you would not be."
               "I hope not; it is doubly odious in a woman. But one gets in the habit of laughing
                  at every thing just to make people stare or to be thought witty. It's a dreadful
                  habit."
               "It is, indeed," he said; and knew that his voice sounded priggish and
                  sententious; but could not change it.
               "I'll not be lectured," cried she. "If I abuse myself, it is with the expectation
                  that you will contradict me."
               "I fancy it will be necessary for you often to give me a hint, that I may be sure
                  what you really do mean."
               She did not notice his words, saying, suddenly.
               "Do you know what our talk about right and wrong brings up? The country-place
                  where we were that last summer. Don't you remember the little church down in the
                  village? Oh, Kenneth, Kenneth, how pleasant it was to go there!—don't you
                  remember?"
               How often during the first years of separation, while remembrance was still a
                  bitter pain, he had thought of those visits to the quiet chapel, and repeated
                  Longfellow's pretty lines about the lost girl who looked like gleaning
                  Ruth—repeated them, and stamped his feet on the hot Egyptian sands in rage and
                  anguish. But the reality to which he had returned was not the old dream; he could
                  not speak of those recollections to this woman with the flashing, restless eyes,
                  so unlike the light which they poured on him once—this chameleon, vexing him by
                  her quick changes and brief glimpses of the girlish creature whom he had
                  loved.
               "But, somehow, I hate our churches in town," she was saying, when he got his
                  thoughts back from that mental view of himself, gazing off at the pyramids through
                  the white distance, and moaning his grief out in poetry. "Besides, one is always
                  too tired to go! Just think, those Spanish people next door always dance on Sunday
                  night; and I have been to them sometimes—how I bated myself for doing what I
                  thought wicked; but one does so many hateful things! Dear me, don't sit looking so
                  grave."
               "Was I looking grave?"
               "A perfect monument of reproach; and I don't liked to be reproached."
               "I have never done it," he answered, slowly—"never."
               "You had no right—no reason!" she cried, with sudden passion. "I could not help
                  myself; you know that. Every relative I had in the world setting at me! Oh, you
                  never can understand what I endured!"
               His face had looked so like the old time, that she could not forbear crying out,
                  in the quick rush of memory, without thinking how her words might sound.
               "I always knew," he replied, in a kind voice. "Even in the height of my anger, I
                  always pitted you as much as I did myself."
               "That was like you—such a good, patient Kenneth! Perhaps I might have behaved
                  differently; but I was always a coward. I could not bear to be frowned at; and you
                  will never know half the means they used—even my own mother against me! Oh, my
                  mother, my mother! if she had only been another sort of woman! I never cease to be
                  thankful that I have no children; at least, I can not make their existence such a
                  curse as she did mine."
               "Hush, hush!" he said, inexpressibly pained by her wild looks and words. "You
                  don't know what you are saying."
               "Let us talk of something else," she cried; "it is not well to think. Have you
                  heard the new opera they are to give next week, for the first time here? One can
                  always talk about the opera— Oh, Kenneth, don't watch me like that! I know I am
                  frivolous and wicked; but don't look so disappointed!"
               She could not help it; all sorts of insane speeches would force an utterance, in
                  spite of her. She could not lose this friend—she did not think about his making
                  love to her—she did not want it—only, in her misery, she could not bear to see
                  disapproval in any countenance; her own thoughts and condemnation were enough.
                  Perhaps a little longer, and even her good name must go; she would hold fast to
                  every precious thing while she could. For the present, the scorn and contempt must
                  lie between her and her own soul; she could not support even disapproval from
                  him.
               "Don't look disappointed, Kenneth," she repeated. "Wait a few weeks; who
                  knows—perhaps I shall be less restless and changeable—"
               She stopped short. A few weeks—she might as well ask him to wait and see what she
                  would be like in eternity! She to talk of weeks, when only brief hours hung
                  between her and ruin! She could fairly hear Dick Faulkner's odious step, that she
                  knew so well—those firm, quick footfalls, the sound of which had so often sickened
                  her during the weeks which led to this awful moment. She could absolutely see
                     his loathed face peering into her own,
                  with its smile of triumph! and she bad nothing to propose—just as unprepared as
                  the day he was last there; and yet she must meet him. The picture her vivid fancy
                  drew so completely overpowered her that, before she was aware, she had cried out
                  bitterly,
               "Oh, pity me, Kenneth, pity me!"
               It was spoken! She had broken down at last; her whole secret had nearly escaped in
                  that appeal. She was close to a burst of frenzied sobs, and an hysterical scene
                  that would have appeared like insanity or play-acting to a well-regulated
                  person.
               What could he think? Only that this woman loved him—that she feared, in spite of
                  his previous words, he did not mean to take up the thread of their destinies from
                  the point where stronger hands had torn it out of their grasp. It was impossible
                  to think any thing else, and not to believe, also, that she suffered so horribly
                  at the dread of his not forgiving her, that it overcame even her pride and
                  feminine reticence. Yet, even as he admitted it to himself, some perception struck
                  him that this was not the conduct of a woman who loved. It did not, it could not,
                  occur to his mind that any terrible secret burdened her soul, and made her long
                  for sympathy; he could only believe that, if she did not care for him, she was
                  leading him on from an impulse of fiendish coquetry; but in either case he must
                  speak. He must speak, though he, too, was haunted by a quick vision—of the pretty
                  room where he had that morning sat with Milly Crofton, her pure girl's face gazing
                  at him, so free from worldly emotion—even from the common cares which must leave
                  their impress upon any countenance after twenty-five.
               "I came here to-day to talk seriously with you," he said, and knew that his voice
                  sounded hard and cold.
               She thought he was about to remonstrate upon the folly of her life—to reproach her
                  for wasting it—perhaps, to tell her of vague rumors which might have fallen from
                  Dick Faulkner's venomous lips.
               "No, no," she exclaimed, trying to smile; "don't talk seriously; we are safest on
                  the surface."
               "You and I can not stay there," he continued. "Do you remember what I said to you
                  the other night?"
               She shook her head, making a vain effort to recall any special words that he might
                  have spoken. What could they have been about? Had he heard vaguely of her
                  difficulties, and come to help her? Oh, if he could—if he would! She might better
                  tell him the whole; even if it cost her his friendship and esteem, she could, at
                  least, have her life free from Dick Faulkner. It was only a second's wild
                  thought—she remembered that he was powerless. He was not rich enough at so short
                  notice to raise the amount she required. If he could, if he were able to borrow
                  it, she must not ask the favor; ten to one, she should not be able to repay it in
                  time, if ever, and he might be ruined. So that quick hope died out like those
                  which had gone before. She sat looking straight at him, yet not seeing a line of
                  his features in the blinding pain which made her head reel till sparks of fire
                  danced before her eyes.
               He could not tell from her words—what he believed her pretended
                  forgetfulness—whether she was afraid of betraying herself, or was only coquetting
                  with him. He grew very angry at that suspicion—there was a bitter pang at his
                  heart all the while—but he must go on.
               "You can not, I think, have forgotten what I said," he began again.
               "Oh, I dare say—" She stopped short, conscious that she was making some irrelevant
                  reply, though not certain what he had said. "I beg your pardon—did I interrupt
                  you?"
               "I said you had not forgotten," he repeated, rather sternly.
               "I wish I could," she muttered, too low for him to catch the bitter complaint; "I
                  wish I could!"
               "We were talking of the past—"
               "Then we had better have left it alone," she broke in, passionately. "I want
                  neither to look forward or back; let me rest where I am, while it is
                  possible."
               "I must finish; I must tell you what is in my mind," he persisted, more and more
                  convinced that she was trifling, and feeling his heart harden toward her.
               "Oh, tell me then," she said, impatiently, throwing herself back in her chair, and
                  trying to fasten her attention upon his words, though the effort made her head
                  ache worse than ever, and she still dreaded reproaches or remonstrances upon her
                  wasted life. "You want to scold me—no wonder; but I wish you wouldn't! You
                  couldn't say any thing half so bad as I have said to myself—not a thousandth part
                  so bad as I deserve."
               "I did not dream of doing any thing of the kind," he answered. "I only wanted you
                  to remember our conversation in the opera-box the other evening."
               "Then I can't—do believe me. I am not always false—what object could I have?"
                  cried she, angrily—not because she felt in a rage; it was pure nervousness that
                  rendered her voice sharp.
               "I said that it would still be possible to bridge over the gulf which separates us
                  from our youth—"
               "Never, never!" she interrupted, dimly comprehending now what errand had brought
                  him, yet not trusting her own intuitions. "We could not do that; it is
                  impossible."
               "Not if you will be my wife," he said, slowly, conscious that never was woman
                  wooed in such a cast-iron sort of fashion, but not able to make either tone or
                  manner one whit warmer.
               "Your wife!" she repeated, in a bewildered way. "I be your wife?"
               "I came here this morning to ask you," he continued.
               "You don't mean that," she exclaimed, still too much confused to believe him in
                  earnest. "That is carrying nonsense too far, even for amusement. Don't say such
                  things."
               "I am speaking seriously," he said; and a second glance showed her, blind as she
                  was, that he meant it.
               "Oh, Kenneth!" she faltered.
               "I come with the old question, Alice," he said, for the first time calling her by
                  the familiar name, and painfully aware, as he uttered it, that it no longer
                  possessed the slightest music to his ear. "Will you marry me?"
               "I marry you?" she echoed.
               "I said I came with the old question," returned he, not perceiving until he had
                  spoken that he was only repeating himself—to her whose presence had once been a
                  spell to rouse him easily into eloquent speech—into the passionate utterance which
                  ought to come natural to a lover.
               "But do you come with the old heart?" cried she, suddenly. "Oh, Kenneth, Kenneth,
                  why do you talk like this! It can not be—it can never be—you feel, you know, that
                  it ought not."
               "Tell me why, Alice?"
               "Even if you came with the old love warm in your heart, it could not! We are
                  worlds and worlds apart; I would not dare let you approach nearer. But you don't,
                  Kenneth; it is only the memory of the dead dream—the dear, sweet dream."
               "Not dead—"
               "Yes, and the girl you loved dead with it! It is only that you are attracted to me
                  by the occasional likeness I have to her; but I am not she—O Heaven, how
                  different!"
               "Alice," he said, "I come to you in earnest; I don't understand your words or
                  manner; this is a serious moment. Surely you would not coquet with me now; you can
                  not be so changed as that."
               "Changed in every way," she cried. "I am not the Alice you knew; do understand
                  that! But I would not coquet or trifle; you are right there; try to
                  comprehend."
               "Surely, you are not surprised—"
               "Yes, yes!"
               "But you must have expected me to speak."
               "Never; indeed I did not. I thought you liked to recollect the pretty dream—that
                  it pleased you to stray toward the old time—that there might be occasional vague
                  regrets over the vanished hope; but not this—nothing like this."
               "You might have known me better."
               "And that is what it is," she went on—"just an unreal sentiment born out of old
                  memories; nothing else."
               "And—and you have felt so, too?"
               He could scarcely have put a question so misplaced, or in a more awkward fashion;
                  but it was all he could say.
               "What have my feelings to do with it?" she asked.
               "If you remembered—if you cared—"
               "Why, you thought I loved you!" she broke in.
               "Don't accuse me of being vain and unmanly," he exclaimed. "At least, you know
                  that I am not mean and base."
               She started from her chair, then as quickly resumed her seat: a sweet, womanly
                  smile came across the trouble in her face.
               "I don't think so; you know I could not. It all comes to me now; I understand
                  every thing. You thought I loved you—don't say a word! Kenneth, you are a good
                  man—a noble heart. You came to me because you thought that some idle words you had
                  spoken made it your duty; but you don't love me."
               "Have you not believed that I did?"
               "No; it was impossible."
               "But after what I said—"
               "I did not even remember it. If I noticed it at the time, I only supposed it a
                  mere compliment—I am so used to sentimental talk! Stop, Kenneth; don't interrupt;
                  don't try for pretty words; we must be perfectly frank and honest now."
               "Yes, whatever comes."
               "Dear old friend, if you loved me ever so well, I would not marry you; yet you are
                  good and noble to have come. I could hate or laugh at another man who fancied that
                  I cared for him, and so offered me his hand; but it was generous of you."
               "Then my—my loving you would make no difference?"
               "None! Nothing could make any difference—nothing under heaven. Kenneth, Kenneth,
                  if we were in different worlds, we could not be more completely separated; if I
                  were dead and buried, we could not. Yes, that's it—think of Alice as dead; think
                  of her kindly, and pity me. I could bear your pity; and oh, Kenneth, I am the most
                  miserable woman alive!"
               She buried her face on the arm of her chair, and for an instant sobbed
                  uncontrollably, though she shed no tears.
               "You drive me wild!" he exclaimed. "You say that we are separated forever, yet in
                  the same breath you talk of your misery."
               "Yes," she said, raising her head and forcing herself back to a sort of composure.
                  "I forgot how it would sound; it seems as if I meant that I cared for you. Then I
                  must tell you this—you have no part in my trouble."
               "Is there in your mind some scruple, some fancy, that, because my heart is not the
                  boy's heart, you must refuse it?" he questioned, determined, at least, to be sure
                  that he had done no wrong.
               "Not that. Oh, it is impossible to explain—not where you are concerned, though. I
                  don't mean to speak rudely, but I have scarcely had time to think about you since
                  you returned. I was glad to see you—I am glad— but it has no reference to the past; I couldn't
                  think of you in that way—you're not vexed?"
               "No, no; speak your thought out."
               "You can listen, because your heart is not touched either. Why, if I had that
                  added to all I bear, I should go mad. I caused you trouble enough in the old days;
                  thank Heaven! I am powerless now. As for the rest, what worries me I can not tell
                  you—only so much; and believe me now—it has nothing in common with thoughts of
                  you. Don't ask me any questions; only be my friend. Promise that."
               "I do—always your friend; nothing could ever happen which would make me
                  otherwise."
               She felt herself growing very faint; his words roused anew the thought of what
                  dire mischance tarried just beyond. Her lips were so dry and parched that she
                  could with difficulty articulate, yet she went on speaking; any thing was better
                  than to sit silent with that horrible dread in her soul—the skeleton grinning
                  between her and this generous-hearted man, who, in spite of his kindness, was as
                  powerless to aid her as if he had been an indifferent stranger.
               "Some time you will really love, and marry," she said—"perhaps some pretty
                  creature like Milly Crofton. I often watch her, and think she is like the girl you
                  used to know—the heart they killed, Kenneth."
               "My poor Alice!" he murmured, involuntarily giving voice to the great pity which
                  stirred his soul; for he knew that, whatever might be the secret of her suffering,
                  it was real.
               "Yes, call me that; think of me so," she said; then the faintness against which
                  she had been struggling for many moments grew so strong, so like the chill of
                  death, that she was forced to add, "I think you must go away now, I am so
                  tired."
               He saw that her very lips were blue-white; the face leaning back against the
                  cushions of the chair was so ghastly that he could scarcely repress a cry of
                  alarm. He hurried to a table where there sat a carafe of water, poured out a
                  glass, brought it, and obliged her to drink. In a few moments she was better,
                  could sit up, smile and speak.
               "I ought not to have worried you when you were ill," he said, remorsefully.
               "No, no; I am glad you came. We shall be friends, Kenneth—always friends?"
               "Always, Alice."
               "Yes, whatever-comes. I believe you would pity me— Don't look at me so, Kenneth;
                  are you thinking that I am half mad? Sometimes I think so. It's only my absurd
                  life; I have had no rest for weeks; but it will soon be over now—very soon."
               "What, Alice?"
               She was thinking of the one way out which presented itself—the one hope of
                  freedom; the horrible thought which had been growing stronger in her mind as these
                  last awful days drifted by. Nothing else left—but she could die! She had tried to
                  put it from her, this crowning wicked impulse, but it would not go; and as she
                  glanced at the clock, saw that the hour was near when her last vague chance of
                  relief must prove vain as the rest, it started up in her soul so like a
                  full-formed resolution that it broke through her words.
               "What will be soon over—what do you mean?" she heard him ask.
               "Why, all the trouble—I mean the season will end, spring come, and I shall go into
                  the country. Indeed, I am so worn out that I don't know what I say."
               "I shall go, that you may lie down and sleep," he said, extending his hand.
               She caught it, and held it fast in her cold fingers; it was dreadful to be left
                  alone! Then, with her usual inconsistency, her ability to think a dozen things at
                  once, came the idea that she might have had his support; he would never have gone
                  back, once pledged. Nothing could have induced her to drag him down in her fall;
                  his love, if she could have had it, would have proved an added terror; yet her
                  heart grew bitter to think that she had lost it. More than all, she could not bear
                  to part with him because he was connected with her lost past.
               "You will think of me at my best," she said. "You'll not see me like this again.
                  Will you remember me sometimes when you are happy with pretty little Milly?"
               "Why do you talk so much of her? I scarcely know the child."
               "But you love her—I mean you will; I feel it. She will make you happy; oh, I am
                  glad of that. She will be like the old dream to you—as if these years had not come
                  between. But no; I can't have that. You must not forget me. Think of the Alice you
                  knew as dead. I must have my place."
               "You torture me!" he cried. "I can't understand you! If you could love me, let me
                  try to make you happy. We will go back together to the old dream, away from this
                  weary bustle, and look for our lost happiness."
               "We couldn't find it, Kenneth! Don't be vexed with me; no wonder I puzzle you. I
                  can't tell, myself, how much of me is real. But, indeed, I don't want your love.
                  You may believe that."
               "But you will have my friendship?"
               "So thankfully! There, go now, before I say something else silly or insane."
               He took her hand again with a feeling of profound pity, and was raising it to his
                  lips. She snatched it away, startling him anew by her vehemence—it was the hand
                  Dick Faulkner had kissed!
               "Not that!" she exclaimed; "not that, for the world!"
               Then, even in this moment of acute suffering, with the consciousness full upon her
                  that soon she must make a choice between disgrace and death, the coquetry
                  ingrained in her nature came up. At least, it seemed such to herself, only she was
                  in a sort of earnest all the while, giving way to the emotion only excitable ble
                  people can understand, which is neither exactly of the head nor heart, yet belongs
                  to both.
               "You shall kiss the other," she said, and held it up with a gesture and glance
                  which made her a very Circe.
               He kissed it gravely: this was not the kind of spell to fascinate him, because it
                  was not like the Alice of former days.
               "The last kiss," she added; "but your golden-haired ideal need never be jealous,
                  though no other men's lips shall blot out the touch of yours, Kenneth."
               So he went away, conscious that he left behind him forever the latest memory of
                  the old dream. He was naturally enough a little saddened for the time, but could
                  not resist a feeling of self-gratulation that he had proved true to his own sense
                  of honor. How hard the struggle to go to that woman with his question, he fully
                  now appreciated by the sense of relief which came over his mind. He was sorry for
                  her; he saw that she suffered; yet he could not decide whether she was the most
                  consummate actress that ever lived, the creature of some passing impulse, or
                  indeed oppressed by a secret trouble under the excitement and brightness of her
                  life.
               As the door closed, Alice Marchmont sunk back in her chair, and sat with her eyes
                  fixed upon the clock. The room was quite dark now, except where the bright
                  fire-light illuminated it, reflected upon the face of the pretty pendule so that
                  she could see where the hands pointed.
               Twenty minutes to six—twenty minutes! She sat still and waited, counting the
                  seconds as they dragged by, yet with scores of varying thoughts in her mind all
                  the while. At last the bell-like chime sounded the hour; a moment after, the
                  door-bell rang. She did not stir; she had a feeling as if she were dead and cold,
                  and must sit there staring out through the darkness till the Last Judgment.
               The door opened—a servant with a salver in his hand.
               "I beg madame's pardon; I only just learned that she was here, else I should have
                  lighted the candles; I was out on madame's service."
               It was a caprice of hers never to burn gas in her rooms: there was no possible
                  expense, great or small, she had failed to incur.
               "Who rang, Ferguson?"
               "Only a person with this letter, madame. Shall I light the room?"
               "No; go away, please."
               The model domestic departed; she tore open the envelope—only another failure; but
                  it was the last!
               She sat still for a few moments longer—not faint—not suffering acutely—her powers
                  seemed deadened; then she rose and walked quietly away to her chamber.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               THE POTENT NAME.
               ALL that had happened, and was still to happen, did not alter the fact that Mrs.
                  Marchmont must dress and go out to dine; for, at all events, she had not yet left
                  the world. To send a refusal and remain at home was out of the question. She would
                  have rushed into the society of a coterie of ghosts beckoning with spectral
                  fingers to worse than the horrors of a German romance, rather than keep herself
                  company.
               She dared not stay at home, that dreadful idea of self-destruction so pursued her.
                  It might come to this; she expected now that it would; but it was not time yet,
                  and solitude would drive her so mad that she might attempt her own life before she
                  knew really what she was doing.
               As she entered her dressing-room Pauline the faithful gave her one glance, and
                  uttered a little cry of alarm.
               "Are you growing hysterical?" asked her mistress, coldly.
               "I beg madame's pardon," apologized the woman; "but if madame could see how pale
                  she is she would be herself startled."
               "I am not so easily alarmed," she replied. "But I suppose you can make my checks
                  red; you have something that you put on your own."
               "Oh, pardon; I could do it beautifully, if madame permits, just by rubbing the
                  checks with a peculiar red ribbon. Nobody could every suspect."
               "I don't care how you do it, or who suspects," she answered, sitting down in a
                  chair by her dressing-table, though not glancing toward the glass. "I am very
                  cross, Pauline, but don't mind."
               "Never; madame is never that! She is not well just now; but cross? she is like the
                  angels."
               "Very like," returned Mrs. Marchmont, with a bitter laugh, and added, to herself,
                  "there are two sorts."
               "Madame shall dine out?" questioned Pauline.
               "Yes; where is Miss Portman?"
               "She have gone to her old friend's, Miss Livingston's."
               "Yes, I know. What time is it?"
               "Not quite seven, if madame pleases."
               "Dress me, Pauline. Don't ask me what I will put on; pull my chair away from the
                  glass. Be sure you make me handsome, very handsome; I have a special reason."
               If it should be the last night any human being connected with her society world
                  ever saw her among them again; if, on coming from John Worthington's house, she
                  knew that nothing remained for her but death, at least let them remember this
                  evening. Ah, he would be sorry, that good, tried friend; and Kenneth too: there
                  was nobody else to get beyond horror or wonder. And she had come to this! she, Alice Marchmont; and the time had
                  been, in her girlish days, when, in spite of worldly influences, in spite of a
                  frivolous mother's example, she had said her prayers and read her Bible, and
                  allowed the one sensible woman who ever approached her at that season—a governess,
                  of whom Mrs. Bemers got rid of as soon as possible—to teach her the blessed
                  doctrines of the Catholic faith; when the Church services were familiar to her,
                  and the thought of Confirmation a pleasant one, and no shadow troubled her soul of
                  the season when she, in her turn, should crucify the Christ anew by willful
                  departure from his teachings.
               She sat motionless as a stone image under Pauline's skillful hands, till at length
                  an exclamation from the French woman, who could not longer support the silence,
                  made her look up.
               "Well?" she asked.
               "Madame is so beautiful! if madame would only take one little peep in the
                  miroir."
               Mrs. Marchmont rose, walked to the cheval-glass at the end of the room, and
                  surveyed her full-length image. The dress was some marvelous tint of green, so
                  pale as to look almost white, with long hanging sleeves, showing the white arms;
                  precious old cameos encircling her neck, spots of vivid rose-color tinting her
                  checks, and the great brown eyes almost black with the pain which cut, like
                  icicles, across her heart—a sharp, physical pain, added to her mental
                  distress.
               "I shall not leave the house till eight," she said, turning away after one glance.
                  "How much time yet?"
               "Twenty minutes," replied Pauline, in a tone of mortal injury which struck the
                  other's ear.
               "You have done wonders," she said: "I thank you very much. Come and tell me when
                  it is eight o'clock."
               Pauline went softly out; there was something very odd about her mistress to-night,
                  something which she could not understand; but she was a silent creature, and did
                  not even express her thoughts to the band below stairs.
               Mrs. Marchmont walked slowly up and down the room several times, her hands crossed
                  behind her back, her head drooped. At length she unlocked the safe where she kept
                  such of her jewels as were in her possession, and took out a tiny phial. It
                  contained opium. It had lain there since an illness she had in the autumn. Why she
                  kept it she had never known. As she held up the flacon to the light, shaking it slowly, she felt that now she did
                  understand. An instant after, she asked herself was she capable of doing the deed?
                  Of physical pain she had a great dread; but the death that this dark liquid would
                  bring was so easy! And she had come to this! she, who even a month before would
                  have said that she believed in God, and trusted him, believed in the Bible too,
                  reckless as she was, page for page and word for word, weak and superstitious as
                  the faith might appear to modern philosophy.
               This was the point to which life had brought her, the life she had willfully,
                  determinedly chosen, as she thought now, though, in reality, once drawn into the
                  vortex, she had been whirled on and on without space for reflection. The bitterest
                  remembrance in her mind was the reason which obliged her to contemplate this last
                  step, this irremediable sin. Dick Faulkner's kiss still burned upon her hand; his
                  shameful words yet rang in her ear. She had lived to have an avowal of degrading
                  affection forced upon her: worse than that, she had arrived at a crisis where her
                  good name must be utterly ruined by the slanders of this wretch, or she end her
                  mortal career with a dose of the poison she held in her hand. Yes, one other way
                  out—she had to repeat it to herself—dishonor!
               And now she saw what had really brought her to this strait: it was rather what the
                  world calls flirtation, permits and approves, than the business exigencies of the
                  case. Had her conduct been always circumspect and guarded, Faulkner's power to
                  harm her would be confined to their moneyed relations; but pecuniary ruin was the
                  least misfortune which menaced her now. She had allowed herself to be drawn into
                  receiving his attentions; she had gone on and on, as scores of women have done
                  before, and now she stood face to face with the loathsome, abhorrent truth,
                  stripped of the disguises in which she had so enveloped it that she had never
                  perceived its real shape.
               There is an old-fashioned, almost an antiquated, Book wherein are set down these
                  words, from the lips of the one Preacher whose every syllable is truth: "The man
                  who looketh upon a woman to lust after her hath already committed adultery in his
                  heart." The married woman who indulges in flirtation, the woman who receives
                  tender looks and whispers from a married man, is a woman who has been sullied by
                  such thoughts in the man's mind. This sounds coarse; but this is a coarse world,
                  and ours a coarse century, in spite of the fine names under which we clothe our
                  vices and our crimes. These things look very differently set down in the language
                  they deserve, instead of dressed up in the glowing paragraphs of sensation novels
                  or French plays; but we have trifled with the glittering exterior long enough; it
                  is time to make ourselves see the blackness and the rottenness under.
               In this hour Alice Marchmont saw it plainly enough, and felt that nothing could
                  ever free her soul from the degradation of all that she had brought upon it. If
                  she could be liberated to-morrow, the horrible fact would remain that she had
                  rendered it possible for a bad man to speak vile words; she could never wash that
                  memory out, and there could be no punishment equal to it.
               A rap at the door roused her from her maddening reflections. She hid the phial,
                  and when Pauline entered was throwing her opera-cloak about her shoulders. It was
                  eight o'clock, and the carriage had been waiting some time. She went her way.
               Among the circle of guests gathered in Mr. Worthington's library, until such time
                  as Mrs. Marchmont's arrival should enable them to eat their dinner, were Halford
                  and Milly Crofton.
               "I supposed you would be late," her host said, hurrying forward to the door to
                  meet her.
               "Of course you thought something bad of me," she replied, gayly; "you always
                  have—a liberty that comes of old acquaintance."
               "You like it," said he; "you know you do! You get fed with so much sugar that it
                  suits you to come, now and then, and let me say sharp things to you."
               "They keep my mind in tone," she answered. "But really, I think you look more
                  wicked than usual to-night."
               "And you—are you well again?"
               "Look at me," she said, smiling.
               "Oh, this is your company face; I'll study it later."
               He laughed, and passed her on to his niece, a pretty girl of about Milly Crofton's
                  age, to whom Mrs. Marchmont said a dozen charming things in a breath, and
                  thought,
               "I dare say you think what would you give to be like me. Ah, if we could change.
                  Oh, my youth, my youth!"
               But neither despair nor sentiment could be indulged just then; she had only time
                  for a word with Halford, a flattering greeting to Milly, who had forgotten her
                  momentary annoyance of the morning, and was as enthusiastic as ever in her
                  admiration of the beautiful woman. Dinner was announced, the guests marshaled in
                  their proper order, and Mrs. Marchmont was led away by her host.
               It was a delightful party; there were not more than a dozen people, but chosen
                  with the tact Mr. Worthington displayed on such occasions—a dinner to be
                  remembered by any quiet person, who had leisure to think and to recollect. Mrs.
                  Marchmont as far outshone her ordinary self as, in her mildest moments, she
                  outshone ordinary women; and all the while she was marveling whether it was only a
                  dream, every thing seemed so far off and unreal.
               She saw Kenneth Halford seated by pretty Milly at the other end of the table,
                  looking at her occasionally in a kind of wonder, then turning back to his neighbor
                  with an expression of rest on his face. She saw how it would he—he might not think
                  it now—but he would marry that young girl. It did not matter, so far as she was
                  herself concerned; nothing mattered. There was no man living whom she would dare
                  to wed. Oh Heaven! in all her list of adorers and friends, not one but would
                  shrink away in horror at a perception of the truth.
               The money—the money!
               Somebody else's name—some help!
               All these wild thoughts in her mind while the conversation went on, while she was
                  talking and laughing, wondering vaguely if she should lose her last gleam of
                  reason, scream suddenly, stab herself with the carving-knife by Mr. Worthington's
                  plate, and make an end of it—and in the midst scenes from the old days rising
                  whenever she looked at Kenneth Halford. The gray autumn afternoon in its quiet;
                  the blue smoke curling up among the trees; the countenance which she saw across
                  the lights, so calm and grave, gazing into that young girl's eyes—she could see it
                  as it looked on that still afternoon when he had said farewell to that other girl,
                  as much a stranger now to Alice Marchmont as the pretty, innocent creature before
                  her. The recollection, too, of what awaited her return home—that came in the
                  jumble of her thoughts also. She could see the phial of nauseous black liquid
                  where she had hidden it, and catch the sickening odor of the poison, growing faint
                  and weak as if the fatal draught already stupefied her senses.
               There was nothing spared her, for somebody began to talk of a recent venture in
                  stocks which had astonished Wall Street—some bold outsider who had accumulated a
                  vast fortune in a few weeks.
               "To lose it, probably, in as short a time," John Worthington said, when the story
                  ended. "The taste for gambling, once formed, is not easily subdued; the man will
                  go back."
               "Gambling is a rather harsh word," some woman said.
               "I don't know of any other that applies," he answered; "do you?"
               "Please to recollect that my husband is a Wall Street man," laughed she.
               "Your husband is a regular commission-broker, doing a legitimate business, and
                  never by any chance going outside of it. That is one thing—an honest, honorable
                  occupation. The man who goes into Wall Street to throw his money upon some stock
                  is a gambler as much as the man who sits down at the green table and risks his
                  substance."
               "I don't think those would be very popular doctrines in our day," Kenneth Halford
                  said.
               "Is the truth ever popular?" demanded Worthington.
               "And what do you call the woman who 'dabbles in stocks?'" asked the lady who had
                  just spoken, only too familiar, like the rest of us, with the cant phrases used to
                  express such transactions.
               "I call her a very unwise person," Mr. Worthington' answered, laughing, unwilling
                  to be drawn into a serious argument upon the subject at his own table.
               "He shall not get out of it in that way—shall he, Mrs. Marchmont?" persisted Mrs.
                  Townley.
               "No, indeed," returned she, feeling herself shiver from head to foot. "We will
                  know just how bad things he dares think of us in his bachelor mind."
               "The queen has spoken," some man said. "Out with it, Worthington."
               "I call her a gambler too, if you will have plain words," he replied, trying to
                  speak jestingly ingly, though it was
                  difficult upon a matter where he felt so keenly—"a gambler, and with less excuse
                  than a man, because she forsakes her sphere to reach the temptation."
               A chorus of laughing expostulations greeted the remark; then Mrs. Marchmont said,
                  gayly,
               "Please to remember how much woman's sphere has widened; it takes in every thing,
                  even to Wall Street."
               "I'll not jest upon the subject," he said, pleasantly. "Suppose we talk of
                  something else, for I have a bad habit of calling a spade by its name."
               "Oh, I insist on knowing what makes you severe," continued Alice. "Upon my word,
                  Mrs. Townley, I believe he has been wandering from the path of rectitude, and has
                  suffered for it."
               "I?" he exclaimed, with a genuine horror which made them all laugh again. "I would
                  as soon put my hand in the fire."
               "We all know that a burned child dreads it," cried she, teasingly.
               He laughed, and attempted to change the conversation; but some reckless impulse,
                  which she could not resist, forced her to annoy him by persisting in the
                  discussion, and Mrs. Townley joined her from mere frivolity. The dinner had lasted
                  an unconscionable length of time. It seemed to Mrs. Marchmont that the morrow must
                  have come, it appeared so long since they sat down at the table, glittering with
                  plate and delicate Sèvres, and odorous with flowers born in warm Southern
                  lands.
               "We insist on having the truth; don't we, Mrs. Marchmont?" cried Mrs. Townley, in
                  her affected way.
               "Yes; either he shall make a full confession, and admit that he learned his
                  scruples from a severe lesson, else he shall give his reasons for flying in the
                  face of popular opinion in this savage fashion," she said.
               "There is no way out, Worthington," laughed a male guest.
               At this instant a message was brought Miss Constance by one of the servants.
               "Oh, uncle," she said, in the deep distress which trifles cause at her age, "we
                  are so late with dinner that some friends I invited for the evening have already
                  come."
               "What a terrible catastrophe," he replied, smiling. "Very well, dear, you and my
                  little Milly shall run away to them; we will all come presently."
               Halford rose to open the door for the two girls. Milly gave him a shy, inquiring
                  glance, which caused him to follow them out, wondering a little at such folly on
                  his part; and Mrs. Marchmont observed him go.
               "If you will promise not to make me argue, and will leave the subject after,"
                  Worthington said, "I'll tell you a story, now that those two children are gone.
                  Perhaps, then, none of you will marvel at my severity."
               "Is it very sensational and exciting?" demanded Mrs. Marchmont, with a pretty
                  eagerness, while it was all she could do to keep from springing up and running
                  away, to escape this new torture.
               "Yes; and the best, or the worst, of it is, that it is true."
               "How delightful!" cooed Mrs. Townley.
               "Fill my glass with Champagne first," laughed Alice; "I'm an impressionable young
                  person, and may faint before you finish."
               "It was only a year ago," John Worthington said, trying to keep his voice quiet
                  and unmoved, "that I went home to dine with a friend who had been at my office on
                  business. It was very late: when we got to the house, the servant told us that his
                  mistress had started for Albany an hour before; a telegram had come announcing her
                  mother's illness. He gave his master a letter, and went out. I stood and looked at
                  my friend as he opened it and began to read; before he had finished the page, he
                  fell at my feet in a sort of fit—"
               "Oh, go on!" pleaded Mrs. Townley, while Alice Marchmont leaned back in her chair,
                  smiling still.
               "This man had been enduring terrible business anxieties for months," he continued;
                  "I had succeeded this very day in assisting him; we had gone to the house together
                  to gratify his wife by the news, for he loved her."
               "She was not to blame for her mother's illness; relations are always committing
                  some indiscretion," said Mrs. Marchmont, with a flippancy so out of place that it
                  shocked her own delicate sense of tact, though she could not keep silent.
               "This letter was to tell her husband that for the past year she had allowed a man
                  of their acquaintance to buy stocks for her," pursued Worthington, slowly. "He had
                  led her on and on, deceived her, lied to her—at last came with the news that she
                  owed him a large sum—either she must run away with him or he would expose the
                  whole affair, and prosecute her husband: she had gone."
               There was an instant's silence, broken by expressions of horror.
               "But he could not have been a man of business or respectability, since he was
                  willing to ruin-his own future," Mrs. Townley said.
               "Both; that is, he was received in society; every body knew him for a bad man,"
                  Worthington said.
               "Go on," Mrs. Marchmont urged, in a low voice.
               "Yes; what did the husband do?" asked Mrs. Townley. "Left the creature to the fate
                  she deserved, I suppose."
               "He found the route his wife had taken; she was to meet this man in a Southern
                  city, and go to Cuba—from there to South America. He reached the rendezvous before
                  the villain who had helped her to this, and he took her home with him."
               "What! he forgave her?"
               "Yes, he forgave her—paid the debt, and was ruined."
               "And did he kill the man?" demanded some one.
               "No; because that would have disgraced his wife," Worthington replied, playing
                  with his fork in an absent way.
               "No wonder you have a horror of stock speculations," said Mrs. Townley, with a
                  shudder.
               "Mr. Worthington!"
               It was Alice Marchmont who spoke his name. He looked up at her, and waited for her
                  to go on.
               "Would you have forgiven the woman?"
               The answer rang out slow and ominously firm.
               "No."
               Mrs. Marchmont arranged the lace upon her bosom, and looked already a little weary
                  of the subject.
               "Oh, you hard-hearted man!" cried Mrs. Townley; and the men added one thing, most
                  of the women another.
               "I might forgive a woman who was unfortunate enough to love where she ought not,"
                  John Worthington said. "I would never forgive one who placed herself in the
                  position this woman did, from coquetry, or a cold-blooded design to make a
                  merchandise of her smiles, and go to the extremest verge of decency and dishonor
                  without going over."
               As he ceased speaking there was a movement to rise. It was so difficult for Alice
                  Marchmont to get out of her chair, it seemed to her that her limbs were half
                  paralyzed; but she struggled to her feet, took Mr. Worthington's arm, and her
                  laugh rang out gay and unconcerned.
               They went up to the drawing-room. She was still the centre of attraction; they
                  made her talk, they forced her to sing; and each instant she grew more brilliant
                  and beautiful, as the fever in her veins drove her nearer and nearer absolute
                  insanity. Then there was a brief space of quiet for her; she knew that Halford had
                  come to her side while she sung, at somebody's request, a song of the old, old
                  days. She glanced down the room, and saw pretty Milly looking at them, and
                  thought, drearily,
               "She loves him; let him go to her. I can not give him the girl he lost, but this
                  pure creature is more like her than I; let him go. I dare not even have his
                  friendship, which he promised; I can keep nothing; I am alone."
               All the while there was a sharp pain beyond her bitterness, beyond the insane
                  whirl of her thoughts. A year before she might have taught this man to love her
                  anew; she might have had her girlhood back; but now? Oh, now she regarded the
                  possibility as a lost soul in the depths of purgatory might look back over the
                  records of its earthly existence, and see where sin avoided would have led it far
                  from the present agony.
               "You must go and talk to those young girls," she said. "I have been looking at
                  Milly tonight; she reminds me more than ever of the girl we used to know. Go to
                  her, Kenneth; pray God that she may never change so that she shall look back on
                  herself as she is now, and wonder if she can be the same."
               "Your voice sounds so mournful," he said: "I am sure you are ill."
               "Ill? I have no time to be! Don't you know that I am a star-actress? I never
                  forget that I am before the foot-lights."
               The interview of the morning left no trouble or constraint in either of their
                  minds. He was glad that he had spoken—glad that it was over; but his sympathy was
                  profound, and she would always possess for him an interest peculiarly her
                  own—occupy a place in his thoughts which no other woman could usurp. Her laugh
                  jarred upon his ear; after what he had seen that day it sounded forced and
                  unnatural. He glanced, too, at Milly sitting there in her girlish innocence—truly,
                  an image of rest. He was worn and weary—glad to be done with worldly women and
                  their ways. At this moment Mr. Worthington came up, and Halford moved to Milly's
                  side; it was pleasant to see the smile which lighted her eyes, and to think that
                  it might be possible to win her love and be ministered to by her
                  tenderness—somewhat selfish in his fancies—after the habit of men who have reached
                  his age.
               "I want you to come and see the alterations I have made in my study," John
                  Worthington said. "You abused it for a den the last time you were here. I
                  consulted Constance's taste, and now I suppose you will say that it is much too
                  fine for a crabbed old bachelor."
               "I shall certainly find fault because you consulted any feminine authority besides
                  mine," she said.
               He smiled at her pleasantly; she had no idea of a certain secret which had lain in
                  his heart for years.
               "I did remember the color you said I ought to have, but I was afraid of boring you
                  by asking your advice."
               "The excuse is worse than the offense," she replied. "But, indeed, to-night you
                  seem determined to add enormously to your catalogue of faults."
               "Why don't you say crimes, and be done with it?" laughed he.
               "Don't use such a horrible word," she exclaimed, quickly, and as quickly forced
                  her voice back to the indolent quiet proper to the occasion. "You've not said a
                  single complimentary thing to me this evening."
               "But I never do."
               "Then it is time you began. Your education has been dreadfully neglected; I really
                  must take you in hand."
               "Very well; I promise to prove a docile, if not an intelligent pupil."
               "Oh, don't be so horribly correct even in your language; at least, show your claim
                  to humanity by making a few lapses there."
               "I make them often enough, in every way; you don't think I set myself up as a
                  criterion, or a judge?"
               
               "You are hard on people's failings—don't deny it. Because you can be stately and
                  determined, don't blame weaker mortals for not attaining to your pitch of
                  perfection."
               "Upon my word, you are downright ill-natured! What a disagreeable old fossil you
                  make me out."
               "I think you the best man in the world, but I am horribly afraid of you," she
                  replied, lightly, yet with a certain earnestness in her voice.
               It was dangerous, but she found a relief in going as near the truth as she
                  dared.
               "Afraid of me, indeed; you were the most impertinent critic I ever had, even as a
                  child."
               "Was I? Tell me; was I a nice child?"
               "The most spoiled little monkey—"
               "But nice?"
               "Well, one couldn't help loving you, and giving way to your whims; you made every
                  body do that."
               "And as a girl?"
               "Why, you know I was absent for two years—my one holiday, nearly. You were married
                  when I got back."
               "Oh yes; I remember."
               She took his arm, several people followed, and they passed down stairs to the
                  ground-floor, and entered the pretty apartment of which he had spoken. They all
                  stood there chatting for a few moments; then two of the men—elderly bachelors—took
                  that opportunity to steal away into Worthington's snug smoking-room, and enjoy a
                  surreptitious cigar. The other pair, being birds of opposite sex, and having a
                  very interesting flirtation well under way, chose to walk up and down the passage
                  for a few moments. In John Worthington's house people were really at liberty to
                  enjoy themselves, and it was his habit, in general, only to invite people with
                  brains enough to know how to do it in a sensible fashion. So he and Mrs. Marchmont
                  stood chatting by his great table, loaded with books and papers.
               "Such frightful disorder," she said, beginning to toss over the volumes.
               "May I write a note?" he asked. "I have just remembered one that I promised to
                  answer."
               "Write, and don't apologize," she said, seating herself in his favorite chair.
                  "You have been persistently rude to me for ten years; it is only cruel now to
                  attempt an affectation of ceremony."
               "And you must get a little tired, occasionally, of always wearing state robes, and
                  playing queen," he replied, searching among the piles of manuscript for the letter
                  he needed.
               "I'll not have you laugh at me and my poor little life, just because you happen to
                  be a distinguished man, and as wise as all those books up yonder," she said,
                  pointing to the well-filled shelves which lined the walls. "I wonder if you really
                  read them!"
               "So, after all, you doubt my claims to the wisdom you just complimented me on
                  possessing."
               "I believe the man wants another compliment!"
               "Yes; I retain my innocent tastes; I rather like bonbons."
               "Then you'll not get them; write your note."
               "Time enough: one does not often catch you alone. I wonder sometimes if each of
                  these years that slip so rapidly away finds you a happier woman."
               She shivered at his words, but laughed out, partly from the recklessness grown
                  natural to her, partly to hide her emotion.
               "Don't wonder about such things, you dreadful book-man! Don't you know that
                  civilized people keep such wonderings for their own private delectation?"
               "But I don't pretend to belong to civilized people."
               "Oh dear, I wish we did not, any of us. How nice, if we could only live on an
                  island in the Indian Ocean—wherever that may be—and care for nothing, but pick our
                  enemies' bones in peace behind the doors of our—well, whatever one uses there in
                  place of a house."
               "I have been thinking of reading you a lecture," he said; "it has troubled my mind
                  for a good while."
               "Don't then, please; I hate to be lectured."
               He looked grave, in spite of returning the smile with which she strove to soften
                  him.
               "We are such very old friends," he said.
               "You are very rude to remind me of my age."
               "You used to come and talk freely to me," he went on, notwithstanding her efforts
                  to shake his gravity; "but you are always in the world now. Don't be angry—your
                  extravagance, of which I hear so much, is your own business, so is your
                  flirting—but don't flirt with Dick Faulkner. There, it is off my mind at
                  last."
               "I hate that man!" she exclaimed.
               "So you ought," he answered. "But they tell me he visits you—that he boasts of
                  your acquaintance."
               "I meet him—I—" She stopped short in the prevarication.
               "I suppose you wanted to tease his wife," he continued, beginning anew his search
                  for the letter. "But just let that man alone altogether; I know him."
               A wild longing came over her to tell him the whole story—to go on her knees and
                  beg him to save her. But to lose his respect and affection—she had such a craving
                  for both—to hear words of reproach, read her condemnation in his face, in the
                  first sound of his voice—how could she do it? What would life be worth when she
                  had lost these from him, and the admiration of her world! better die and be done,
                  than confess, or live deprived of them. Perhaps she might have tried though, might
                  have yielded to the voice of the good angel that pleaded with her—Heaven only
                  knows—but his next words rendered it impossible, by reminding minding her of the
                  verdict he had passed upon a weak woman only an hour before.
               "One other thing; I must say it, even if you never forgive my impertinence; long
                  ago you gave me the right to meddle—about stock speculations, which we were
                  talking of at dinner. Only yesterday I heard that fool of a Mrs. Doane boast that
                  her brother let her take ventures; don't you ever be deluded into such
                  schemes."
               "But Mrs. Doane did make a lot of money."
               "Never you mind; so much the worse, if she did. Gambling is gambling; nothing can
                  make wrong right. It is sure to end ill for a woman—particularly a woman alone in
                  the world. Ten to one she gives some rascal power over her which he is not slow to
                  use in any way. You are not angry?"
               "No, no!"
               "I see you hate the bare idea connected with yourself: no wonder. I vow, if I
                  caught my niece at such performances, I would disown her; it would be the one
                  thing I never would forgive."
               No hope! She could not appeal to him—could not tell him even a portion of the
                  truth. Before she left home she had told herself that every thing was at an end;
                  still it seemed as if there had been a door partially open whereby she might
                  escape, and he had just shut it in her face. She was away off in the blackness
                  again; the night was deeper, more impenetrable, than ever—no guide, no help, no
                  loop-hole; his stern words had flung her off the last halting-place where she had
                  clang; she was sinking down—down!
               "There," he said; "I believe I have finished my lecture and my cautions. I wish
                  you would be more quiet, give yourself a little rest; but I have not the heart to
                  scold further; you always disarm me by your patience."
               "It is very good of you to care—"
               "I do care; I always shall. Now, then, I will write my note, and will go back to
                  the people. So you like my room?"
               "It is very pretty," she answered, quietly; a strange composure had succeeded the
                  whirl in her brain.
               Mr. Worthington seated himself at the table and wrote a few lines—held up the
                  paper so that she could see the signature, in the great, sprawling, irregular
                  hand.
               "I don't improve in my writing," he said. "Do you remember the summer we were all
                  at Lake George, when you used to amuse us by imitating my signature?"
               "Did I? One forgets so."
               She felt so dizzy that she had to grasp the arms of her chair for support. Just as
                  if the devil had whispered it audibly in her ear, came the first intimation of the
                  one possible way out of Faulkner's power.
               "Oh yes; Marchmont said you must have been meant for a forger, you were so
                  successful. Indeed, it was wonderful; I couldn't tell it from my own; I always
                  promised not to prosecute you when you forged my name in earnest," he added,
                  laughingly.
               She shrunk back in mortal terror; that dreadful word seemed to snatch her from the
                  precipice where she had stood for an instant. She saw him look up in surprise at
                  her sudden movement. She knew that she must speak, must say something.
               "One forgets so," she repeated. "It seems ages ago."
               "It was a very pleasant summer: I remember it distinctly," he said.
               There was no further opportunity for conversation; more people entered the room,
                  and the stream of idle talk and laughter went on until Mrs. Marchmont could endure
                  it no longer. She ordered her carriage and made her adieus, sparkling to the last,
                  and left them wondering at her spirits, speaking of her as one of the few persons
                  in the world really to be envied.
               She was at home, up in her room, and there on her dressing-table lay a note
                  directed in a hand with which she had grown only too familiar during the past
                  weeks.
               She tore it open; it contained but a few words.
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Have you forgotten that to-morrow makes the tenth day? Admire my
                              patience; I have not even been near you. It has seemed an age, but you
                              will let me come in the morning; you will let me arrange the affair
                              without trouble to yourself.
                           
                              DICK."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Oh the insolence—the cool sense of power! it drove her, for the time, beyond the
                  verge of reason upon which her brain had tottered so long; she went wholly
                  mad.
               She could not die—she dared not; she told herself that. Then she knew what lay
                  before her—disgrace, in one form or another. Only one way out—one! He had pointed
                  it to her himself; John Worthington had shown her the one way. She must seize
                  it—she could not die—she must! She would be free at any cost—be able, when the
                  morrow came, to fling that wretch's money in his face, and have done with him
                  forever.
               Are you pronouncing it unnatural? Think a little of the circumstances—the awful
                  strait which she had reached—and see if there would have been no temptation for
                  you. I do not mean to palliate her sin, yet I aver that she was not a bad woman. I
                  can at least say that she did not realize what she was about to do; never stopped
                  to think of the consequences in case of discovery; thought of nothing only to free
                  herself from that man.
               I can not make a sensational scene; I can only describe exactly what this woman
                  did. She believed afterward that she was mad; in many instances crime and insanity
                  are so closely connected that it is difficult for human judgment to separate them;
                  but no metaphysical discussions could change the matter-this was what she did.
               
               She had been sitting in the chair where she threw herself on entering the room,
                  going over the events of the last few days, her utter failure in every quarter to
                  obtain assistance bringing the review up to the words John Worthington had this
                  night spoken. The scene that must take place on the morrow rose in her mind; she
                  could see Faulkner's devilish smile again. Ruin—disgrace! Either the ruin of her
                  womanhood and her soul, or disgrace and exposure before the world. If she could
                  die! if she were not so utterly weak and despicable! She actually held the poison
                  in her hand, and tried to raise it to her lips; she could not do it. Her hand fell
                  to her side as suddenly and powerless as though some invisible strength grasped it
                  and would not let her go. She thrust the bottle out of sight; it was useless to
                  struggle with her own cowardice.
               She ran to the safe, unlocked it, and took out a paper—came back to the light, and
                  studied it—the paper which she had twice presented in vain to her Hebrew friend.
                  It was a bill for the amount needed, with her signature attached—worthless! It
                  only required another person's name—an indorsement on the back; that was all—and
                  her Jewish friend would be happy to further her wishes.
               She searched among her letters for specimens of John Worthington's writing. There
                  were numerous notes from him; he was always inviting her to his house, or sending
                  her rare flowers, with notes scribbled in his trenchant, amusing vein. She sat
                  down at the table again, and began to copy the name—John Worthington. She covered
                  a whole page with those two words; you could not have told the signature from the
                  original before her.
               She drew toward her the paper which she had offered to the Israelite. There was an
                  instant's pause; her white face glared upward and about; her wild eyes seemed, at
                  that last moment, searching some refuge, some aid. She made a movement to fling
                  the pen away—her hand touched Dick Faulkner's note; she gave a low moan, more
                  painful than a shriek of the keenest agony.
               Again she seized the pen; this time there was no hesitation. The potent name—John
                  Worthington's name—was on the paper when she laid it aside.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               THE FIRST WALK.
               THE next morning Milly Crofton went out for an early walk. A former servant of
                  Mrs. Remsen's was dying of lingering consumption, and Milly always found leisure
                  to go and see her once or twice a week, though it never occurred to her that she
                  was doing a meritorious work, and she had not the slightest idea how much pleasure
                  her bright presence afforded the desolate woman.
               She turned into Fifth Avenue, almost deserted at that time, and walked rapidly on;
                  for the invalid lived in a narrow street so far up among the sixties that it was
                  quite beyond the pale of civilization, and required a good hour's march to reach.
                  It had been an effort for Milly to go out this morning; but she had some money to
                  give their protégée—her own and Constance's savings, largely increased by a
                  donation from Mr. Worthington—and she was anxious that poor old Abigail should
                  have it at once. This sacrifice of her own inclinations met with a very unexpected
                  reward—all the pleasanter, for that reason. As she stopped at a crossing until a
                  butcher's cart, which threatened instant destruction to the unwary, dashed past,
                  followed by the butcher's dog, looking so fierce that Milly felt grateful he had
                  not time to pause in his chase, Kenneth Halford appeared up the side street, and
                  was close to her before she perceived him.
               "Miss Crofton! is it possible?" said he. "I did not suppose you had wakened yet,
                  after last night's fatigues."
               "Wakened and out, as you see," she replied, with the quick blush and the
                  smile—rather of the eyes than lips—which he thought so pretty.
               "You are as energetic as an English girl," he said.
               "Oh dear!" returned Milly; "all the slanders about American girls' indolence and
                  ill health may have been true of the past generation, but we can walk as far and
                  wear as thick shoes as any of the English women, I assure you."
               "I really believe you must have run away," said he, jestingly; "I think it will be
                  my duty to take you in charge."
               "Have you lived so long abroad that you consider it improper for a young lady to
                  walk out alone?" she asked, pouting.
               "Not a bit of it; I am proud to think that my young countrywomen don't need
                  watching."
               "Indeed, aunty doesn't let me go by myself during promenade hours; but so early as
                  this one doesn't expect to meet any human being but the brick-layers, and they are
                  always civil."
               "I will promise to be as civil as a brick-layer," laughed he, "if you will let me
                  accompany you; I had set out for an early walk too."
               "But I am going ever so far, and over to the east side of town," she replied,
                  naming the locality to which she was bound; but he had been so long absent that he
                  knew nothing about the neighborhood.
               "And I want to walk ever so far," he said; "so, unless you will find it a bore,
                  pray let me go with you."
               Milly wisely said nothing except, "It won't bore me."
               He caught a glimpse of her face, however, and it spoke as eloquently as the most
                     exigeant person could have desired. She
                  looked like an English robin, in her simple brown dress, with a bit of bright
                  scarlet at her throat; and her step was as springy and light as if she trod in
                  time to music inaudible to other ears.
               He walked on beside her, having first offered his arm; but that Milly refused with
                  another blush and a laugh.
               "Is it improper?" he asked.
               "No—but—I mustn't take it," she said, unhesitatingly, though he could see that it
                  was an effort for her to be courageous enough to speak. "Here, no young lady takes
                  a man's arm in the day-time unless he is her brother, or she is engaged to
                  him."
               "I did not remember that," he replied, too delicate to disturb her by a jest, as
                  many men would have done.
               So they went on through the bright sunshine; for it was a beautiful morning, the
                  weather almost unseasonably mild, though with a sufficient sharpness in the soft
                  air to keep it from being heavy or oppressive. They were at no loss for subjects
                  of conversation, and Halford had the art of making people talk; indeed, afterward
                  Milly was rather startled to remember how freely she had spoken her thoughts out,
                  only consoling herself by the reflection that, though she had not known him long,
                  the circumstances of their first acquaintance prevented her regarding him as a
                  stranger.
               The church clocks were striking nine as they passed Mrs. Marchmont's elegant
                  house, and they both looked in astonishment at the unexpected sight of her
                  brougham before her door.
               "I didn't know that she ever stirred out till noon," Milly said.
               "I think the coachman must have fallen asleep there after bringing his mistress
                  home last night, and forgotten to drive to the stables," replied Halford.
               Then they both forgot the circumstance in a renewal of the conversation which the
                  sight of the carriage had momentarily interrupted. Bright and pleasant as the
                  winter had been to Milly, this early ramble seemed the brightest and pleasantest
                  occurrence of the whole season; she remembered it long after, when between her and
                  that time swept a tempest of pain, wrath, and trouble, such as yet her young life
                  held no perception of.
               When they reached old Abigail's house, Milly said,
               "I shall have to stay here a little while; so I must bid you good-morning;" and
                  there was a shadow on her face, bravely as she fancied herself speaking.
               "Why must you?" he asked.
               "Because you will want to walk farther, or go back."
               "I have promised myself to see you safe home to your aunt," he replied; "so I
                  shall wait for you. Don't think to escape in that way."
               "Oh, that is very good of you; but Abigail always keeps me so; and I shall be
                  uncomfortable to remember that you are waiting."
               "Unless you really want me to go, I shall wait. I see a little open square yonder;
                  I shall find a bench, and smoke my morning's cigar while you are doing the amiable
                  to your old woman. But don't let me stay, if you would rather have me away," he
                  added, for the express pleasure of seeing her face grow earnest in her
                  protestations.
               But she disappointed him; her head was turned, so that he could not see it as she
                  answered, demurely,
               "I shall like to have you wait very much, if you don't mind."
               Then she ran into the house, and Halford strolled on to the square decorated with
                  two trees and a hideous pretense of a fountain, and sat down to smoke. About as
                  unfavorable a spot for day-dreaming as one could well conceive, but he managed to
                  lose himself, nevertheless, in a reverie more agreeable than any that had visited
                  him for a long time.
               It was not more than half an hour before the green door opened again, and his
                  unfashionably far sight perceived Milly descending the steps. He hurried forward
                  to meet her, saying,
               "I am afraid I forgot myself, and smoked more than my regulation cigar; now will
                  that small sin lie at your door, or Mrs. Abigail's?"
               "Neither," said Milly; "you can't shift your sins off on other people in that
                  fashion, Mr. Halford."
               "You are discouraging, with your straight-forward, uncompromising orthodoxy," he
                  answered. "I thought you would quiet my conscience by at least offering to share
                  the blame."
               So they walked back, chatting gayly, and Halford rather wondered at himself for
                  the pleasure he found in this child's talk; but it was so different, in its
                  artlessness, from that of old women, it possessed all the more charm.
               They found themselves within reach of civilized regions again, and turned once
                  more into the Avenue. As they went by Minerva Lawrence's mansion, that namesake of
                  the Athenian goddess chanced to be standing at a window of her breakfast-room,
                  and, as soon as she saw them, thumped vigorously on the glass, regardless of
                  etiquette, or the risk she ran of having a glazier's bill to pay.
               "Let's pretend not to see her or to hear," said Halford; but Milly shook her
                  head.
               "She's always so good to me," she urged; "and I half promised to go out with her
                  yesterday, but Aunt Eliza wanted me."
               "Then we will be conscientious, and go in," said Halford, "especially as I see the
                  man already opening the door; it is as well to do right, when you can't help
                  it."
               Milly ran up the steps, laughing at his remark of doubtful morality, and he
                  followed. Mrs. Lawrence met them in the passage, voluble in her astonishment and
                  pleasure.
               "Where on earth have you been? why, you must have started at daylight. I had just
                  come down to breakfast, and one never has any appetite alone. Oh, you naughty
                  Milly, not to have remembered yesterday! But come into the breakfast-room, and
                  have some coffee. Dear me, Mr. Halford,
                  you aren't running away with the child, I hope."
               "I am taking her safely home; or was, when you stopped us, Mrs. Lawrence. Coffee
                  indeed! why it is almost luncheon-time," he added, as they entered the
                  breakfast-room, and then began to ask her numerous questions, lest she should
                  disturb Milly by some attempts at raillery; and her efforts in that line were not
                  always discreet.
               "I am late," she said; "but I was at Mrs. Philips's last night, and not a soul of
                  you there; it was a failure: poor thing, it's too bad, when she works so hard to
                  get people to notice her. And, Milly, why didn't you come to me yesterday as you
                  promised, you bad child?"
               "I said if I could, but Aunt Eliza wanted me."
               "She always wants you if you are coming to me," grumbled Mrs. Lawrence, in a
                  comfortable way; she could not even grumble in earnest. "That's just like Eliza;
                  she must rule, or she's not happy; but I'm very fond of her, for all that. Here's
                  chocolate, if you won't have coffee, Mr. Halford; or they can make tea."
               He chose the chocolate, in order to get rid of her persuasions, and she forced a
                  cup upon Milly: nothing made her so happy as to have an opportunity of gratifying
                  her hospitable instincts.
               "I've not seen you since my ball, Mr. Halford, though I found your card. How Mrs.
                  Marchmont frightened me! I never knew her to faint before in my life."
               "I can scarcely fancy it being any body's favorite recreation," said Halford.
               "But she is quite well again; I had a little note from her yesterday," pursued
                  Mrs. Lawrence.
               "Oh, I saw her at Mr. Worthington's last night," added Milly; "we had such a
                  charming dinner; I like her so much."
               "Dear me!" cried heedless Mrs. Lawrence; "and only last week I heard Eliza Remsen
                  say, with my own ears, that Mrs. Marchmont was so careless in her conduct—no, she
                  said reckless—"
               "Ah! you see," interrupted Milly, mischievously, "Mrs. Marchmont has rather
                  forgotten us all winter, except for her large parties; and after all, aunty is
                  only human; but she does admire Mrs. Marchmont; who could help it?"
               "Nobody, of course; but la, my dear, the way people talk! But then, they would
                  talk about an angel; and the whole world is ready to lie down and let her walk
                  over them."
               "How nicely your flowers look," Milly said, not having yet developed any taste for
                  scandal or gossip. "The bigonia you gave me is in full blossom; you can't think
                  how lovely it is. And now I really must go home; I promised Aunt Eliza not to be
                  gone any longer than I could help."
               "She's the sweetest child in the world," Minerva declared, pointing her plump hand
                  at Milly, and addressing Halford. "I'd give half I'm worth for a niece like her.
                  Come straight here and kiss me this instant, you little witch; you've no business
                  to be so pretty."
               She allowed them to go away, at length, and they walked on past Mrs. Marchmont's
                  house, and soon turned down the street in which Mrs. Remsen resided.
               "You must not forget to ask me in," Halford said, not above artifices to prolong
                  this pleasant morning; "you know I promised myself to see you safe in your aunt's
                  guardianship."
               "She will be very glad to see you," Milly answered.
               "As far as you are personally concerned, I dare say I have wasted as much of your
                  time as you can bear for one day."
               "Indeed, I have enjoyed my walk so much!"
               "Then may I ask the aunt if the experiment may not sometimes be repeated?" he
                  inquired.
               Milly gave him one of her demure little answers as the door opened; but this time
                  he did catch the expression of her face, and saw that it was much more
                  enthusiastic than her words. She conducted him at once to the morning-room,
                  certain that Aunt Eliza would be there, and as well prepared to receive visitors
                  as if the hour were a reasonable one; for Mrs. Remsen never indulged in careless
                  costumes, or allowed her young people to acquire the had habit either.
               She received Halford cordially, but there was no sign, in voice or manner, of the
                  satisfaction which the sight of the two together afforded her.
               "You see I have brought this young lady safely home, Mrs. Remsen," he said. "I
                  chanced to be setting out for an early walk too, and was rewarded for my good
                  habits."
               "It certainly was very nice for Milly," she answered, quietly. "How was poor old
                  Abigail, dear?"
               "About as usual; she had passed a very comfortable night," Milly said, sitting
                  down, her face so animated and her color so bright that her aunt saw with delight
                  that she was looking her very best.
               "Are you given to early walks, Mr. Halford?" she asked.
               "Yes, as spring comes on. Miss Crofton tells me that it is her habit too; will you
                  let me join her sometimes? She has promised not to refuse, provided you
                  permit."
               "Oh, of course; indeed, I don't like her going out much alone; but I am always
                  busy of a morning, and my daughter Maud still has her lessons to occupy her."
               "Then, Miss Crofton, you will not forget, I hope, that I am always at your
                  service," he said.
               Milly had risen, and was busy about the pagoda in which her birds lived; so,
                  again, she only said,
               "Oh no," and went on with her task. "Aunty, I think Maud has forgotten the fresh
                  water: she said she would put some in."
               "Oh, my dear, if you trust to Maud!" returned Mrs. Remsen, lifting her hands to
                  signify the vanity of any hope where that young lady was concerned.
               The aunt and Halford talked for a few moments, while Milly flitted about her
                  bird-cage, joining in the conversation occasionally; and at length Halford rose to
                  go, feeling that he really could not decently intrude any longer at this hour.
                  Mrs. Remsen was just cordial enough in her manner, said exactly the right words,
                  and he went away thinking her a very agreeable woman, and a very wise guardian for
                  a young girl.
               Once in the street, he remembered a magazine paper that he had promised an editor
                  to send to him this morning, and turned his steps homeward to attend to the
                  forgotten duty. As he neared Mrs. Marchmont's house, he saw her carriage again in
                  front of the door, and the lady herself just descending from it. Before he reached
                  the spot she had entered her dwelling, and he went on, wondering anew, as he and
                  Milly had done, at such matutinal exertion on her part.
               It was odd enough; but Alice Marchmont had gone to bed and soundly to sleep after
                  her work of the previous night—so completely worn out by the fears and emotions of
                  the past days that not even a dream disturbed her repose. She woke early, and at
                  first could not realize what had happened. Gradually the whole truth came back;
                  but with it came, also, the recollection that by noon Dick Faulkner would seek her
                  presence; she must be ready to meet him; she must complete the task she had
                  begun.
               She did not falter; she positively did not think. She was burning up with inward
                  fever; her head ached and swam so that she could scarcely get out of bed; but she
                  must rise; she must go in search of the Jew as early as possible. She kept in her
                  room to avoid meeting Miss Portman, replying so coldly to Pauline's first
                  expressions of wonder at finding her up at so unusual an hour, and partially
                  dressed, without assistance, that the polite Frenchwoman did not venture to add
                  another word.
               "Bring me my coffee and order the carriage," she said: "I must go out at nine
                  o'clock. I have to meet some people on business down town."
               "Madame is overwhelmed with affairs," the Frenchwoman said, sympathizingly.
               "Yes; but I am through now; I shall settle every thing this morning," returned
                  Mrs. Marchmont.
               She was astounded at her own calmness; she could not reflect upon what she had
                  done, or was about to do; it literally conveyed no meaning to her mind for the
                  time; she could only remember that she was free of Dick Faulkner—free to draw her
                  life back from the horrible shame which had menaced it.
               She drove away to the dirty, crowded portion of the city where the small Hebrew
                  had his den. On the ground-floor was a shop in which were displayed the wares that
                  comprised his ostensible business. There was a huge collection of rococo things,
                  tempting enough in this day, when there is a rage for impossible old traps in the
                  way of ancient cabinets, uneasy chairs, insane-looking ornaments of all sorts; so
                  that she ran no particular risk of exciting surprise in the mind of any body who
                  chanced to see her in this neighborhood.
               The little Hebrew was visible, as innocent as ever of clean linen or acquaintance
                  with soap-and-water. He received her in his usual wooden manner, showed her a
                  marvel of ugliness in the way of a carved table that had lately come into his
                  possession, and finally conducted her up stairs, that she might see some wonderful
                  vases which had only just been unpacked, and not yet exhibited to any customer. It
                  was doubtful if this bit of acting imposed upon the shrewd Hebrew clerks, as
                  greasy and soiled as their master; but he knew that it would be a consolation to
                  the lady to go through the pretense, and he was always willing to oblige his
                  clients, even to the keeping up of appearances, provided he was paid for it.
               The fat, untidy wife, who made regular visits to Mrs. Marchmont's house, in the
                  character of a distressed, but virtuous, widow woman, was as careful as her
                  husband to preserve the demeanor suited to the occasion. She was busy at a lofty
                  desk, with huge account-books, seated upon a high stool, with her legs hanging
                  down, and displaying an extent of black stocking and an amount of yellow garter
                  which was really astounding. There was not even speculation in her fishy eyes, as
                  she looked at Mrs. Marchmont—not the remotest gleam of acquaintance with that
                  lady's private affairs, or her diamonds.
               Once safely up stairs and seated in the den of an office, oppressive with a stale
                  smell of smoke and Bologna sausage, a sudden faintness came over the desperate
                  woman, but she did not lose her self-control; the dire exigencies of the moment
                  nerved her.
               "I wish you would open the window," she said; "it is very close here."
               The little Hebrew obeyed, though now there was an expression of surprise in his
                  face; that any human creature could desire fresh air filled him with
                  astonishment.
               The cool rush of wind steadied Mrs. Marchmont's reeling brain a little. She leaned
                  back in her chair, looking languid, and careless, and stately all at once. The
                  little Hebrew was watching her keenly enough from under his bushy eyebrows; but
                  there was nothing in her appearance to excite either wonder or suspicion.
               "I have arranged my little affair," she said; "I think even to you the paper I
                  offered the other day will be perfectly satisfactory."
               "But if you please not to say 'even,'" returned the Hebrew. "Surely, the madam
                  never found me hard to deal with;" and he looked quite a picture of injured
                     innocence. "I did not only ask a name;
                  that is not much; and the lady knows business is business to a poor man."
               "And I have the name," she said. "Of course, I could have obtained it in the
                  beginning; but I hated to expose the state of my affairs even to so dear a friend
                  as Mr. Worthington; however, you obliged me to do so by your obstinacy."
               "That is a good name—a very good name," replied the Jew, rubbing his hands softly
                  together.
               Mrs. Marchmont took the bill from her pocket and laid it on the table. He examined
                  it, but with no show of suspicion, though the momentary delay was more than she
                  could endure.
               "Have you some new scruple to satisfy?" she asked, impatiently.
               "No, no. A good name; I know it very well; many a time he has give me a check for
                  the things he bought here."
               "Very well; then that is all you want, I suppose."
               "Yes; yes. Now I have to think if I can raise the moneys—next week would not be
                  soon enough?"
               It was not a wish to annoy her which caused him to speak, only the magpie fondness
                  for hoarding which made him hate to give up his treasures, or admit that he had
                  them, as long as he could avoid it.
               "Give me back that paper," said she, rising angrily. "You know very well that I
                  have a large payment to make at noon; it is simply impertinent to ask if I can
                  wait."
               "If the lady will not be impatient," he said, in a deprecatory manner, holding
                  fast to the bill. "This morning? then she must have it."
               Mrs. Marchmont sat down again.
               "Now understand," she said, "this bill is not to leave your desk—not to be seen by
                  any body till I take it up. Mr. Worthington has no idea that it is to go into your
                  hands; he would be furious at my putting myself in such a position. He thinks it
                  is to be in the hands of my agent; he does not dream that I know you."
               "Just so; just so; I know how to keep a secret: the lady can certify to that. I am
                  not hard, like some beobles."
               "I shall be ready to take it up before the three months are over—"
               "The ninety days," corrected the Hebrew.
               "Very well. This is the last of my business annoyances. You will have your other
                  money too, and I shall take my jewels."
               "As the lady wishes."
               "Come, don't keep me; that's a good soul. I have a great deal to do."
               "I count the interest; we must take that out."
               "Oh, I shall not dispute over the amount; it is terrible, the usury you demand;
                  but I can't help myself."
               The Jew made his calculations upon a bit of dirty paper, and showed them to
                  her."
               "That is it."
               "You told me the other day; I drew the bill for a sufficient amount to cover it
                  and leave me what I want."
               "It is a large sum—"
               "Are you hesitating? If you haven't the money, after all, say so, and let me go
                  elsewhere," she cried.
               "My bank is the Shoe and Leather, in the Bowery," he said.
               "What do I care about your bank? Am I likely to go there, or anywhere, and present
                  a check with your name attached?" she asked, haughtily. "I could have had the
                  money from Mr. Worthington, but I would not take it; I can't bear to borrow from
                  my friends. I know that he runs no risk in lending me his name; I need only a few
                  weeks to get all my matters arranged."
               "Just so; just so," he answered, in his monotonous voice, which irritated her
                  beyond endurance.
               "Do you mean to give the money?"
               "Why not, with a good name? but if the lady will not take a check I must go to the
                  bank; a poor man like me doesn't have such sums in his safe."
               "How long will it take you?"
               "I am back in ten, fifteen minutes. Will the lady wait here?"
               "No; can't you send it to my house? Yes, I'll wait; only be quick—that is, I'll
                  wait down in my carriage; one can't breathe here. I'll drive to the corner of the
                  street. No—the coachman—I'll look at the things down stairs."
               "And the vases; I am sure the lady would like the vases, if she will only take a
                  peep at them."
               "You can't delude me into a purchase this morning, Mr. Herman," she said. "Do go
                  and get the money; I don't wish to be kept here all day. Where are the vases? I'll
                  look at them while you are away."
               "I shall call Mrs. Herman to show them," he said, hurrying off.
               He disappeared, and presently the jointed wooden doll of a woman came up, wiping
                  her nose on a red silk handkerchief. She was a taciturn body, and scarcely spoke
                  as she conducted Mrs. Marchmont into the chamber where the vases stood.
               They were old enough, ugly enough, rare enough; but all Alice Marchmont saw, as
                  she looked at them, was a vision of Rome, which she had visited when a very young
                  girl. Somehow the vases brought it all back, and there she stood, lost in her
                  memories, while the wooden woman stared at her furtively, perhaps wondering, in
                  her dull way, if it was possible that they belonged to the same species and
                  sex.
               The quarter of an hour passed; the Hebrew returned panting—the package of
                  bank-notes was in Mrs. Marchmont's hand.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               BAFFLED.
               THE deed was done, and could not be undone; for the note lay hidden among the
                  mysterious documents in the desk of the bland but unimpressionable Hebrew, and the
                  money had soiled Alice Marchmont's hand.
               It was done, and could not be undone; and from that hour the real torture and
                  suffering began. For the morning she put thought resolutely by, with a brief
                  return of the ability so to do which had of late deserted her. There was great
                  triumph in her heart when she reflected that she was out of Faulkner's power; but
                  even under the first gladness a sense of self-abhorrence, a consciousness of
                  guilt, coiled about her soul, and stung it with a nameless pain, which must
                  increase to an agony beyond any thing she had yet endured.
               They came, and said that Mr. Faulkner was waiting to see her; and she went down
                  stairs to go through this interview—the last, she kept thinking, which he would
                  ever have with her, except in the eyes of the whole world. Back came the
                  reflection of all from which she had been saved; her vivid fancy pictured the
                  contrast to her present feelings, supposing the required sum were not in her
                  possession; and again she was glad, horribly glad of what she had done. She would
                  have rejoiced to enter and overwhelm him with a burst of indignation and scorn, to
                  tell him exactly the sort of man he was, and how thoroughly she understood and
                  despised him; but the restraints of her life were too strong upon her to render
                  that possible. She did so love her position, the verdict of the world was so much
                  to her, that she could not afford to indulge in the truth even now; she must still
                  keep on terms of civility with Dick Faulkner, and with Dick Faulkner's wife. She
                  could not allow a marked change in her conduct to lead any body to suppose that he
                  had been on terms with her where he could have a possibility of giving
                  offense.
               "How I hate it," she thought, as she descended the stairs—"all the deceit, the
                  lying. I don't believe that I was naturally artful. Oh, if they had only left me
                  alone ten years ago, what a different woman I should be to-day! I can hear him
                  walking up and down; if I could only go in and trample him under my feet! I wish
                  the man lived who loved me well enough to hear the whole truth, and—"
               She did not finish her reflection, called herself a fool for raving in that absurd
                  fashion, and walked on into the morning-room, so calm and self-possessed,
                  receiving Faulkner with so entire a forgetfulness of their last interview in this
                  very apartment, that he was absolutely embarrassed for an instant. She had freed
                  herself—he understood that; how, he could not imagine; but his prey had slipped
                  through the toils which he had so cautiously woven during the past months. She saw
                  the confusion and wrath in his face, and exulted, though her manner was very
                  quiet, and her voice delightfully languid and disdainful.
               "Business is the order of the day," said she, without giving him time for more
                  than such greetings as he could utter in the first instant of his disappointment.
                  "I will not detain you; I am growing business-like, you see."
               She motioned him to a seat, sat down herself opposite, with a table between them,
                  whereon she laid the great pocket-book which he had noticed in her hand as she
                  entered. He did not speak; he was watching her, with that murderous frown on his
                  face, wondering, while he cursed her in his heart, how she had managed to compass
                  her deliverance. She took out the packet of crisp, new bank-notes, each of them
                  for a thousand dollars, and, as she touched them, shuddered to see what a pile
                  there was, remembering how she had stained her soul to obtain them.
               "I suppose you did not think a check would serve the same purpose," he said,
                  speaking for the first time since his confused salutations.
               "I did not," she replied. "I believe you will find the amount correct. Now, if you
                  will give me those troublesome papers I asked for, I think the matter will be
                  arranged."
               She pushed the pile of notes toward him, but still kept her hand upon them until
                  he tossed rudely down the receipts, at which she glanced for an instant.
               "Are they satisfactory?" he sneered.
               "Perfectly," she answered, with a courteous bow, and signed him to take up the
                  money.
               He crumpled the package into his pocket, and sat irresolute.
               "Now," thought Mrs. Marchmont, "if he is not an utter idiot, he will say a few
                  commonplaces and go. There's not the slightest necessity for a scene; I don't want
                  to be obliged to turn him out. Good gracious, I couldn't live to own that Dick
                  Faulkner had insulted me!"
               But he was an utter idiot—that is to say, a man; and he must needs air his
                  penitence and remorse, really supposing it necessary in order to have any hope of
                  her ever speaking to him again. If he could only have gone away without the
                  slightest allusion to what had happened, she would at least have been forced to
                  admire his tact and coolness.
               "I don't know what to say to you," he began.
               "Better say 'good-morning,'" she replied, laughing. "I know these are business
                  hours, and you want to be gone. A thousand thanks for having taken the time to
                  come-up to-day."
               "I think I must have been mad that last time—"
               "And one never notices the ravings of delirium," she interrupted, gayly, and
                  thought, "Oh, will he have it?"
               Yes, he undoubtedly would; his next words convinced her of that.
               "I want to know if you have forgiven me,"
                  he continued, awkwardly—"if we may be friends still."
               He would have it out; well, perhaps it was better; at all events, since he forced
                  her to speak, she would treat him to as much plain truth as might leave civility
                  in future possible.
               "I can at least forget, Mr. Faulkner," she answered; "and as long as I am not
                  obliged to remember, there will be nothing to forgive."
               "You don't know how much I think you," he exclaimed. "Indeed, I am not so bad a
                  fellow as people say! If you could only know what my life is; if you could
                  understand half its wretchedness—but why should you be troubled."
               He had recovered his wits sufficiently to try what he imagined would be the most
                  effective way of softening her. He was a handsome man—in a bad style—and he looked
                  particularly picturesque and interesting then, flinging his curls impatiently back
                  from his forehead, copying an attitude of a favorite jeune
                     premier at the French theatre, and speaking in the same monotonous
                  tone, with a little quiver in the voice which is popularly supposed to give strong
                  evidence of repressed emotion. The attitude and the tremulous accents might have
                  been very telling with many women, but, unfortunately, Mrs. Marchmont had studied
                  the jeune premier quite as closely as he, and
                  was too much in the habit of essaying private theatricals herself to be in the
                  slightest degree moved. She was so much an actress, knew every dramatic trick so
                  well, and had studied men so thoroughly, that the most awkward bluntness would
                  have been more effective, and stood a better chance of deceiving her.
               "Absolutely, he is posing," she thought, "as if I were a girl of sixteen. Ugh, you
                  great silly, ugly, black spider! does the woman live idiot enough to be duped by
                  your borrowed airs and graces?" But when he had finished his little speech, she
                  said, sweetly, "I suppose everybody's life has its trials, and we must each bear
                  our own; mine to-day must be a struggle with my modiste, for I need a new dress,
                  in a great hurry, for Mrs. Rosevelt's ball."
               How Dick Faulkner would have liked to strangle her! He fairly hated her as he
                  looked covetously at her disdainful loveliness, all the while a fierce passion
                  glowing in his heart. Still, he must cling to the sentimental rôle; he knew no
                  medium between that and attempts to frighten her; and those were useless now.
               "So you will not be friends?" he sighed.
               "With all the pleasure in life," she answered, "as one has friends in this busy
                  Vanity Fair."
               "I don't understand you," he said, with a studied gloom which made her long to
                  tell him she could herself get up a much more truthful imitation of the admired
                     jeune premier.
               She began to grow irritated at his determination to be sentimental; since she
                  could not deal him one honest blow full in the handsome face which she had last
                  seen so insolent and wicked, she would punish him by making plain her appreciation
                  of his histrionics.
               "Then you shall understand me, Mr. Faulkner!" she said; "and we will have done, if
                  you please, with this foolish talk, which is pretty enough on the stage or in
                  novels, but very tiresome in real life."
               She had the best of him every way; she had slipped out of his clutches just as he
                  believed her hopelessly in his power; it was hard work to keep the devil
                  under.
               "I am sorry if I have been tiresome."
               "That is good of you, at all events," said she. "You remember what the clergyman
                  said to Canning? But I suppose you don't know much about clergymen."
               "As much, perhaps, as my neighbors," he retorted, allowing his natural voice to be
                  audible.
               "That is not pretty of you. But this particular clergyman said to the statesman,
                  in speaking of his own sermon, 'I tried not to be tedious.'"
               "And Canning?"
               "Answered mildly, but with a sense of injury, 'And yet you were.'"
               Dick Faulkner showed his white teeth in a grimace which he believed a smile, but
                  the devil did so break out in his face that Mrs. Marchmont's blood ran cold as she
                  remembered what she had escaped.
               "Now let us put sentiment aside; it is dreadfully antiquated in our century," she
                  continued, gayly. "I shall be glad to see you and your wife at my parties, Mr.
                  Faulkner—glad to meet you in society; and more I could not say to any one. The
                  life I lead leaves me no leisure for any closer acquaintance."
               He returned to the monotone and the repressed agitation.
               "But you will forgive—"
               "Don't remind me! I said that I had forgotten—you may believe that; but never
                  trust to a woman's forgiveness."
               "Can one trust to a woman at all?"
               "Oh, that is the grand question with poets, from Byron down. I was to be trusted,
                  you perceive—in business matters. Let me thank you again for worrying yourself
                  with my little affairs."
               "If you would allow me to do more—I have something on foot now that is sure to be
                  successful."
               "No; thanks. I will take my little losses and—my little lesson."
               Was there no way in which he could sting or hurt her—leave her with a certain
                  dread in her mind that the affair might not be so completely ended as she
                  believed? He would have sold his soul at that instant to give such threats a
                  foundation.
               "You are quite sure that I shall never mention your having made ventures in
                  crooked Wall Street?" he asked, meaningly.
               "Perfectly," she answered, with composure, and a softly ironical ring in her
                  voice. "You don't suppose that I could accuse you of any thing so ungentlemanly?
                  What an unmitigated villain a man would be considered on all sides who betrayed a
                  confidence of the sort! Don't be astonished, though, if I tell the story to your
                  wife some day, when I am bored or cross."
               That would be pleasant! His wife—happily for her—had money that Dick Faulkner
                  wanted, and always hoped to obtain; and besides this, he had no wish that their
                  quarrels should come to an open outbreak. He had trouble enough now at
                  home—trouble enough to keep his place in society; and a hint of this business
                  might drive the jealous woman to extremities. "And this one would do it," he
                  thought. "What a born devil she is! I do believe she'd tell my wife just for the
                  fun of the row, however much she suffered by it."
               Mrs. Marchmont perceived that her final shot had told; and it so lightened her
                  spirits, under the rage and disgust which she felt for the man, that she bowed him
                  out of her presence with the utmost graciousness.
               Dick Faulkner went away thinking, "The woman has done me; what an ass I have been!
                  I might have drawn her on—got her to invest in some stock company till she hadn't
                  a penny—she was crazy enough over it—and then—"
               He ground his teeth with rage, to think how he had defeated his own game by his
                  inability to wait.
               "How ever did she raise this money? She is dreadfully crippled. Never mind, madam!
                  The game is yours this time; but if ever I do get a chance to turn the tables—! I
                  don't know whether I love her or hate her. I know I'd like to carry her off in the
                  face of the whole world, and let every thing go to the devil together."
               He was gone, and Alice had leisure to think—I should have said, she could no
                  longer keep thought at bay. It came like an audible voice, crying out to her what
                  she was—a criminal—a forger!
               She ran up and down the room like a wild animal in a cage; the full horror and
                  degradation burst upon her. It seemed to her that before the day was gone she
                  should be discovered, her guilt published, and she dragged out to face it. Where?
                  To prison? Yes, to prison, along with thieves and murderers, and horrible women,
                  such as she had read of, and never been able to realize as absolutely belonging to
                  the same sex with herself. This was where her life had ended. It must be a dream;
                  it was impossible that she could have committed a crime: she did not believe it;
                  she would not. Women committed sins, but not of that sort. There was Sybil Ansley,
                  who ran away from her husband with the lover of her girlish days. Only a short
                  time before, she read of a woman who shot the man that had deceived her, and
                  killed herself afterward. Such sins women were guilty of sometimes. But a crime
                  that could lead to arrest, a trial, imprisonment! No, it was not possible.
               She had seen the Tombs once; a party of country friends had persuaded her to go
                  there with them. She saw all its dreary horrors anew at this moment—the dark
                  corridors, the narrow whitewashed cells; she scented even the indescribably
                  loathsome prison odor; and worse than all, the women's faces looking out at her
                  from between the bars—the dreadful, dreadful faces! Now she was akin to them. It
                  grew too horrible; she buried her face in the cushions of her chair, and sobbed
                  and shook in an hysterical spasm which made her almost believe that she was
                  dying.
               When that was over, other thoughts came; she began trying to cheat herself, to lie
                  to herself. She had not meant to commit a crime; it was not one in reality. Before
                  the three months were over she could return the money; that long-delayed sale of
                  her Virginia lands might any day be concluded; she should be a rich woman then.
                  There would be the dividends from those railway stocks; and she had property to
                  sell—oh, a hundred things, with a little time—she was not ruined. Oh, she was sick
                  of it—the hollow life, the foolish whirl! It would not have been worth even the
                  time she had lost upon it. Just to be petted, and flattered, and wondered at; and
                  there was no one she cared about, after all. Where were her friends? Women hated
                  her, in spite of their smiles. There was John Worthington—yes, he had been her
                  friend; and he was the very man against whom she had sinned.
               But it was not a crime! If be could only have known the strait she was in, he
                  would have helped her; only she could not tell him. She could more easily have
                  died than meet his look of reproval and contempt. She tried to think how she could
                  have wasted so much money; and one extravagance after another came before her mind
                  to reproach her. The parties she had given, the unheard-of expense and luxury—oh,
                  she could not think about it; she would not. Every thing should be right again;
                  she would take up the note, and no one need ever know. She must not think of it in
                  that light, or she should go mad. She must not think about it at all; she must put
                  it aside like a horrid dream. And just as she had reached the refuge of her
                  chamber, and was looking in silent dismay at the haggard face which stared at her
                  in return from the mirror, they came to tell her that Constance Worthington was
                  below.
               She, of all persons! The very name made her heart stop beating. She was afraid of
                  falling on the floor, or doing something unheard of and ridiculous, before the
                  servant could get out of the room. Then she remembered how necessary it was that
                  there should be no change in her manner. She must see the pretty girl often, as
                  had been her habit—see John Worthington, and learn to hide her remorse while
                  listening to his friendly words. Oh, existence had been hard enough upon her, but nothing like
                  this!
               "When they obliged me to give up Kenneth, I believed I should die," was her
                  thought. "During that short season of my married life, I fretted and moaned, and
                  it seemed very dreary; and these past weeks—but now— Oh, there was nothing so bad
                  as this!"
               She wrung her hands, she beat her face, she did a variety of insane things, at
                  which we laugh in romances and call stage effects; yet sometimes, in each of our
                  lives, we have, perhaps, committed the same insanities when trouble met us and
                  drove our poor wits before it. At last she got her senses back; bathed her face,
                  and looked to see that the puffs of her hair were properly arranged; wet her eyes
                  with soothing liquids, to do away the redness left by her tears, and rubbed her
                  face with numerous other things, hoping to hide the traces of emotion. By this
                  time she was herself again. She rang for Pauline, and made a lovely carriage
                  toilet; for she meant to take Constance out-of-doors; there would be a certain
                  relief in escaping from the house. She was ready, at length, to go down and behave
                  decorously, and utter her polite falsehoods, as one must, whatever crisis may wait
                  beyond. Constance found her more bewitching to-day than ever, and was herself as
                  pleasant and cheerful as possible.
               She meant to be agreeable, even when speaking of her uncle, she said. "He is busy
                  over the Gordon case—the forged will, you remember."
               Alice had reason to rejoice that, trusting to the shelter of her veil, she had
                  touched her pale lips with a little red for the second time in her life.
               "The—what?"
               "The will case they were talking of last night—oh, it was after dinner. Well, you
                  must have read about it; uncle is on the nephew's side; he thinks there is no
                  doubt of Jordan's guilt."
               "No doubt—oh! And your uncle is against him? And he'll go to prison for years and
                  years?"
               "Oh, don't pity him!" cried Miss Constance, with the fierce decision of youth that
                  has never suffered or been tempted. "Such a wicked man, to cheat that poor brother
                  and sister!"
               Alice felt as if she must scream, or throw herself under the carriage wheels, or
                  do any thing to get beyond the sound of that young voice.
               "Uncle says that crimes of the sort seem to increase of late; and then he scolds
                  about the wicked extravagance of the age, and—"
               A sudden fright that the horses took at the instant fortunately so distracted
                  Constance's attention that she never remembered to finish her sentence, and did
                  not notice Mrs. Marchmont's face. A huge van, piled with furniture, dashed across
                  the street, appearing so unexpectedly close to the animals' heads that they forgot
                  their customary good behavior, and bounded into the air in a way that would have
                  been becoming enough in a pair of unicorns, but was not a satisfactory performance
                  on the part of two well-trained carriage steeds. Constance was not strong-minded,
                  and uttered a little cry of terror, catching her companion's arm; but Mrs.
                  Marchmont did not stir, or attempt to re-assure her. The disturbance only lasted a
                  moment: she was conscious of wishing that it might end in death.
               "Oh, weren't you frightened?" cried the girl, as John succeeded in soothing the
                  horses so that they decided to forsake their statuesque attitudes, and plant their
                  fore-feet on the ground; "I am sure you were; you look pale."
               "Oh, frightened out of my senses," returned she. "Let me see—what was I going to
                  tell you when those wretched animals began doing circus? Oh, I know! I'll not be
                  cheated out of my witticism."
               She took the conversation into her own hands, and sparkled so bravely that
                  Constance laughed until Mrs. Marchmont marveled if the time had ever been when
                  she, too, could laugh like that.
               "I want you and your uncle to go with me to the opera to-night," she said. "You
                  may tell him that he promised last evening."
               "No, I'll not tell him that; for he hates fibs, even in fun," said Constance; then
                  began to look remorseful, for fear her speech was rude.
               But Mrs. Marchmont patted her hand re-assuringly, as she said, "A lawyer with a
                  tender conscience—what an anomaly!" Then she wondered to herself if she would be
                  different had there been any body in her girlish days to reprove her kindly, as
                  this good man did his niece, and added, "He is right, Constance! And women do lie
                  so—don't let yourself get the habit; besides, it does no good. Where was I? Oh,
                  you are to go and have supper at my house after, with such available spirits as we
                  chance to lay hands on."
               "That will be delightful! Uncle always says that your impromptu suppers are
                  enchanting."
               "Then he shall be enchanted," said Mrs. Marchmont.
               It was not that she wanted them, or any body, near her; but somehow she should
                  have a sensation of safety to-night, if she could only bring John Worthington
                  within the spell of her smiles. Would she ever feel safe in any other way during
                  this season of suspense which must ensue? Three months to pass before the money
                  need be returned—this was the manner in which she phrased it in her thoughts—and
                  her only hope was that at the expiration of half the period she should have it in
                  her power to retrieve her sin.
               Retrieve her sin: could she ever do that?
               Thus she went thinking again! Was she never to get her mind away from the dreadful
                  subject?
               "I'll tell you what we will do, Constance," she said, suddenly. "I have owed Mrs.
                  Remsen sen a visit for an age: we'll drive there, and ask her to let your pretty
                  little friend, Milly, join us to-night: we don't care about the elder lady, but
                  Milly is very nice—next to you the nicest girl I know."
               "Oh, she is lovely!" cried Constance. "She will be delighted; for she admires you
                  so much."
               "Very well; then we will go and ask her. But your uncle must come; I will take no
                  refusal, remember."
               The more she thought, the more anxious she grew. It seemed of vital importance
                  that she should have John Worthington in her sight during these first hours of
                  unfamiliarity with her present self.
               "He will be sure to come," Constance said. "You can depend on him. For that
                  matter, he never refuses your invitations, though he hardly ever finds time to go
                  anywhere else, unless as a kindness to me."
               "Yes, he is always kind," Mrs. Marchmont said, slowly.
               "But he likes to go to you, and he is always delighted when you come to our
                  house," continued thoughtless Constance. "He is never so particular about every
                  trifle as then, and he talks about it for days afterward."
               It was odd that these unconscious revelations, by no means uncommon on the girl's
                  part, never helped Alice Marchmont toward a perception of the man's secret, quick
                  as she usually was to perceive her full power over those about her. But John
                  Worthington had always held a place in her mind quite apart from other people:
                  that he could possibly care for her other than in a friendly, elder-brother spirit
                  had never entered her mind. Now, Constance's artless words only filled her with
                  fresh horror, as she remembered how unworthy she had proved of this friend's
                  confidence—how basely she had repaid his trust. The recollection of his unvarying
                  goodness was too keen a torture, in these first hours of remorse: she must get
                  away from it—away from the solitary companionship of this happy creature.
               She gave the order to drive to Mrs. Remsen's house—a commodious dwelling in a
                  fashionable quarter of the town. Though not rich, Mrs. Remsen never did things by
                  halves, nor committed blunders. When she had a young lady to present in society
                  she allowed no neglect of appearances to interfere with success.
               She was at home this morning, and more flattered by Alice Marchmont's visit than
                  she would have cared to acknowledge. Milly was in the room, and Hortense
                  Maynard—the second daughter—chanced to be honoring her mother and cousin by a
                  half-hour's utterance of wisdom and philosophy.
               "This is as unexpected as June weather in midwinter," Mrs. Remsen said, as she
                  came forward to meet her guests; and she had a very nice manner of doing and
                  saying things, though she was liable to attacks of overdignity.
               "Now that sounds a little like a reproach, pretty as it is," returned Mrs.
                  Marchmont, prepared to try as hard for the general approbation as if there had
                  been a man present. People always said that she flirted as desperately with women
                  as she did with the opposite sex. "But if you could know how busy I am, you would
                  not wonder at my finding little leisure for morning visits. I hope you are quite
                  well, Mrs. Maynard; I've not forgiven you for not coming to my last party! Ah,
                  small Miss Rosebud, I needn't ask how you are. Where on earth does she find such
                  color, Mrs. Remsen? Bless me, child, you needn't make yourself prettier by
                  blushing like that!"
               "I have wanted to see you and offer my excuse," Hortense Maynard said, in her
                  voluble fashion. "I always hate to miss your evenings, but I was engaged every
                  night that week. I had three lectures, a meeting at Professor Drivler's, the new
                  somnambulist, the society for the universal language, the—"
               "And you are still alive!" said Mrs. Marchmont, in a wondering voice, that
                  convulsed the two young girls with silent laughter.
               "I shall live, I trust, while I have a duty still left unperformed," replied
                  Hortense; and there was something piquant,
                  absurd as it was, in the contrast between her pretty face, elegant dress, and the
                  sort of conversation in which she indulged. "Dear Mrs. Marchmont, I want to
                  interest you in the new hospital."
               "I can't be interested, but I'll give all I can."
               "Now, Hortense," cried her mother, "I'll not have you make a trap of my
                  drawing-room to catch people in and frighten them out of their money."
               "Mamma can't understand," sighed Hortense, resignedly; "Adelaide can't—oven Milly
                  does not really, though she is better than the others."
               "Thanks," laughed Milly.
               "What I want you to do, Mrs. Marchmont, is to take an actual, personal interest in
                  these things; it would do you good, ennoble your life, lend a fresh enjoyment to
                  existence—"
               "Hortense, do you know what you are saying?" interrupted her mother.
               "I am obliged to come to this house to have that question asked," said Hortense,
                  addressing Mrs. Marchmont, with sad patience. "Do I know what I am saying? And
                  only last night Professor Drivler said that the expression of my ideas was
                  something so precise and exact that each sentence was ready to stand in a book as
                  I uttered it."
               "But you know we poor ordinary women have so few ideas," said Alice; "and mine, at
                  least, are always in a sad jumble. It's of no use, Mrs. Maynard; we have each our
                  mission, and must fulfill it."
               "And yours is to be charming," said Mrs. Remsen, with a severe glance at her
                  daughter.
               "That's very nice. But, indeed, I reproach myself for not doing a host of things;
                  but, besides the society work, I have a good deal outside side. You know I am a solitary female, and must
                  attend to my own business; Mrs. Maynard is spared such worries."
               Hortense shook her head, and looked unutterable things. It really was useless to
                  waste her wisdom; these butterflies would not be lifted out of their frivolous
                  ways either by persuasion or example. At the same time she was wondering if Mrs.
                  Marchmont's elegant costume was from Worth, and what it cost.
               "I came partly to beg a favor of you, Mrs. Remsen," Alice said, taking advantage
                  of Hortense's momentary silence.
               "It is granted in advance, I assure you."
               "I want to beg your Rosebud for the evening. Miss Constance and her uncle are
                  going with me to the opera, and home to supper afterward; they will call for your
                  niece, and bring her back."
               "Milly will be delighted, I am sure," said Mrs. Remsen, secretly flattered by this
                  attention on the courted woman's part, though only the day before she had told an
                  intimate friend that she did not and could not approve of the way in which Alice
                  Marchmont "went on"—that vague term of condemnation so much in vogue with
                  women.
               "And it's the first night of 'Favorita,' and I never saw it but twice!" cried
                  Milly, ecstatically. "Oh, Mrs. Marchmont, how good of you to think of me!"
               "How good of you to like to go with me, you mean!" said Alice. "Mrs. Remsen,
                  you'll not be afraid to trust her? Mr. Worthington's presence will be a surety
                  that I shall have none of my ineligibles about."
               Mrs. Remsen agitated herself with protestations and assurances that no
                  guardianship for her niece could be more acceptable than that of the lady whom she
                  addressed; and Alice smiled graciously, and thanked her, and said sweet things in
                  return, perfectly well aware of every word of censure the speaker had ever uttered
                  in regard to her.
               "I wish you could be persuaded to come to one of the meetings of the Earnest
                  Workers for Japan, Mrs. Marchmont," said Hortense, dashing into the conversation
                  again. "The other night we had a speech from a real Japanese. It was so
                  interesting."
               "Highly lacquered, I suppose," said Alice; but Mrs. Maynard was too busy talking
                  to notice.
               "Just now I am greatly occupied with the society for the promotion of a universal
                  language," she continued. "When one thinks of the benefit to civilization; when
                  one reflects upon the countless myriads in heathen lands talking an
                  incomprehensible jargon, which renders it impossible for the sun of knowledge to
                  illuminate their darkness—"
               She held up her hands to express the weakness of words where such reflections were
                  concerned, and added, in the same voice as before,
               "You have every thing over from Paris, don't you?"
               "Usually; I find it cheaper in the end, and so much less trouble."
               Mrs. Remsen plunged eagerly into chiffons, in
                  the hope of getting Hortense off the pedestal which she had mounted; and indeed
                  the wise lady showed as much excitement in the discussion as if she had been the
                  weakest of her sex.
               At length Mrs. Marchmont rose to go. Much as all the idle talk wearied and
                  irritated her, it had helped another half-hour to pass; she was, at least, a
                  little nearer the end of this dismal day. It seemed so strange to be sitting there
                  among innocent women, talking of the petty affairs which interested them, with
                  this new ban which separated her life from theirs rising before her mind. Often,
                  in reading novels, she had wondered how people felt when some secret crime haunted
                  their thoughts, and they were obliged to go calmly through the details of
                  existence, repressing every evidence of care. And now she knew; she was like
                  them—an outcast—a criminal! She thought this while taking her part in the
                  conversation, while the idle talk went on, and the laughter of the two girls rang
                  in her ear; they laughed so easily, the joyous creatures!
               "You will come and see me soon, Mrs. Remsen?" she said, rising. "And don't give up
                  my next evening in favor of the Japanese, Mrs. Maynard, else I shall throw my
                  influence in the opposite scale, and vote for leaving them heathens."
               "My life has so little leisure for the amusements of society," sighed Hortense.
                  "Sometimes I wonder myself how I get through all I have to do."
               "Weren't you at Mrs. Morford's dance last night?" asked her mother, rather given
                  to pulling her off her pedestal.
               "Yes; she fairly insisted; but my mind was far away," returned Hortense, with
                  unshaken dignity.
               "One can dance very well without it," said Alice. "So next time send your mind to
                  do duty among the Workers for Japan, and let me have your bodily presence. Come,
                  Constance, we are making an unconscionable visit."
               So she went away, left Constance at her own door, and drove on home, sitting face
                  to face with the terrible secret which had usurped the place of the skeleton, and
                  was a more awful sentinel still.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               UNDER THE YOKE.
               LOOKING across the "glittering horseshoe." Mrs. Marchmont saw Dick Faulkner in his
                  wife's box, nearly opposite; and when she remembered that the time had gone by for
                  her to shiver at the sight of him, her excitable nature found its first feeling of
                  relief since her solitary communion of the morning. She was glad, horribly glad;
                  she had been right to free herself from him. She would never think about the
                  matter again; and the sensation of rest and security grew stronger as she turned
                  and met John Worthington's smile.
               "It was very good of you to give up two nights in succession to folly and
                  idleness," she said.
               "I have got in the way of yielding to your caprices," he replied. "Now, Constance,
                  I could have put off easily enough; but when she said that you wanted me, I
                  resigned myself at once."
               "You knew that I would be capable of coming to capture you?"
               "Quite; even the sight of my law-books would not have driven you away. You lack
                  reverence."
               "And you have humored my caprices so long!"
               "For which I ought to be ashamed. Every body spoils you, but I don't wish to help,
                  I assure you."
               "Your conscience may be at ease; at least you have done your duty in the way of
                  reproval. You are the only person who has ever ventured to scold me; admit that I
                  always listen patiently."
               John Worthington was forty, and one of the most famous lawyers of the day; but
                  such geese are men up to the last, that I think to hear this queen of society make
                  such acknowledgments was pleasanter in his ears than the loudest plaudits he had
                  ever received in a courtroom.
               They were seated at one side of the box, quite by themselves; Miss Portman, as
                  usual, was conscientiously following the scene, libretto in hand, and resigning
                  herself to the invariable headache produced by the crash of the instruments; the
                  two girls were holding a whispered conversation about some trifle which they
                  considered of vast moment; and none of Mrs. Marchmont's satellites had as yet
                  appeared upon the horizon; so the friends were able to converse
                  unrestrainedly.
               "I scold you," Worthington went on, "because I really think you have a little mind
                  and soul at the bottom of your nonsense and waywardness."
               "Your gallantry is overpowering! But had you finished?"
               "No; you interrupted me, as usual."
               "Then don't make periods in your voice till your sentence is finished. What comes
                  after waywardness?"
               "And most women have neither mind nor soul, I meant to say."
               "Such a stale libel—such an old, worn-out charge! But after all, I am no better
                  than the rest."
               "I should think not, indeed! I hold you worse, a great deal."
               She gave him an odd, frightened glance.
               "Now I don't know what you mean."
               "Because they are not accountable beings—a set of dolls—while you, pushed to
                  extremities, could show character enough of some sort."
               The talk was drifting in the direction of all others most terrifying to her; but
                  she could not resist an impulse to continue it.
               "Upon my word, Mr. Worthington, one would suppose you thought me capable of
                  murder."
               "Under certain circumstances, possibly," he replied, coolly. "The truth is, Alice,
                  you have more brains than heart—"
               "Now I take that as a compliment!"
               "Because your heart has never had fair play; at the same time, you are as
                  impulsive and irrational as a child."
               "Always remember that!" she exclaimed, with a feverish earnestness under the
                  laughter in her voice. "Promise me always to think it!"
               "I can safely do so."
               "And would, even if I committed the murder?"
               He grew suddenly grave; her reckless words jarred upon him somewhat.
               "Don't talk in such extremes," he said.
               She laughed, gave him one of her quick, bewildering glances, and added,
               "You will always like me? I need not feel afraid of losing you?"
               I think I have said somewhere that for years John Worthington had guarded a
                  certain secret, and it was one which he meant never to betray. He believed that it
                  would be only folly to break the silence so long preserved; to do it might even
                  bring to an end the pleasant, intimate intercourse that brightened his life in a
                  way of which no one dreamed. But the desire to speak rose powerfully in his soul
                  as she asked that question; it was quickly repressed, however, and he said,
               "It is too late to try making you afraid. But see, the girls have ended their
                  talk, and Constance is looking reproachfully at us for not paying any attention to
                  her favorite duet."
               "Ah yes, it is all new to them both," sighed Mrs. Marchmont. "Only think of being
                  still in one's first season!"
               She could not keep quiet; she wanted to talk, and drown the tones of the thrilling
                  music which wakened strange echoes in her soul.
               "I hope I frightened you the other night when I fainted," she said.
               "Indeed you did."
               "I am so glad; that was what I wanted."
               "I suppose you fainted on purpose?"
               "Of course—just to make a scene. I had done every thing else that evening to
                  astonish you; so I tried that. Was it effective—did I do it well? You caught me, I
                  believe—gallant man! But you couldn't call me a heavyweight."
               "Now take breath and begin again," he said, rather grimly, disturbed by the
                  recollection of her singular manner and illness.
               "Thank you—no, I'll not speak at all; you may listen to the music."
               "That is your gratitude, I conclude, for my caring whether you are ill or well,
                  alive or dead!"
               
               "Oh, I am grateful; I make you my best courtesy, metaphorically. Laura Keene was
                  the only woman I ever saw who could courtesy like an angel and not step on her
                  train. I declare, if I was Madame Rothschild, or the Princess Marguerite, or
                  somebody who could afford it, I would give her a fortune if she could teach me to
                  act off the stage half as naturally as she does on."
               "I never thought you could be improved."
               "In the way of acting?"
               "Of acting, certainly."
               "But do you know, Mr. Worthington, I am very weary of it! I am glad Lent is near.
                  I wish it was time to go into the country. I want to get away. I don't believe
                  I'll come back into the world any more."
               "You are not well yet; don't let me be so unpardonably rude as to remind you of
                  the old proverb."
               "I would not prevent your being rude for the world;" and she laughed heartily.
                  "'When the demon was ill,' et cetera. I read once in a book on good-breeding and
                  morals that it was unlady-like to say devil."
               But her face had grown too haggard and worn for her fun to be agreeable to the
                  man.
               "Are you sure that you are quite well yet?" he asked.
               "As well as I shall ever be."
               "What do you mean?" he asked, anxiously. "There is not really any thing serious
                  the matter? You are not hiding some illness from—from your friends?"
               She looked at him in surprise for an instant, and the tears rose in her eyes.
               "I believe you would actually care!" she said, wonderingly.
               "Care?" he repeated; and words which he did not choose to utter started to his
                  lips.
               "I didn't know there was any body left who would think twice about it," she said.
                  "No, there is nothing the matter—unless my mind has a crook in it; but I think it
                  always had."
               "And something has been troubling your mind; of that I am sure."
               If she could tell him! The insane thought presented itself—if she could reveal,
                  word for word, what she had done!
               "I was thinking, after you went away last night, that I ought to have told you, if
                  there was any thing I could do, you had only to speak; but I think you know
                  that."
               "You would do it?"
               "Yes," he said, very quietly; "if it were to go against my creed, my principles—no
                  matter what—I should do it, if necessary."
               Great Heaven, and she had doubted this man's friendship—had preferred guilt to
                  trusting him!
               "Dear friend," she said, "I need no help. I beg you to believe that. I am in no
                  difficulty, except the one that troubles most people—the inability to get away
                  from myself."
               "You would tell me?"
               "I think so—if you could help me. Mr. Worthington, I believe I never understood
                  you before; I wish—"
               "What, Alice?"
               "That was not what I meant to say. We have been on familiar terms from habit;
                  after all, we have seen little of each other's real selves."
               It was so difficult to keep back what he would fain have said, that any made words
                  sounded poor and weak.
               "I mean what I say. I am your friend; I shall always be. It is not only that I
                  admire you more than any woman I ever saw—pshaw, I needn't be stagy!"
               If he had only spoken like this last night! Yet no; she knew that her lips would
                  have remained sealed. The more he showed his fondness, his admiration, his faith,
                  the less possibility there would have been of destroying them by her avowal.
               "No, no," she replied, hastily; "we'll not indulge in a scene. Hereafter, I don't
                  mean to have bothers of any sort. I want to try and be less frivolous and
                  absurd."
               "You have never been either the one or the other."
               "Such an empty, aimless life, with no thought beyond the little worthless success
                  of an hour."
               "I don't agree with you, nor with all the things wise people say and write about
                  such matters. I don't consider it a poor ambition for a woman to make herself a
                  leader in her world—a power in society."
               "It isn't worth the trouble one takes."
               "It isn't worth rushing into such follies as women do," he said—"extravagance,
                  debt, and that kind of thing."
               "My days of extravagance end with this season," she replied. "My debts I mean to
                  pay; so I'll not take your axioms to myself."
               "I should be sorry to think you had any real cause."
               "Don't you ever be sorry for me in any way, Mr. Worthington! I'll not tell you all
                  my frivolity. I'll not confess my sins to you, because I can't live without the
                  respect of the few whom I really esteem; but don't be sorry."
               "And don't you use such strong words."
               She laughed—if he could know the truth!
               "I was speaking as if you were my conscience," she said; "I always try to coax
                  that."
               "Not if there were real reason why it should condemn you; then you would never
                  try. I should pity you very much if there had been any possibility in your life of
                  meeting—as so many unfortunates do—a place where to go wrong was easy, and the
                  right so hard that you yielded."
               "You think I would suffer?"
               "Suffer! You would make each day an eternity of torture! You have great
                  capabilities for suffering in that high-strung nature of yours; don't ever give
                  them an opportunity to have the upper hand."
               "But no troubles come to women except through their hearts; and I have none, you
                  know."
               "I suppose you had once."
               "I can't tell—only a flirting machine, I think. But do you know that is more like
                  the real thing than people imagine? It can ache, and be in earnest, and simulate
                  all sorts of feelings."
               "You must be somewhat tired of that?"
               "So tired! I tell you, I'd like to be a shepherdess and tend sheep. Heigh-ho! I
                  wish I was in the forest of Ardennes."
               "And very miserable you would be in a week."
               "I suppose so, unless I found such a satirical old Jaques as you are somewhere
                  about."
               "You'll marry—"
               "So people have said for quite a number of years! No, Mr. Worthington, I would not
                  let a good man marry me—a bad one I would not take."
               "What do you mean by saying that you would not let a good man marry you?" he
                  asked.
               "Because I am not worth such a man's love. There, I'm not acting—it is the honest
                  truth."
               He turned and faced her.
               "What will you say when Kenneth Halford asks you to marry him?"
               "I never shall be obliged to say any thing, for he'll not ask me."
               "I thought he had been in love with you once."
               "Nonsense: I have arranged his destiny in my own mind;" and she glanced toward
                  Milly, who was eagerly watching the stage.
               "Indeed! And what shall you say?"
               "Congratulate them."
               "And what shall you think?"
               "Mr. Worthington, nothing could induce me to marry Kenneth Halford, if he wanted
                  me; and he does not. He will worship an ideal all his life, and moan because no
                  woman fulfills it."
               "Oh, if he wants an angel, he must go where most people won't go in a hurry; and I
                  don't know that he deserves so much better than his neighbors."
               She noticed the tone of relief in which he spoke, but did not attach any
                  particular meaning to it; for not the slightest perception of his real sentiments
                  had ever reached her, keen-sighted as she usually was to discover when a man's
                  heart or fancy was touched.
               "Now we have settled every thing," she said. "Just in time, too; for here come
                  some tiresome men. Ah me!"
               There was no further opportunity for uninterrupted conversation; the curtain had
                  fallen, and there was a constant succession of dandies fluttering in and out of
                  the loge. Mrs. Marchmont called the girls to her
                  side, and found a pleasure in making them talk, looking at them the while with a
                  sharp pang of regret rather than envy. John Worthington leaned back in his seat,
                  and allowed the stream of idle chat to flow on, without discomfiting any body by
                  sharp, quizzical speeches, such as he sometimes permitted himself, and which were
                  not easily parried by people in general.
               So the evening wore on, and Mrs. Marchmont made the two or three additions
                  necessary to fill up her supper-table. They were all for the benefit of the young
                  ladies, however, as she intended to keep herself free to engross Mr.
                  Worthington.
               Dick Faulkner irritated his wife by his persistent staring at the opposite box,
                  and the pair managed to get up one of their fierce quarrels before the opera was
                  half over. Faulkner did not venture to intrude into the loge; for he knew that if he did Mrs. Marchmont would make him
                  repent severely; and he cursed her anew at the thought, as he had done many times
                  since the morning. And Alice, reading his discomfiture in his face, knowing that
                  he dared not come, exulted from the bottom of her heart, and again, in her delight
                  at feeling once more free from the nightmare of his influence, almost forgot the
                  price which she had paid for this liberty. Under the circumstances, Dick could do
                  nothing but abuse his wife; and he made her suffer not only on her own account,
                  but vicariously for Alice Marchmont's contempt. However, she was quite able to
                  take her own part, and the presence of other people did not in the least interfere
                  with the energy of the matrimonial battle.
               At length Kenneth Halford came and paid his salutations, after a long season of
                  furtive watching of the two—the elegant woman and the rose-bud of a girl by her
                  side. At first Mrs. Marchmont was gratified by the complete ignoring, in word or
                  manner, of any remembrance of their conversation of yesterday; but suddenly there
                  rose in her mind the recollection of what had happened since—the memory of the
                  past night's work—and her mood changed. It was utterly unreasonable and unfounded,
                  and she knew it, but she was ready to blame him in a measure for what she had
                  done. If he had been true to his early dream—if he had ever really loved her—he
                  might have saved her in those closing hours. And now where did she stand? What had
                  she become?
               She was ready to spring from her chair and rush out of the box, as the dreadful
                  answer hissed through her soul. Then she reproached herself for being so miserable
                  and weak a fool that she was not able to bear quietly even the first hours of
                  acquaintance with her sin. She must conquer this absurdity, at any rate; she could
                  not take to making a high tragedy of herself, and discomposing people by sudden
                  starts and suppressed moans at any chance word which touched her secret, or each
                  pang of remorse that stung her.
               She consoled herself by saying several intensely disagreeable things to Halford,
                  as most women—or men, for that matter—would have found a consolation in doing. He
                  looked, not hurt, but as if he were pitying her; and then she fell in a hot rage. Of all the old passion, the
                  old love, there was only this sentiment left—pity! It was more than she could
                  endure, just then, and she as nearly turned her back on him as was lady-like.
               He went and leaned over Milly's chair, and she was frankly glad to see him, and
                  talked in her girlish way, though not after the fashion of ordinary girls; and
                  once more Halford thought what a rest and quiet her society gave. Mrs. Marchmont
                  saw it; if he had put his feelings into words for her benefit, she could not have
                  understood them more clearly; and to-night, in her new mood, she did not approve.
                  She had of her own accord sent him away—had herself pointed out Milly as capable
                  of offering the love which he craved and needed, and had felt willing to aid them
                  both, instead of trying to bewilder his fancy by her own smiles and arts.
               She had thought so, and, remembering who and what she was, had sent him away
                  hurriedly, frightened at the bare idea of loving and being loved. But to-night she
                  was not pleased when she saw him bending over the girl and talking, with such a
                  quiet, rested look on his countenance. Her heart was very bitter and sad; she
                  wanted to be truly loved. She had scores of adorers, and adulation enough lavished
                  upon her to satisfy a dozen women; but she had never been loved but once, and then
                  it had not been her present self, but the girl she used to be, and of whom she had
                  thought for years with such regretful pity; and it was Kenneth Halford who had
                  loved her.
               She felt a sudden rage at Milly's youth and Milly's face, with its beautiful
                  promise of development when her heart should be fully awake, and her mind in the
                  maturity of womanhood. She called Kenneth Halford to her; she could not sit there
                  just then, with others, and see him placid and content in Milly's presence, while
                  she had such an ache at her heart and such a troop of confused and conflicting
                  thoughts in her mind. Not aching for love of him, this heart. Let me see if I can
                  make plain the feeling by which she was possessed. Alice knew that the woman she
                  had become was a world away from Kenneth Halford; she could not have dared let him
                  approach nearer; but she pitied the girl that she once was—the girl they had
                  sacrificed so remorselessly to their Moloch, the world—and she could not hear to
                  see him bending over this other young creature, as if able to forget every past
                  dream or suffering in that calm presence.
               Mrs. Marchmont called him to her, and sent the dandies over to Milly, for which
                  neither she nor they were thankful. John Worthington had left the box to speak
                  with some friend; so Alice had an opportunity to talk with Kenneth Halford. But,
                  in spite of her efforts, she felt impelled to say the precise things which she
                  knew would annoy him, and so hurt herself, by reading disapproval in his eyes. In
                  a few moments, however, as other people came and went, she allowed him to pass
                  from her, and paid him no further attention. Indeed, when he took his leave, she
                  was so much occupied in listening to some man's nonsense that she could scarcely
                  accord him a parting smile. Her first intention had been to ask him to accompany
                  them home, but she had not done so, and she was not too much engrossed to notice
                  Milly's look of disappointment as he was allowed to go away. Mrs. Marchmont
                  noticed it, and for an instant almost hated the girl. Then a feeling of regret
                  crossed her mind—of shame, too, for her own pettiness.
               She called herself hard names, and would have made any atonement to Milly, even to
                  uniting her and Halford, whether they desired it or not, and attempting any number
                  of sacrifices and expiations for her own part. Indeed, she sent in search of him;
                  he should come to supper; pretty little Milly should be gratified. But her good
                  resolutions awoke too late; Halford was not to be found by her messenger, having
                  gone straight out of the house on leaving her box.
               Before long the curtain fell on the last act; the two girls had wished to see the
                  closing scene, and they were gratified. Passing through the lobby on John
                  Worthington's arm, Mrs. Marchmont encountered Dick Faulkner, so close that her
                  white mantle brushed him as she passed. She had to how and smile, shivering
                  inwardly because so much as the folds of her garments had touched him, loathing
                  the sight of the handsome face, whose wickedness was so plain to her now under its
                  smiles, and shuddering again as she remembered how hopeless her fate were it
                  possible that she should ever be put a second time in his power.
               "I do so cordially abhor that man," Worthington said, as they moved on, regardless
                  whether or not his words were audible. "I can not understand how it is that decent
                  people tolerate him."
               "I'll not have you abhor any body just now," she answered; for it gave her a
                  sensation of fear to listen to his words. "I want you to be agreeable; the man is
                  nothing to you or me."
               "Thank Heaven for that!" he said.
               In the depths of her heart Mrs. Marchmont fervently repeated the thanksgiving. She
                  was free—at least she was free! She cast one glance back through the crowd; Dick
                  Faulkner was leaning against a projection of the wall, and looking after her with
                  an expression which made her shiver afresh, till Mr. Worthington asked if she were
                  cold, thereby bringing her down to the necessities of the moment.
               The supper was very gay and pleasant; even Miss Portman warmed so much under the
                  wit and merriment, or the Champagne which Worthington persuaded her to drink, that
                  she positively laughed aloud, changed her position three times, and twice
                  volunteered a remark, so astonishing those who knew her best by this unprecedented
                  display of animation that they absolutely forgot to answer. Constance and Milly
                  found the evening delightful, though the latter had leisure to miss Halford; yet
                  at the same time she was glad—not attempting to account for the feeling—that he
                  and Mrs. Marchmont were not on such intimate terms as she had at first fancied,
                  for Alice had said.
               "I only ask my very, very special friends on occasions like these; so you see I
                  have adopted you into my heart, Miss Milly."
               She was in a charming mood, which lasted almost up to the time that they were
                  ready to leave the table; then something Worthington said, some chance words which
                  struck close upon her secret, gave her again the desire to escape—to get away from
                  every one of these familiar faces—above all, from the man whose friendship she had
                  returned by such awful treachery.
               "You will have an opportunity to find out whether you miss me," she said,
                  suddenly, addressing him, but speaking aloud.
               "Do you mean to go into retreat for Lent?" he asked.
               "The next thing to it—I am going to Washington."
               "Now please to explain this freak," said he, while the other men uttered
                  exclamations of horror, and Miss Portman turned into a statue of astonishment at
                  once.
               "No freak whatever," replied she, as decidedly as if the idea had been a long time
                  in her mind, instead of having just entered it, born of her sudden dread of the
                  constant dissimulation needed in his presence. "I have business there, and I must
                  go."
               "Are you going to settle the affairs of the nation?" he asked, smiling.
               "To settle my own, at least," returned she. "I have developed a fine taste for
                  business, I assure you."
               "Now I believe this is as new to you as to the rest of us," said he.
               "She says it to frighten us all," added some man.
               "Not I," she answered. "If I must give reasons, every body knows that I own a
                  tract of land away off somewhere—I don't exactly know where. Is West Virginia near
                  China?"
               "Oh no, my dear! surely you know better," said poor Miss Portman, with a sad
                  earnestness which made every body shriek.
               "Very well; I'll not expose my ignorance by trying to tell where it is," said she.
                  "At all events, I am going—"
               "Not in search of it?" asked Worthington.
               "No; to Washington, because—"
               She stopped again, remembering her fear that Faulkner might learn something of her
                  plans, and attempt to balk them.
               "I intend to delude Congress into making it an independent county for me," she
                  added. "Now this is a profound secret; so all of you rush off and tell it as soon
                  as you can."
               "I've no doubt you'll succeed," said Worthington.
               "I assure you I am perfectly serious—"
               "Have we doubted it?"
               "At least about going. I leave the day after to-morrow."
               "Is this news to you, also, Miss Portman?" asked John Worthington.
               "Oh yes; and so sudden; really, Alice, it is very confusing," groaned the old
                  maid.
               "My dear, you adore Washington; you worship the President, and regard Congress as
                  an immaculate body, that ought to be immortalized in statues of brass."
               "And Congress could easily furnish the material," said Worthington.
               "It is entirely on your account that I am going, Adeliza; so don't be ungrateful,"
                  pursued Alice. "You know you have been sighing all winter for a sight of—well,
                  I'll be merciful, and not give the Senator's name."
               "Oh, my dear!" squeaked Miss Portman, in deep distress.
               "If it is a case of attending to Miss Portman's happiness, there is nothing to be
                  said," observed Worthington.
               "And it is," Alice averred.
               "Oh, my dear!" repeated Miss Portman, on an ascending scale, and looking more like
                  a Chinese mouse than ever.
               "And you really are going?" Worthington asked, as soon as the laughter had again
                  subsided.
               "I really am, and for a long visit," she replied, rising from the table. "Mr.
                  Worthington, set the example of going home. Remember that I am an unprotected
                  widow, and it is past one o'clock. What will my neighbors say of such
                  dissipation?"
               "Going to Washington!" murmured Miss Portman, despairingly—not that she objected
                  to the journey, but any sudden proposal always filled her with confusion and
                  dismay.
               "I am so glad to have had you here this evening," Mrs. Marchmont said to Milly,
                  passing her arm about the girl's waist for an instant, and speaking in a low tone.
                  "You're a dear little thing, and I fancy that I shall grow very fond of you. Be
                  sure to like me."
               "Indeed I do," said Milly; and meant what she said.
               Mrs. Marchmont gazed earnestly, regretfully, in her face for a little; then let
                  her go.
               "I wonder if I was ever like that," she said to herself.
               John Worthington did not catch the words, but he read in her countenance the
                  fancies called up by Milly's youthful happiness, and drew close to Mrs.
                  Marchmont's side.
               "Will you write to me sometimes?" he asked.
               "Yes. Don't I always when I am away?"
               "And if you want me—if there is any thing I can do—only send, and I will come at
                  once."
               She took his hand, dropped it as quickly, and said,
               "Good-bye, every body. Miss Crofton, Mr. Worthington and Constance are to take you
                  safe home."
               She detained them all still for a few last words—gay, laughing to the last. Worthington left the room behind the others.
                  As he reached the threshold she ran forward, seized his hand again, shook it
                  warmly, saying,
               "You promised always to like me; don't forget."
               He turned and looked at her, his grave features stirred into unusual emotion.
               "God bless you!" he said. "Good-bye."
               As the outer doors closed behind her guests, Mrs. Marchmont flew off to her
                  chamber before Miss Portman could utter a syllable. Human companionship was not to
                  be borne an instant longer.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               ELF-LAND PATHS.
               THERE commenced for Milly Crofton a succession of weeks, in the very beginning of
                  which her feet strayed into elf-land, and each day only led her further along the
                  mazes of that enchanted realm. Her dreams heightened the commonest objects and the
                  commonest incidents into absolute beauty and perfection. Never was there such
                  sunlight before as played about her way—never such music as she listened to at
                  balls or opera. Oh, it was the old, old story, but always new, always sweet, and
                  will remain so while this world holds fresh young hearts like hers in the midst of
                  its dreariness.
               Alice Marchmont departed on the day she had named, and the season hurried toward
                  the soberness and quiet of Lent. People seemed determined to crowd all the gayety
                  possible into the short weeks before Ash-Wednesday should usher in its period of
                  penitence and reflection.
               Milly enjoyed the festivities more and more, and wherever she went she met Kenneth
                  Halford; and his presence brought the charm which brought this new brightness over
                  her life. She did not think much in these days; she did not question her
                  heart—indeed had grown terribly shy of herself—but she did know that she seemed
                  lifted above the common earth, and wondered if such sunshine had ever been granted
                  any other mortal.
               Halford was a great deal at the house, and he did not forget Mrs. Remsen's
                  permission in regard to morning walks with Milly. That lady watched the progress
                  of events with the most unconscious air, and never troubled Milly by word or look.
                  She knew the man with whom they had to deal, and was perfectly certain that these
                  attentions to the girl were neither idle nor unmeant. He was not a man to retreat
                  from any position that he had assumed, or amuse himself at the expense of any
                  woman's happiness. So she waited composedly, certain that an agreeable denouement to Milly's pretty romance would come,
                  sooner or later.
               Fortunately, Adelaide Ramsay was absent all this month; otherwise she would
                  certainly have found some means of troubling Milly's peace, as her envious dislike
                  of her cousin had reached a tolerable pitch of hatred in these days of the
                  latter's little triumphs. The old story of the engagement which once existed
                  between Halford and Alice Berners was not generally known among their present
                  acquaintances; so not even a whisper in regard to the past intruded to cast a
                  shadow over Milly's way. It was a season of unalloyed happiness; but she was too
                  young and too undisciplined to know how seldom it is that a long season of
                  uninterrupted contentment is granted to any mortal. No romance or poem ever
                  pictured an idyl half so beautiful as Milly's life during those charmed days,
                  though the details would be slight enough if put into words.
               So the beautiful days floated on, and each successive one lured Milly farther and
                  farther into the Eden from whence a return to the old life became always more
                  impossible. The golden dream must either widen into realization, or, when it
                  faded, leave her wounded and faint upon the bleak rocks of the desolate desert in
                  which so many hearts like hers have wakened after a brief wandering in that
                  fairy-land of youth.
               The pleasant walks, the daily visits, took their course; there were frequent
                  invitations to the opera, with only Aunt Eliza besides themselves in the box, when
                  the music was, in Milly's cars, a joyous pæan that no instruments of mortal
                  invention ever played, the passionate arias and duets thrilling her soul with
                  melodies which no human voice ever expressed; there were evenings at the French
                  theatre, which were hours of such enchantment as no dramatist's eloquence or
                  actor's passion could ever evoke; occasionally quiet hours at home, when no
                  visitors were admitted, and Aunt Eliza read her newspaper, or made a pretense of
                  embroidery, or wrote letters, while Milly sat at the piano and sung old ballads,
                  often interrupted by long, low-voiced conversations, not containing a word which
                  would merit to be set down, but deeply engraven in her heart, as if they held all
                  this world's wisdom in their length.
               So little to tell—a story so old, so worn out; yet I would gladly linger over it;
                  and you who should read, though you might pretend to smile in scorn, would feel
                  your own hearts stirred to their inmost depths—not by my poor words—but by the
                  spell of memory carrying you back to the enchanted realm where each has wandered
                  in his turn. But let the details go; there is no need to picture them; and sneer
                  as we may, not one of us ever grows hard enough or worldly enough to forget, when
                  we watch the progress of a romance like my pretty Milly's.
               "Do you think I am wearing out my welcome?" Halford asked, one day, as he returned
                  to the house with Milly, from an expedition to a private picture gallery.
               Mrs. Remsen had accompanied them; but on leaving the gallery Halford had begged
                  that Milly might be allowed to walk back with him, as she had taken no exercise
                  that day. He had assumed a great deal of responsibility about similar matters so
                  naturally that nobody thought of questioning it.
               "You must ask aunty about that," Milly answered; "she has not hinted to me that
                  she was tired of your visits."
               "So I will; that gives me an excuse for going in," he said. "I was wondering what
                  one I could manage; now I can enter boldly; indeed, it really is my duty to know
                  at once if she is weary of the sight of me."
               It had been four o'clock when Mrs. Remsen left the pair at the entrance of the
                  picture-gallery, and it was somewhat past five, and nearly dark, when they entered
                  the room where she sat. But she did not ask how they had managed to consume a
                  whole hour and more in a walk which a tortoise would have accomplished in less
                  than half the time; nor did she make any remark when, later, some chance words of
                  Milly's revealed the fact of their having come round by Madison Square—to
                  accomplish which feat they must have gone at least a mile out of their way.
               "Mr. Halford has come in on purpose to ask you a question, aunty," said her niece,
                  as the two appeared before the matron, and interrupted a little vision in which
                  she had been indulging as freely as if she had not lived long past the period when
                  such weakness is permissible.
               "What is this important question, Mr. Halford?" she inquired, suavely.
               "But you are not to hesitate just for the sake of politeness, aunty!" cried Milly,
                  before he could explain. "Aunty does sometimes, Mr. Halford. She hates to tell
                  fibs; but she has very stately ideas in regard to civility and hospitality."
               "Now you are throwing out base insinuations," he said, gayly. "You want me to
                  think that, if she denies being tired, it is only because she is too kind to
                  mortify me."
               "Has Milly been hinting that?" asked Mrs. Remsen, entering into the badinage
                  gracefully enough, thinking the while, as she glanced at Kenneth Halford, how much
                  these quiet weeks had changed him. He looked younger, more restful and content;
                  and it was pleasant to her to see it, and then turn to the radiant brightness that
                  grew each day more lovely in Milly's face. "Has she been slandering me, Mr.
                  Halford? But you and I are too old friends for her wicked little tongue to make
                  mischief between us."
               "I did not say a word; it was his own conscience that accused him," Milly averred,
                  in laughing self-defense.
               "What have you done, Mr. Halford, that your inward monitor has become
                  troublesome?" demanded Mrs. Remsen.
               "Upon my word, I am afraid that even in this statement Miss Crofton is not
                  correct," he replied. "My conscience refuses to blame me as it ought—"
               "It must be made of gutta-percha," put in Milly, parenthetically.
               "I only asked her if you were tired of the sight of me. I have bored you so
                  constantly of late that it occurred to me that I might wear out my welcome."
               "I am always glad to see you," she replied. "As a proof, I was meaning, when you
                  came in, to ask you to stay to dinner—a very unceremonious one; for Maud has gone
                  to her sisters; so Milly and I must dine alone, unless you will give us your
                  company."
               "But his conscience!" said Milly, mischievously."
               "I shall reward it by staying," Halford declared. "Thanks, a thousand times, Mrs.
                  Remsen; for I should have been doomed to a solitary dinner at my club."
               "A meal prepared for feminine tastes may not be very tempting, I warn you," she
                  said. "But at least I have always a very tolerable glass of claret to offer my
                  male visitors. Mr. Crittendon brought me a huge case from France."
               "I shall prove the innocence of my taste by hugely enjoying the dinner prepared to
                  suit feminine palates," he answered.
               In truth, Mrs. Remsen was not in the least troubled about the dinner. She had
                  foreseen that Halford would enter the house, and had already instructed the cook
                  as to the changes and additions which were to be made in the repast.
               Milly went away to get rid of her out-door garments. There was to be no dressing,
                  her aunt had said; but she could not resist induing herself in a white cashmere,
                  with a blue over-skirt, which was as becoming a thing as she could have put on;
                  and Aunt Eliza did not remark the change.
               The dinner was a complete success—even to the venison which had been sent by an
                  acquaintance gone to the Adirondacks for a week's winter sport; and the claret was
                  beyond reproach.
               "The chef at the club couldn't equal this,"
                  Halford averred; and Mrs. Remsen did not think it necessary to admit that she
                  neither possessed one of those troublesome French treasures, nor even a cordon bleu, though, indeed, her wonderful old black
                  woman, who had lived with her mother before her, deserved the latter badge if ever
                  a female did.
               The evening was not quite so pleasant as the dinner, because Hortense Maynard was
                  seized with the idea of visiting her parent on the way to some learned reunion;
                  and poor Charley Thorne and a brace of other youths strayed in likewise. But Milly
                  was too happy to feel annoyance at the interruption, and greeted luckless Charley
                  with so much kindness that for an instant he brightened out of the gloom into
                  which he had been thrown by the sight of Halford so comfortably established by the
                  young lady's side.
               These had been troubled weeks to Master Charley, and he really suffered in his
                  little way, since it was to the full extent of his capabilities. I suppose he
                  found it just as hard to bear as people of a different calibre do their miseries.
                  He was a perfect model of the youth of New York; the parting of his back hair was
                  always irreproachable, his neck-tie a marvel, and his trowsers real works of art. He had not much
                  more to say for himself than his species in general; but at least he was free from
                  affectations and vices, and Mrs. Remsen was already precipitating her soul into
                  futurity, and regarding the possibility of Maud, some months later, catching his
                  poor little heart at a rebound.
               "I never see you any more," he began, as soon as he could get near to Milly and
                  make his small moan, Hortense Maynard having unconsciously afforded him the
                  desired opportunity by taking instant possession of Mr. Halford. "I might as well
                  be off in the—the desert of Sahara, or up with those fellows in the
                  Adirondacks."
               "I saw you only night before last, at Mrs. Morrison's concert. If you forget as
                  easily as that, I don't think much of your friendship," returned Milly, cruelly,
                  though she did not mean to be unkind. "And I wonder you did not go up to the
                  Woods. I should think an expedition there in the winter must be delightful."
               Charley went down into the depths of black despair at once. Even Mrs. Maynard was
                  making a grand display of her acquirements and the incessant duties of her life
                  for Halford's benefit; and at last she got upon one of her favorite hobbies—the
                  praiseworthy efforts of a band called "The Earnest Workers for Japan," among whom
                  she ranked as chief; and she did not leave the subject until she had deluded
                  Halford into putting his name on her subscription-book.
               "You are incorrigible, Hortense," said her mother, coming up at the moment. "Don't
                  pay any attention to Japan, Mr. Halford. It is too far off for sympathy."
               "Oh, that is its chief charm," returned he; but Mrs. Maynard was too serious to
                  notice the raillery.
               "I wish you could persuade mamma and Milly to take some interest in the good
                  work," she said. "Now Milly is a nice, dear little thing, but so childish; and
                  mamma only encourages her."
               "I hear you, Hortense," said her mother, laughing. "Say what you like of me, but
                  don't ask for any change in my Milly. Besides, we can afford to be lazy and
                  selfish. You are so determined to do good till people hate you that you leave us
                  no chance."
               "You always turn serious conversation off with a jest, mamma," sighed Hortense. "I
                  have ceased to hope for any impression on you or Milly either."
               "So much the better for us all," returned Mrs. Remsen, gayly. "You will not need
                  to distress yourself, and will leave us to our frivolity in peace."
               Hortense shook her head and lifted her hands—such pretty hands! She was altogether
                  so elegant and fine-ladyish, so totally unlike the received ideas concerning
                  strong-minded women, that Halford could not avoid a smile at the contrast between
                  her appearance and her much-vaunted pursuits.
               "I wonder you don't wear yourself out," he said. "You never give yourself a
                  moment's rest."
               "At least I should exhaust myself in the cause of duty," she replied, with a
                  reproachful glance at her mother.
               "I see the look, Hortense, but I am too thoroughly hardened to be affected," that
                  lady said. She always consoled herself, when Hortense talked stilted trash to any
                  man, by the fact that the creature was pretty enough to make any sort of
                  conversation endurable to masculine ears.
               "You were at Professor Drivler's lecture the other night?" asked Halford.
               "Yes; I would not have missed it for the world. The crowd was frightful, and the
                  heat beyond description; but it was suffering in a good cause. Mamma, my new
                  velvet polonaise was absolutely ruined; the lace was in rags."
               "Now that does touch me," said her mother. "If you must run the risk of
                  suffocation or being trodden to death by a learned mob, you might at least wear
                  something plainer."
               "It was a marvelous effort of genius," pursued Hortense. "I never listened to such
                  fervid eloquence. He spoke for two hours and a half, and it seemed only a few
                  moments."
               "It tires me to think of it," said Mrs. Remsen.
               "I confess to running away," added Halford; "the heat was unendurable."
               "Take care," said Mrs. Remsen. "Hortense will accuse you of encouraging Milly and
                  me in our frivolity."
               "If my efforts everywhere were as useless as they are among my own relations, I
                  should call my life a wasted one indeed," she said, playing with her bracelets,
                  and looking very handsome in her melancholy.
               "Fortunately, your constant exertions are too fully crowned with success for you
                  to become discouraged," Halford said.
               "You are very good; I hope they are not quite thrown away," she replied, with a
                  sweet self-complacency. "I have always wished that mamma had left Milly more to me
                  since my marriage; I am growing a grave old woman—"
               "At twenty-six," interrupted her mother. "Hortense, it's lucky Adelaide does not
                  hear you, and I don't mean to be made out quite as ancient as the Pyramids,
                  either."
               "Age does not count by years," returned Hortense. "But you do fly about so—"
               "Naturally, being a frivolous young thing," again broke in Mrs. Remsen; for her
                  spirits had been unusually high all the evening.
               "I would have taken Milly with me in my studies," pursued Hortense. "At this
                  moment I am deep in Sanskrit—"
               Here there was a general outbreak. Milly gave a little shriek of horror: Charley
                  Thorne groaned; and Halford could not keep from laughter at the idea of poor
                  little Milly doomed to Sanskrit. But Hortense pursued her theme composedly, and
                  Halford drew a pencil and paper per toward him, and made a sketch of Milly trying
                  to study a Sanskrit manuscript, which delighted Mrs. Remsen beyond measure.
               "You have studied the Eastern languages, Mr. Halford?" continued Mrs. Maynard.
                  "You know how delightful the labor is—a positive recreation to a well-disciplined
                  mind."
               "I have battered my head a little against Arabic," he replied; "but I am afraid
                  that my mind is not in a proper state of discipline, for I found it terrible
                  work."
               Milly laughed, and Hortense shook her head again.
               "Why will all men, even wise ones, students like yourself, encourage the frivolity
                  of the women of this age by such remarks!" sighed she.
               "You speak as if you belonged to some other century," said her mother.
               "I feel sometimes as if I did, mamma; at least, I am glad that I find something in
                  this to occupy my powers."
               At this juncture Charley Thorne managed to get near Milly again; and, as Mrs.
                  Remsen had no mind that he should distress the child at present by an untimely
                  disclosure of his passion, she was obliged to leave Halford to Hortense's tender
                  mercies, while she went to protect her niece. The two youths, who had been
                  undergoing a voluntary and embarrassed banishment at the piano ever since Milly
                  deserted it, were called out by the hostess, and she assisted Milly to keep the
                  conversation general among their group. All Charley Thorne could do was to sigh
                  prodigiously, and nibble so recklessly at the fingers of his gloves that Mrs.
                  Remsen longed to tell him he would bring on an attack of indigestion. Milly was
                  really and truly quite unconscious of his deplorable state, and teased him, as she
                  had always been in the habit of doing, until he turned misanthropical, and took
                  refuge in "Owen Meredith." He announced, suddenly, that the Queen of the Serpents
                  was a truthful picture of woman, and only frowned and tried to look as much as
                  possible like Lester Wallack in "The Stranger," when Milly laughed, and his two
                  male friends followed her example.
               "It must be dyspepsia," Milly said; and Charley half rose to his feet, meaning to
                  depart; but the idea of leaving Halford master of the field was more than he could
                  endure, so down he sat again. Even the sight of his gorgeous new shirt-studs, that
                  shook under the tremendous sigh he gave, did not console him.
               "You don't treat me well," he moaned; "and it's too bad when I've known you all my
                  life; and to slight me without any reason."
               "You always quarrel with me nowadays," replied Milly; "and you're not half so nice
                  as you were once. It all comes of that set of young men you go with so much. But
                  there's Cæsar offering you tea. Will you have a cup?"
               But Charley waved off the elegant coffee-colored servant and his tray with a
                  tragic gesture.
               "I'd take some if it was poison," he said, dolefully.
               "It's good Orange Pekoe," returned Milly; "and I wish you would give me a cup. Put
                  but one lump of sugar in it, and—oh, you've rained it with milk!"
               For Charley had seized the jug and transformed the dish of tea into a white pool,
                  with one reckless dash.
               "I never can do any thing right!" he sighed.
               "Now you must drink it," said Milly, severely; "we can't have cups of tea wasted
                  in these expensive days."
               "But I don't like tea; I never touch it," pleaded the poor boy.
               "So much the more reason why you should drink every drop. I dare say it will be
                  your first attempt at penance. Now don't hesitate; it will only get cold and taste
                  the worse."
               "And I hate it with milk," urged Charley.
               "I am very glad of it," replied pitiless Milly; "another time you'll not deluge my
                  cup when I don't like it, either. Now drink it at once, without any more words.
                  Aunty is looking at you! She is very peculiar about certain things, and nothing
                  vexes her so much as to see people waste her Orange Pekoe."
               Halford, sitting near enough to catch the dialogue through the monotonous hum of
                  Mrs. Maynard's voice, smiled at Milly's nonsense, and the unconscious way in which
                  she displayed the feline instincts of her sex by tormenting her victim. Luckily,
                  he thought, she was still a kitten, and the velvet paws gave no vicious
                  scratches.
               "I'll not have you tease Charley Thorne," Mrs. Remsen said, coming up at the
                  instant that Milly was sternly ordering him to swallow the nauseous draught. "Mr.
                  Carrolton wants you to sing, Milly. I shall stay here and protect you, Charley,
                  from such treatment," she added, by her frank manner making the miserable youth
                  feel younger and more helpless than ever.
               "I doubt my having a suspicion of a voice," Milly said, rising, as the Carrolton
                  youth ambled up. There is no other word which expresses the peculiar style of
                  'locomotion' which the youth of Gotham invariably affect. "I will do my best,
                  though. What shall it be?"
               She looked at Halford rather than at the person whom she addressed; and as Mr.
                  Carrolton seemed incapable of any thing beyond twirling his watch-chain and
                  swaying gracefully back and forth on his heels and toes, that gentleman begged for
                  "The King of Thule." Milly sang it exquisitely. Her voice was not very powerful,
                  but thoroughly cultivated, and her taste perfect; and there was, too, that
                  pathetic ring which one often hears and wonders at in the voices of young
                  girls—sometimes almost saddening one by the thought that it is like a premonition
                  of experiences still undreamed of, which shall yet render that piteous tremor a
                  settled and ordinary tone.
               Some such fancy occurred to Halford as he listened; but he said to himself that in
                  Milly's case the fear should never be realized; it should be his care to prevent this; for though,
                  when these weeks began, he had no thought how far they would lead him, he had no
                  mind to regret their course as he looked back. This child possessed an absolute
                  fascination for him. There was a rest and peace in the idea of winning her love
                  sweeter than any sentiment which had touched him for many a day. He did not
                  perceive the leaven of masculine arrogance and selfishness in his reflections.
                  That any trouble could ever come to her through him did not occur to his mind.
                  That this very love which it pleased him to see so unconsciously taking a deeper
                  hold upon her heart might transform her from a child into a woman, was a fact
                  which he forgot likewise, as the wisest of us overlook truths which concern
                  ourselves, though they would be plain enough to us in the case of another.
               Charley Thorne looked and listened too, and indulged in his own little attempts at
                  sentiment and reflection; but his mood was by no means so tranquil as Halford's.
                  He had three minds to make a confidante of Mrs.
                  Remsen on the spot; but that astute lady perceived his desire, and took measures
                  to prevent its expression. When the time came that Milly was actually engaged, she
                  would play the part of consoler to Charley with great satisfaction, and do her
                  best to teach Maud to help in the charitable work of soothing his wounds; but at
                  present any confession would be an embarrassment, since she could not positively
                  affirm that Milly was out of his reach. So she kept up an animated conversation
                  upon such subjects as he could best talk about—his wonderful breed of dogs—his
                  horses—his genius for billiards—his athletic feats at the gymnasium. And even
                  after Milly had left the piano, she contrived artfully to keep the wretched boy
                  from the tête-à-tête he desired.
               Except to him, the evening was not an unpleasant one, for Hortense Maynard was
                  obliged to leave before she had utterly reduced Halford to a state of coma by her
                  long words and eloquent periods. One of the youths accompanied her for the express
                  pleasure of attending on a pretty woman. But he was sorely punished for the
                  weakness by what he endured at the learned party. Charley Thorne told Milly
                  afterward that the unfortunate wretch was ill for a week in consequence of the
                  sufferings of that night, and he vowed to Charley that henceforth, to the day of
                  his death, he would never so much as read a newspaper, and had burned every thing
                  he owned in the shape of books as soon as he reached home, while the memory of his
                  wrongs was fresh in his mind.
               It was soon time for every body to go, and Halford set the younger men the example
                  by rising to take leave. Charley Thorne would have sat there till daylight—at
                  least, he told himself that he would—sooner than leave Halford to profit by his
                  departure; but under present circumstances he could do nothing but follow in the
                  wake of the others. He made his farewells lugubrious in the extreme; but his
                  misery, deep as it was, would have been increased tenfold had he dreamed that
                  Milly did not hear a word that he said, in the pleasant confusion which Halford's
                  parting sentences created in her mind.
               Poor Charley was any thing but an agreeable companion to his friend after Halford
                  left them: he loathed the idea of billiards, treated with contempt the proposal of
                  broiled oysters and a bird at Delmonico's, and scouted with still more scorn the
                  idea of lounging into the club and finding out what the other fellows were at.
               "No, no, Jack," cried he; "there's a—a what-you-call-it between us—a gulf—a
                  desert, you know!"
               "I don't know," retorted Jack, naturally a little nettled in spite of his good
                  temper by the contempt which his friendly proposals had met with from his chosen
                  comrade. "I've crossed the Desert of Sahara, and I've been up the Archipelago—no,
                  the Bosporus; but never mind—and I'm blessed if I understand what you're driving
                  at, old man, or what's huffed you."
               "I'm not huffed," moaned Charley. "I'm—but never mind, Jack; you wouldn't
                  understand."
               "Now see here, Charley," returned the other, "you've been regularly knocked off
                  your perch lately. You just come along with me to Delmonico's, and let's have it
                  out over a bottle of Rudesheim and a broiled bone or something. Now we've been
                  pals too long for us to fight shy of each other; so come along."
               The youth's brain was not immense, nor his slang very intelligible, but he meant,
                  perhaps, more kindly than a superior animal would have done. Charley allowed
                  himself to be persuaded, though he did not disclose his secret—even to the
                  faithful Jack he could not do that—but he managed to 'pick a bone,' and 'get
                  outside' of a flask of wine—to employ the elegant expressions of the youth of our
                  day, and felt relieved, momentarily, by the performance.
               The Lenten weeks drifted on, and Easter came—the most beautiful Easter, Milly
                  thought, that had ever gladdened the earth. Two or three days afterward there was
                  a little break in her dream—Kenneth Halford was obliged to go to Baltimore for a
                  time. But Milly was not unhappy or restless; only, instead of being an affair of
                  each moment, her happiness was made up of memory and anticipation.
               The night before his departure Halford was at the house. There was no opportunity
                  to have much private talk with Milly, for there were two or three people present.
                  But he was not sorry for that; he meant fully to speak the words which he had
                  promised himself to utter; but he was, unconsciously, somewhat selfish in his new
                  contentment, and had no mind to break the silence until his return. He wanted
                  Milly to miss him; she was not half enough aware of the secret which he read so
                  plainly in her face. This week of loneliness would show her plainly whither her
                  heart had strayed, and her joy at seeing him again add to the pleasure of the
                  avowal he should then utter.
               Milly was sorry to have him go, but she had not thought enough to expect a
                  declaration; and his manner was too kind and tender up to the last for any feeling
                  of disappointment to trouble her.
               "You will be sure to miss me?" he said, as he stood beside her at the piano during
                  the latter part of the evening. She had been singing, and he thought that he had
                  never heard any thing half so sweet as the ringing tones of her fresh young voice.
                  "You will be sure to miss me?"
               "Oh yes; I shall have to walk alone or with Maud," she said, woman enough to try
                  for any subterfuge that should keep her words from becoming too earnest.
               "What a selfish little Miss Milly!" he whispered.
               "Indeed, indeed, I am not," she said, eagerly, so moved by his laughing reproach
                  that she forgot her evasions. "I shall miss you very much—you have been so
                  kind."
               "To myself," he replied. "And you'll be glad to have me come back—promise!"
               "I do promise," she said, rather unsteadily, letting her fingers stray softly over
                  the keys.
               "Say it in so many words—you will be glad," he urged.
               "I shall be very glad," she answered, almost inaudibly.
               "The week will seem a thousand years long to me," he said.
               Just then some wretch approached the instrument, and there was no opportunity for
                  further conversation. Halford perceived that these weeks had drawn him on further
                  and more rapidly than he had meant so soon to go; but he could not be sorry. Life
                  could offer nothing brighter than the love of this beautiful child—no higher
                  pleasure than to watch the development of her mind and heart. He was more
                  satisfied with existence than he had been in years, and rather wondered at his own
                  capabilities for enjoyment as he looked back over the past mouth.
               Presently Mrs. Remsen came up and spoke to him. He had promised to attend to some
                  business for her in Baltimore, and she wanted to give him the necessary papers and
                  directions.
               "I am ashamed to bother you," she said; "but as you kindly offered to save me the
                  trouble, perhaps, of a journey—"
               "It will be a pleasure to oblige you," he answered, as she left her speech
                  unfinished, as people do about half their sentences in real life.
               "I have written out plainly all that is necessary to do," she continued, "and will
                  send you the letter and papers to-morrow."
               "But I leave by the early train," he replied. "You must give them to me
                  to-night."
               "Then, as there is no one here with whom I need stand on ceremony, if you will
                  come into the other room, you shall have them," she said.
               So he followed her; and, after the business matter was arranged, they still stood
                  talking for a few moments.
               "You will only be gone a week?" she asked.
               "Not longer," he answered, rather absently. He was thinking that, though he could
                  afford to please himself where Milly was concerned by not putting his intentions
                  into words till after his return, he had no right to exercise the same reticence
                  toward Mrs. Remsen. To speak—even vaguely—would settle his fate at once; but the
                  thought was not unpleasant. He said to himself again that life had nothing
                  pleasanter or brighter than the chance of taking into his own guardianship this
                  girl-heart, and teaching it to throb and glow into a woman's power of affection,
                  while still preserving all the freshness and innocence that it possessed in this
                  season of girlish dreams.
               "We shall be glad to have you back," Mrs. Remsen said, graciously, breaking in
                  upon his thought.
               "Thanks; you are very good. I hope, though it is not very long since we renewed
                  our acquaintance, you have learned to consider me an old friend and to like me a
                  little?"
               "Indeed I have, Mr. Halford."
               "And to trust me?" he asked, smiling.
               "I have proved it," she replied, with an answering smile, which told him she had
                  been by no means blind or unobservant during these weeks which had been allowed to
                  take their course unchecked.
               "And I shall try to be worthy of it," he said, earnestly.
               "You don't need to tell me that, Mr. Halford."
               "When I come back, I shall have a favor to ask of you. I think you know what it
                  will be!"
               "I will tell you when you come to ask it," she replied, pleasantly.
               "I want to steal the very prettiest of your treasures," he said. "I want you to
                  give me your little Rose-bud."
               "But the favor will not be for me to grant; you will have to ask in another
                  quarter," she said, not affecting the slightest surprise, for she knew the man
                  well enough to be certain that any such common feminine artifice would annoy him,
                  and, perhaps, rouse suspicions in his mind that he had been angled for and led on
                  to this moment.
               "I have not spoken; you may be sure I would not until I had your permission," he
                  replied.
               "At least you have that," she said; and her heart swelled high with gratified
                  vanity and pride, though, to do her justice, there was a better feeling
                  mingled—she rejoiced honestly in the prospect of Milly's happiness.
               "Of course, I can't be certain what my fate will be," he continued; "and I have a
                  fancy to leave it undecided till my return."
               "You must choose for yourself; I've nothing to do with the time or reasons," she said. "I don't think I need to tell you,
                  Mr. Halford, that no word of explanation has passed between Milly and myself. I
                  really believe she is not conscious what it is has made her so happy during these
                  weeks. She's an odd compound—artless as a child, but with a heart that any man
                  might be proud to win."
               "And if I find I have won it, she shall be a happy woman," he answered, with the
                  self-confidence only too common with all of us.
               "I am certain of it. You shall have her without a scruple or fear on my part, Mr.
                  Halford."
               "Then we will leave every thing just as it is until my return," he said. "I want
                  her to find out that she misses me; I do think she will."
               "I fancy there is little doubt of it, you have been making such a little princess
                  of her all these weeks. Certainly I shall give her no hint of this conversation; I
                  have left her to herself, and shall continue to. I did it because I knew the man
                  with whom I had to-deal, not because I am a careless or unobservant guardian."
               "And I thank you for your confidence in me."
               "So this ends all we need say about the matter at present. I suppose I must go
                  back to those people."
               He put into his breast pocket the papers which she had laid on the table, and
                  followed her back to the drawing-room. Mrs. Remsen was a proud and triumphant
                  woman, but she gave no sign; she was too acute for any such weakness. Perhaps
                  there was an added cordiality in her manner to every body; she really felt
                  amicably disposed toward the whole world.
               The time for leave-takings arrived, and Halford had only space for a few whispered
                  words to Milly.
               "You will not forget your promise?"
               "I shall not forget."
               "It is not good-bye, you know, though it seems a long time."
               He held her hand for an instant in his own, made her heart throb tumultuously by
                  the earnest look in his eyes—then he was gone.
               As soon as she could, Milly ran away to her own room, that she might be alone with
                  her delicious fancies, free to listen to the voice in her soul, which sounded more
                  sweet than the song of a Southern bird.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               "INTO THE MAGIC REALM."
               THE week of Kenneth Halford's absence got by, but the waiting had not seemed very
                  long to Milly, for constant reminders came to assure her that he by no means
                  forgot their acquaintance—Milly called it that to herself, and had
                  grown conscious enough to blush a little as she did so—in the engrossing cares of
                  the business which had caused his departure. Bouquets of choice flowers, for which
                  he had left an unlimited order, reached her daily; he sent such books as he
                  chanced to read and like, and there were occasionally marginal notes on the pages
                  in his writing. Even a few tiny billets came, also, inclosed in certain epistles
                  to her aunt, which were rendered necessary by the affairs he was arranging for
                  her. All these things were trifles, perhaps, but they served to keep up the
                  brightness of her dream undisturbed.
               The week ended, but he was not able to return on the day he had appointed;
                  forty-eight hours more absolutely went by, and their length roused Milly at last
                  to a full perception of the new world into which her heart had strayed. She was
                  almost frightened at first, ready to reproach herself as unfeminine and bold, and
                  shed a few tears in the solitude of her chamber. Finally, she opened the box in
                  which she treasured his notes, read them again, went back in fancy over the events
                  of those charming weeks, and by the time her reverie ended, the fear, the sense of
                  shame, were forgotten in the delicious thrill which stirred her soul to its inmost
                  depths.
               The night after was Mrs. Lawrence's ball, the very last of the season; for on the
                  next day but one Lent would begin. Halford wrote Mrs. Remsen that he should
                  certainly be back for that occasion, and begged, as the greatest possible favor,
                  that Milly would keep her first redowa for him—he deserved so much show of
                  consideration after his banishment. Mrs. Remsen gave the letter to Milly without
                  any remark, apparently unconscious that the half-jesting lines were more than a
                  bit of ordinary gallantry. In all this time, never, by word or look, had the wily
                  matron betrayed the least knowledge that Halford's attentions to her niece had any
                  special meaning; and though she talked of him frequently, and landed him to the
                  skies, she appeared to consider his friendship as belonging to her rather than
                  Milly.
               Mrs. Remsen and her niece were very late in arriving at the ball; in fact, Milly
                  began to despair of ever getting there; and, though she said not a word, Mrs.
                  Remsen was almost as impatient as her niece of the delay. But one of the children
                  chose this opportunity to indulge in an attack of earache just as they were
                  dressing, and could not, of course, be left until remedies had been found to
                  soothe her pain. She must have Milly by her, too; lay her poor little head on
                  Milly's lap, and be coaxed and comforted by her alone. The girl bore the waiting
                  wonderfully well, not evincing the least show of impatience, even sitting by the
                  child after the pain had ceased, and lulling her to sleep with the strains of a
                  quaint old melody made doubly sweet by her fresh young voice. Mrs. Remsen—more
                  than ever inclined to be fond of her niece-during these days—said to herself that
                  this certainly was the most charming creature that ever existed, and was delighted
                  to find that she looked prettier than ever in the new dress which had been
                  prepared for this important occasion.
               But late as it was when they entered Mrs. Lawrence's rooms, Halford had not
                  appeared, and Mrs. Remsen half feared that the new gown would prove a useless
                  expense. Somehow, disappointed as she was, Milly could not help feeling certain
                  that he would arrive before the night was over; and this inward assurance kept her
                  in a state of pleasurable restlessness which only heightened the bloom on her
                  cheeks, and added a new brilliancy to her eyes. She was beset by partners, poor
                  Charley Thorne the most persistent, of course; but, though she gave him and others
                  galops, and even stupid quadrilles, in abundance, nothing could induce her to a
                  redowa, even Strauss's loveliest waltzes; and at last her cruel refusals quickened
                  Charley's jealous mind into a suspicion of the cause.
               "I know," he whispered, going up to her at the close of a dance during which he
                  had watched her from a distance with a bitter envy of the man who happened to have
                  the bliss of supporting her, "I know why you have refused every valse."
               "Do you?" returned Milly, fanning herself, anxious to make it appear that it was
                  the heat, and not his question, which deepened her color. "Well, why shouldn't I
                  be capricious the same as other people?"
               "You've promised not to valse with any body
                  while that man is gone," asserted Charley; and his angry tone made the innocent
                  appellation sound more like an opprobrious epithet than the general term applied
                  to the male species of humanity.
               "I remember giving you at least half a dozen valses last week," said Milly; "and I think you are very rude."
               "I didn't mean to be," replied Charley, growing humble at once, not so much from
                  honest contrition as because he feared that, if he did not attempt a show of it,
                  she would treat him to cold looks for the rest of the night. "But it's awful to
                  think that's the reason, and it makes me wretched."
               "Then I would advise you not to think of it," said Milly, with a dignity quite
                  overwhelming. "You always quarrel with me nowadays, and I shall end by not liking
                  you a bit unless you stop this absurd way of talking."
               "Oh!" gasped Charley, catching the lapels of his coat in both hands, as if to hold
                  himself up.
               "Yes, indeed. Now don't talk any more nonsense, and I'll walk the next quadrille
                  with you. I am sure I don't know why you are so ill-tempered all the time, and it
                  annoys me very much; so I wish you would stop it."
               "If you'd only be as you used!" sighed Charley.
               "Oh dear, you have told me that so often—as if I had lately turned into a Gorgon,
                  or something else dreadful!" said Milly.
               "I don't mean your looks," Charley began; but she would not listen.
               "I shall send you away if you don't stop this instant; my aunt would be angry if
                  she heard you," menaced Milly; so he had to content himself with looking as gloomy
                  as his youthful face could manage.
               The evening flew on, supper-time came and passed, and still Halford did not
                  appear. Milly's pleasant anticipations began to fade; she was vexed at herself for
                  having expected him. The ball, after having been so agreeable, suddenly appeared
                  tiresome, and she almost wished that her aunt would signify her desire to depart.
                  She had just finished a tedious quadrille with an elderly beau who still ranked
                  himself among the dancing men; he was leading her back to her aunt, when, as Milly
                  raised her eyes, she saw Kenneth Halford standing by that lady. She was near the
                  doors into the passage—she did not wait to think that Halford might have seen
                  her—she made some rapid excuse to her partner, and darted away up the stairs,
                  anxious only to escape for a few moments before meeting him.
               Mrs. Lawrence's house was an immense one, divided in the middle by a great
                  corridor, and besides the suite of drawing-rooms (situated on the ground-floor,
                  after the arrangement in most New York houses) there was a succession of pretty
                  apartments on the upper story, always thrown open for the convenience of such
                  elderly people as preferred whist or conversation to dancing, and ending in the
                  prettiest little boudoir imaginable. Milly passed through the first card-room,
                  where turbaned dowagers and ancient masculines squabbled over the card-tables, and
                  on into the second, which chanced to be empty. She sank down into a seat in the
                  corner, and, catching sight of her face in a mirror, was startled by its color;
                  but, before she had time to confuse herself with further thought, the draperies
                  were flung back from the doorway, Kenneth Halford entered, looked eagerly about,
                  and, catching a glimpse of her in her retreat, hurried forward with words of
                  delight, which caused poor Milly's heart to flutter more helplessly than ever.
               "I have been looking everywhere for you," he said. "Didn't you see me? Why did you
                  run away?"
               "I—I was tired; I came up here to rest for a moment," Milly said.
               "And aren't you in the least glad to see me?" he asked, though to a man of his
                  years and experience the question was unnecessary. "Won't you say a single
                  word?"
               "Oh yes, I am glad," returned Milly, trying to speak carelessly. "We had given you
                  up, it is so very late; but I suppose you forgot about the ball—dining with
                  friends or something."
               "I have only just had time to dress and get here," he replied. "Late as it was, I
                  determined to come; but, if you are not glad to see me, I might as well have staid
                  away."
               Milly had risen as if to go down stairs, but he drew her hand through his arm,
                  feeling it tremble under his touch, and led her on into the little boudoir,
                  letting the draperies fall back over the
                  entrance, so that they were concealed from the view of any person entering the
                  outer rooms.
               "Do come in and sit down," he said. "It is cool and pleasant here, and you must
                  need a breath of fresh air after the heat down stairs."
               "No, I am not in the least tired," she answered, forgetful of the declaration she
                  had made a moment before. "Besides, I remember now, I promised the next dance to
                  Mr. Thorne, and I must not hide myself."
               "Sit down just for one minute," pleaded Halford.
               Milly still hesitated. She was so troubled by the inexplicable nature of her own
                  feelings that she felt almost afraid of him, and her very agitation annoyed her
                  into a sort of vexation toward herself and him.
               "Just one moment; it's not much, when I have been away so long," he said.
               She allowed him to lead her to a seat, turned half pettishly, half timidly away,
                  and began pulling her bouquet to pieces as carelessly as if the violets had been
                  found under a hedge for the picking, instead of having drawn a large bank-note out
                  of poor Charley Thorne's pocket, unaware, as he was, in his youthful inexperience,
                  that his offering gifts and attentions, and showing himself ready to play Sir
                  Walter Raleigh, if necessary, that she might keep her little feet unsullied, would
                  never win from her more than a few capricious smiles when there was no more
                  important person at hand.
               Kenneth Halford stood watching her, thinking how pretty she looked, how useless it
                  was for her to attempt this show of indifference, and how bewitching she was
                  altogether, with her whole face gaining a new depth of expression under these
                  first struggles of her girlish heart.
               "Won't you speak at all to me?" he asked. "I had been flattering myself that you
                  would be pleased to see me come back, and now you receive me as if I was your
                  deadliest foe. At least, if you are angry, tell me what I have done."
               "I am not angry," she said, flinging away half a dozen more violets, "But—but I
                  came up to rest, and you came in so suddenly!"
               "When I hurried back on purpose to see you to-night! What a silly animal I was—I
                  actually thought you in earnest when you asked me to be here for this ball! But
                  you show plainly that I might as well be at the North Pole, for any thing you
                  would care!"
               "I said I was glad," she replied.
               "Oh yes; but you'll not talk; you'll not look at me!"
               "I am talking now, and I am looking at you," returned she, attempting that last
                  effort as she spoke; but the little coquettish effort at composure which would
                  have been easy enough to an older woman was a pretty failure. Milly's voice
                  faltered, and her eyes sank shyly beneath his, while her dainty fingers again
                  worked sad havoc among the odorous blossoms they held.
               "Did Charley Thorne send you that bouquet?" he asked.
               "It doesn't make any difference who sent it," said she, so near crying outright
                  from her varied emotions—anger at her own absurd behavior among them—that she was
                  obliged to take refuge in rather sharp speeches. "Any way, I have three more
                  lovely ones at home."
               "What an overflow of wasted adoration that implies," said Halford, smiling; for
                  her shyness, her little attempts at dignity, her pettish voice, were all incense
                  to his masculine vanity. "Poor flowers, luckless swains! But really, my dear
                  child, if you don't stop tearing this to pieces so recklessly, you will have to
                  send home for one of the neglected offerings."
               "I wish you wouldn't call me child, Mr. Halford," returned Milly, gladly rushing
                  into any pretense for anger. "Because you know my aunt so well is not a reason for
                  addressing me like that; and I don't like it. I'm sure you're quite acquainted
                  with my name."
               "I know your first name best of any," he answered, his voice sinking lower; "I
                  ought, indeed—Milly! Why, it has been the last thought in my mind each night of
                  this cruel absence—like a prayer! Milly—such a sweet name!"
               Milly's devastating hands paused in their cruel work; the lids drooped over the
                  blue eyes, and her head sank a little lower.
               "You know what I meant," she said, rather indistinctly.
               "Then you'll not let me call you Milly? You'll not be friends?" he asked.
               She turned her head still more away; and as he repeated his question, he bent so
                  near, trying to look in her face, the flowers in her hair touched his
                  forehead.
               "I thought we were very good friends," she said, managing to keep her voice
                  tolerably steady, and her tell-tale eyes hidden.
               "One is good friends with all the world," returned he, in a disappointed, injured
                  tone; "that phrase doesn't mean any thing. But tonight you are not even friendly
                  with me; you don't so much as give me a flower; you'll not say you remembered to
                  keep even one dance for me!"
               "Was it my fault that you came so late?" cried Milly, with incautious haste. "And
                  every body teasing me to dance; and I hate to have any body put me in an absurd
                  position!"
               "Oh, Milly, Milly, how can you say such dreadful things?"
               She had said more than she intended, but not in the sense he meant. She was afraid
                  that she had betrayed the real cause of her agitation—the flutter and dizziness
                  which she had tried to hide under capricious speeches and pettish waywardness—poor
                  little girl! As if the real cause had not been apparent to him from the first!
               "Any-way, it is very wrong of me to stay here so long," she added. "I was engaged
                  to Mr. Thorne for the galop; it is perfectly shameful to treat people so rudely!
                  You made me do it, Mr. Halford; you know you did; it is all your fault! But I'll
                  go back this minute, and say how sorry I am."
               Kenneth Halford's detaining hand was laid lightly on her little fingers, but,
                  somehow, that gentle touch detained her as effectually as the strongest of fetters
                  could have done.
               "You won't go away angry with me, Milly—you won't leave me like this?"
               She began to tremble beneath that thrilling whisper; she forgot Charley Thorne and
                  his wrongs, Alice Marchmont's stormy dark eyes, the ball, and every thing
                  connected with it, as completely as if they had all been worlds away. The music
                  surging up into the half-lighted boudoir only sounded like the echo of the melody
                  sounding so loudly in her heart. Then it was that, under the influence of the
                  delicious moment, and the new beauty which her sweet trouble woke in Milly's face,
                  Halford was hurried on to speak the words which carried her away into a new
                  world—words which came from his heart, and were the utterances of real affection,
                  though it was the affection that a man gives to a creature young and childish,
                  finding the sunshine in her eyes a pleasant contrast to the shadows which haunted
                  his older experience and sterner life.
               "You know that I love you, Milly," he said; "you know that you are more than all
                  the world to me! Give me your dear little heart to keep; bring your brightness
                  into my dull life; be my wife—will you, Milly? Oh, answer! Don't look away from
                  me, little one—say that you will come to me!"
               Milly could not speak; her two hands were clasped in his, her eyes drooped under
                  his eager gaze, and poor Charley Thorne's violets rolled away unheeded over the
                  carpet—just as the incense of his youthful adoration would now pass forever out of
                  her existence, along with the thousand other trifles which had contented her
                  before this bewildering vision came.
               "You don't speak—you don't answer me, Milly! Surely you know that I love you? I
                  did not know how dearly myself until now! You will not send me away? You can not
                  dream how desolate and lonely my life has been! Say that you will bring your
                  sunshine into it, and give it a brightness and warmth that, till I knew you,
                  seemed gone out of it forever."
               It was certain that he had no need of words. Those quivering hands nestled in his
                  own, the absolute glory of those girlish eyes lifted timidly to his for a moment,
                  was answer enough; but the man's nature could not be content until he should have
                  a complete avowal of his triumph.
               "Just one word—do you love me?"
               She could whisper it then—just the one word he demanded, faint and low, but fuller
                  of conviction than a whole volume would have been; and Kenneth Halford caught her
                  for an instant to his heart, exclaiming,
               "My own darling—all mine now; my charge, my happiness, henceforth. There shall no
                  trouble come near you, Milly; the fairy stories you used to read shall not be
                  brighter than your life, my Milly," he whispered, "my little one—all my own!"
               Still the same tone of triumph mingling with his real feelings—the thought that he
                  had gained the treasure which would bring to him the charm now wanting in his
                  existence—a love which would live upon his smile, and grow into worship in return
                  for his tenderness. She was all his, to minister to him alone, to be his songbird,
                  his plaything, content to nestle peacefully among the outer folds of his heart,
                  and have no conception of the inner depths that remained undisturbed.
               "Are you happy, Milly? Are you content? Have you loved me—have you dreamed of this
                  dear time?"
               Still determined to probe her very soul, and bring out its holiest secrets as an
                  incense at his shrine; and all the while, in spite of his manly sense and true
                  worth, so hopelessly unconscious of his own selfishness. He repeated these words
                  again and again, until he forced an answer from her at last; and out of her
                  bewilderment Milly faltered,
               "How could I allow myself to think of such things—how could I know that you cared
                  for me—do any thing but blush at my unwomanliness in—in thinking of you at
                  all?"
               "And you loved me, Milly? Don't be afraid of me; surely you can speak openly now;
                  it is only your own heart which hears you—yours, forever, Milly."
               "I seem to have been living in a dream," she answered, brokenly. "Oh, don't make
                  me talk of it—I will tell you some time—don't, don't ask we now!"
               "She hid her face in her hands, and at last he remembered and pitied her
                  confusion, leaving her time to be silent and recover her calmness, while he
                  contented himself with kissing her little cold hands, calling her by every tender,
                  loving name, and promising every thing for the future, as men rashly do at such
                  times. They were so completely out of sight in that bay-window of the boudoir that
                  it was some time before Milly's recollection returned; then, though dizzy still
                  with her great happiness, she could remember that they were not alone in some
                  beautiful world, such as he had been promising to create for her, and had
                  described to her, with an extravagance of metaphor which he would have been the
                  first to laugh at from the lips of another.
               "It must be very late," she said. "Please let me go to aunty."
               "So soon—you wish to leave me already?"
               "My aunt will want to go home."
               But he could not let her go yet; he must hold her hands just an instant longer,
                  and exult at the happiness in her face.
               "I shall tell your aunt very soon," he said, "but not to-morrow. I must keep our
                  secret a little while—yours and mine, darling—it is so very sweet."
               
               Ah, the heavenly words—their secret! The utterance seemed to make Milly's bliss
                  brighter and greater, if that were possible; he could see it in the sudden
                  tremulousness of her smile.
               "It is so delicious to say 'ours,' isn't it, Milly?" he whispered. "Little one,
                  you don't know how happy I am; how my life expands and blossoms under this new
                  content. I did so want to be loved—not as women love who have worn out all their
                  freshness in the world, but wholly, entirely, by a heart that had never stirred at
                  any human voice before."
               She paused before him with a sweet gravity which quite took the childishness out
                  of her face—with a purpose and strength that were like a premonition of the
                  womanly soul which love would rouse within her, saying, in a low voice, that had
                  lost its tremor,
               "I will so love you—I can so love you; and I thank the Heavenly Father that I am
                  able; yes, I heartily thank him."
               Perhaps, for a brief instant, it flashed upon his mind how different a creature
                  this girlish being might become under the influence of his affection—flashed upon
                  him and was forgotten, because he liked best to keep her as she was now, to be his
                  sunbeam, his one flower, which never gave out a tithe of its brightness and
                  sweetness save to him.
               "My little Milly—my darling!"
               "I can't see all those people again—I can't!" she pleaded, shrinking timidly still
                  from his embrace.
               "You shall not," he answered; "they are not worthy to look at the new beauty in
                  your face. I'll take you to the dressing-room; then I'll find your aunt, and see
                  if she is ready to go."
               He led her away, but detained her at the door for another farewell.
               "I must see you early to-morrow, Milly. You haven't given up your early
                  walks?"
               Milly had, since his departure; he saw that in her face.
               "My precious child—you'll let me call you that now?"
               The words were too sweet for Milly to remember her attempt at dignity when he had
                  first spoken them.
               "But you'll go for a walk to-morrow? I shall not even come to the house for you; I
                  shall meet you, and it will be quite like a stolen interview, Milly, since nobody
                  knows our secret."
               The little romance made the anticipation doubly pleasant in Milly's mind, but she
                  was so fearful some one might come up that she begged him to go away as soon as it
                  had been arranged in which direction her morning promenade was to lead her. But
                  when he reached the door, he looked back—somehow the brief parting appeared very
                  long—and on her saying that her cloak had been thrown out of sight, he hurried
                  back to search for it, and whisper farewell again.
               He was gone at last, and Milly stood there, unable to think, in the delicious
                  whirl of her senses, until she heard her aunt's step, and her aunt's voice
                  conversing with some acquaintance also bent mantle and muffler-ward. They were
                  talking eagerly—probably about somebody's short-comings; people are seldom so
                  earnest about any thing else—and Mrs. Remsen only glanced at Milly in her white
                  wrappings, and said,
               "So you are ready? Do just tell them to look for my furs; that's a dear
                  child."
               Then she and her companion resumed their talk, continuing it as they passed down
                  stairs, greatly to Milly's relief, for she dreaded questions as to the cause of
                  her disappearance from the dancing-room, and was glad that her aunt's quick eyes
                  did not observe her face, for she felt that it must be telling many things she did
                  not wish to speak.
               Kenneth Halford was waiting for them in the passage. Milly hardly dared to look at
                  him. As he helped her into the carriage, he found an opportunity to whisper,
               "To-morrow morning, remember."
               Mrs. Remsen called, at the same instant,
               "You must come and see us soon, Mr. Halford. I have had no time to thank you for
                  your kindness."
               As if he were likely to forego any occasion to present himself at the house; at
                  least, that was the way in which Milly interpreted the pressure he gave her little
                  hand while he answered Mrs. Remsen. I dare say that was what he meant, too;
                  entirely forgetting how often he had neglected that privilege, allowing a game of
                  billiards or a dinner to detain him, when he had thought how pleasantly Milly's
                  face always lighted up at the sight of him (what a little darling she was
                  altogether!), and had determined to enjoy her society and pretty songs during the
                  evening.
               The carriage drove off. Milly looked out as long as she could see him standing on
                  the steps under the gas-light, then sank back in her seat, only fearing that her
                  aunt would be in a mood for conversation, and so jar upon her dream. But Mrs.
                  Remsen only said,
               "I really am too tired to talk; don't expect it, child."
               Milly probably did not wish her aunt to suffer from fatigue, but was very glad
                  that any cause kept her silent, though she took half a second, before going back
                  to her vision, to pity Aunt Eliza for having no bewildering reverie to make her
                  forget weariness—nothing to think of but a quantity of troublesome, commonplace
                  ideas—her plans for her children—her expenses—thoughts such worlds away from the
                  girl's dazzling fancies, that she quite pitied the middle-aged lady. Probably Aunt
                  Eliza knew what had happened as well as if ample confession had been made; but
                  there was a nice side to her worldly nature; she could understand Milly's feelings
                  enough to respect them, and would disturb her by no show of consciousness until
                  the proper moment arrived.
               As soon as they were safe in the house, Milly ly ran up to her own room, where she
                  and her dreams would be secure from interruption. I can not put the thoughts of
                  those first hours into words; it would seem a positive sacrilege to analyze and
                  anatomize the emotions of that fresh young heart, half frightened at its own
                  happiness. You can all look back and recall a similar era in your lives; perhaps,
                  in most cases, it proved only a vision, ending in sorrow and darkness, or getting
                  gradually worn away in the hardening contact with the world; but at one time it
                  appeared real and lasting as eternity itself; and you have not forgotten—you can
                  recollect—how every thing shone in the glorious light of its newness, and can
                  picture Milly's dream.
               The next morning Milly went out to walk. When she asked permission—for it had
                  never been Milly's habit to announce her will after the bluntness too common with
                  girls of this generation—Aunt Eliza only said,
               "It will do you good; stay out in the air for at least two hours."
               She smiled to herself after the child had gone, foreseeing just whom Milly would
                  meet as plainly as if she had been endowed with the gift of second-sight. Mrs.
                  Remsen was in high good humor with existence just now, and absolutely enthusiastic
                  in her affection for Milly.
               It certainly happened that the young lady had not walked far when she met Kenneth
                  Halford. She saw him long before he reached her side; and, after that first
                  glance, was in a state of such pleasurable agitation that she would have been very
                  glad to sit down. He saw her, too, looking so pretty in her sober walking-dress,
                  with that thorough-bred air which it is permitted to very few young girls to
                  attain, her pure forehead relieved by the masses of soft, luxuriant hair; and he
                  exulted at her loveliness. He hurried on to meet her, glad to find that he still
                  preserved the enthusiasm of the previous evening—well satisfied with himself
                  because he yet possessed the power of loving.
               The first transports of the interview had to pass quietly enough; indeed, I fear
                  that it is only in plays any thing out of the common order of affairs often
                  happens; but Halford brought a new color to Milly's cheek by his whispered
                  questions.
               "Had she regretted last night? Did it seem a dream still?"
               But they soon came down to a safer level of conversation, considering their
                  surroundings, and Milly explained that her aunt had given her a little errand to
                  do.
               "Further, perhaps, than you would care to go," she said, with a smile of unbelief
                  at her own words.
               "You suspicious, treacherous pigeon!" Halford replied. "You know you only say that
                  for the pleasure of hearing it contradicted."
               Already he had invented a variety of nonsensical pet names for her; and, in her
                  ignorance, she was pleased thereat, not perceiving that even in this trifle he
                  showed how young and childish he considered her—a creature to be fondly loved and
                  cherished, no doubt—still, to be looked upon as a child, and not in any way to
                  have a part in the graver emotions of his life.
               "Do you remember our first walk, Milly?" he asked. "Had you thought then of the
                  possibility of our ever walking together like this?"
               "Oh no, no—how could I?"
               "You wouldn't take my arm, and you blushed so beautifully when you explained the
                  reason!"
               "And I don't take it now," returned Milly, triumphantly; but she blushed all the
                  same.
               "Tell me, when did you first begin to think? Ah, don't shrink away, don't be
                  afraid!"
               "I—I haven't thought," Milly said, breathlessly. "Don't ask me questions—please
                  don't!"
               "Did you miss me? Just tell me that!"
               "Those last days—when you staid away longer than you intended—"
               "Then you found out that you cared a little? My precious! And were you
                  disappointed when you thought I should not come to the ball? Oh, Milly, who had my
                  waltz?"
               Her indignant glance proved that the promised dance had not been given to any
                  other mortal, though he had felt certain of this without asking.
               "We are going to the opera to-night," Milly said, getting away to a safer subject.
                  "We have Mrs. Lawrence's box to ourselves."
               "I wish we were to have it to ourselves," returned Halford.
               "Now don't say absurd things, because then I look foolish," cried Milly; "and it
                  is not pleasant if one happens to meet people. My aunt said at breakfast that we
                  should want a cavalier, and if she had thought she would have asked you, but now
                  she supposed she must send for Cousin Moulson. I think it's really dreary to be
                  waited on by such a tiresome old man; be always smells of snuff."
               "I suppose that is better, though, than the odor of the cigars with which we of
                  the younger generation perfume ourselves," said Halford. "But it would be a shame
                  to confide you to the tender mercies of that venerable party, and have you run the
                  risk of sneezing yourself to death. Do you think, if I chanced to call at—just by
                  accident—"
               "Oh, if you only will!" exclaimed Milly, ecstatically. "It's 'Favorita' to-night,
                  and then it would be perfect."
               "But you must promise to sit back in the box, so that a whole crowd of your
                  adorers won't see you and rush in."
               "As if I had such things!" laughed Milly.
               "Oh, don't deny it! I am quite afraid that you are a fearful little coquette!"
               "No, Mr. Halford; indeed, indeed I am not."
               "Well, well, you needn't be so earnest about it, my little one—as if I could say
                  it seriously! But you called me by a name that is not for your pretty lips."
               
               "I am not accustomed to the other," she said, shyly.
               "Did you never even whisper it to yourself?" he asked. "Oh, Milly, your name has
                  grown so familiar to me!"
               "I am glad you will go," said Milly, becoming a little nervous again at his
                  earnestness, and wishing to avoid the subject.
               "Then you'll not answer my question?" he urged.
               It was cruel of him to insist on such little revelations while her happiness was
                  so new. It betrayed the selfishness of a man's affection; for he never thought of
                  her trouble in his desire to satisfy that craving of his heart to be idolized and
                  worshiped like a Romney Leigh or a modern Sir Launcelot.
               "Please don't talk about it yet," she pleaded. "I feel so strange, so awkward;
                  wait a little—Kenneth!"
               He was gratified by her timid utterance of his Christian name, and he saw by her
                  face how sorely she was disturbed, so had magnanimity enough to be quiet for the
                  present. He began to talk of other things, quaintly, pleasantly, as he could talk
                  when he pleased, and Milly soon forgot her embarrassment, and walked on through
                  the bright morning with a step which never once touched the common earth.
               They went to the florists to fulfill Aunt Eliza's commission; then made divers
                  detours, so as not to pass down the avenue again—not that there was the slightest
                  reason, but it pleased them to make a mystery of the expedition, turning sharp
                  corners and running away from their acquaintances; and Halford, in spite of his
                  thirty-three years and nonchalant dignity, enjoyed it as much as Milly. They were
                  almost at the street where Mrs. Remsen lived, when Halford said,
               "I shall go on to the house with you, and take great pains to relate to your aunt
                  our chance meeting—your casual mention of the opera and Mr. Moulson—and shall say
                  that I have come to offer my services, if she will accept them."
               Milly laughed gayly; all their foolish pains to invent a mystery when none was
                  needed pleased her mightily.
               "Aunt Eliza will be pleased," she said; "you are a great favorite with her, I
                  know."
               "Has she told you that?" Halford asked, quickly, beset by certain thoughts as to
                  the counsels which the experienced matron might have given her youthful charge;
                  for life had rendered him somewhat suspicious, as, alas! it does most of us.
               "No," Milly replied, frankly; "I don't think she ever said so; but she is always
                  very friendly with you; and aunty can be haughty enough when she chooses! But
                  once, while you were gone, she did say that you were a man to be honored and
                  trusted."
               It was true—he was; a man much more worthy of confidence than the race in general.
                  He felt slightly ashamed of the thought which had sprung up in his mind, though it
                  came from a desire that Milly's love for him should not be mingled with a single
                  worldly feeling. And it was not; he felt certain of this. She had never once
                  remembered his fortune, his position, or any of the advantages which would have
                  been prominent in the minds of so many girls, grown old and calculating before
                  their time.
               "To-morrow will be Ash-Wednesday," Milly said. "I have promised Constance
                  Worthington to go to St. Alban's with her."
               "And I had meant to go there, too—how very odd! And, little one, we will not tell
                  even Aunt Eliza our secret until three whole days have gone; we will have it all
                  to ourselves until them."
               By this time they had reached the house, and he went in, prepared to meet Milly's
                  relative with an accession of kindly feeling. Mrs. Remsen was fully a match for
                  half a dozen Kenneth Halfords, or, indeed, any number of the wisest men, as a
                  shrewd woman always is. From her manner, no one would have supposed that she
                  suspected the young people of having done the very thing she desired—followed the
                  plan she had marked out from the day of Halford's arrival. She was perfectly
                  content to wait and make no sign until they were ready to speak, and could
                  appreciate the feeling which made the pair long to have their happiness, for a
                  little time, entirely to themselves.
               Halford presented his petition to be one of the opera party, and it was
                  granted—not a word or look added that could disturb Milly—and, altogether, Halford
                  left the house better satisfied than ever with his future relative, thinking,
               "She's a well-bred woman—nothing fussy about her. Upon my word, I don't believe
                  she has talked to Milly about money or position; any way, the little darling is as
                  innocent and undesigning as a wood-thrush—such a comfort!"
               He walked rapidly away, so happy and content that he scarcely recognized himself,
                  still with that feeling of self-gratulation at his heart that he yet possessed the
                  ability to love. He thought, too, and more exultantly, how Milly would love him;
                  how pleasant she would make his life with her childish ways; how much better this
                  calm affection on his own part than the restless passion of early youth; how sunny
                  and quiet after the loneliness, the great want, which had troubled these later
                  years. He was more glad than ever that the preceding weeks had lured him more
                  swiftly on than he intended when they began—glad that he had not longer postponed
                  making his contentment complete, though, when he went to the ball, he had not
                  meant to speak the words so soon—it was only that he had been surprised into
                  uttering them by Milly's unconscious betrayal of her feelings and the fascination
                  of the moment. He had purposed to wait—to study her—to consult his own lordly will
                  and pleasure; but he was glad now that he had spoken.
               At the opera that night, Milly looked so lovely ly in her happiness that he was
                  fuller of content than ever. The little supper Halford persuaded Mrs. Remsen into
                  afterward—there being ample time to enjoy it and get home before the midnight
                  bells tolled out the Carnival season—was so gay that really things were growing
                  too pleasant to be real.
               The next morning Milly went to service with her friend Constance; but, though she
                  tried hard to be devout and penitent, as suited the day, I am afraid the sight of
                  Kenneth Halford in the adjoining seat sorely disturbed her meditations, though I
                  doubt if her guardian angel set the record against her as a sin.
               That evening Halford came to the house; the next day there was another long walk,
                  another visit; and so the three days agreed upon wore by. And such bewildering
                  days they had been to Milly as, I think, come but once to any human being. Later
                  in life there must always be the recollection of certain other days marked with a
                  white stone, to mar the perfection of any happiness life can give; but these were
                  her first—her very first; she had never before strayed into Eden.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               THE STORY TOLD.
               THE morning which succeeded that trio of happy days, Milly Crofton sat alone in
                  the library. She made a lovely picture, curled up in the corner of a sofa, with
                  her blue morning-dress floating over the crimson cushions, and her attitude as
                  graceful as though she had taken more thought in choosing it than was really the
                  case.
               The warm yellow sun, which had premonitions of spring in its glow, streamed over
                  her fair hair, gave a new softness to her mouth, and deepened the color of her
                  eyes until they might have caused a careful observer to think that there was an
                  earnestness and strength in her nature which her girlish existence had not yet
                  developed.
               Presently she should hear the door-bell ring—hear him go up to Mrs. Remsen's
                  sitting-room—then, after a little, come down again to tell her that all was
                  arranged.
               It all happened just as she expected. The ring came—the steps ascended the
                  stairs—then a delicious whirl in Milly's heart and brain left her powerless to
                  take any note of time, or form a single connected thought, until the tread struck
                  her ear anew, the door opened, and a voice cried out,
               "Has my bird flown quite out of sight this morning?"
               It was so pleasant to crouch behind the window curtains, where she had quickly
                  concealed herself, and watch him looking eagerly about, until the disappointment
                  which came over his face made her forget both her shyness and her desire to tease,
                  and she ran from her hiding-place so quickly that the draperies floated out like
                  banners; and before they had settled to their proper position, she was drawn to
                  his side, his strong arm lifted her from the floor, and his lips rained kisses on
                  her forehead and eyes, by way of punishment.
               "Your aunt has given you to me, you naughty white pigeon," he said; "and these are
                  your fetters, my darling, my own heart's darling!"
               Then more kisses and many foolish words, until Milly only wondered that she did
                  not die outright from very happiness.
               "And aunty was pleased?" she whispered, when they were at last seated, and
                  prepared, as they believed, to hold a sensible conversation. "Was she
                  pleased?"
               "As if she were likely to be any thing else, at the prospect of being rid of such
                  a dear little bother?" returned he. "And she consents to our wish, that the
                  engagement should not be announced just yet; so we can still have our secret to
                  ourselves for a while."
               "She does not think me a trouble," said Milly, extricating her long curls from his
                  fingers. "Let me tell you, I am not accustomed to have any body tell me so—and you
                  are not to make my hair untidy; suppose some one should come in?"
               "But some one can't," replied he. "That coffee-colored man-servant of yours has
                  received orders that there is no one at home this morning."
               "So twenty people that one might wish to see may be turned away," cried Milly,
                  mischievously.
               "Who is to care? Not you—not I; and your aunt is busy."
               Then followed a long talk in the sunlight; and Halford pleased himself with
                  thinking of his good sense in choosing a loving, devoted creature like this to
                  worship him. She had such bewitching ways; and she rested him after his experience
                  of the past—an experience which had left him a little careworn and selfish, in
                  spite of his manly qualities. He asked her again all those questions which he had
                  pressed upon her the night he told his love; and she had more courage now to
                  answer.
               "Had you thought of me, Milly—had you, indeed?"
               "How could I help it? Had I ever seen any one half so good and noble and
                  handsome?"
               "Dear, dear little Milly! And did you wonder if I loved you?" he continued, still
                  eager to feed his vanity with those sweet assurances. "Did you wonder, Milly?"
               "Yes," she faltered, but a little sharply; it hurt her pride to have her maiden
                  secrets wrung from her.
               He grew tender again, and the morning passed so swiftly that Milly could not
                  believe he had been there twenty minutes, when Mrs. Remsen, thinking he had gone,
                  came into the room to congratulate her niece.
               "But I am just going," Halford said; "I have no business to be here; I have oceans
                     to do. Mrs. Remsen, this child makes
                  me forget every thing."
               The lady smiled approval, and busied herself good-naturedly at the other end of
                  the room, while he took his farewell—rather a lengthy operation it proved. After
                  he was fairly out of the room, she sat down to talk, expressing her satisfaction
                  with such warmth that Milly was fully content.
               "Weren't you surprised, aunty?" Milly asked.
               Mrs. Remsen only smiled. She did not feel it to be necessary to tell Milly that
                  this consummation was what she had hoped and labored for; indeed, if she had not
                  seen clearly how matters were going, it was hardly probable that Milly would have
                  been left quite so much to her own devices, or indulged with so many new dresses
                  and pleasant extravagances. It certainly was kind in the aunt; for many a woman
                  with an unmarried daughter would not have relished seeing a niece bear off so
                  valuable a matrimonial prize as Kenneth Halford from one of her own special brood.
                  But, besides loving Milly, Mrs. Remsen was a wise woman. Maud could never have won
                  him—Maud was a fool, and her mother was aware of it. She relinquished the prize to
                  Milly without a groan; better a nephew than no relation. Maud's turn would come
                  now; she should have a clear field and the favor of the married sisters and
                  cousin. Truly, Mrs. Remsen's acquaintance might call her a fortunate woman, and
                  the few who partially understood her admired her sagacity and foresight.
               "Now, pussy, you are disposed of," she said; for sometimes she could unbend enough
                  to employ pet names. "I am sure I ought to be satisfied; Adelaide and Hortense
                  settled as they are—you happy as a queen—I should be a wicked woman if I was
                  not."
               Milly scouted, incredulously, the idea that any queen whoever sat on a throne was
                  able to compare with her in regard to bliss; but she listened in silence, not
                  choosing to make Aunt Eliza smile by putting her extravagant thoughts into words.
                  So Mrs. Remsen went on to detail her own plans, feeling that in the first part of
                  the conversation she had said all which the poetic and romantic side required.
               "Next winter I shall bring Maud out; then you will have a house of your own, and
                  be able to take her a great deal off my hands."
               "Indeed, yes, aunty; and you know I would do my best to have her enjoy
                  herself."
               "I am sure you would, Milly; you are very young, but, upon my word, I would rather
                  trust her with you than with either Adelaide or Hortense."
               Really, such unusual praise was very pleasant, Milly felt; and, as Mrs. Remsen
                  looked at her and saw how pretty she was, and thought what a sensible little
                  creature she had proved herself, and how well every thing was arranged, she was
                  inclined to bestow still higher encomiums. Then her reflections went back to her
                  own special wishes and requirements, and the good which her niece's marriage might
                  work therefor, as was natural, and no more selfish and worldly than it is
                  permitted even good people to be. One does not expect to find at every turn
                  penitent Saint Augustines, and pious, patient Saint Catherines, ready and willing
                  to crucify themselves without any reward whatever.
               "I shall depend on you married ones very much where Maud is concerned," she went
                  on. "This bringing out so many girls has thoroughly cramped me; but don't think I
                  regret the trouble you have cost, Milly; you have done exactly what I wished, and
                  are a dear, good girl."
               This commonplace fashion of regarding her extreme happiness grated a little on
                  Milly's ear, and she would rather not have heard the gentle reminder which closed
                  the speech; but she bore it very patiently, pleased to see how frank and
                  confidential her own new dignity made Aunt Eliza.
               She was evidently not to be treated as a child any longer.
               "Mr. Halford will have the sort of people about him that I like," said Mrs.
                  Remsen. "Now Hortense's set are so wise and literary, that Maud would be
                  overlooked; and Adelaide will not give up her liking for admiration; so she has a
                  crowd of men about who are only detrimental to a young lady; for they haven't the
                  least thought of marrying. Your position will be a very enviable one, my
                  dear."
               Milly had never once thought of that; it brought a flush to her check to hear her
                  aunt speak in so business-like a manner. She would have been glad, in her girlish
                  romance, to attempt some great sacrifice to prove her love. An indistinct vision
                  of toiling for Kenneth, and living in the most modest of cottages, with affection
                  to brighten it, struck her as a thing desirable.
               "I never thought about his being rich," she exclaimed, impetuously; "why, Aunt
                  Eliza, it would be the same to me if he had not a penny; he would still be Kenneth
                  Halford."
               Mrs. Remsen smiled in tolerance of her folly; she had not interfered with Milly's
                  romantic ideas, because they chanced to take the direction she approved. Had they
                  led her into any undesirable attachment, Milly might have discovered a phase in
                  her relative's character with which she had never yet become acquainted.
               Soon Maud came in, and was informed of Milly's prospects; and she dashed
                  frantically at the opening which they left her. She had no great amount of
                  affection for her cousin; she had always looked upon her as an intruder who stood
                  in her, Maud's, light; so now she was divided between envy of Milly's good fortune
                  and self-gratulation that at last she might emerge from the retirement in which
                  she had with great difficulty been kept. She had not the beauty of one sister, nor
                  the tact and style of the other, and she was no more like Milly than a blue jay is
                  like a cardinal-bird. Her face would pass as pretty, and also her figure, with the
                  aid of skillful dressing. She was shallow and ill-tempered; given to talking
                  nonsense, with a strong tendency toward the "rapid" order, so common among the
                  young ladies of the present day. This latter role, easy as it seems, requires an
                  unusual share of beauty and wit to make it at all successful, or even creditable.
                  But her mother was not uneasy in regard to her; she could manage Maud's future.
                  There was one good thing: she would never be troubled with any ridiculous ideas of
                  romance and self-sacrifice; these were not in the girl's character—that is, if she
                  could be said to possess such a thing.
               "Well, I needn't be buried alive any longer, I suppose!" exclaimed the young lady;
                  "you are out of my moonshine at last, Milly."
               "My dear," said her mother, "don't use such expressions!"
               "There's no one to hear," retorted Maud, who believed that good manners were to be
                  kept, like fine dresses, for the benefit of society. "I wish it wasn't the end of
                  the season; I could come out now."
               "Have a little patience," returned Mrs. Remsen.
               "Oh, patience!" repeated Maud, tossing her head indignantly. "I hate the
                  word."
               "Next winter you shall have your own way and he introduced," said her mother.
               "Next winter!" echoed Maud, in angry dismay. "Am I not going to Newport? You must
                  take me there; I have set my heart upon it. Clara Fay and all the girls of my age
                  this last half at school are to go, and I must go too. All the fellows one cares
                  to know—"
               "Maud!" interrupted her mother, in horror. "Where did you learn such dreadful
                  expressions?"
               "Goodness, mamma! As if it made any difference here at home—you are so very
                  particular!"
               "I detest the habit of slang, and I will not permit it."
               "Why, mamma, all the girls at Madame Chonfleur's do it—not, of course, before the
                  teachers. Clara Fay always speaks of her papa as "the Governor," and her mother as
                  "Madame Beck"—it's out of a book—Bulwer, I think; but then he's such a prig!"
               "Do be quiet. You talk too much," exclaimed Mrs. Remsen, seeing Maud's follies
                  rather more plainly than usual, in contrast with Milly's good sense.
               "Oh, that is what you always say, mamma," returned Maud, in an injured tone; "I
                  believe you think me a fool. What is the good of my going into society, if I'm
                  always to be muzzled like Tom Schuyler's dog?"
               Mrs. Remsen held up both hands with such an expression of suffering that Milly had
                  much ado not to laugh.
               "Tom Schuyler!" repeated the mother. "A man old enough to be your father, and
                  spoken of in that manner!"
               "He pays me a great deal of attention whenever he sees me," said Maud, stoutly;
                  "and I don't care a straw if he is old; he is richer than Mr. Halford."
               These last words mollified Mrs. Remsen; her mind rushed forward to future
                  probabilities. After all, these old bachelors often were pleased with such girls;
                  something might come of it; she would not be too severe.
               "I have decided upon my first ball-dress—just what it shall be," cried Maud, her
                  mind taking one of its rapid flights toward her favorite subject of thought. "And
                  you mustn't interfere with me, mamma; it will be perfectly lovely."
               "The dress, or the non-interference?" asked Milly.
               "Oh, you needn't be witty at my expense," said Miss Maud, sharply. "If you are
                  going to be married, it's no reason for putting on such airs. I may be married
                  myself before long! And I don't care a bit if I can't say sharp things. Tom
                  Schuyler says it's no credit to a girl; and he's going to teach me billiards and
                  rowing at Newport."
               Mrs. Remsen was obliged to go out on business; so she left the cousins together,
                  reserving her lecture for her daughter until a more convenient opportunity.
               "Mamma needn't think I'm going to be kept back any longer," exclaimed Maud, as
                  soon as her mother was gone. "It's a sin and a shame for a girl to be put down as
                  I have been—here I am seventeen! I'll tell you what, Milly, you'll be very mean if
                  you don't give me lots of pretty things when you are once married, to pay me for
                  waiting till you were served."
               "I'll do any thing I can to please you, Maud," replied Milly, wishing that her
                  cousin would depart, and leave her to dream in peace.
               "There's Hortense snubs me every time I open my mouth, as if I was a—a china
                  poodle," said Maud, casting about for a comparison, and falling upon this somewhat
                  unhappy one from chancing to catch sight of such an ornament upon the étagère.
               Milly was wickedly amused, for the china dog had an absurd resemblance to Maud.
                  "She thinks," pursued Maud, "that because she never makes mistakes about the names
                  of books, and can talk about ologies, that she's quite wonderful. I hate ologies,
                  and I can never remember the names of things; but I don't care; I'm not going to
                  set up for a Joan of Are."
               Milly could not see what connection of ideas there was between the heroine of
                  France and a woman who pretended to scientific attainments, and she laughed
                  outright.
               "Now, you're laughing at me," said Maud, preparing to go into the sulks without
                  loss of time.
               "I was laughing at learned ladies," asserted naughty Milly. "You know I couldn't
                  be one if I tried."
               
               "But you're so bright," said Maud, enviously; "and you know how to say such witty
                  things to men; and mamma says you're so high-principled."
               She might have added much more without drawing upon her imagination; but to admit
                  that Milly possessed a reputation for beauty was farther than Maud's magnanimity
                  could go.
               "When you have been a little in society these things will come to you," returned
                  Milly, good-naturedly.
               "Oh, I don't mind," said Maud, by no means dissatisfied with herself, in spite of
                  envying her cousin. "I think my style will be different altogether from
                  yours."
               There could be no doubt of that in the mind of any person who saw the two
                  together.
               "I'll go to Newport in spite of mamma," continued Maud. "You won't care to go; you
                  can visit somebody, or perhaps you'll be married before that. I'm going to have
                  just the prettiest lot of new dresses ever seen. Milly; I mean to have one of
                  those new blues, you know—the skirt trimmed with ruchings, and let them run up the
                  side and be caught with poppies. I'll have three—"
               Milly leaned back in her chair in resignation; but she was spared the impending
                  avalanche of modes by the entrance of a servant bearing an immense basket of
                  flowers, which he placed on the table before her. Maud looked at the blossoms,
                  remarked that the violets would be lovely in a tulle dress, while Milly was in
                  ecstastics over the beautiful gift, which filled the room with its heavenly
                  fragrance.
               "Of course, Halford sent them," said Miss Maud, who had a way of mentioning her
                  male acquaintances with a delightful freedom the reverse of lady-like, usually
                  eschewing any prefix whatever to their names.
               Milly was reading a scrap of paper folded among a cluster of rose-buds, and could
                  not listen.
               "I say," demanded Maud, in a louder key, "wouldn't you rather he'd sent you a
                  bracelet?"
               Milly came back to real life with a glow of indignation.
               "Have you no love for beautiful things—no appreciation—"
               But she checked herself; where was the good of wasting words!
               "Aren't bracelets beautiful things?" retorted Maud. "I saw a pair at Tiffany's
                  yesterday that were perfectly adorable. They were shaped like this—why don't you
                  look, Milly?"
               But Milly was reading again the single line written on the slip of paper, and
                  Maud's words fell upon deaf ears. The young lady crept softly behind her cousin
                  and, peeping over her shoulder, read aloud,
               "'Sweets to the sweet!' Not a thing else. If that isn't downright silly in
                  Halford!"
               Milly turned upon her in extreme wrath. "You are the rudest girl without
                  exception, Maud, that it was ever my ill fortune to meet. The idea that you could
                  read another person's note!"
               "I'm not at all rude, and you need not get a convulsion because I read a little
                  foolish scrap like that. I only did it for the fun of seeing you in a towering
                  rage."
               "Very poor fan, Maud, and very unladylike. A sort that I don't appreciate. Be good
                  enough not to attempt it with me again."
               "I shall do it whenever it suits me! You are not Miss Pompey the Great if you are
                  going to be married," said Maud, flushing with anger. "You think no one can
                  possibly be engaged but yourself; but I warn you I shall not be put down by your
                  airs and graces. I shall not endure it—there!"
               "My dear Maud, you are as foolish as you are rude," said Milly in her loftiest
                  tones, and, feeling that her patience was leaving her, took her huge basket of
                  flowers and went to her own apartment to enjoy them and her tender thoughts of the
                  giver in peace.
               "Nasty thing!" muttered the elegant Miss Maud when she found herself alone.
                  "Sweeping out of the room as if she was an English duchess, and I the dust under
                  her feet. I hate her; I'm sure I do. She shall never queen it over me—living
                  dependent upon mamma. I would like to remind her of it when Mr. Halford is here,
                  only mamma is quite on her side, and ought to be ashamed of herself. I hate them
                  all, and wish I had upset the basket and stepped on the flowers—shabby things for
                  a present, any way—I quite hope he's stingy."
               She appeared to find a certain consolation in this idea, and went away up stairs
                  to tease a poor seamstress who was making a dress for her; and by way of a vent
                  for her ill humor of the morning, she made that much abused creature take off all
                  the flounces of her robe and place them anew.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               MILLY'S DREAM.
               THE Lenten days glided on—such sweet, calm, beautiful days to Milly, though she
                  sometimes half reproached herself for not being so grave and sedate as the
                  requirements of the penitential season demanded. But it was very difficult to
                  remember her short-comings in the first ecstasy of her happiness, though she tried
                  hard to be thankful and to recollect whence this great joy came; so, perhaps, she
                  did not put the period to such bad use, after all.
               Constance Worthington, having no special dream or unusual cause for elation, flung
                  herself violently into a rigid observance of Lent: never missed a single church
                  service, early or late, and sternly refused bonbons or indulgences of any sort; so that, owing to her state of
                  mind and Milly's constant new calls upon her time, the two girls saw less of each
                  other at this season than they had been in the habit of doing.
               At least every other day Milly would find leisure to go up to St. Alban's as well
                  as her friend; and it was very easy for her to pray and be grateful during these
                  weeks; but Halford either accompanied her or else met her on the way; and this was
                  reward enough to make her feel that Lenten observances, so far from being a
                  trouble, were a great pleasure; and she wondered that so many people dreaded the
                  season. The quiet, too, was so delightful: no balls, no rushing about night after
                  night; occasional visits to the theatre or opera, where Halford always sat by her
                  side; now and then tranquil concerts or receptions, at which he could talk to her
                  almost as unrestrainedly as at home; and, better than all, long evenings in Aunt
                  Eliza's drawing-room with her lover, when nobody besides Mrs. Remsen was there,
                  and she careful not to let the young people feel her presence a restraint. Oh, it
                  was a bright, lovely period, and Milly wished that Lent might last until it was
                  time to go into the country. But she only expressed her opinions once to
                  Constance, for that rigid young woman treated her to a severe lecture, mentioning
                  several dry books which she thought Milly had better read; and the very names of
                  them made poor Milly yawn, and Constance's sermon did not prick her conscience so
                  vitally as it ought to have done. But she was not vexed—she could not be angry
                  with any body just now—only she decided to keep her theories to herself, and let
                  Constance go her way. At this time it was Milly's creed—young girls are fond of
                  creeds—that religion was meant to make people happy, and she did not think it had
                  that effect upon her friend; though, in truth, Constance found as much excitement
                  in her new rigidities as Milly did in her dreams; and the two were just a pair of
                  children, with whom any new feeling must necessarily become an enthusiasm.
               Milly's wish to have the engagement kept a secret was complied with so far as any
                  actual announcement was concerned; but most people had their own suspicions on the
                  subject, and Minerva Lawrence occasionally teased her to make a frank
                  confession.
               "How long do you mean to insist on this impenetrable mystery, little pigeon?"
                  Halford asked her one day. "I invent as many excuses for talking to you in public
                  as if we were surrounded by unheard-of dangers, and when I come here of a morning
                  I double as cautiously as a hunted hare."
               Milly laughed at his nonsense, but it pleased her, nevertheless.
               "There's no necessity for telling people yet," she said; "we know, and Aunt Eliza
                  knows; the matter doesn't concern any body else."
               "One's friends have a way of thinking that it is exactly such affairs which
                  concern them vitally," he replied.
               "I don't want them told yet," she pleaded.
               "I believe the child is ashamed of her fetters," he exclaimed, laughingly, as he
                  kissed the white hand whereon glittered the sapphire ring he had placed there with
                  words which still made Milly's heart flutter each time she regarded the pretty
                  bauble.
               "Oh, Mr. Halford—"
               "To whom is she speaking?" interrupted he, addressing a statuette of Apollo on the
                  mantel.
               "I mean—Kenneth," said she, slyly.
               "Ah, I know him! Very well, sweetheart: what was to be the conclusion of that
                  pathetic appeal?"
               "You know that isn't why I don't want people told—you do know it is not,
                  please?"
               "I am beginning to have serious doubts," said he, with mock gravity. "Unless you
                  tell me the real reason, I shall be obliged to think you are ashamed of me."
               "You are as wicked as you can live!" cried Milly.
               He could never be content without making her put each most tender feeling and
                  maiden fancy into words, unconscious that it was positively cruel to insist. She
                  blushed so beautifully in doing it, and the pleasure of reading her guileless soul
                  was so great that he could not resist.
               "Now is it because you think I am old?" he continued. "Milly, I saw such dreadful
                  crow's-feet under my eyes this morning!"
               "It is a downright fib—the dear eyes—the beautiful eyes!" cried Milly, laying her
                  dainty hand softly over them. "Oh, Kenneth—I can't explain—but somehow I feel as
                  if it was a sort of sacrilege to tell it all out for people to gossip over, as
                  they do every thing."
               "Such a sensitive little Milly!"
               "I can't make it clear, but I feel it! See, it's like this—the little miniature of
                  my dead mother that I wear always—I couldn't bear to let a stranger touch it, or
                  even look at it—"
               "My darling, my precious—I understand!"
               So, with her head pillowed on his breast as he folded her to his heart, she could
                  smile and talk more earnestly, though there were tears in her eyes which he was
                  obliged to kiss away, and he felt slightly remorseful for having forced her into
                  an effort to explain her shy emotions.
               "Of course every body must know—we must let them be told," she continued; "but
                  there's no hurry—say there isn't, Kenneth!"
               "None in the world, little one! There, I only wanted to tease you."
               "You had old thing!"
               "I don't believe the news will take any of our friends much by surprise," said he,
                  laughing mischievously again. "You are very wise—I have so much trouble to make
                  you talk when there's any body present that I'm afraid people will think you are a
                  victim; but I'm a foolish old chap, and show my feelings too plainly."
               "Nothing of the sort," returned Milly; "if you do care about me, you hide it
                  beautifully! Now the other night, when you talked to Miss Moore, I'm sure every
                  one thought it was she you were in love with."
               Of course, she had to be punished for such wickedness, and the morning seemed to Milly the
                  happiest she had ever spent, though, as each separate one of its predecessors
                  during the last fortnight had appeared thus in turn, perhaps, in summing up and
                  comparing the whole, she would have been at a loss to make a choice among
                  them.
               She wasted a great deal of time, undoubtedly, during these days; but though Aunt
                  Eliza was rather a martinet in her ideas of duty and the necessity of occupation,
                  she never reproved Milly now; and, indeed, it was not exactly the girl's fault.
                  Halford was at the house daily, and there were expeditions of all kinds constantly
                  on foot; so that even Mrs. Remsen was forced into idleness frequently, and seemed
                  to enjoy it. Milly did not neglect certain little duties she had long before
                  assumed: each morning she gave the children their music-lessons; and it was a
                  great saving to Aunt Eliza, as it allowed her to get on with an ordinary daily
                  governess for the rest of their small studies. She was never tired of praising
                  Milly, and the wheels of the little household rolled on velvet during those weeks.
                  Prudent and far-sighted as she was, even Mrs. Remsen forgot that the brightest sky
                  can change suddenly; and Kenneth Halford no more remembered that there were such
                  skeletons as disappointment and trouble in the world than if he had been eighteen
                  instead of a man who had lived and suffered till, at one time, he had slight faith
                  left in any quarter. His love for Milly was so totally unlike that early passion
                  which had dazzled his boyhood and left the first years of his manhood desolate
                  that he never thought of comparing the two. Indeed, the past was entirely
                  consigned to oblivion; he had long before outlived it; even his meeting with Alice
                  March-mont after that lengthened separation had failed to warm the ashes of the
                  old affection into life. He said to himself, and truly, that he was no more the
                  man who had loved her than she was the impulsive girl of whom the dreaming boy had
                  made an ideal. There was not a feeling, not a memory in his heart, which
                  interfered with his loyalty to Milly; yet he had been guilty from the first of a
                  great error. He forgot that in endowing this child with the gift of his love he
                  took her out of her childhood forever. He forgot, too, that in becoming a woman
                  she would have a woman's need and right to share his existence fully—be a part of
                  it, or, rather, allow hers so to mingle with his that the two lives would only
                  form one beautiful whole. There must be no thought which she could not share—no
                  secret left untold which could ever trouble their happiness; there was no aim or
                  care which she would not, through the might of her love, be capable of
                  comprehending. The necessity of none of these things had a place in his mind; she
                  was to be his songbird, his sunbeam, a creature kept apart from the graver
                  interests of his destiny, to rest contented on his heart and warm it by her
                  brightness. He could have seen how fallacious this idea was had it been the case
                  of another; but, like the rest of us, he was blind when the matter became
                  personal. John Worthington saw the whole truth more clearly, for a warm friendship
                  had sprung up between the two men, commencing in a similarity of tastes, and
                  cemented by the strict integrity which each acknowledged in the other. There had
                  been no confidence on Halford's part in regard to his engagement or love, but as
                  Worthington often saw him with Milly, he could not fail to suspect the truth; and
                  if he had not perceived for himself the state of affairs, Constance's frequent
                  remarks would have pointed it out.
               "I wish Milly would tell me, uncle," she said several times, in discussing her
                  suspicions; "I think she might—such good friends as we have always been."
               "My dear Con, let Milly alone," was her uncle's reply; "when your turn comes, and
                  you know how nice it is to keep such a pretty secret as long as possible, you'll
                  be glad that you did not tease her."
               "My time for such things will never come," she said, with the decision of
                  eighteen, and the amusing contempt with which an unawakened heart regards the
                  weaknesses of others. "I don't mean to leave you."
               "Very well; I am glad to keep you—don't forget," he said, laughing.
               "There is no danger. Besides, I'm studying German; if Milly would only have taken
                  it up too, as I begged, she wouldn't have had leisure for any nonsense."
               "German is a very good thing," said Worthington, with preternatural gravity,
                  though Constance was too much in earnest to observe that it was a little
                  overdone.
               "I should think it was," returned she. "But Milly never did have patience to
                  study."
               "My dear, I fancy that Milly is busy, too, with a new language, and a more
                  engrossing one than German, though it comes so easy that I dare say she can even
                  think in it without difficulty."
               "Oh, now you are laughing!" cried Constance. "Well, I do think it's foolish of
                  her, all the same; and only just before she went to Europe she told me she should
                  never marry—told me so with her own lips," continued Constance, with great energy,
                  as if that method of imparting information was so unusual that it had added
                  solemnity to the declaration.
               "Ah, you see somebody else's lips have convinced her that she spoke rashly," he
                  said.
               "I don't like it all the same," returned Constance, with an injured air. "I don't
                  think people ought to announce a determination until they have given it so much
                  thought that there is no possibility of their changing."
               "Oh, Con, Con!" cried her uncle, with a burst of irrepressible laughter, "I shall
                  have to remind you of this sometime—when you get through with your German."
               "Then I shall have something else to occupy me," said Constance, with a little air
                  of superiority periority too innocent to be disagreeable. "Only yesterday I told
                  Milly one ought always to be busy, and she said she thought it was nice to be
                  lazy—she actually did, uncle!"
               "Jupiter Ammon, what a horrible confession!"
               "Now you are teasing again; and, indeed, I am in earnest! I am so fond of Milly,
                  and I hardly ever see her now!"
               "Be patient, little one, and, above all, unselfish! You've not lost your friend;
                  give her time to get accustomed to her new happiness, and she will love you better
                  than ever."
               "And she has such odd ideas about Lent," added Constance, dropping her voice to a
                  solemn whisper.
               "What heretical opinion has she expressed? I thought my old friend, Mrs. Remsen,
                  had taught her Church doctrines very carefully."
               "Oh, Milly is good—so good—I don't mean that!"
               "Then what did she say that troubled you as to the ideas she entertains in regard
                  to Lent?"
               "Why, that people ought to be just as happy as possible whenever they could—"
               "I agree with Milly, my dear."
               "Yes, but that one could show as much gratitude in Lent by being happy as by going
                  to service twice a day. Now, uncle, when Lent means—means—that is, when it is the
                  season for repentance and penance and—"
               "And thinking very charitably of our neighbors, my dearest."
               "Oh, uncle!" cried Constance, blushing scarlet.
               "You would not intentionally do otherwise: but, my child, we can't judge for
                  others."
               "Yes, I know, and I don't mean to. But when I wanted her not to touch bonbons or go to the theatre—it was so little to
                  do!"
               "Because you wanted it?"
               "No; because—oh yes, I'm afraid it was partly for that," she answered,
                  remorsefully.
               "My dear, go to church all you can without neglecting other duties—that is right.
                  Give up amusements and indulgences—that is right, too; but it is not a sin for
                  Milly to eat sugar, and I don't believe that sitting through a play will prevent
                  her being thankful."
               "I see now—I was judging her! Oh dear, and I was trying so hard to be good!" said
                  Constance, disconsolately.
               "Don't try quite so hard: that's all. I mean, don't hunt up all sorts of ideas to
                  prick yourself with, and don't run the risk of paying so scrupulously the tithe of
                  mint and cummin that you forget the weightier matters of the law. I hold to every
                  Church observance—to its full rites and ceremonies; but don't keep Lent so rigidly
                  that you exasperate yourself into uncharitableness toward those who do not feel
                  the necessity to keep it just according to your ideas, or even just to the
                  letter."
               "I'll go and tell Milly how wicked I have been; that will punish me," said
                  Constance, feeling herself a terrible sinner.
               "I don't think I would use so harsh a word," her uncle replied. "And now put on
                  your bonnet and walk a little way with me, and forget for half an hour that it is
                  Lent."
               Constance was happier by the time they returned to the house than she had been for
                  weeks, and her uncle's kind explanations cleared her mind of sundry small doubts,
                  and she ceased to consider herself utterly hardened and lost because she could not
                  help regretting the bonbons—her special
                  weakness—which she had vowed not to touch until Easter Monday.
               It chanced that this same evening Worthington encountered Halford at the club,
                  where that gentleman had strayed after his usual visit to Mrs. Remsen's, and the
                  two had a pleasant talk in a quiet corner. The conversation wandered, as the
                  conversation of men of all ages will, toward the opposite sex; and Kenneth
                  Halford's opinions in regard to love and marriage showed Worthington plainly what
                  the feelings were with which he had entered into his engagement—always supposing
                  that matters had gone as far as that.
               "I don't understand," Halford said, in answer to a remark of his companion's. "I
                  have always thought that there was a great deal of nonsense in the talk about the
                  danger of disparity of age."
               "I don't consider that the danger lies in the disparity of age; it is in the lack
                  of common tastes and sympathies."
               "But I hold that a man should teach a wife to acquire his. One could not do this
                  with a woman already formed in mind and thought, accustomed to the world; but
                  suppose a man chose a young girl—a child in heart until his affection awakened
                  it—the case is different."
               "Altogether different."
               "Don't you believe, then, that a man could train insensibly, and develop mind and
                  soul according to his ideas?"
               "He might, assuredly."
               "You say it in a doubtful tone."
               "Not doubtful as regards the fact."
               "How, then?"
               "I was thinking of the young girl."
               "But if she was loved, cared for, made happy?"
               "All right! But suppose she suffered under this training and development—that she
                  learned to chafe at the knowledge that her husband considered her a child?"
               "Her very innocence and ignorance would prevent that."
               "My dear friend, she would not remain a child."
               Halford smiled compassionately, really pitying the old bachelor's lack of
                  knowledge.
               "I think," he said, "that one occasionally meets a character which will always
                  retain that happy faculty—not a girl of little mind, either—full of beautiful
                  capabilities which the man she loves may foster without disturbing the child-like
                  spirit which made her chief attraction to him in the beginning."
               
               "I can only say that I think the man would have to go very carefully to work,"
                  John Worthington replied.
               "Of course," said Halford, confidently.
               "I think you mean that this imaginary wife should be kept apart from her husband's
                  actual life—content with that—having, in fact, only a partial love—"
               "Fondly loved and cherished."
               "I can only say that it seems to me she would probably discover this lack in her
                  life, and either rebel or suffer silently, according to her nature."
               "But there would be no lack."
               "I beg your pardon; according to my view of marriage, there would. I think that,
                  to have any hope of happiness, husband and wife must be literally one—not even a
                  care left unshared."
               "But it is just those annoyances I would keep from her."
               "They are not annoyances when they have a place in the mind of the man she
                  loves—she would feel them as she would feel that she was shut out from his inmost
                  self, and the knowledge would make her wretched."
               "That might hold good in the case of a woman who had lived and suffered; but the
                  example I am imagining is a very different creature."
               "She must grow a woman in her turn."
               "Yes, but of another sort from the 
                     wordly
                     worldly
                   creatures one meets."
               "Humph! A fairy! Well, my dear fellow, I'm afraid that, however carefully you
                  guarded the elf in an enchanted palace, some chill wind from without would sweep
                  in and transform her into an earthly being, with a strong determination to be
                  considered such."
               Again Halford smiled compassionately; Worthington saw it, but offered no remark.
                  The conversation was confined to such generalities that his attempt at warning did
                  not strike home; but he perceived that if it had been ever so closely pointed it
                  would have failed to produce any effect.
               "I would advise a man to reflect well," he said, quietly. "It is a solemn
                  responsibility to take a human destiny into one's hands—above all, the kind of
                  butterfly creature you mean—a butterfly with a soul; if it was an ordinary one,
                  she might be happy enough."
               "But it is the fact of her possessing a soul which would make her charming."
               "'Just so—and which would give her capabilities for suffering, too."
               "I have failed, I see, to make my meaning clear."
               "I understand your idea perfectly; and though an ancient bachelor, little skilled
                  in the nature of butterflies with souls, I repeat that I consider such a marriage
                  a great risk."
               "You think the man would not be happy?"
               "I don't think about him; but I fear that the butterfly-wife would suffer, and her
                  wings droop and fade, and the suddenly awakened soul cry out dismally in wrath and
                  pain." He stopped and laughed a little at his own fanciful imagery, as we all do
                  when conscious of having ventured beyond commonplaces; then felt ashamed of the
                  weakness, and added,
               "I don't know why I should laugh; I mean every word."
               "It is very pretty, but I should not be afraid. I think I perceive a way of
                  avoiding a single shadow."
               "Then you have solved a secret which might have puzzled Solomon; I congratulate
                  you," said Worthington, dryly.
               "I'm afraid it did sound conceited," Halford answered, for he was sensitive about
                  laying himself open to any such charge.
               "No, but overconfident; I, at my age, should call it a trace of youth, though I
                  suppose you consider yourself years beyond that."
               "Upon my word, I think I am growing young nowadays."
               "Take care, or I shall believe you have found the fairy."
               "And if I had?"
               "Then I'd say, heartily, God bless you both! You're a good man, Halford—a very
                  good man! But when you do catch the butterfly, remember my caution about hurting
                  her wings."
               "Oh yes; but you see my theory is so clear."
               "Heavens and earth!" cried John Worthington, "I'm not likely ever to marry; but if
                  I should, it will not be upon a theory."
               Halford laughed, and dismissed the subject; indeed it was idle, he felt, to pursue
                  it; Worthington was a very wise man, but this was a matter outside of his
                  comprehension. So they went into the smoking-room, and on the way Halford
                  said,
               "Have you any idea when we shall see Mrs. Marchmont back?"
               "Not the slightest—don't think she knows herself. "She writes me occasionally; we
                  are very old friends, you know."
               "Oh yes; she has an immense esteem for you."
               John Worthington smothered a sigh. Esteem—it was all very well so far as it went;
                  he was past forty, and could expect nothing more from any woman, but it seemed
                  very little, and the word sounded very cold. But this was an unmanly bit of
                  weakness; so he hastened to put it by, and say cheerfully,
               "I shall be glad to see her back! I always feel that parties at my house are a sad
                  failure without her."
               "A charming woman—a remarkable woman—"
               "Not like your fairy, eh?" but though he said this, Worthington believed in his
                  heart that Halford would never have relinquished Alice Marchmont if there had been
                  the least hope of winning her—as if any man would! Worthington thought.
               "Not a happy woman, I sometimes think," Halford said.
               Worthington's fears on this subject grew stronger each day, but he had no mind to
                  acknowledge them even to his friend.
               "She is variable and capricious," he said; "but the only wonder is that the
                  adulation she receives has not spoiled her more."
               "Nature seemed never to weary of heaping on her the gifts that would bring this
                  about," Halford replied. "I never saw so beautiful a woman, nor so clever a
                  one."
               How the pale, proud face rose before John Worthington's fancy! The smile, half
                  mocking, half sad, thrilled across his soul; the passionate light of the great
                  brown eyes lit his imagination into a glow; but the vision must be put aside!
               There was a little more idle talk; then he bade Halford farewell, and walked
                  homeward through the still night, thinking that, in spite of fame, of gratified
                  ambition, wealth, all the gauds which had glittered so bravely to his sight in
                  youth, life looked cold and empty; and even his scorn of his own weakness, his
                  stern sense of right, which led him to regard the complaint almost as a sin, could
                  not thrust the disheartening consciousness entirely from his mind.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               FINDING THE CLUE.
               ALL this time people heard of Mrs. Marchmont as brightening the Lenten dullness of
                  Washington by her presence, working sad havoc among foreign diplomats, and
                  creating dire confusion in the minds of stately old senators who ought to have
                  been years past the possibility of such weakness. But they were men; so that
                  period would never arise, if they lived until the age of Methusaleh; and the musty
                  proverb, "No fool like an old one," is as replete with truth as it was on the day
                  of its first utterance.
               The French baron had gone on to the capital also, and his name was often mentioned
                  in connection with that of the fascinating widow, and bets were made at the New
                  York and the Union as to the chance of the baron's winning the prize. Of course,
                  in this age there is nothing about which men do not lay wagers, from the truth of
                  the Bible to the probability of some friend's grandmother living the week out.
               Richard Faulkner listened to the various reports of Mrs. Marchmont's triumphs, and
                  ground his teeth when they described her as gayer and more fascinating than ever.
                  He was not a man easily to relinquish a well-formed resolution; a certain dogged
                  obstinacy that lay at the bottom of his impulsiveness had been, in a great
                  measure, the secret of his success; and seldom had a stronger emotion found a
                  place in the pandemonium which he called a heart than his passion for Alice
                  Marchmont. It is revolting to write; but, to render my narrative clear, I must set
                  down the exact truth in regard to the people whose characters I wish to make plain
                  to you.
               After her hasty departure, he recovered sufficiently from the rage and trouble
                  into which he had been thrown by her outwitting him, and escaping his clutches at
                  the very instant when he believed that his plans were culminating, to get back his
                  usual clear-sightedness and determination to get to the bottom of any affair which
                  puzzled him. How had she raised the money? that was the thought which scarcely
                  left his mind even during his busiest hours in the Gold-room, or while weaving his
                  numberless webs to catch the unwary in the solitude of his private office. He
                  understood exactly the state of her affairs; there was not a detail of her
                  embarrassments with which the past season had not made him familiar; for, after
                  having once trusted him, it had been a great relief to know there was somebody
                  with whom she could talk freely. How had she raised the money? A score of possible
                  devices—several of them founded on that lack of faith in honor and virtue which
                  grew naturally out of his own baseness—suggested themselves in turn; but prone as
                  he was to think evil, each idea had to be rejected in turn because his keen
                  common-sense showed him its impracticability.
               The small Hebrew was an old friend of Faulkner's; indeed, he possessed a certain
                  hold over the bulbous-nosed Jew, as he did over most people with whom
                  circumstances rendered him intimate. It was he who had made the Israelite and Mrs.
                  Marchmont acquainted; and he was cognizant of every business arrangement between
                  them, even to the troublesome lien which Herman held upon her jewels. Many a time
                  he had secretly laughed at what the proud woman must suffer from those weekly
                  visits of the distressed but virtuous widow, to make sure that no false play was
                  attempted in regard to the diamonds. The same espionage pursued Mrs. Marchmont
                  during her sojourn in Washington, and Faulkner knew it. The Jew had behaved fairly
                  enough, actually intrusting a larger portion of the gems to her guardianship
                  during her absence, but not running the slightest risk thereby. He possessed a
                  daughter who was the happy and fleshy spouse of a Washington clothes-dealer; and
                  this amiable woman gratified her parent by enacting the part of the distressed
                  widow twice a week, while Mrs. Marchmont dazzled the old senatorial owls by her
                  presence in their city.
               With all this knowledge, it was not difficult for Faulkner to discover before a
                  great length of time the precise means whereby Mrs. Marchmont obtained a
                  sufficient sum to repay him, and give herself a temporary relief from other
                  pressing creditors. So much was clear; she had persuaded John Worthington to lend
                  his powerful name to a bit of stamped paper; but the certainty of the method she
                  had employed to release herself from her embarrassments did not materially aid
                  Master Richard in those schemes for revenge which he plotted—not with cold-blooded
                  fiendishness, but animated by a sense of personal injury none the less strong
                  because it was unreal and ridiculous.
               
               He watched; he waited; for, even with the sight of John Worthington's signature to
                  make the affair plain, there was a host of vague suspicions in his mind which
                  would not be allayed. Now I might make a very sensational chapter indeed just
                  here; I might describe Faulkner hunting up a skillful burglar, who, for a
                  sufficient reward, would break into Mrs. Marchmont's house, get possession of a
                  writing-desk which contained a diary wherein she set down each night the day's
                  events, and where the details of the forgery were described as elaborately as if
                  they had been stage directions for acting a drama. Perhaps that coup would be a little coarse and vulgar, not exactly
                  suited to the highest rules of dramatic romance; but there are others which would
                  serve: you see, I am unwilling that any body should accuse me of a lack of
                  invention or ability to work out a stirring plot. The Hebrew's spouse, with a
                  genius for histrionics, might have been induced to try a new rôle, or Dick might
                  have known some wronged maiden willing to serve his ends, and overwhelm him by
                  exposure at the close of the volume. This wronged but still interesting maid
                  would, of course, have scarlet hair, green eyes, the pallid complexion of a
                  vampire, not a tinge of color in her face except the coral hue of her lips, with
                  an ophidian head, a serpentine grace and sinuosity in each movement, a strange,
                  subtile fascination which no mortal could resist, and a fondness for soliloquy
                  equal to Hamlet's. She and Faulkner would be discovered in a low, earnest
                  conversation; at the first revelation of his plot she would utter a fierce shriek,
                  changed to a soft moan by a threat from him. More talk—more shrieks. Suddenly Dick
                  would pronounce Alice Marchmont's name; the wronged but interesting maid would
                  spring to her feet with a wild, exultant cry; then immediately turn into a statue
                  for the space of five minutes. After Dick had brought her out of her perpendicular
                  trance by judicious questions, she would howl forth her tale in a paragraph of six
                  pages, in the course of which, by earnest study, one would discover that the man
                  whom she loved and loathed had deserted her for this creature Dick named. She
                  would be ready for revenge—thirsting for a draught of what modern actors term
                  "be-lood"—and would clutch the air wildly with two white hands, make frantic
                  dashes at Dick, ordering him to speak plainly, and talking so fast that she gave
                  him no opportunity to gratify her. The scene would close, leaving the injured maid
                  and Dick in a tragic attitude; and the next one would rise upon Alice Marchmont's
                  bed-chamber, with the wronged female standing in the centre of the room, her
                  costly raiment exchanged for the garb of a domestic, her scarlet hair hidden under
                  a cap; and she would do Hamlet to any extent in order to unfold the plot. Of
                  course, at this particular crisis, Mrs. Marchmont's housekeeper was in need of a
                  chamber-maid; the wronged one knew it—injured feminines always know when their
                  enemies require new servants. Arrayed in fitting guise, she would present herself
                  to the housekeeper; and here would be an opportunity to contrast the homely
                  honesty of the elder woman and the devilish craft of the younger. The avenger
                  would take her place among the band of servitors; after doing Hamlet, she would
                  search wildly—cursing a great deal all the while in blank verse—among Mrs.
                  Marchmont's secret treasures, discover a blotting-book, hold it to the light,
                  pant—gurgle—moan, and finally announce to herself in a confidential voice,
                  distinctly audible in the neighboring square, that she had solved the mystery. The
                  treacherous tissue-paper would have preserved the forged name, and the injured
                  maid would disappear from the mansion, carrying the proofs of guilt away in her
                  mysterious flight.
               But nothing so delightfully thrilling occurred; I wish there had, with all my
                  heart. But in real life events have a humiliating way of coming about in a very
                  prosaic fashion, and all sorts of trivial, absurd incidents mix themselves up with
                  the loftiest tragedy,
               Some men who belonged to the club of which John Worthington was a member invited
                  Dick to dine there one night, and Dick accepted, though the sight of the place was
                  a severe humiliation, for he had twice been blackballed when seeking admission
                  among the enviable band. He knew very well that he had to thank Worthington for
                  this slight; he had openly said that Dick Faulkner should never be permitted to
                  join a club to which he belonged. Worthington, when they chanced to meet, never
                  vouchsafed him more than a chilling salute or a few brief words, and would not
                  have gone so far as that, only Dick insisted on being elaborately civil; for his
                  desire to keep his somewhat uncertain position in society as steady as possible
                  made him determined to show that he was at least on speaking terms with the
                  honored and influential man.
               This evening he met Worthington in the card-room. There happened to be few persons
                  present besides Dick and his host, and the party seated at Worthington's
                  whist-table, which was drawn near a fire-place at one end of the apartment, quite
                  aloof from the other players. There was an empty table close by, and Faulkner and
                  his companion took possession of that to indulge in a game of écarté. Before long Dick's Amphitryon was called out
                  for a few moments, and Dick sat listening to a conversation between the four
                  gentlemen, of which he had caught some portion while talking to his companion, and
                  which had by this time grown so animated that it delayed the progress of the
                  card-dealing.
               "I tell you that no arguments could affect me," Mr. Worthington said, in that low
                  voice which was at once so gentle and so firm.
               "But perhaps I did not state my peculiar example distinctly," returned his
                  partner.
               "Yes, you did; but it makes no difference. I learned my lesson very early in
                  life—by observation though, instead of experience, fortunately for me—but it was
                  one I never forgot."
               "How so?"
               "Why, you must remember my unfortunate guardian, poor old Longford—the best man in
                  the world, and the weakest. It was nothing but indorsing his friends' bills that
                  rained him."
               "Oh yes; I recollect the whole story now; and a sad one it was."
               "You must all three recollect it," returned Worthington. "He was completely
                  ruined, and his good name went too. A better-hearted man never lived. The disgrace
                  killed him; and it was all brought about by the conduct of those he had trusted.
                  The last time I ever saw him, only a few days before his death, he told me the
                  whole story. I was little more than a boy then; and he made me promise that while
                  I lived I would not take the first step which might end in a position like
                  his."
               "Keep clear of your neighbors' paper, eh?"
               "Yes, and I have remembered it. If ever I felt tempted to yield, that old man's
                  face came up before me and held me firm."
               "It must have been deuced difficult sometimes to get rid of doing the thing,"
                  observed another of the group.
               "So it was," Mr. Worthington replied; "but I've not found the things most
                  necessary to do in this world the easiest, Van Rensslaer."
               "No, by George; I should say not."
               Then there was a little laughter to get rid of the disagreeable impression left by
                  the memories of old days which Mr. Worthington's words had called up; but he did
                  not join in the merriment: he was looking very grave, and absently playing a
                  silent tune on the table with his fingers.
               "You're an awful one for holding firm, Worthington," said his partner. "I don't
                  suppose there's so obstinate a man living, when you have once made up your
                  mind."
               "I hope that is not the exact word to apply," returned he, smiling.
               "Oh, very well; call it firmness, if you like that name better; but admit that you
                  have the organ wonderfully developed."
               "I trust so—not much chance for a man in this life who is so unfortunate as to be
                  lacking in the quality."
               "You're right there," assented Van Rensslaer."
               "But how to stick always to a resolution like that puzzles me," observed
                  another.
               "I would do any thing else for a friend. I hope, if I had only five dollars, I
                  should not refuse to divide with a person whom I called by that name; but put my
                  own to a bill for him—never—nothing would induce me."
               "But under the exceptional circumstances I have suggested," observed his
                  partner.
               "They would have no such effect," returned Worthington. "If I could raise the
                  money, I would lend it—give it, at any sacrifice, in a case like that of which you
                  spoke—but never indorse a note. No! I am as principled against it as I am against
                  gambling, intoxication—yes, theft, or the lowest vice you can name."
               "It's a good rule to lay down, but not always easy to follow, Worthington,"
                  observed one of the others.
               "I have never swerved from it," he answered; "yet I don't think any friend of mine
                  has ever called me disobliging or mean."
               "No, no," was of course the general chorus.
               Dick Faulkner leaned over the table by which he sat, and played with the rack of
                  pens.
               "It would be a good thing for some of us if we had been as wise as Mr.
                  Worthington," he said, addressing that gentleman's partner in the game—a man
                  engaged in Wall Street, like Faulkner, and not in a position to snub Dick for his
                  free and easy interruption of the conversation.
               "Yes, indeed," the other replied; and the two gentlemen at the opposite sides of
                  the card-table addressed some similar words to Dick, not sharing Worthington's
                  prejudice against him, or not caring to take the trouble to be rigid in the cause
                  of virtue if they did.
               Emboldened by his success, Faulkner addressed Mr. Worthington, partly because he
                  wished the conversation continued, partly because he wanted the next day to boast
                  that he had enjoyed that gentleman's society.
               "And you have been able to keep to your resolution without losing a friend, Mr.
                  Worthington?" he asked, wheeling his chair round so that they sat face to
                  face.
               In secret, Worthington anathematized his insolence, but, without being guilty of a
                  deliberate outrage, he could not refuse to answer; and as he never did things by
                  halves, his manner was perfectly courteous as he replied,
               "I think I may safely say that I have not lost one in my whole life from that
                  cause."
               "And yet you have held firm to your resolution?" persisted Dick.
               Mr. Worthington's silent how would have abashed a brazen image by its awful
                  dignity, but it produced no impression whatever on Faulkner. He had an end to
                  gain, and Worthington should be forced to say more, no matter what slight Dick
                  himself received in the skirmish.
               "You never in a single instance varied from your rule?" he asked.
               Mr. Worthington gave him a glance of cold surprise, enough to freeze ordinary
                  blood, but said, quietly,
               "I never varied from it in a single instance."
               "It's the most extraordinary thing I ever heard!" cried Dick, in an admiring
                  voice, appealing to the other men. "I'll lay any wager there's not a man in the
                  house at this moment who could say as much."
               "I don't believe there is," averred Worthington's partner; and the remaining pair
                  announced that they did not believe there was, either.
               "Even when you were young?" added Dick,
                  offering the suggestion so apologetically that it could not give offense—only as
                  any words he might utter—the bare fact of his existence, even—were an offense to
                  John Worthington.
               "There is no exception, sir—none," said he, rather sternly.
               "I fancy that the rest of us have been guilty of the weakness so often that we
                  should not venture to count the number of times," rejoined Dick, not exactly
                  venturing to put another question.
               "Yes, indeed," observed Mr. Worthington's partner—a thin man, with a nose like a
                  trumpet, and eyes that looked sideways, as if they could not see over
                  it—unconsciously aiding Faulkner in his desire to have a cross-examination. "You
                  are perfectly certain you have not forgotten a single lapse?"
               "My memory is very good," replied Mr. Worthington, rather stiffly. "I should not
                  have been likely to forget the circumstance."
               "You see," said Dick, with a laugh, "we can't bear to think you are so much
                  superior to ordinary humanity; I wish there had been one transgression of your
                  rule."
               "Yes, yes, Worthington," added another; "look back—search your memory—was there
                  never one violation?"
               "A small one—to oblige some friend—some lady, may be: there's a suppositious case
                  where no ordinary rules would hold good," said Dick, still laughing.
               Mr. Worthington treated him to a glance of icy contempt which made Dick wince, and
                  addressed his partner, oblivious of the impertinent remark.
               "I never in my whole life put my name to the paper of any human being," he said,
                  with extra distinctness. "So well known is my resolution, that for the past ten
                  years no man—no person—has asked me to do it, or even hinted the wish. I could not
                  express myself more distinctly, so there is nothing else to be said."
               "Just so," murmured the trumpet-nosed gentleman; and the other two men uttered the
                  same ejaculation.
               But Faulkner did not feel inclined to quit the subject, though Mr. Worthington had
                  partially turned his back upon him.
               "Not much use, then, for any body to present a forged indorsement of Mr.
                  Worthington's to a money-lender," said he, "since his rule is so well known."
               Mr. Worthington took up a pack of cards that lay by his side and asked the trio
                  generally,
               "Is it my deal?"
               "Mine," said one of the antagonists.
               "I say, any body would have pretty work trying to forge your signature,
                  Worthington," cried the trumpet-nosed man, snorting at his own wit.
               "I think so myself," he replied, smiling; "I don't suppose there's a man on
                  Manhattan Island can boast one so bad."
               "Never saw it," said the antagonist who had taken up the cards.
               "It's a lucky thing to have it peculiar in any way," added Faulkner.
               "The 'John' looks like 'gin,'" said the trumpet-nosed, with a fresh snort; "as for
                  the 'Worthington'—well, there's no words! Give us that scrap of paper and the pen
                  off the table back of you, Van Rensslaer," he continued.
               "Do you want me to exhibit my chirography?" asked Worthington, as Van Rensslaer
                  placed writing implements before him.
               He laughed and scrawled his signature; they all looked at it, Dick leaning
                  directly over his shoulder, and the laughter became general. There were a variety
                  of witty remarks and comparisons, but Dick Faulkner held his peace; he had resumed
                  his seat before Worthington looked up.
               "You're safe from the most experienced forger that ever lived," said he of the
                  trumpet.
               "I never saw but one person who could imitate my signature," Worthington
                  replied.
               "It is to be hoped that was in a quarter where you ran no danger of having it
                  tried," observed Faulkner.
               Mr. Worthington did not hear.
               "It might place you in an unpleasant box—deuced unpleasant—if it was some friend
                  who possessed the ability," continued Dick, in a louder voice; and, when this
                  remark did not seem likely to be heard any more than the previous one, added,
                  "mightn't it, Mr. Worthington?"
               "Really, as the possibility has never entered my mind, I am not prepared to answer
                  your inquiry," was the cold response.
               "My suggestion, rather," added Dick, with a bow.
               "Indeed, Faulkner's right," said Van Rensslaer. "There might arise a predicament
                  that would pose you awfully."
               "My imagination is not sufficiently brilliant to conceive it, my dear fellow,"
                  returned Worthington.
               "But suppose circumstances—fate, or whatever you please—had put your friend in a
                  tight corner," continued Dick, not to be excluded from the conversation by any
                  reasonable effort on Worthington's part; "he might be tempted to play you a shabby
                  trick."
               "By his own wickedness, then; he couldn't lay the blame on what you call fate, and
                  what I am accustomed to calling Providence," replied Worthington, with polite
                  severity.
               "All right," said the unabashed Dick. "But suppose the devil took possession of
                  this person, and tempted him to forge your name as the only way out of his
                  scrape—"
               Mr. Worthington would not interrupt; but as Faulkner made a slight pause here, he
                  hastened to rejoin,
               "Among my whole list of friends there is not one in regard to whom your
                  supposition could ever hold good; so I am relieved from the necessity of
                  contemplating it."
               "Now you're going too far!" cried Van Rensslaer; and his partner, as usual, echoed
                  his words, while Dick waited patiently. "Any body may be tempted, and some fine
                  day you may find that your friend has done your name to a tidy bit of paper, and
                  you will either be obliged to expose him or pocket the loss."
               "Just so," said his partner.
               Mr. Worthington burst out laughing.
               "Upon my word," said the owner of the trumpet, gravely, "I don't think it's a
                  laughing matter, viewed in that light."
               "It is the putting it in this light which makes it so laughable," replied
                  Worthington; "and you would say the same if I told you who the person is that
                  succeeds in imitating my scrawl."
               "Man or woman?" asked the other, from sheer idleness, and yawning because the
                  subject had lost its interest.
               "It is a lady," Mr. Worthington replied.
               "Name, name!" cried Van Rensslaer, gayly.
               "Nonsense! One would think we were a pack of college boys," said Worthington,
                  contemptuously. "I do wonder, Van, if you will ever remember that it is twice a
                  decade since you were twenty."
               "Oh, come, you needn't fling a fellow's age in his teeth," replied Van Rensslaer,
                  in his boyish way. "I insist on your telling now, because it must be a good joke
                  by your laughing."
               "Decidedly the best of the season," said Worthington. "I'll tell the lady herself
                  of it before you sometime."
               "I know," whispered the trumpet-nosed, bending toward his opposite neighbor. "It
                  is Mrs. Marchmont; she's the only woman in the world he ever takes the trouble to
                  visit."
               "Hush!" Worthington said.
               Faulkner did not appear to have caught the laughing whisper or Mr. Worthington's
                  grave remonstrance; he was comparing his watch with the clock on the mantle, and
                  looking ruefully at the table he had left, as if regretting his friend's prolonged
                  absence.
               "But I was right!" persisted Worthington's partner.
               "Yes; and now drop the subject, Livingston. Did you say it was your deal? We'll
                  win this rubber and be done for to-night. Just set the inkstand out of the way,
                  will you, Van?"
               As he spoke he crumpled the page whereon he had written his name, and flung it
                  upon the hearth near which he sat. The four returned to the business of the hour;
                  Dick Faulkner rose and sauntered up and down the room till his friend came back,
                  full of excuses for his delay.
               "It's no matter," Dick said; "but I must move homeward now; it is getting
                  late."
               "I'll walk with you," the other replied.
               They left the room together. As Faulkner was going, he took a cigar-case from his
                  pocket, extracted a Havana, went to the fire, and lighted it, picking up for that
                  purpose the paper which Mr. Worthington had thrown on the hearth, twisting the
                  remainder in his hand as he walked on, apparently unconscious that he had retained
                  it.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               THE FIRST SHADOW.
               MILLY'S bright days remained cloudless until Lent closed, and Easter ushered in
                  its season of rejoicing. Then Mrs. Marchmont returned from Washington as
                  unexpectedly as she went away, not having given any intimation of her plans even
                  in the gay, amusing letters with which she indulged John Worthington during her
                  absence. Back she came, with her gorgeous beauty, the strange glamour in her eyes,
                  and the proud lips that uttered such bitter speeches at one moment, and the next
                  brightened with such bewildering smiles that the gloom seemed only an outward
                  shadow instead of proceeding from trouble within.
               Worthington called at her house the day after her arrival, and was shocked and
                  alarmed at the change in her appearance; but she was already surrounded by a group
                  of her friends and admirers, so that he had no opportunity to ask troublesome
                  questions. She had grown thin; but it was not that so much as the expression of
                  her face which caused the alteration. She had not fallen off, so far as beauty was
                  concerned, and her spirits seemed as high as ever; but it was a gayety which
                  jarred upon him, for he felt that it was factitious. She talked a great
                  deal—related a score of anecdotes at the expense of her Washington adorers, and
                  the idiots about her—as John Worthington mentally called them—laughed and
                  applauded, not observant enough to notice the change either in appearance or
                  manner, or, if they did notice, too selfish to think about it, since, whether ill
                  or troubled, she was still able to play her usual part in the tiresome old
                  game.
               Mrs. Lawrence had recommenced her weekly receptions as soon as Lent ended; and
                  though this first one, which was to take place the evening after Alice Marchmont's
                  return, was a musical affair, the certainty of a good supper brought the customary
                  crowd.
               Halford was there before Milly's arrival; and, after searching for her in vain, he
                  went up stairs into the card-rooms to see whom he could find, as the music had
                  ceased for a little, and the familiar salons looked desolate without the presence
                  of his rose-bud.
               "She isn't here yet," Mrs. Lawrence said, chancing to meet him near the foot of
                  the stairs. "I suppose the place seems empty."
               "With this crowd?" he asked, not 
                     chosing
                     choosing
                   to understand her words.
               "That's the comfort of a large house," said she, complacently; "one can invite
                  one's friends without running the risk of their suffocating."
               "And I believe you have more friends than any other woman in the world," returned
                  he.
               
               "I ought to have plenty; I like my species! I like you, too, though you're not a
                  bit confidential—it's shabby of you."
               "I thought I was frankness itself," said he.
               "Oh, indeed! But I'm not blind—not quite," returned Minerva, as if there was a
                  probability of her soon becoming so. "I can see as far as most folk, and you may
                  be silent, and Milly look innocent, and Eliza Remsen purse up her mouth—she always
                  had an ugly mouth, though she doesn't believe it—but I know what is going on."
               "Really, your discernment is appalling! You make me afraid," he said, and got away
                  as rapidly as possible.
               Up stairs in the chamber next the boudoir where he had told his secret to Milly,
                  he came upon Mrs. Marchmont. She had just left the dressing-room, and stopped
                  there for an instant's solitude before encountering the crowd below. She stood
                  leaning against the window, from which she had pushed the curtains back, gazing
                  out into the garden beneath, where the leafless trees sighed and waved their
                  branches in the night-wind, and the moon, half obscured by clouds, rushed swiftly
                  up the sky as if trying to escape the gloom which threatened utterly to overwhelm
                  her. As Halford saw her, he was as much struck as Worthington had been by the
                  change in her face: it showed very plainly as she stood there unconscious of
                  observation. Such diverse emotions swept like shadows over her countenance, and
                  dimmed the splendor of her eyes, that he was fairly startled. But he moved quickly
                  forward; she caught the sound of his step, and turned to meet the intruder,
                  whosoever it might be, schooling her features into the haughty quiet which had
                  grown their habitual expression.
               "How do you do, Mr. Halford?" she said, holding out her hand; but though she
                  smiled, and added pleasant inquiries, it seemed to her listener that she spoke
                  with an effort, as if in reality too listless and weary even to be glad at this
                  meeting with an old friend.
               "Are you well?" he asked.
               "Perfectly. I have forbidden any body's asking; it is so humiliating always to be
                  obliged to confess myself in rude health!"
               "Upon my word, you don't look it," he said.
               "Never mind my looks; those weeks in Washington were enough to make any angel grow
                  plain. But you have been a runaway, too, somebody told me. The idea of your being
                  as near to me as Baltimore, and not coming on to the odious capital!"
               "I should have liked it exceedingly," he replied, "but I was too much engaged to
                  spare even a few hours from my business."
               "Don't mention the horrid word! I don't allow it uttered in my hearing any
                  longer."
               "There seems to be a variety of things that you have forbidden," he said, smiling.
                  "As I have not seen you for some time, you will have to give me a list, so that I
                  may not ignorantly transgress."
               "I would forbid every earthly subject, if I could only find new ones—heavenly or
                  otherwise. I have heard every thing discussed till my patience is exhausted," she
                  replied; but, gayly as she spoke, it struck him, as it had John Worthington, that
                  her spirits were more unreal and unnatural than ever. "Who is down stairs—just the
                  old set, I suppose? How nice it must have been to have lived in the Reign of
                  Terror! One had new faces each day in prison; and an hour's flirtation gained a
                  new piquancy by the reflection that a stroke of the guillotine at the end of it
                  would prevent one's admirer ever growing tiresome."
               "Washington seems to have had a bad effect on your mind," he said, not half liking
                  the talk.
               "On my manners, at least," she replied. "Though I did not bore myself too much;
                  sometimes it was rather pleasant—a change, at all events; and that's the one
                  blessing life offers."
               "So the baron followed you?"
               "Of course—as you would have done if you had not been the most perfidious and
                  fickle of men. What nonsense I am talking! I really forgot it was you, my good old
                  Kenneth. Have you been here long?"
               "No; I only came a few moments ago; every body that I cared to talk with was busy,
                  so I wandered up stairs to see who was to be found."
               "Every body! That always means one body. So she was busy, and could not so much as
                  give you a word—poor man! Did you catch sight of my baron? He has no business to
                  be late, because I expressly ordered him to come early."
               "And so waited until near midnight before arriving yourself?"
               "Exactly! I thought he would get tired, and go off before I appeared. The poor
                  baron—he really is a nicer creature than one would believe."
               "So he is the present victim?"
               "Oh, he'll never be a victim to any body or any thing, unless it be tobacco. And
                  you—aren't you a victim yet?"
               "I think not—"
               He stopped, for at that instant a face glanced in at the door-way—a girl's face,
                  looking very youthful and pretty framed among the silken draperies; but it
                  disappeared before Mrs. Marchmont could remark what attracted his attention.
                  Several people from the inner room entered just then, and Halford took advantage
                  of their appearance to hasten away in search of Milly.
               He did not find her, though; and presently Mrs. Marchmont met him in the
                  card-room, and of course he offered his arm down stairs.
               Milly had left her aunt for a moment talking to some acquaintance, and had passed
                  through the suite of upper rooms for the express pleasure of glancing into her
                  beloved boudoir. She loved that chamber better than any spot in the whole world;
                  there was no haunt which held a memory so enthralling as that of the night when
                  Kenneth Halford put his heart into words, and led her away into the full glory of
                  the magic land. On her way she fell upon the little tableau—innocent enough, but
                  somehow not a pleasant one to her—Mrs. Marchmont looking full in Halford's face
                  with those speaking eyes, and he bending toward her with a deference and attention
                  which of late Milly had not been accustomed to see him bestow upon any one but
                  herself. She felt a little guilty, too, as if she had intruded upon a scene not
                  meant for her observation—stricken suddenly by the idea that he might think she
                  had watched, or that a hint of their engagement might already have reached Mrs.
                  Marchmont, and she with her careless tongue sting Halford by some such
                  insinuation.
               Milly flew off to the dressing-room to have a moment to herself, telling Aunt
                  Eliza a fib as she passed—that she had forgotten her handkerchief, though the fib
                  was unnecessary, for Aunt Eliza was talking comfortably, and ready to wait as long
                  as Milly pleased before entering upon the lofty enjoyment of the classical music
                  which once more surged up from the apartments below. But Milly uttered her little
                  untruth, and fled on to the retirement of the dressing-room. Luckily it was
                  empty—even the maid in attendance had temporarily absented herself; so she had an
                  opportunity to try and calm the agitation caused by the picture she had so
                  unwittingly studied. She remembered her old fears of Mrs. Marchmont, fears so
                  quickly allayed by her departure that they had lain forgotten until now; but they
                  rushed back, and it required some time for Milly to recover the beaming content
                  which had been her portion of late. Presently she could think of the dear words
                  Halford had spoken in that little chamber; of the weeks of happiness which had
                  followed, and was ready to laugh at her own folly—as if any human being could come
                  between her and her bliss, as if any mortal occurrence could ever really disturb
                  it!
               She returned to the card-room, and found her aunt; but Mrs. Remsen was so deep in
                  conversation that Milly had to wait, and it was tiresome, now that she was cager
                  to meet Halford and atone for her momentary irritation by increased sweetness and
                  amiability.
               "Now I'll go," Mrs. Remsen said, at last. "Are you completely out of patience,
                  Milly?"
               "Oh no; but I do like music, you know."
               "Exactly," laughed Mrs. Remsen, as she took the girl's arm and led her away; "it
                  is to listen to the music that you are anxious to go down stairs."
               "Now, if you tease me my cheeks will get scarlet," pleaded Milly.
               "Then I'll do it; for it is very becoming."
               "Oh, please—I shall look like a goose!"
               "So you are—a dear little goose! But mercy on us, what a crowd there is! I believe
                  Minerva Lawrence is never satisfied unless she fills her house till one can't
                  breathe."
               "But the music is very fine," Milly said.
               "I dare say. I'm not musical, further than to like your singing, Puss. If I must
                  have concerts, I prefer them in a room built for the purpose."
               Milly was accustomed to hearing her aunt and Mrs. Lawrence indulge in such thrusts
                  at each other's expense; but she knew they were good friends all the same, and
                  neither of them would have allowed any one else the liberty of abusing her old
                  school-companion.
               "It's like going into a furnace," sighed Aunt Eliza, as they reached the foot of
                  the stairs. "Oh, Minerva will be a fool if she lives to be a hundred! I never
                  endured any thing like it."
               Unfortunately for the good resolutions Milly had so lately been making, the very
                  first sight that met her eyes as she entered the drawing-rooms was Mrs. Marchmont
                  with a crowd about her, from which she was just turning away with her usual ease
                  and indifference, and taking Halford's arm for a promenade between the pieces.
                  Worst of all, he was so much occupied that he did not notice Milly's entrance. She
                  was not a fool, even in her love and her exacting disposition. When she reflected
                  upon the matter, she knew very well that a man was to have a little use of his
                  eyes and cars for old acquaintances, though he might be engaged. Many a time she
                  had laughed at girls for indulging in silly tempers concerning things of the same
                  sort; but that did not remove the sudden chill which struck her when she saw Alice
                  Marchmont leaning on Halford's arm, and glancing up in his face with those
                  wonderful eyes which would look as if they were meaning a great many things that
                  they did not.
               It is very well to theorize about such trifles, as Milly herself had often done in
                  the plenitude of her untried wisdom; but a case which appealed directly to her own
                  feelings was a different matter, as you or I might discover under similar
                  circumstances. She followed her aunt with a cold pressure at her heart, a
                  breathless sensation, an inexplicable sickening thrill which made her absolutely
                  faint, and very glad to sink into a seat.
               As if her disagreeable thoughts were not annoyance enough, Adelaide Ramsay must
                  needs come up and hiss venomous whispers into Milly's ears under cover of the
                  music, which kept her words from reaching Mrs. Remsen; for Adelaide was not
                  exactly bold enough to run the risk of incurring her mother's wrath by such
                  remarks as her dislike of Milly prompted her to utter. The two cousins never made
                  the pretense of being friends, though it was not Milly's fault. Adelaide had
                  always disliked her, and now, since she suspected that the girl was soon to make a
                  brilliant marriage, fairly hated her. Indeed, she had on several occasions of late
                  been so rude that Mrs. Remsen had advised Milly to keep away from her house, and
                     even threatened her daughter with
                  Mr. Ramsay's displeasure if she did not let Milly alone. Maud had as nearly
                  betrayed the secret of the engagement as she dared, and Mrs. Ramsay could not
                  resist this opportunity of gratifying her spite.
               "Do you see Kenneth Halford and Mrs. Marchmont?" she asked, without the slightest
                  preamble or salutation.
               "I was busy listening to the music," Milly answered, civilly; "it is very
                  beautiful, isn't it?"
               "Oh, you can't put me off that way!" returned Adelaide. "You had better look after
                  Halford, I can tell you, Miss Milly."
               "Allow me to beg that you will tell me nothing of the sort," replied Milly, with a
                  good deal of quiet dignity. "It is neither a kind nor polite remark."
               "Upon my word, as Maud says, your airs lately are too much for human patience! I
                  shall tell you what I think best. Please to remember I am a married woman, and
                  your cousin."
               Milly could easily have exasperated her with a cutting answer, but it was not
                  worth the trouble; besides, she had no wish to quarrel or to dislike Mrs. Ramsay,
                  if the woman would only treat her with a show of decent feeling. So she said,
               "I am sorry you and Maud disapprove of me, but I can't help it; and I do not wish
                  you to connect my name with any man's as you did just now."
               "I beg your pardon," returned Adelaide, with an insulting laugh; "it was Mrs.
                  Marchmont's name that I connected with Halford's—and with good reason, too."
               "One that would not interest me, however important," said Milly.
               "Don't be absurd—using words like Hortense!"
               "At least Hortense is good-hearted and lady-like. Please to go away, Adelaide;
                  this is no place for a discussion."
               "Perhaps you'd better order me out of the rooms, and be done with it! Now I shall
                  say what I like, and when I like. I was speaking in all kindness; but that is the
                  way with you—you never appreciate one's motives."
               "I think I do," Milly said; then closed her lips and mentally determined not to be
                  provoked into speaking another word.
               "Every body knows Halford used to be crazy over Mrs. Marchmont years ago, when she
                  was a girl," continued Adelaide. "Dear me! I believe he tried to shoot himself
                  when he heard she was married," she added—this last clause an entire falsehood, of
                  course, born out of her desire to annoy Milly.
               "If you don't go away this instant I'll speak to aunty!" she gasped, and Adelaide
                  thought it best to retreat.
               Milly began fairly to hate this beautiful Alice, with her picturesque dress, her
                  entrancing ways, her power to sing in a theatrical, passionate fashion, and before
                  the evening was over had been pettish, and almost rude to her. Mrs. Marchmont
                  annoyed her still more by an amused forbearance, though all the same she felt an
                  inclination to punish her, as one does to punish the freaks of a spoiled child.
                  Poor Milly! Somebody came up to ask her to follow the general example of
                  promenading through the rooms while the musicians exchanged the classics for a
                  slow march. It was Charley Thorne who asked, unfortunate boy!
               "You've scarcely spoken to me for a whole week," he said, dolefully; "you never do
                  speak to me nowadays, and I know the reason; but never mind! I wish you would take
                  my arm once more—just once," he added as dismally as if he were to be ordered off
                  to execution immediately after.
               Milly's first impulse was to answer the boy sharply; then came a second
                  thought—the biting fear so quick to trouble a woman's mind, however young, that
                  some one might be looking curiously at her, might suspect her secret, notice any
                  change in her manner, and attribute it to its rightful cause. So she made poor
                  Charley—who had flung his young heart at her feet to be trodden upon in the
                  insolent, unconscious pride of her girlhood—happy by taking his arm, and walking
                  up and down the room with him.
               Then Kenneth Halford saw her with her cheeks glowing from that fear, and her eyes
                  beautified by the twofold pain in her soul. The course of the promenade brought
                  the couples close together.
               "Oh, my pretty little fairy!" said Mrs. Marchmont, holding out her hand. "I am so
                  happy to see you again."
               Milly could not bring herself to give more than two fingers and a very cold answer
                  to the lady's greeting, casting one glance toward Halford as she did so; but Mrs.
                  Marchmont intercepted the glance, fleeting as it was, and her wits—sharp as so
                  many polished daggers—comprehended the matter at once as well as if she had
                  received a whole volume of explanations.
               "You must come and see me, my blossom," she continued, talking rapidly, while
                  those swift thoughts flitted through her mind, smiling, too, at Milly's
                  stateliness, which was a little like the attempts of a pigeon to imitate a
                  peacock. "Come very soon, you and the dear aunt—is she quite well?"
               "Quite well; she is here," Milly replied, not vouchsafing Halford a second look.
                  "I think you may take me back to her, if you please, Mr. Thorne."
               Charley led her away. It was a pleasure to get her out of Halford's neighborhood,
                  if only for a few moments.
               "I haven't slept for a week," he moaned, suddenly, forgetting the silence under
                  which he had meant to shroud his griefs. Whispers in regard to Milly's engagement
                  had reached his ears, and for days he had been eagerly watching his face in the
                  glass to see if thinness and paleness gave any signs of the speedy death which he
                  believed he wanted. But it was not so easy to die uncomplainingly as he had
                  imagined, and now he turned upon Milly with that peevish confession.
               "I should go straight home, then, and go to bed," was her unfeeling answer. "We
                  must not walk any longer. They are beginning that thing of Riesiger's, and every
                  body is expected to sit down.
               Milly wanted to go back to her chair. She felt as she had sometimes done under the
                  influence of a bad dream, as if her limbs were half paralyzed and refused to move.
                  Charley Thorne wandered disconsolately away, to watch her from a distance, and
                  think his poor little dismal thoughts, and Halford came up, unconscious that any
                  thing was amiss. The look whose language had been so plain to Mrs. Marchmont was
                  lost on him—being only a man!
               "I did not see you come in," he whispered, under the cover of the thunder of two
                  violoncellos and a grand piano-forte. "How pretty you look, my little
                  blossom!"
               I suppose he could not have stumbled on two more unfortunate speeches! First, so
                  innocently to acknowledge that he had been unaware of her presence. Love was
                  making Milly imaginative and unreasonable enough for the feeling we have each
                  indulged in our turn—the expectation that a beloved is to know by intuition when
                  one approaches or is near. Then to call her by that name! She liked pet names, but
                  this was the appellation that odious woman had just given her in his hearing. It
                  grated on Milly's ear like a harsh word.
               "What made you so late?" continued Halford.
               "It is not late," replied Milly, fretfully, telling a fib to gratify her vexation;
                  for it was late, and Aunt Eliza's dilatoriness had put her in a fever a full hour
                  before they set out.
               The tone was unmistakably cross. Halford looked surprised.
               "Aren't you well?" he asked.
               "Certainly. Why should you think I am not?"
               He smiled; he had never seen her cross before, and it made her so pretty and
                     piquant that he rather liked it by way of a
                  change—for a few moments. After awhile another opportunity was given restless
                  people to walk about, and Halford turned from a conversation with Mrs. Remsen to
                  offer Milly his arm. She had three minds to refuse, but could not bring herself to
                  carry her resentment so far. Halford took pleasure in teasing her, and said a
                  dozen things at which she would have laughed in another mood; but she could not
                  laugh now. Mrs. Marchmont passed them on some man's arm, and half whispered a few
                  French words in Halford's ear so rapidly that Milly could not understand them.
               "What a pretty lilac," he said, carelessly, pointing to the trimmings on Milly's
                  over-skirt.
               He was not to blame because her unpracticed ear had not caught the hurried
                  accents, nor could she quarrel with him outright because the fascinating widow
                  chose to address him in a foreign language; but she could find fault when he gave
                  a wrong name to the tint of her bows.
               "They are lavender," she replied. "Something must have made you color-blind
                  to-night."
               "My dear child," returned he, bent on teasing her, "I pride myself on the
                  correctness of my eye—lilac, I do assure you."
               "Then Aunt Eliza and I and the dressmaker must all be blind," she answered,
                  hotly.
               He laughed again at her tone and manner, and was so determined to make her laugh
                  that at last Milly grew amiable in spite of herself. The evening would have passed
                  off tolerably, and Milly need not have felt troubled or cross again had not Mrs.
                  Marchmont chanced to meet her just before supper and utter some innocent remark
                  which turned Milly acid once more. Then it was she committed the folly of being
                  pettish, and almost rude, turning away with a few words so unlike her usual
                  gentleness that Mrs. Marchmont was surprised and offended.
               "How cross the little blossom seems!" she said, wonderingly, to John Worthington,
                  who had come in for half an hour just to meet her.
               "Perhaps you have been poaching on her manor," he answered, rather wearily; for he
                  was not in good spirits to-night.
               "What do you mean?"
               "Why, Halford has been very devoted to her all these weeks of your absence, so
                  Constance says; she fancies, too, that they are engaged."
               "Engaged—Kenneth Halford to that child?"
               "Why not?"
               "She is very pretty, to be sure, but a mere baby—and at his age! He must be
                  four-and-thirty!"
               "How dreadfully ancient!"
               "As most men live, it is. The generality of you are Methusalehs before that—too
                  old and blasé for a little innocent creature
                  like her to fancy."
               "You will please to remember my age."
               "But you don't want to make love to Milly Crofton, I suppose? Mr. Halford engaged
                  to her! Upon my word, it makes me laugh."
               Her eyes danced. She was certain that her suspicion, roused earlier in the evening
                  by Milly's manner, was correct.
               "And the goose is jealous!" she thought. "She's a pretty young bird, but she
                  musn't hiss at me like a small serpent each time I venture to look toward her
                  idol—that will never do."
               There was a confusion of epithets in the lady's mind, but the main thought was
                  very clear under them: if that girl ventured to be impertinent she must be
                  suitably punished.
               "Of course she hasn't an idea in her head," Alice went on thinking while she
                  watched Milly. "Well, it's odd how a man of Kenneth Halford's age will take a fancy to bread-and-butter
                  after ruining his digestion with all manner of forbidden eatables; but I don't
                  really believe in the engagement."
               Milly could not tell what was passing in Mrs. Marchmont's mind, or be sufficiently
                  wise to know that in a battle such as she was ready to bring on, a woman like her
                  always has every advantage over a young girl, in spite of love or ties of any
                  sort. She determined that the lady should discover that she did not mean to submit
                  to affectionate patronage, or be called names of extravagant endearment, or be
                  meddled with in any manner. Poor little Milly!
               Before the concert was over Mrs. Marchmont had Milly and Halford again brought to
                  her mind by John Worthington.
               "Just look at them as they stand there by the piano. Doesn't that look like
                  business?"
               "I do believe he is getting into mischief," said she.
               "Very pleasant mischief, I've no doubt. She is a bewitching little fairy."
               "Just a sweet, undeveloped child! So like a man! and when the child turns into a
                  woman on his hands he'll grow tired of her because she is like the rest of her
                  sex, and reproach her instead of his own folly."
               "You speak warmly," said he, rather suspiciously. "I think you prophesied this
                  very thing weeks ago, and I asked how you would like it. Is it less agreeable than
                  you fancied?"
               "How cross you are to-night!" she exclaimed. "I think I shall go home to get rid
                  of you."
               "But you didn't answer my question!"
               "I sha'n't weep over my Kenneth's desertion, if that is what you mean," she
                  answered. "But he's a good man, and she's a sweet baby. I don't like to think of
                  their making each other unhappy; but perhaps they will not."
               He felt certain that there was no hidden feeling in her mind. It was a great
                  relief, for he had often feared that Halford's return had something to do with the
                  change this winter had worked in her.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               CROSS-PURPOSES.
               OF course not many days could elapse without Mrs. Marchmont's meeting Dick
                  Faulkner; still she contrived to avoid him a great deal, for though she was free
                  from his power, the sight of him reminded her so forcibly of the insult he had
                  offered—the crime he had forced her to commit—that it was torture to find herself
                  in his presence, even if not compelled to address more than a cold bow or a few
                  chilling words.
               Immediately on Alice's arrival, Mrs. Faulkner left her own and her husband's
                  cards, and Mrs. Marchmont returned hers, scrupulously, though she vowed that
                  nothing should tempt her ever to set foot within the house. She must be civil when
                  they met, lest people should notice and ask the reason of the breach; but she
                  would not go beyond that. Only a few evenings afterward she encountered them at a
                  party, and Mrs. Faulkner fluttered up with her false smiles and honeyed words,
                  doubly distasteful to Alice, because she knew that the spiteful woman only did it
                  at Faulkner's command.
               Later in the evening she found Dick himself by her side; he had been annoying her
                  for the last half-hour by standing at a distance and watching her in the old way,
                  so that by the time he approached she was in a state of high nervous
                  exasperation.
               "May I compliment you on the restored looks you have brought back from
                  Washington?" he half whispered, in that silky disagreeable voice and the
                  compromising manner he assumed toward all women. "You seemed tired and fagged when
                  you went away, but the old capital has done wonders for you."
               There was a covert sneer in his tone which struck her with the old chill of dread,
                  and she knew that the speech was meant for an impertinence; her glass told her
                  plainly how much these weeks had changed her. Fortunately, she was alone for the
                  moment, and could relieve her mind.
               "You need not compliment me at all," she replied, not vouchsafing him a single
                  glance. "I have already spoken to your wife; that politeness will serve for you
                  both the whole evening."
               "You are not changed, certainly!" he said, trying in vain to keep his voice from
                  quivering with anger; "you come back as haughty and unforgiving as you went."
               She did not speak—looked away over his head still, with that same careless
                  contempt which touched him as no display of anger could have done.
               "I think you are making a mistake," he said, slowly; "it is Christian-like and
                  womanly to forgive; it is always safer, too, for the patience of the most penitent
                  man may be pushed too far."
               "As I am not a Christian, and you any thing rather than penitent, I can make no
                  application of your words," she answered, after a momentary struggle whether to
                  speak, or let him stand there unnoticed till he must leave her for fear some one
                  should observe and smile at his ridiculous position. "The rest of your speech
                  seems a kind of threat; you forget that you are powerless."
               He laughed in a low, sneering tone.
               "You will think me capable of threats, then? But what folly on my part at this
                  late day!"
               "Utter folly!" she said; though, in spite of her, the old fear grew stronger, and
                  she looked at him now—studied his face, to try and discover if there was any
                  hidden meaning to his speech; but features and attitude had assumed the
                  sentimental expression and pose which always exasperated her. "I think it better
                  to be frank," she continued, quickly, under the influence of this emotion; "I
                  shall be obliged to you, Mr. Faulkner, if you will never address a word to me
                  beyond the commonest greeting."
               "That is hard," he said; "very hard, when the greatest pleasure I have in life is
                  to converse with you, even if I must endure disdainful looks and cruel
                  speeches."
               "This is simply impertinent," she replied. "Have the goodness to go away, or I
                  shall be compelled to leave you standing here."
               "No, don't do that," he said; "it would be unwise."
               "Another mysterious threat?"
               "Only a caution for your own sake; you do not wish people to know that you are
                  offended with me."
               "I warn you that I shall not try to hide it, if you venture to annoy me."
               "Then you would have to tell the reason. I don't mind; I am not ashamed of loving
                  you."
               She half rose—remembered where she was, and controlled herself.
               "I think," she said, "there must be some man here who would protect me from your
                  insolence. Will you force me to make sure?"
               "But that would only hurt you! Suppose some preux
                     chevalier shot me, it would not prevent the world's saying you must
                  have gone very far when I dared say such a thing; you would have to endure
                  something worse than my society."
               "Nothing could be so bad as that!"
               "Well, well, I don't mean to quarrel—do you know why?"
               "No; nor care to hear."
               "Simply out of regard for you. I am, what I always have been, the most devoted of
                  your friends. I will not quarrel."
               "I think you had better go away," she said, with an ominous pause between each
                  word.
               "In a moment; I don't intend to annoy you hereafter, so I must speak clearly
                  now."
               "You have nothing to say."
               "Yes; this! I want you to remember that I am your friend. When the time arrives
                  that you need my help, recollect what I say now, and send for me at once."
               Again the paralyzing fear came back. Had he discovered any thing? did he suspect?
                  was there a real meaning to his words, or were they only an empty insolence for
                  the pleasure of tormenting her? Oh, that last question must contain the rightful
                  answer; yet the bare thought that it might not nerved her anew with the
                  desperation which nowadays served in the place of her old courage.
               "When I want you I will send," she answered, with a bitter smile; "perhaps you
                  will have the goodness to wait until then, before approaching me again."
               "Yes," he said, gravely; "I will wait."
               She would not raise her eyes, anxious as she was to read his face; she feared that
                  they might confirm the dread in her soul.
               "And you know that I can wait patiently," he went on. "A few weeks ago, when you
                  set a time for me to come to you, I never intruded until the exact day: I shall
                  not now."
               "If you will only wait till then, I have nothing more to ask."
               "I will wait."
               He bowed and turned away, but she felt herself tremble under the triumphant ring
                  in his guarded voice.
               A few days afterward she received an invitation to dinner from Mrs. Faulkner: it
                  was declined, as were all succeeding invitations from that quarter; Alice avoided
                  the houses where she was likely to meet the husband or wife. In spite of his
                  potency in these days, there were people who refused to allow Dick Faulkner to
                  enter their doors, and as much as possible she confined herself to their society.
                  When she did chance to meet him, he never troubled her further than to speak, as a
                  distant, respectful acquaintance might have done; and as the days went on she put
                  him a great deal out of her mind.
               The fears which gathered darkly were not those in which he had a part—she must
                  guard against John Worthington now. The time sped on with such terrible rapidity;
                  the note hidden in the Hebrew's desk haunted her more and more persistently. Twice
                  during her stay in Washington she had thought the bargain for her lands complete,
                  had expected to have the deeds presented for her signature; on each occasion the
                  matter had again fallen through. The company could not agree among themselves, not
                  where her demands were concerned; but there were inward dissensions among them—a
                  change of president, and various troubles, which prevented their having leisure to
                  attend to any purchases as yet.
               And the days flew, each bearing her nearer the moment when prompt action would be
                  a necessity. She had no hope of getting a renewal of the note; in the beginning
                  the Jew had allowed her to see that any such clemency was not to be expected. When
                  the fatal day arrived he would appear before her, bill in hand, and at the first
                  word—the first plea for delay—hurry from her to seek John Worthington, and place
                  the forged signature before his eyes. She never got beyond that exposure in her
                  thoughts; when she reached that point she was past forming even the wildest idea
                  of what might follow. Whether he would expose her, allow the law to take its
                  course—oh, she hoped that would prove his choice! A prison—hard labor—life among
                  the vilest convicts, would be easier than to have him come and look in her face,
                  and tell her she was safe from the effects of his righteous anger, so far as
                  betrayal was concerned; but no punishment of the law could equal the agony of
                  meeting his contempt.
               She grew more and more capricious in her manner toward him; sometimes seeking his
                  society, sometimes fairly running away, and unable to decide whether she suffered
                  most in listening to his friendly words or in the seasons of solitude when tormented by the idea that before
                  they met again some untoward chance might have revealed to him the truth.
               Worthington, troubled by his own secret, placed a construction upon her conduct
                  entirely foreign to the facts. He began to fear that he had not concealed his
                  feelings so carefully as he believed; that she suspected his folly, and was
                  divided between a wish not to break their long friendship, and a dread that he
                  would pain her by putting his insanity into speech. So he visited her less; went
                  less frequently to places where they were likely to meet. Then his absence
                  terrified her, and she would seek him and try to make her manner what it had
                  formerly been, and shudder with remorse at each tone of his voice.
               The baron had followed her home from Washington; he was always haunting her steps,
                  seeking an opportunity to lay his title at her feet; and though she knew there was
                  little hope of her daring to accept—the idea, too, of marrying him was a
                  torment—she could not let him speak yet, lest afterward she should regret having
                  thrown away that one chance of escape from her old life.
               She had no peace anywhere, but in those weary days Kenneth Halford's companionship
                  was nearer rest than aught else, and she lured him to her side by every art that
                  she could find. He saw more of her real self than others did, and he pitied her
                  profoundly—it was the sore feeling in his heart; but Milly was tormenting him
                  sorely, and Mrs. Marchmont's society was a relief, so he sought it often; and of
                  course there were eyes enough to notice, and tongues enough to hint to Milly of
                  the flirtation that was going on.
               The next time she met Mrs. Marchmont after that first evening, Milly carried into
                  execution her plan of showing the haughty beauty that she did not mean to be
                  patronized or treated as a child. It was very like a foolish blossom pitting
                  itself against a diamond star and getting its leaves pierced by a score of the
                  sharp, sparkling points. Again Alice Marchmont smiled sweetly upon her, and held
                  an internal monologue.
               "Yes, I'll certainly teach you a lesson, you dreadful-mannered little girl of the
                  period! If Kenneth Halford is idiot enough to marry you, I shall do him and you a
                  service by aggravating you into common sense. How much you do lack it, my pecked
                  white dove!"
               Milly had dealt a dangerous blow to her own peace, poor child! I do not mean to
                  say that Mrs. Marchmont in the least disliked her; but she was accustomed to
                  conquest even among her own sex, and impertinence was a thing she could not
                  endure. Besides, during these horrible days she was hard and cruel; any fancied
                  slight made her long to punish the offender. She would rule absolutely to the
                  last; there was so little time left now—so little!
               Had she really known Milly, she was more capable of thoroughly understanding her
                  than any body had ever done; but meeting her casually in crowds, she only saw the
                  trifling, childish exterior, and believed that Halford—if the story of the
                  engagement proved true—was taking a step that he would bitterly regret when too
                  late. She concluded hastily that Milly's mind was like the minds of so many girls,
                  the best comparison for which is an oak-seedling that the Chinese plant in a vase,
                  and which, under some subtle treatment, speedily shoots into a miniature tree,
                  pretty and quaint, but never to enlarge or grow any higher.
               No confidence in regard to the engagement passed between Mrs. Marchmont and
                  Halford, and though Alice heard the reports she did not feel herself obliged to
                  change her manner toward him, since he offered no hint of his new ties. This was,
                  unfortunately, Milly's fault. Only a short time after Mrs. Marchmont came back, he
                  asked his betrothed if he might confide their secret to one of his oldest and
                  dearest friends. She was sure whom he meant, and her budding jealousy prompted her
                  to refuse the request.
               "I'll not have it," she said. "You promised me that you would not tell till I gave
                  you leave."
               "And I shall keep my word, dear child," he answered, for he was still patient with
                  her; "but in this one case I should like to break through our compact."
               "I'll not hear of it," Milly said; "no, I'll not hear of it."
               So the conversation ended there, and he did not renew his plea.
               The days passed on; it was all the work of a brief season, and the contest thus
                  began was continued—mere play to the elder woman, but stern, terrible earnest to
                  blind little Milly.
               Just her childishness, her sunny laugh, her light heart had won Kenneth Halford's
                  love. Therefore, when she grew fretful, and her temper uncertain, when she took
                  him to task about trifles, not choosing to reveal the real hurt which smarted so
                  keenly, he became impatient, and began to regard her childishness from another
                  point of view. He hoped that he had not been overhasty in entering into this
                  engagement, which was equivalent to fearing that he had gone on too fast. He felt
                  that, at all events and at all risks, she must be subdued and taught that such
                  freaks were silly and ridiculously out of place toward a man so much older and
                  wiser than herself, when that man had honored her with his affection; and I never
                  yet have met one of the sex who would not have felt the same.
               Then, out of the mystery of the heart's awakening, Milly's mind developed like an
                  amaryllis bursting suddenly into blossom. She thought of things in a way she had
                  never before done; of life and the world as they really are; of the fact that she
                  could not always be young and pretty. She saw that Halford considered her a child;
                  that he loved her as such; that there were depths in his past which she was not
                  allowed lowed to sound, supposed incapable of comprehending—experiences which kept
                  them worlds apart in spite of love and vows. She perceived clearly that he only
                  allowed her to stand in the pleasant light of the portico, and never dreamed of
                  opening the inner doors of the temple that she might enter and take her rightful
                  place.
               Did the awaking of these new faculties, this ability to reason, this
                  clear-sightedness, this struggle into womanhood make her suddenly more patient,
                  better able to set right the tangled woof of the present? Ah, never did it so
                  happen in the case of any human being! The wisdom gained by experience does not
                  come until long after the battle is over, the defeat accepted. We look back on our
                  Waterloos, and see how the fight might have been won; but when we have acquired
                  the generalship necessary for a victory, the great stakes for which we would
                  struggle are no longer there.
               Milly was astonished to find that her temper could be so bad. The children at home
                  fretted her; the light duties she had to perform became insupportable. Every thing
                  went wrong, and she made herself more wretched each day, without mending matters
                  in the least, and forced her aunt to think her almost wicked, and wonder how it
                  was that her new position could have so changed her nature. Mrs. Marchmont was
                  punishing her for her naughty behavior, without meaning to injure her happiness or
                  believing there was depth enough to her mind to make real suffering possible.
                  Halford was rendered colder and sterner by Milly's petulance, and so the clouds
                  loomed swiftly up over the horizon which had been so glorious.
               "I want rest, peace," said Kenneth Halford, in his masculine arrogance. "Is this
                  child only to tease and annoy me, instead of proving the cheerful sunbeam that I
                  wooed for my loneliness?"
               No remembrance of the warning John Worthington had given recurred to his mind; he
                  was blind as the rest of us are until the time arrives when there is no space for
                  any thing but regret. We can see clearly enough then how we might have averted the
                  tempest. As we look back across the graves of the past we can perceive how
                  patience, self-sacrifice, even quiet endurance of actual wrong, might have been
                  needed to set matters straight, and the sacrifices look very small, haughtily as
                  we should have rejected them while they could have proved of any avail.
               Minerva Lawrence struck the crowning blow upon Milly's heart—struck it
                  unintentionally, blindly, without the least idea of her own cruelty—just as our
                  best friends hurt us, in their desire to meddle with that which is better left
                  alone. She was very fond of Milly, and took it upon herself to be indignant at the
                  gossip concerning Mrs. Marchmont and Halford. But it did not occur to her to
                  believe that it was without foundation—she never stopped to think that he was an
                  honorable man, incapable of proving false. She felt it her duty to caution Milly,
                  to set her on her guard, to rouse in her a proper spirit of resentment; for,
                  though the girl had never admitted her engagement, Minerva, in her wisdom, felt
                  certain that it existed.
               So, just when Milly was hottest and most bitter, and her jealousy at its height,
                  Minerva came to make her a visit, and, as Mrs. Remsen was out, had a full
                  opportunity to free her mind of the burden which oppressed it. She felt irritated,
                  too, because Milly had not been frank with her. The more wholly a secret belongs
                  to one's self the more fiercely one's friends resent one's reticence.
               "Where were you last night?" she asked.
               "Aunty and I had to go to Hortense's," Milly replied, yawning at the bare
                  recollection. "Oh, it was awful!"
               "I should think so—I tell Hortense honestly I'm not equal to her reunions. She
                  thinks it's because I'm a fool, but I don't care."
               "And where were you?" asked Milly, not wishing to be led into fault-finding with
                  her cousin.
               "At the opera."
               "Many there?" demanded Milly, just to make conversation, for it was hard work to
                  talk.
               Halford had gone to Mrs. Maynard's, too, and Milly had managed to get into an
                  altercation. But he would not quarrel; he rose and went away, thereby punishing
                  her more cruelly than if he had scolded.
               "Yes, a great crowd," returned Minerva, with unnecessary emphasis. "Mrs. Marchmont
                  was in her box, going on as usual—half-undressed—laughing, sighing, rolling up her
                  eyes. I hate her!"
               Milly did not reply.
               "And you ought to," pursued Minerva. "I can tell you that."
               "You have no reason for telling me any thing of the kind," said Milly.
               "Yes, I have—don't be snappish, when I'm so fond of you! Kenneth Halford was with
                  her all the last act. I saw her go down stairs on his arm."
               He had strolled into the opera-house after leaving Mrs. Maynard's, and seeing
                  Alice Marchmont had gone to her box; but in Milly's state of mind her first
                  thought was that he had promised to do so—had left her with the intention of
                  seeking that woman.
               "And what was there improper in the proceeding?" she forced herself to ask, trying
                  to appear languid and bored, as she had seen elder feminines do more
                  naturally.
               "It's a shame—never mind, I'm supposed not to know—but I'm not a mole, nor an
                  owl!" cried Minerva; and by this time she was in a state of such excitement that
                  she poured out her whole bundle of gossip almost without a pause. "I don't believe
                  you ever heard they were engaged once; but they were! I'd forgotten it; but when
                  Helen James raked up the story from her old aunts I remembered it. Yes, indeed; and she was always what she is
                  now—the most heartless coquette in the world. She threw him over because he hadn't
                  money in those days, and married Mr. Marchmont, and Halford went off to Egypt. You
                  needn't look unbelieving—it is the truth."
               "But it is nothing to me," said Milly.
               "So much the better, but it's a fib! You ought to call him to account for the way
                  he goes on;" and she added a long list of enormities which increased Milly's
                  anger, though she would not say a word.
               She tried for a little to believe that the story of the engagement was false; but
                  once having set out on her mission, Minerva could not relinquish it until she
                  proved the fact by circumstantial evidence which Milly could not doubt.
               At last Aunt Eliza came in, but she appeared too late. Minerva had done all the
                  harm she could, and in Milly's mood it was a great deal. The keeping secret this
                  ancient history seemed, in her exaggerated frame of mind, a deliberate deception
                  on the part of Halford—one that she could not and would not forgive. Worse than
                  any thing, this woman had not lost her old power over him; she was sure of that.
                  But he should learn that she was no baby to be contented with careless smiles and
                  coaxing words! She would have all or nothing; if he was not prepared to give her
                  his full heart, let him go back to Alice Marchmont and his former love, and leave
                  her life free.
               Halford perceived that she was jealous of Alice. The idea amused him at first, as
                  her petulance had done. But Milly carried matters too far; it became an insulting
                  suspicion in his eyes, and he was utterly out of patience with her folly. Then
                  Milly began to flirt; she had worn the edge off her other weapons, short as the
                  combat had been; she would go into the fray armed with the two-edged sword of
                  coquetry. But when a young girl attempts to wield that blade out of bitterness and
                  a desire to annoy her lover, she does not handle it with the coolness of an
                  experienced fencer; half her thrusts go astray, and the sharpest blows cut her own
                  heart.
               Milly went on foolishly with any body who presented himself; worst of all with
                  poor Charley Thorne, who was as foolish a boy as she was girl, only he had not
                  much mind or soul to develop, so would not get himself so severely hurt as Milly
                  was doing. Still, he loved her to the full extent of his capabilities. We think
                  that a worm is not much to be pitied when wounded, because it can only feel a
                  dull, sluggish pain; but, after all, if it suffers to the full extent of its
                  powers, then it suffers in reality as severely as an angel could.
               By this time Halford was really angry. Not that he supposed Milly cared for the
                  youth; but, overlooking the real cause of her conduct, began to fear that she was
                  led on by her love of admiration and flattery, and that she had conceived the idea
                  of taking a leaf out of Mrs. Marchmont's book because she was annoyed with that
                  lady. Milly must learn that such conduct was not to be permitted, and as he
                  compared her with Alice Marchmont, he thought what a pity it was that young girls
                  could not have the experience of worldly women, or that women must give their
                  innocent freshness as the price of their knowledge.
               But when you take a simple wild-flower, modest and perfumed with morning dew, and
                  put it in a hot-house to grow double, to deepen in color, and become more gorgeous
                  in every way, the fragrance and simplicity die out of it. You have a beautiful
                  decoration for a jardinière or a ball-room, but
                  you have deprived the blossom of the charm it had when odorous of the free air and
                  memories of the pleasant haunts where you played and were happy years and years
                  ago.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXII.
               IN THE DARK.
               FROM the moment that Milly admitted to herself the truth of the reports Minerva
                  Lawrence poured into her cars, not a day passed without bringing a host of
                  confirming evidence. She began to find proofs of dissimulation in the slightest
                  thing connected with Halford's conduct toward Mrs. Marchmont, and to indulge more
                  and more in the idea that he felt his engagement a restraint.
               "Why didn't he leave me alone?" cried poor Milly, in her passionate monologues.
                  "Why did he come to me, and teach me to love him when he had only half a heart to
                  give? He might have gone back to his old dream, and left me untroubled. Oh, it was
                  cruel, it was wicked! I shall hate him soon!"
               At least half their interviews became stormy ones. At times Milly was on the point
                  of telling him that she knew the story of his past—his treachery toward herself,
                  and bidding him leave her forever. But then some effort on his part to pet her
                  back to peace would succeed for the moment, and she would persuade herself that he
                  loved her, until a second meeting with Alice Marchmont roused her jealous fancies
                  to a higher pitch. Had she only told him—bared her whole soul, no matter how
                  harshly, even yet the clouds might have been cleared away. He could have shown how
                  false her fears were; made her understand that his boyish dream had no more
                  connection with his present life, no more hold upon him than the pursuits which
                  pleased her when a little child possessed an interest now. But she did not speak;
                  she kept her secret resolutely, sullenly, and it ate into her heart like a
                  plague-spot, cankering to the very core.
               Another week went by, and once again they were all assembled in somebody's house,
                  busy with the old routine of dancing, talking—pitying themselves for being there,
                  and hating their hostess for the invitation as bitterly as she detested them for
                  the necessity of offering it.
               Milly was in one of her most violent moods of irritation, and Halford cynical and
                  misanthropical, as he had grown of late. Mrs. Marchmont was there too, and Dick
                  Faulkner watching her, and each time she met his eyes it seemed to her that she
                  read there a triumphant consciousness of the fact that the narrowing circle of
                  days bore her rapidly toward her doom. The sight of him and the dread which his
                  presence roused had its usual effect of putting her in the wildest, most feverish
                  spirits, and prompted her to do and say a thousand things for which she hated
                  herself afterward.
               After trying for a while in vain to have a pleasant moment with Milly, Halford
                  went away to make one in the circle about Mrs. Marchmont. They danced together,
                  and finally she complained of the heat, and he led her away into the
                  conservatory.
               They fell into a morbid, speculative conversation, sitting alone in the pretty
                  retreat much longer than was in exact accordance with the rules of etiquette, but
                  Mrs. Marchmont had grown reckless of what people said, and Halford, man-like, did
                  not think. Several times a stray couple wandered in, glanced at them, and departed
                  with meaning smiles and whispers; but neither noticed. At length, as usually
                  happened, their talk became personal, and something Halford said roused Mrs.
                  Marchmont into contradiction; but it was a laughing, graceful warfare, very
                  different from poor Milly's sharp speeches and petulant ways.
               "I've no patience whatever with you," she said; "not the least. You are like the
                  rest of your sex, Kenneth Halford."
               "In allowing myself to be dazzled by your brilliancy?" he asked, laughingly.
               "Nonsense!" retorted she. "What is the good of talking in that way? There is
                  nobody to hear."
               "Thank you," said Halford, and felt vexed, as the veriest old stager will when a
                  woman says such things, however indifferent he may be to her.
               "People say that you are engaged to that pretty little baby, Milly Crofton."
               Halford looked up rather angrily at the epithets.
               "If I am—she is a darling little thing!"
               "Just that." replied she, coolly; "and it was what you wanted to find. Let me
                  see-you are almost four-and-thirty; you have lived ever since you were fifteen—oh
                  yes, I know what men like you want! To be worshiped, adored, made a god of!
                  Innocence and youth for you—very good!"
               "Thanks again for your kind opinion so frankly expressed," he replied, amiably
                  enough; "but my vanity is not quite insatiable."
               "You don't thank me, and I'm not talking about your vanity. What I want to know is
                  this—since you have seen fit to take a child to bring up, why are you not
                  satisfied?"
               "I wonder," said Halford, musingly, "do these children—"
               "No, they don't," interrupted Mrs. Marchmont; "they never do grow up, and that is
                  their chief charm—the very reason why they are to be envied. Who would feel if he
                  could help it? You have chosen your wild-flower—sometimes, after the first
                  blossoming, such flowers turn into the most commonplace weeds. I trust it will not
                  be the case in this instance. Still, you must run your chance—you can't have
                  ragout and syllabub in the same dish; excuse the confusion of metaphors. You have
                  grown dreadfully tired of the taste of ragout; I only hope the syllabub will not
                  turn sour."
               "How cynical you are!" returned he, in an irritated tone.
               "Men always say that when one takes the trouble to tell them truth; verity and
                  cynicism they seem to regard as synonymous terms."
               "I wish there was no such thing as truth," cried he, laughing.
               "I don't think there will be by the time the next generation gets here," returned
                  she, quietly. "Well, they say we live afresh in our children; with your prospect
                  you can look forward to that poetical delight."
               "You sneer, but I know you love children; you would give the world for something
                  to care for as you could for a child."
               "I don't deny it," she replied; and for an instant her lip quivered; but the brief
                  emotion passed, and she continued in her former careless voice, "I dare say I
                  shall envy you! I suppose, when a man grows tired of his syllabub, the babies are
                  a great consolation; and our American doves subside very quietly into nurses and
                  upper-servants."
               "I don't wish—"
               "You needn't interrupt! I have reached the children's chapter, and I am always
                  eloquent thereupon. I say the babies are delightful, but they will grow to men and
                  women; and the first use they make of their serpent teeth is to sting one's dead
                  heart into new life and keener suffering than any thing that went before."
               "You are worse than Mephistopheles!" he exclaimed, angrily.
               She laughed outright.
               "Just because I tell you a few plain, unvarnished facts!"
               "I don't believe they are facts."
               "So much the better for your peace of mind; don't you believe it until you are
                  forced—the time will come soon enough."
               "Upon my word, you are doubt incarnate," said he, laughing too.
               "I should be sorry to lead such a tender young Faust astray," returned she,
                  mockingly. "I wish no harm to you or your Marguerite, but I am really afraid for
                  your future. There are acids enough in her composition to make your sweet draught
                  unpalatable whey unless there can something be found to counteract them."
               "She is dreadfully exacting and jealous," Halford said, gloomily, with a man's
                  usual lack of generosity.
               
               "Never mind! I am sorry I made that last speech—it was too bad of me; but I have
                  been punishing her lately for sundry little impertinences." Mrs. Marchmont's mood
                  changed; he looked so disturbed that she longed to say something which should case
                  the pain caused by her words, though she honestly feared that her warnings would
                  prove correct. But it was wicked of her to foster his own feelings of distrust in
                  the future he had chosen! Why should she force doubts more clearly upon him? She
                  was grown too hard and cruel—oh, these last days would leave nothing womanly,
                  nothing even human about her! She was indulging these swift self-reproaches while
                  he spoke again, for he felt ashamed of that weak complaint as soon as it was
                  uttered.
               "Milly is only a child yet," he said; "I must be patient. One's theories are fine
                  enough, but it is difficult to reduce them to practice."
               "It is the thing of all others, though, which must be done! There I go again! What
                  was it Shakspeare said about the ease of showing other people the road? The idea
                  of my giving advice to any body; why, I haven't even a fine theory left to
                  violate!"
               "You never are satisfied without doing yourself injustice."
               "It's not of me we were talking," she said, quickly; "it is of you and your hope
                  of happiness—a possibility that interests me more just now than any thing
                  connected with myself. Mr. Halford, listen to me, I am in earnest now: if you go
                  to work aright, I believe that you may be tolerably happy and contented. Go find
                  her, and try to bring back her sunshine. It is a great deal to be loved; don't
                  lose the opportunity."
               "If I have found it," he muttered.
               "You believed for a time that you had. Why, man, even a pleasant deception is
                  better than a blank! Keep to your illusions, if such they be."
               "To tell me that, at my age, when I know how impossible it is to prevent their
                  slipping away!"
               "Then don't let this idyl be an illusion! I tell you the future is in your own
                  hands. Take what life offers, and don't fret after the unattainable. You are not a
                  boy. I'll not talk to you any more to-night. I feel bitter—I really envy you the
                  peace that you may have."
               She sent him away without the least hesitation or ceremony.
               "But I don't want to go," he said.
               "No matter—go back to that pretty flower. I don't wish you here; in reality, you
                  don't wish to stay. We are two idiots to stand airing our misanthropy at each
                  other's expense."
               She could not trust herself to be grave. She began to say merry, witty things, and
                  sent him off laughing, in spite of his mood.
               "I wish the child had brains," she thought, looking after him as he passed out of
                  the conservatory. "But, after all, she is better off as she is. Of course he will
                  get tired—a man! Bah! the idea of being loved by such a hackneyed heart as his; it
                  would bear comfortably as many crosses as an apple-tart. Still, where will one
                  find a better, or as good? for he is worth infinitely more than any other of his
                  sort, that's certain! My good old John Worthington does not count in the list. Oh,
                  John Worthington!"
               She put her hands hastily before her eyes. The thoughts called up by the mental
                  utterance of that name were too terrible to endure. She went to the window, leaned
                  her forehead against the glass, and forgot Halford, Milly, the whole world, but
                  herself and her misery. She gazed up at the moonlit sky: it looked so far off, so
                  cold! There was no comfort, no hope for her even in the future. The forever itself
                  seemed only an empty sound, else a new word of doom.
               She heard some one enter the conservatory; she was not alone. Back to reality she
                  came, flashing at the foolish midge who interrupted her reverie a smile so
                  brilliant that it fairly dizzied him.
               "Come and say pretty things to me!" cried she; then gave him a second glance, and
                  added, carelessly, "Oh no, you are one of the dancing set. Well, take me among
                  them, Mercury."
               I suppose the poor fool was dreadfully puzzled, flattered, and confused all at
                  once. Mrs. Marchmont had a habit of upsetting the brains of the midges, and making
                  them feel horribly uncomfortable and out of place, yet hopelessly fascinated the
                  while. It was a great deal to be seen talking and dancing with a woman who was the
                  rage, and they admired her from the very fact that they could no more understand
                  her than they could decipher an Egyptian hieroglyph, and that her conversation was
                  as unintelligible to them as the complaint of a nightingale would be to a flock of
                  sparrows.
               Halford went in search of Milly. She was talking with Charley Thorne, who saw her
                  grow inattentive and deaf and blind, and knew before he looked up that Halford was
                  near. So, with an ache in his poor heart, he took himself out of the way, for fear
                  he should get mercilessly snubbed, as sometimes happened since the Milly of old
                  days had so utterly changed.
               "Milly," said Halford, "half our sunshine seems gone. Is it wise to let these
                  shadows come between us?"
               Her lips quivered, but she knew that he had just left Mrs. Marchmont. The
                  knowledge did not incline her to accept any share of the blame.
               "I have not brought them," she answered, doing her best to look cold and quiet,
                  and to speak with proper indifference.
               "No matter who has done it," he said; "they have come, and they will make us very
                  unhappy if they are not swept away."
               A fortnight before, Milly would have been softened by those words and that tone;
                  now, out of her new clear-sightedness came the thought,
               "He talks to me as if I were a child, to be lectured or coaxed into obedience at
                  his whim. I'll not endure it!"
               She did a very silly and unworthy thing, but painfully natural in her state of
                  mind. She gave a little flirt to her fan, and, with a coquetry which no art less
                  than Mrs. Marchmont's could have rendered graceful, said,
               "I have not complained of unhappiness! Dear me, where has Charley Thorne gone? He
                  asked me to dance."
               Of all habits which girls can fall into that of nicknaming their male
                  acquaintances was the most detestable to Halford, and it was a bit of bad taste of
                  which he had never before heard Milly guilty.
               "She really has no heart," he thought; "one can neither reason with her nor appeal
                  to her feelings. Am I always to be disappointed and mistaken? is there no rest for
                  me anywhere?"
               Milly interpreted the gloom in his face to mean unalloyed censure, and it
                  irritated her into another annoying speech.
               "I promised this redowa to Charley Thorne," she said, arranging her bracelet; "how
                  rude he will think me! I hate to be rude, unless people deserve it. Which way did
                  Charley Thorne go, Mr. Halford?"
               "Perhaps you would like me to call him," suggested he, coldly.
               "Glad to get away," thought Milly. "I'll not let him see that I feel it; I would
                  die first—die—die!" She had learned, out of the experience of the past weeks, to
                  be a tolerable hypocrite, so was able to say, flippantly, "If you would be so
                  good! The room is cold when one sits still, and I promised him this dance
                  faithfully—oh, long ago—yesterday morning, at the concert."
               Kenneth Halford stared aghast at this new Milly, who confronted him with those
                  guarded eyes, that icy smile, and found such insolent meaning for her voice. He
                  was at a loss what it would be right and best to say or do; but just then up came
                  Charley Thorne to remind her of her pledge. The boy was frightfully nervous for
                  fear she should refuse, and make him feel boyish before Halford, but could not
                  forego the possible chance of a few moments' happiness.
               "Will you—have you forgotten?" he stammered, completely losing the case of manner
                  for which our New York youths are famous, and which sometimes strikes one in
                  connection with pink cheeks and budding mustaches as ludicrously as it would to
                  hear a lamb growl.
               "Oh, I never forget," returned Milly, with a laugh. Up she rose with a flutter,
                  sweeping out her skirts, and speaking more loudly than was agreeable; took the arm
                  which Charley offered, trembling with delight at the idea of taking her away from
                  that man; and Milly smiled defiance at Halford, and floated off.
               "Has she neither head nor heart?" thought Kenneth. "Not even good manners! Well,
                  well, that I should live to this age to be a greater fool than I was at twenty!
                  Actually to believe in a girl—a doll! I deserve to be punished for my insanity, my
                  idiotic stupidity."
               He fairly ground his teeth, and felt inclined to do melodrama, but, fortunately,
                  remembered where he was, and that it would not be worth while to amuse people by
                  making himself ridiculous. He stood still for a few moments, talked to the first
                  person within reach, then walked quietly out of the room, and went home to smoke
                  many pipes and sulk exceedingly. He sat till near morning, recalling every
                  unpleasant thing which had ever happened to him in the whole course of his life;
                  and when a man past thirty does that, he can speedily reduce himself into a state
                  of sufficient disgust with the world and existence in general to have satisfied
                  Diogenes himself.
               Then he brought the record up to this latest disappointment—this child, whom he
                  loved tenderly, mixed with much of a patronizing feeling which was so exasperating
                  to the creature whom his love had quickened into new powers of thought and
                  perception, and he grew still more misanthropical.
               After a time the very unreasonableness of his mood brought a reaction. He caught
                  sight of Milly's picture lying on the table. The sweet young face, with its faint
                  shadow of melancholy, like the premonition of a sorrowful destiny which made it
                  different from other girl-faces, looked up at him with a reproach for having
                  indulged in those old memories and raked up the ashes out of the dead past to
                  sully the present. He began to study the picture; to be softened and encouraged by
                  the beautiful capabilities the countenance betrayed, and at last went to bed,
                  determined to make one more grand effort to set Milly right, to bring the sunshine
                  back to her eyes, and secure to himself peace and repose in her simplicity and
                  childishness.
               To set Milly right: that was still his thought, erring as sorely now as he had
                  done in the outset. Ah, we men and women going out of our youth—the faded, wasted
                  youth which our own errors or evil fortune has rendered misshapen and distorted
                  till we are glad to be rid of it, to bury it deep, and get away from the lifeless
                  thing which fills us with remorse, such as some wretch might feel in looking at
                  the face of a friend whom he had murdered—how petty and unjust we are toward those
                  still in the springtime of life and heart! We forget to judge them by what we
                  ourselves were at that season; we refuse to acknowledge that they can feel and
                  comprehend mysteries which we know that we felt and comprehended long before we
                  could reason in regard to them. We do this constantly, and so leave ourselves
                  powerless to aid the bewilderment of those young souls, even when we wish in all
                  sincerity to do so. Kenneth Halford was a good man—better than the generality of
                  his kind; but the leaven of conceit and selfishness was there, and by one of those
                  strange, though, unfortunately, frequent contrarieties of our nature, this very love which had come to cheer his heart
                  in the maturity of manhood, roused the perverse qualities which he believed so
                  utterly rooted out that he did not recognize them as evil under the fine guise in
                  which they presented themselves.
               Milly, whirling through the dance, saw Halford depart, and straightway her heart
                  went down, down into the black depths, and she would have gladly given her soul to
                  call him back, just for one loving word, one gentle look. Then she detested
                  herself and innocent Charley Thorne, but was borne on and obliged to restrain her
                  tears as best she could. She was a poor, blind, foolish child, with the woman too
                  suddenly wakening in her soul, living a real life, and doomed to suffer its pangs,
                  which are so terribly real mixed up with so much that is small, ludicrous, and
                  absurd, that hurt the more because denuded thereby of half their dignity.
               Mrs. Remsen saw that Halford was gone; and before long, feeling a little sleepy
                  and cross (the supper was a failure, so she had her reasons for misanthropy as
                  well as any lover of them all), she insisted on taking Milly home; and though the
                  evening was any thing but an enjoyment, Milly felt that solitude would be worse.
                  Then Alice Marchmont gave the crowning stroke to the girl's multifarious troubles,
                  though actuated by the kindly feeling her conversation with Halford had roused. I
                  don't know why, but nine times out of ten we do our worst mischief when trying to
                  help people.
               She and Milly chanced to stand side by side in the dressing-room, and nobody very
                  near. Mrs. Marchmont extended her hand impulsively, and half-whispered,
               "You don't like me of late. I'm so sorry!"
               Milly was not equal to the politeness of seeing the outstretched hand, but she
                  bowed graciously, and answered,
               "How very good of you to take so much notice of a child!"
               "It is because you are one, my dear," Alice replied, good-humoredly, determined
                  not to be vexed.
               "Then excuse me for saying that I find the reason a rudeness," retorted Milly, her
                  checks growing scarlet.
               "People have accused me of all sorts of things, but I think nobody ever said
                  before that I was rude," returned Mrs. Marchmont, with a smile which goaded Milly
                  into hotter anger. "I wish you would be friends; I learned something to-night
                  which makes me anxious to have you like me."
               "I am utterly at a loss to imagine any thing which could give you that amiable
                  anxiety," answered Milly.
               "When you speak like that you prevent my explaining." said Alice, rather wondering
                  at her failure in appeasing the pretty blossom.
               "So much the better!" cried Milly.
               At this moment Mrs. Remsen called.
               "Are you ready, Milly? Good-night, Mrs. Marchmont. What a stupid evening it has
                  been!"
               When she was shut up in the carriage with her niece the lady fell to
                  fault-finding, and Milly grew flippant, so between them they made matters worse.
                  Mrs. Remsen had her suspicions that things were not going quite smoothly with the
                  betrothed pair, and, though she knew nothing for a certainty, was inclined to
                  blame Milly. She had already delivered sundry lectures to the girl upon her
                  peevishness and variable tempers, and they had produced the effect which lectures
                  offered at the wrong time generally do upon people since the days when Cain was a
                  boy, and Adam scolded him for not liking to hear his brother praised and himself
                  always blamed.
               On reaching home, Mrs. Remsen found awaiting her one of the most unpleasant
                  results of our advanced stage of civilization—a telegraphic dispatch. She was
                  obliged, after all, to go to Baltimore in regard to the letting of her houses, and
                  to set off without delay. So she went to bed crosser than ever, which was natural,
                  I am sure.
               The next day she departed, taking Maud with her, having decided to remain a week
                  and visit an old friend. She might as well get a little pleasure, if possible, out
                  of the boredom and annoyance. But Milly could not be expected to stay shut up in
                  the house during her absence, nor could she go away on account of the children, so
                  Mrs. Remsen wrote and asked good-natured Minerva Lawrence to play chaperon for her
                  niece's benefit. She could think of nobody else, little as she trusted Minerva's
                  judgment, for Hortense was too busy with her ologies, her hospitals, and her
                  bluestocking clubs to pay any attention to Milly, and Adelaide Ramsey was too
                  selfish and spiteful even to make a pretense of doing so.
               Mrs. Lawrence would have been delighted to take Milly and the children to her
                  house, but that her friend would not permit; all she could be trusted to do was to
                  go out of an evening with the young lady. So Aunt Eliza departed, leaving behind
                  her so many rules and regulations for Milly's conduct that they became, as
                  peoples' rules usually do, a bundle of contradictions.
               Hale is a spiteful jade—there is not the slightest doubt of that. When she wants
                  completely to upset any little scheme of happiness that we may have in view, she
                  arranges the most commonplace incidents to suit her nefarious designs; and she was
                  as malignant toward Milly as she has proved to each of us in our time.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               THROWN BACK.
               THE days passed on; it was late in March now, and the beautiful traces of spring
                  were everywhere visible. The air grew balmy and soft, the trees in the squares had
                  put out their first delicate green, the birds hovered about them just returned
                  from their southward flight, and each morning brought some new miracle in that
                  wondrous resurrection of nature to which we are so accustomed that we scarcely
                  notice its loveliness in our frantic rush after the pleasures and honors of our
                  petty lives.
               How fast the time flew—this was Alice Marchmont's constantly haunting thought!
                  Almost a month had gone by since her return from Washington, and there was nothing
                  done, no step taken to relieve herself from the dreadful state of suspense which
                  deepened as each day's swift course reminded her of the necessity for action. And
                  she was powerless; could only wait in that horrible doubt, worse to her impatient
                  soul than any ruinous catastrophe.' She watched the days pass, and knew that each
                  left her nearer the crisis which must overthrow her present life as suddenly as an
                  earthquake desolates some tropical land.
               She went out constantly, she was more witty and brilliant than ever; but could
                  those of her own sex who envied and reviled her, and would have been glad to see
                  the endless gossip in regard to her grow into tangible truths which should strike
                  her down from her dazzling height, have seen her in solitude, the severest and
                  most malicious among the band might have felt their rancor turned into pity. There
                  was one fancy which haunted her dreams, and in her waking hours seemed the sole
                  comparison that suited the strait in which she found herself. She was like some
                  hapless wretch in a frail boat that swept more and more swiftly down a laughing
                  stream, with bright flowers and graceful trees on its margin, and the roar of an
                  unseen cataract beyond coming always nearer and nearer, and she powerless even to
                  lift her hand or make a movement to turn the light bark out of the fatal
                  current.
               No wonder that she grew thinner and paler, her eyes larger and blazing with a
                  brighter light, her wit sharper and keener; yet all her trouble seemed only to
                  increase that beauty which had been her bitterest curse, and she was more admired
                  and courted than ever. Often, in her desperate moments, when she thought of the
                  end stealing closer, she would laugh outright in a horrible merriment to think how
                  the fairy palace in which she dwelt must fall into ruin with one fearful crash,
                  like some enchanted dwelling in an Eastern tale, beneath the stroke of a
                  magician's wand.
               The month ended. She had begun to count the days yet to elapse before the forged
                  note fell due, and as the shortening time of grace brought back to her mind the
                  awful dread of madness or death as the only way out, the torture ended. She found
                  herself free! The news came to her early one morning, just when the project for
                  the sale of her lands seemed broken up entirely, owing to the failure of one of
                  the company. But the stock-holders had met again, and this time the bargain was
                  actually concluded with the agent before she knew a word of the matter. Her first
                  thought was that she could deliver herself from peril; her second, that if she had
                  only waited and kept Dick Faulkner from an open esclandre, forgetting how impossible that would have been, this
                  stain need not rest upon her soul. And she could never forget. She might render
                  exposure out of the question, she might stand before the world and the friend whom
                  she had betrayed, fearless of suspicion, but in her own soul that gnawing memory
                  and remorse must remain to torture it beyond any hope of peace. She would know
                  herself a guilty woman, and loathe herself for the knowledge. If she had gone to
                  John Worthington and told him the truth, he would have helped her. He could not
                  have left her alone to face that danger; every word and action of his proved that
                  he would have come to her aid. Then she recollected that what hindered her was the
                  certainty of losing his respect and esteem, and each week of this terrible season
                  since had shown her more plainly how dear they were to her. But if, after the note
                  was again in her hands, she could get back to the one hope of quieting her
                  remorse; if she could tell him the whole story and receive his pardon! Tell him
                  what—that she was a forger, a criminal? All courage went out of her heart again as
                  she asked and answered her own dreadful questions, till she forgot that even the
                  surety of keeping her reputation spotless in his eyes and before the world was in
                  her power; and the old scenes of misery and remorse were enacted anew in the
                  silence of her chamber. She had grown fairly to hate this room—the whole house,
                  for that matter. She could scarcely look at an article of furniture which was not
                  in some way connected with hours of insane suffering, or did not stand before her
                  like conscious witnesses of her guilt.
               There was the pretty morning-room—she could hardly enter it! There it was that
                  Dick Faulkner had dared to bring his wicked designs clearly before her, put his
                  shameful passion into degrading words. The easy-chair in the window of her
                  dressing-room seemed always reminding her that it was there she had sunk down in
                  the first hours of misery. The very figures on the carpet made her head throb with
                  pain as she remembered how often she had lain, hour after hour, counting them
                  mechanically, following their lines, and trying to hold her reeling senses fast by
                  the childish occupation. And oh, worst of all, the sight of the table on which she
                  had committed that deed—made her bond with the fiend! Why, the very bronze
                  inkstand, with its graceful pattern of a helmet supported by two cupids, had been
                  a present from John Worthington himself! It was a slight comfort that the house
                  had passed out of her possession. She had been obliged to sell it early in the
                  autumn, and must leave it by the first of May. The furniture would go; it was
                  mortgaged to the Jew, and he might have it and welcome.
               
               This sale of the lands would free her from pecuniary difficulties, though she
                  might be in straightened circumstances for a long time, certainly until the
                  company opened the mines and sunk the oil-wells upon whose products she was to
                  have a generous royalty. But if she were obliged to live on bread and water, seek
                  menial employment, it would be better than her life during the past year, viewing
                  only the ordinary difficulties which pursue people in embarrassments. She could
                  silence the ceaseless rings at her door-bell, have done with importunate
                  tradesmen, get back the host of bonds and securities, the jewels and other
                  valuables, which lay in her Jewish friend's possession, and, better than any
                  thing, hold once more that accursed paper and tear it with her own hands. She
                  would go away into the country, cross the ocean, and live quietly in some sober
                  Italian city; oh, it made no difference what she did! Even a prospect of absolute
                  physical suffering and want would be a relief! Go somewhere she must; escape from
                  every thing which reminded her of her guilt—most of all, from the kindly glance of
                  John Worthington's eyes; and, even as she thought that, the sudden pang at her
                  heart warned her for the first time of what he had grown to her during these
                  years.
               The tiresome business was settled with very little delay; the deeds were signed,
                  and half the purchase-money in the bank at Mrs. Marchmont's disposal. It was a
                  bright morning—a Tuesday. She was going this very day to her Hebrew confidante,
                  going to make her last visit. It was in her power to reclaim the securities which
                  had gone to help her in her mad schemes, or afford her a temporary tranquillity at
                  the price of frightful discounts and ruinous rates of interest. The thing of which
                  she thought most, of course, was the getting that note in her possession; that
                  done, she would only be obliged to journey forward hand in hand with her remorse.
                  Never to be rid of that, never! It had been the one reflection in her mind since
                  the hour in which she learned that it was in her power to avert danger; it was the
                  sole thought in her soul now as she dressed to go out on her errand.
               How these weeks had changed her; five years of ordinary life would not have
                  altered her so much! She stared at the anxious face confronting her in the mirror,
                  and the cruel morning light showed plainly the ravages which this season had
                  wrought. Every body had always prophesied that hers was a beauty which would not
                  soon fade; she had often thought complacently that even her fortieth birthday
                  would not be to her the knell of youth as it was to less favored women. She had
                  been so proud of that loveliness, so fond of it—not from mere vanity, not wholly
                  from love of the power which it gave her, but from a sort of childish pleasure in
                  every thing beautiful, and a childish delight in its effect. Now she was so tired,
                  so worn in heart and soul, so filled with loathing and self-contempt, that she
                  fairly was sorry that her vaunted loveliness had not suffered more severely.
               "It's such a hideous farce!" she thought. "Oh, what do I want longer of the world?
                  Let me get away—pay my debts and get away, and at least be honest for the rest of
                  my life. Shall I be able to live quiet and alone? Oh, I don't know! And I might
                  have been so much loved—perhaps Kenneth would have loved me; but I would not have
                  cared for that; I had grown beyond him. But it's too late now to think of such
                  things—too late! Why, what would a crown be in comparison to the happiness of
                  looking in John Worthington's face, and knowing that my soul was free from any
                  wrong to his trust and confidence? Oh, John Worthington! John Worthington! if you
                  could know, if you could only see the whole truth, understand all my misery, you
                  would pity me—I know you would pity me!"
               And, as if her mental utterance of his name had been a charm to invoke his
                  presence, some one came to tell her that John Worthington was below.
               "But I can't let him keep me," she said to herself. "I must get at least beyond
                  the risk—the danger. I declare, it's harder to meet him now that I have nothing to
                  distract my mind from the sin I committed toward him, than it was when the fear
                  stood between me and remorse. Oh, it's dreadful to think that I don't want to see
                  him—that I am afraid; when I'd rather have his society than the whole world put
                  together! If I dared tell him—if I could speak the truth out! If I think of it
                  another minute, I shall rush up stairs again and hide myself in the dark. Oh, what
                  a fool, what a fool!"
               She tortured herself with these reflections as she went down to meet him, paused
                  for an instant at the door of the library, then entered with her usual manner. The
                  old game of dissimulation, which we all play so constantly, must go on. She met
                  him with smiles and fair words, as you must meet the man whom you know you may
                  murder before the week is out; as you must greet the false friend who has betrayed
                  you; the woman for whom you broke your heart ten years before; the relative that
                  believes you inherited grandmother's money by foul play—any body, every body,
                  except in those rare moments in life when the masks fall off each face, and you
                  and your foe or your victim stand grinning at one another in an honest
                  acknowledgment of hatred which ought to ease the soul a little after bearing so
                  long its burden of lies.
               "You look better—more like yourself—this morning," were his first words, as he
                  hurried forward and took her hand. "Come, there's some comfort in that. I believe
                  you have actually slept all night."
               "Of course I have; what else should I do? And don't talk about my looking better,
                  you rude man, as if my looks were not always the best to be found."
               "You are very pale, but—"
               "I'll turn you out of the house if you say another word of the sort," she
                  interrupted, sitting down and motioning him to a seat. "By-the-way, what brings
                  you here at this time in the morning? You ought to have been at your office an
                  hour ago. What do you mean by getting into such irregular, dissipated habits?"
               "That is your gratitude, I suppose, for my taking the trouble to find out whether
                  you were alive or dead."
               He had no intention of telling her the real reason which brought him. It seemed
                  foolish to himself, but he could not pass the house without entering to make sure
                  that all was well with her. The whole night through he had been troubled with evil
                  dreams, in which he saw her menaced by invisible dangers, appealing to him for
                  assistance which he was unable to give; and if the vision changed a little, it was
                  only to see her desperately ill, dying by poison, and a strong hand holding him
                  back when he tried to give her the antidote which might save her yet. Whether
                  these nightmares came from the fact that she was much in his waking thoughts, and
                  he had been sorely troubled about her ever since her return, or whether some
                  strange warning was permitted to startle his soul, are questions in regard to
                  which we need not speculate. These unruly spirits of ours hold strange mysteries,
                  and are subject to odd influences, if only we were not so blind in our shallow
                  wisdom that we refuse to heed them. But the charm of her presence, the sight of
                  her face more tranquil than he had seen it in weeks, so cheered him that his
                  troubled dreams, his anxious forebodings, speedily faded from his mind.
               "You are in unusually good spirits," she said, as he talked more rapidly and gayly
                  than was his wont.
               "Because it makes me cheerful to see you look so much like yourself."
               "There you go again! Pray, like whom have I looked lately?"
               "I can't tell—a sort of ghost of your old self."
               "Oh, don't talk about ghosts even in broad daylight. There's no knowing how soon
                  you may rouse them," cried she.
               "None, I hope, that could torment you much."
               "Don't be afraid! You act as if you thought I went about with a secret, like a
                  woman in a romance; but I assure you my existence is a very tame one."
               "I don't like your talking in that way," he said, seriously; "you often do it
                  nowadays, as if you suspected me of watching you. Why should I?"
               "Why, indeed!"
               "I am anxious when I see you look ill or troubled, but I am sure you understand
                  that no other feeling makes me curious."
               "You're the best man in the world!" she exclaimed; "I'm not fit to have your
                  friendship. But never mind. When did you hear from Constance?"
               "Last night. She is enjoying her visit very much. At her age it needs so little to
                  make one happy."
               "Where is she—Albany?"
               "No, Cincinnati. She has some cousins there who have begged for a visit these two
                  years, so at last I was obliged to put by my selfishness, and give her up for a
                  few months."
               "You must miss her dreadfully; such a dear little thing, and growing so pretty,
                  too!"
               "And always honest and true, which is still better."
               "Ah! that's a hit at the rest of us poor women," cried she. "You don't give the
                  sex in general much credit for either quality."
               "Now you want to quarrel, and I'll not do it. I am contented and amiable this
                  morning, and you shall not tease me into a bad humor."
               He sat there for half an hour, enjoying the visit more than he had done any
                  interview with her for a long time. At the last he went hurriedly away, so moved
                  by her gentleness and sweetness that he was afraid to remain lest he should be
                  idiot enough to burst out with the revelation which he meant never to utter,
                  because its utterance would probably cause the loss of the greatest pleasure which
                  his life held—this frank, free intercourse with her.
               Alice Marchmont stood there after he had gone, with a line from the Book which she
                  had so long neglected ringing in her cars, "And some men's sins going before
                     to judgment." Truly hers was a case of this retribution; if the sentence
                  had been written especially to point her out, it could not have been more
                  applicable. Twenty times during that interview she had been on the point of
                  revealing the truth. She wished now that she had possessed the courage to do
                  it.
               "And then," she thought, "he would despise me; shrink away in horror and disgust,
                  and I should see it. I should be alone! Every thing is lost but his
                  friendship—youth, hope, truth, self-respect—oh, I can't lose that, too! Isn't the
                  remorse punishment enough? Isn't it any expiation, any atonement? Must I lose the
                  regard of my one friend, the one human being I care for? Oh, I can't—God forgive
                  me! I can't do that!"
               She sobbed and choked, but no tears came to relieve her, and, suddenly remembering
                  how late it was, rang for Pauline to bring her bonnet and mantle. Of course
                  another person must detain her, just because the anxiety had rushed back, and it
                  seemed that something dreadful would happen before she could reach the Jew's
                  office and obtain that paper. Miss Portman came into the room, and wanted advice
                  upon a dozen trivial domestic matters, concerning which in her most lucid moments
                  Alice would have been as ignorant as a child. Even when she escaped the discussion
                  and reached the door, the spinster called her back.
               "Don't forget—I mean, have you forgotten?"—for if conversing with a person who had
                  only five minutes to live she would have hesitated and struggled to make her language strictly
                  correct—"we are engaged to Mrs. Lathrop tonight."
               "Yes—what for? Oh, I know—a horrid dinner! I wish dinners were abolished. I wish
                  there might never be material found to get up another."
               "My dear Alice," returned the matter-of-fact creature, in horror, "you don't mean
                  that? You don't want the whole human race to starve, I am sure."
               "Then I'm not sure if you are! Bother the human race—singly and collectively!
                  Good-bye, you blessed! I'll soon be back. And oh, my Portman, if you don't stop
                  telling people you are anxious about my health I'll do something dreadful to
                  you!"
               "But I am anxious, my love."
               "That's because you are a dear old goose! But if you ever again hint that I ever
                  was, will, could, or should be ill, I'll—I'll—let me think! I'll make you drive in
                  the Park at five o'clock in the day with a yellow satin gown on and a bird-of
                  paradise in your bonnet."
               She ran off, and left Miss Portman with both hands uplifted and her eyes turned to
                  the ceiling, as if beseeching the crooked-legged cupids depicted there to shield
                  her from so terrible a fate.
               As Mrs. Marchmont's carriage made the turn into Broadway at Union Square, she saw
                  Dick Faulkner sauntering along. He saw her, too, and as he lifted his hat she
                  almost fancied that he made a gesture for her to stop. Then she remembered that he
                  was not likely now to be guilty of any such impertinence, and the reflection
                  brought her a feeling of relief.
               The carriage rolled on, and she reached her destination at length, solacing
                  herself all the way by the thought that it was the last time she should ever be
                  forced to make the journey. She had her check-book in her pocket—a delightful new
                  volume, sent to her the day before from the bank—and when she left the dusty
                  counting-room she would be a free woman, so far as he was concerned; better still,
                  so far as danger and disgrace were concerned.
               The frouzy fat partner of the little Jew's bosom, who was seated as usual at her
                  lofty desk, making her customary display of legs that were not mates and a great
                  deal of black stocking for the delectation of the youths behind the counter,
                  informed Mrs. Marchmont that the Hebrew was in his upper office.
               "Then I will go there," Alice replied, cheerfully, beyond the necessity of excuses
                  or subterfuges to delude the Mosaic clerks. "Don't trouble yourself to come with
                  me. I can find the way."
               So the frouzy woman mounted again to her perch, but with so utter a disregard of
                  her raiment that the young man nearest was able to see that she had forgotten her
                  garters that morning. Mrs. Marchmont passed on up the narrow staircase, which had
                  certainly never been swept, and entered the counting-room, which, in addition to
                  its ordinary odor of sausage and leather, had taken to itself several new and
                  indescribable smells since she was last in it. But she was in too great a hurry to
                  be disturbed by trifles. There sat her little Hebrew friend behind his table.
                  Alice thought that in all probability he dined and slept on that stool, and could
                  not be persuaded off it on any less urgent summons than the hope of cheating a
                  customer more effectually than the youths below stairs were capable of doing in
                  their present adolescent state.
               It did not take long to explain her business, and her Hebrew looked just as wooden
                  as he did on all occasions.
               "I have come to pay every penny I owe you," she repeated, wondering that even the
                  idea of receiving money could not rouse him into a little animation.
               "You are the first visitor of the sort I have had to-day," he said, in his wheezy
                  voice, as he laid down his ruler and put his pen behind his ear. "Plenty come to
                  borrow—"
               "Yes, I dare say. But I am in great haste this morning; so please don't keep me a
                  minute longer than you can help. I want all the securities—the shares, bonds, my
                  jewels. I'll give you a check for the whole amount—the—the last bill and all."
               "Ya'as—so! I heard that madam had sold her Virginia lands to the great company,"
                  he answered, composedly.
               "I believe you hear every thing," said she. "Come—open your great ugly safe, and
                  reckon your interest, and let me pay you. Please don't keep me waiting. I've a
                  thousand things to do."
               "I won't, dear madam, I won't! But give me a little time. I've just had a
                  gentleman here who always does make my poor head so dizzy—Mr. Faulkner."
               "Mr. Faulkner here? Why, I met him in Union Square."
               "Ya'as—just so. He had been here, but not to borrow. Oh, he's too great a man for
                  that nowadays," replied the Hebrew, and for an instant he did rouse enough out of
                  his impassibility to look resentful; but Mrs. Marchmont was too much troubled by
                  the name he had mentioned to observe his appearance.
               "What on earth did Mr. Faulkner want?" she asked, with a sudden fear, which even
                  the thought of the check-book in her pocket could not silence.
               "Business—always business," said the Jew, absently, as he rose from his seat and
                  walked toward the iron safe, key in hand. He opened the heavy door, which grated
                  and complained as if unwilling to disgorge its prey, searched among the
                  compartments, and finally returned to the table, carrying a heap of papers which
                  Mrs. Marchmont recognized only too well.
               "And the box of jewels!" she demanded.
               "Ya'as, presently; as soon as we are through with this," he said.
               "Are you afraid I shall seize it, and run off without paying you?" she asked,
                  impatiently.
               "The madam knows I never doubt her," he said, unmoved. "She ought to have the
                  diamonds compared with my list, to be sure they are all the same."
               "I can trust you, too. I do think you're honest in your way," she said.
               "Business is business, though," he answered, taking a soiled bit of sweet
                  flag-root from his pocket, and proceeding to chew it with an air of tranquil
                  satisfaction. He untied the bundle of papers, and spread them out on the table,
                  and she sat down opposite him. "These are the railway bonds, this is the stock;
                  there's the last interest dotted down on this page. I did it last night, for I
                  knew the madam would be here soon, after what I'd heard, and I didn't want to keep
                  her waiting."
               Mrs. Marchmont studied the amounts; principal and interest were all noted. The sum
                  was a very large one, but, fortunately, she could pay the whole without
                  difficulty.
               "Every thing is here? the amount for the jewels—"
               He pointed to the item with his dirty forefinger.
               "Oh yes, and the mortgage on the Long Island property— Yes, I see. But the
                  last—the bill?" she asked, looking quickly up.
               "The bill?" he repeated, though neither voice nor features expressed any surprise.
                  "The madam is a good business woman, but she forgets sometimes."
               "What do you mean?" demanded she. "Where is the note I drew for three months—"
               "Ninety days," he parenthesized, as usual.
               "Yes, the indorsed note—"
               "Indorsed by Mr. John Worthington, of course; that one," returned the Jew,
                  apparently thinking that he recalled to her mind some circumstance she had
                  forgotten.
               "But I want to take that up, too," she said, eagerly. "It's not due yet; but no
                  matter—I want to pay every thing."
               Probably the Hebrew had not laughed in twenty years at least, but he did laugh
                  now, in a hoarse, creaking tone, as if the muscles of his throat were so
                  unaccustomed to the exercise that they did not know how to behave.
               "Now, that is more than I look for," said he, while Mrs. Marchmont sat staring at
                  him with a dismayed wonder, at first the only sensation in her mind. "The madam
                  wants to pay me twice. But once will do."
               "Pay you twice?" cried she. "Are you asleep? What on earth do you mean?"
               Now his wooden features did show a faint trace of surprise.
               "I think I didn't never hear to equal that," said he, shaking his head slowly. "I
                  do believe it has gone out of the madam's mind."
               His dull astonishment, the strange mystery of his words, changed the sensation in
                  her mind to one of sudden fear.
               "I tell you I want the promissory note I gave you, due in ninety days,
                  indorsed—indorsed—" She could not finish. "Give me that note! I think you must be
                  a little insane this morning!"
               "But I have given it to you," he answered, his face showing that he was still
                  divided between surprise and the idea that she had forgotten certain circumstances
                  in regard to the bill.
               She caught up the sheet where the sums were set down—the note was not named. She
                  seized the pile of papers, turned them hastily over—the bill was not among them.
                  The Jew sat perfectly still, and watched her more curiously.
               "It's not here!" she exclaimed. "Where—where is that note?"
               "But I explain and explain," he said, patiently, spreading out his two hands. "I
                  don't want the madam to pay me twice."
               "If you want me to pay you once, you had better be quick," she said, her voice
                  growing cold and haughty. "Are you presuming to attempt a jest? You forget
                  yourself, sir!"
               "I don't mean to offend the madam," he said, humbly, "and I don't never joke. I
                  can't understand—she seems to forget, though I try my best to make her
                  remember."
               "Remember what?" she asked, forcing herself to sit still and to speak quietly.
               "About the note—"
               "Mr. Hermans, answer me distinctly—where is that note?" she interrupted, looking
                  sternly at him.
               "I gave it up when madam sent me her letter."
               She was on her feet now, staring wildly at him, unable to believe the testimony of
                  her own ears. He rose too, perhaps, in spite of his impassibility, somewhat
                  startled by her appearance. She motioned him to sit down; resumed her own seat.
                  The great horror and dread, undefined as it was, which had taken possession of
                  her, made her afraid to demand the close of the explanation which her hasty
                  movement had interrupted.
               "When did you receive my letter?" she asked, after a short silence, which he had
                  not ventured to break through fear of displeasing her again, though in what his
                  offense consisted he had not the slightest idea.
               "Four weeks ago—nearly five," he replied, determined to confine himself to the
                  simple answer of her questions.
               She hesitated again; then inquired,
               "How did you receive it?"
               "Why, Mr. Faulkner brought it himself," came the response without an instant's
                  delay.
               Mrs. Marchmont grew so giddy and faint under the awful shock that her first
                  confused thought was that she had received a physical blow from some unseen hand.
                  As the black, dancing mists cleared a little from before her eyes, she saw the
                  Hebrew looking strangely at her. Very far off and indistinct his features appeared
                  through the shadows.
               "The letter—give me the letter!" were her first words.
               
               He opened a drawer of the table, took out a folded sheet of paper, and handed it
                  to her. She was obliged to hold it close to her eyes in order to read; a partial
                  blindness seemed to have seized her. It was her writing, she could distinguish
                  that; after a while could make out the words. They were these:
               "Will Mr. Herman please give to Mr. Faulkner the promissory note? Mr. Faulkner
                  will pay the money, and settle the affair."
               Her name was at the bottom. She remembered writing the billet; but that was in the
                  autumn. She recollected the whole circumstance, confused as she was. She had
                  borrowed a small amount of the Jew for thirty days; he had accepted her note. The
                  morning it fell due Faulkner chanced to come to her house with a sum of money
                  which he had made for her in a stock speculation. He knew that she had borrowed of
                  the Hebrew, so she had no hesitation in requesting him to stop at the office, pay
                  the sum, and take up the note. That very evening he had sent her the paper, and
                  there was an end. This billet which she held in her hands had no date, but it was
                  the one she had written in November; it was the only time that she had ever
                  empowered Faulkner to arrange any matter with the Hebrew.
               "It is all right—madam recollects now," she heard the Jew say, cheerfully, while
                  he rubbed his fat hands together. "Madam was in Washington when she wrote, so busy
                  with her pleasure that she forgot; but it was all settled. Mr. Faulkner came
                  straight here as soon as he heard from madam, paid the thousands, took up the
                  note, and madam must have burned it long ago, and forgotten, as she did all the
                  rest."
               She felt no inclination to shriek or faint. She was stupid and numbed by the
                  shock. It had affected her senses for the time exactly as an actual blow on her
                  skull would have done. She could not hear or see distinctly. She spoke, and her
                  voice did not sound like her own; she was conscious of wondering stupidly if it
                  was hers.
               "That is off the list, then," she said. "Make up the whole amount of those
                  separate items, and I will write a check."
               The Jew began his calculations, and she sat there, regarding him in the same dull,
                  stunned manner. Confused as she was, one reflection gradually separated itself
                  from the chaos of her faculties and started up, like a serpent uncoiling its
                  length. Faulkner held that note! He had discovered the forgery, and she was once
                  more in his power! She held fast to the arms of her chair, griping them hard, for
                  it seemed to her that she was falling down—down an immeasurable height into an
                  awful blackness that stretched below. But she did not lose consciousness, did not
                  cry out. Her face was white and fixed, her great eyes positively looked dead and
                  glazed. She drooped slowly against the chair-back, like a lifeless body; but she
                  could see and hear still.
               "That is the amount. Madam can verify it," the Jew said, pushing the paper along
                  the table.
               She leaned both elbows on the board, supported her head with her two hands,
                  actually added up the long row of figures—a kind of mental exertion which would
                  not have been easy for her at ordinary moments. Slowly and with difficulty—any
                  physical movement was a labor—she changed her attitude, took the check-book,
                  filled up one of the blanks, and gave it to him. While she wrote he had been to
                  the safe and taken out the box of jewels. It sat on the table by her.
               "That finishes every thing," he said. "Madam has all her papers. Here is the list,
                  too, of the stones with the values as near as I could get at it in their
                  settings—she must have it verified. Here is a receipt in full, too, though not
                  needed; but I know ladies are particular. So I thank the madam, and I wish all my
                  customers were as prompt and honorable."
               It was a long speech for the small man. She comprehended that her business was
                  ended—that she must go; comprehended, too, that in leaving the place she went
                  forth to meet a danger more deadly, more inevitable than any she had yet known.
                  But she did not faint; made no sign; and the Jew did not trouble himself to study
                  her face.
               She took the papers and jewel-box in her hand, and tried to rise. Twice she was
                  obliged to sit down: her limbs refused to support her. The Hebrew was locking his
                  safe, and did not observe her. With the third effort she got out of her chair,
                  walked steadily onward, but in a moment the Jew's voice warned her that, instead
                  of moving toward the door, she had gone in the opposite direction, and was close
                  to the window.
               "Madam wants to see if her carriage is waiting. I'll call the man, if he has
                  driven up the street."
               She thanked him, knew that she bade him good-morning, passed down the stairs,
                  entered her carriage, and was driven away.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               THE POOR BARON.
               THE next morning came, and Alice Marchmont rose to meet it with such calmness of
                  desperation as she could find. It was useless to talk about courage now; she had
                  reached a strait where the word possessed no meaning. In Dick Faulkner's power
                  still! That had been her sole tangible thought during the hours of solitude which
                  she had permitted herself after her return from that visit to the Hebrew. She had
                  sent Miss Portman alone to the evening's festivity, glad for once to offer the
                  feminine excuse of illness as a reason for staying at home.
               This man, whom she had believed out of her way forever, held her secret in his
                  hands. Disgrace was before her, after all she had dared; the power to fling it
                  down upon her possessed by the very wretch to escape whom she had soiled her soul
                  with crime. Nothing left now but death—no hope! As well look for mercy from a
                  jungle tiger as from him! It was all over. Truly, her world had fallen in ruins at
                  her feet!
               She had decided to wait; she would neither send for him nor write; she would make
                  no sign whatever, as long as there was a day of grace left. It was not from any
                  expectation that her silence would force him into showing the line of conduct he
                  had resolved to pursue. There was no plan in her determination beyond a desire to
                  avoid his presence as long as possible.
               Of course, this morning a dozen people came. She had given orders that she was at
                  home to whosoever came. Of all times, she must not at this crisis vary from her
                  usual habits. Besides the visitors, there were calls from creditors whom she had
                  requested to send in their accounts, fancying the delight with which she should
                  pay them. Now, as debt after debt was stricken off the formidable pile, she only
                  remembered that these efforts to preserve appearances, to be honest and
                  straightforward, were in vain. She might pay—struggle; always the skeleton hand
                  kept before her eyes the note which Dick Faulkner owned, the note with John
                  Worthington's signature.
               By the time the last of the creditors had gone, reduced to a state of smiling
                  abjectness by the entire satisfaction of their claims, the idle people began to
                  stream in. Helen James, overflowing with gossip; Miss Portman's two old maid
                  friends; half a dozen silly women and sillier men, in pairs or singly, and they
                  buzzed and fluttered. But she bore it all patiently; nothing mattered.
               One by one the visitors departed; Miss Portman herself went out, after changing
                  her mind six times as to whether she had better go or stay at home, and insisting
                  that Alice should agree with each separate decision. Mrs. Marchmont sat there
                  alone, wondering if the day would ever come to an end, yet shuddering to see it
                  pass. Presently Ferguson appeared to say that the baron desired an interview. The
                  name roused her to a quickness of reflection which stirred the dullness of her
                  senses into a sudden pain. The baron—why, here was a chance of release, if she
                  should accept him, marry him at once, and go away. True, she was not in possession
                  of the fortune with which report endowed her, but abundance of money was certain
                  to come sooner or later. He was not an extravagant man, nor a mercenary one,
                  though, of course, Frenchman-like, he would not think of marrying a woman who
                  could bring him no dot. But his head, if not
                  very wide, was a rather practical one. If she explained exactly the state of her
                  affairs, proved to him that the sale of her lands would make her rich again before
                  five years were over, he would be perfectly satisfied. His income and the ready
                  money which she should have left, after arranging her debts, would enable them to
                  live almost en prince in Italy. Rome was not an
                  unpleasant place of sojourn now. The young princess had gone there to hold her
                  court. Since Paris had ceased to be—at least the delightful Paris of the
                  Empire—the Eternal City would rank first on the Continent in the matter of
                  amusements and gayety, thanks to the royal Marguerite's love of dancing and
                  pleasure.
               Surely, another escape from the laudanum-bottle was offered. It needed no
                  reflection; the way out lay plain before her. The first idea of a sudden, almost
                  secret, marriage would not answer; Dick Faulkner would discover her plan, appear
                  at the altar, and wave the forged note in the bridegroom's face, if he could stop
                  the nuptials in no other manner. But she might sail at once for Europe, meet the
                  baron in London, wed him there, and let events in America take their course. If
                  John Worthington learned the truth—no, when he learned it, he would not trouble
                  her; he would find means to silence Faulkner. She knew the man; she could be
                  certain that the hour in which Faulkner exposed the secret to him wicked Dick's
                  ability to harm her would be at an end. She should never see Worthington
                  afterward, never be humiliated by the sight of his kind face, dark with loathing
                  and contempt. Faulkner might spread evil stories; they would be powerless in her
                  new life—utterly so. No echo of them could disturb her quiet in the old Roman
                  palace which she and the baron were to choose for their residence.
               It takes so many words to describe her reflections, though they arranged
                  themselves clearly in the brief space before the Frenchman could be shown into the
                  room. There was leisure for another thought, too—worse, more degrading than the
                  others. Poor, miserable Alice! mad, guilt-stained Alice! so fallen from the high
                  estate of her glorious womanhood! She need not run away; she could accept the
                  baron, asking only that the engagement should be kept a profound secret until her
                  affairs were entirely arranged. That would give her leisure to outwit Faulkner.
                  She could do it! Smile at him, weep for him, throw herself on his mercy, lie to
                  him, fool him to the top of his bent, meet artifice with artifice, craft with
                  craft. If he believed that he should succeed, that she would listen to the avowal
                  of his shameful love, he would give up the note, take her money—she was free! Only
                  at the cost of a few falsehoods, of a stain upon her soul deeper and darker than
                  that left by her treachery to her friend; the guilt and degradation of smiling on
                  a man whose every thought in regard to her was pollution, whose every smile an
                  insult; by these means she could purchase her release. She felt a glow of
                  exultation at the idea of duping him, of tearing the note before his eyes, and
                  telling him that he had been duped—outwitted; overwhelming him with the full torrent of her passion and scorn,
                  and enjoying his utter confusion and impotent wrath.
               Then the very thrill of wicked joy which shook her at the picture of his evil face
                  changing suddenly from anticipated triumph to rage and the humiliation of defeat,
                  roused her to a consciousness of the depth to which her soul had sunk. The
                  self-contempt and abhorrence came back, an unutterable fear of herself, too; but
                  there was no space to moan or cry out. The baron was entering; he was in the
                  room.
               There he stood, irreproachable in toilet and attitude, overflowing with pretty
                  speeches, beaming with smiles and delight at finding Mrs. Marchmont alone.
               "This is more happiness than I expected," he said, in French, as he finally
                  subsided into a chair near her, after having made himself pink in the face by bows
                  and compliments.
               Mrs. Marchmont looked at him, and, stunned and dazed as she was, retained enough
                  hold of her womanly intuitions to understand the errand which had brought him; the
                  baron meant to speak out. It had been very difficult for weeks past to avert the
                     denouement; it would have come in Washington,
                  only that she was always careful never to allow him a private conversation. Let
                  him speak now. He appeared at the right moment; let him speak. She had proved
                  herself a coward: she had tried to die, and lacked the courage to carry out her
                  wish. If she trusted to that means of escape, it would fail her again at the last.
                  She was lost, degraded, sunk below the possibility of recovering her self-respect.
                  But one hold over the world remained, one chance to keep the hollow splendor of
                  her life secure before human eyes. She could accept the baron, and outwit Dick
                  Faulkner!
               She had leisure to follow her thoughts so far while the baron chose a more
                  picturesque attitude than his first, arranged the ends of his long mustache, and
                  assured himself that his wristbands showed the proper line of white below his coat
                  sleeves.
               "I began to think there was a fate in it," he said. "I haven't succeeded for so
                  long in seeing you alone that I was truly in despair."
               "You look very comfortable for a despairing man," she replied, speaking his native
                  language with an accent as perfectly Parisian as his own.
               "That is because I am here—with you opposite; no wearisome people to interfere. I
                  am comfortable; I am well."
               "But you are not to commence abusing my friends as soon as you come in," she said;
                  "and in such a sweeping fashion!"
               "I did not say your friends were tiresome, only that it was pleasant not to have a
                  whole world about us."
               "Very well; put in that way, I forgive you! And how does town seem after the
                  dullness of Washington?"
               "Oh, it is endurable, because you are here," he said, with a shrug which revealed
                  his slighting opinion of Gotham as plainly as the most violent abuse could have
                  done. "But I can not think why you stay here; you ought to be in Europe. These
                  people do not appreciate you—these dull men of business, with their ledgers always
                  in their minds."
               "But Paris is dead—poor Paris!" she answered. "And London is a degree worse than
                  New York."
               "Do not mention it!" he shuddered, with a true Gallic horror of every thing
                  English. "I do always remember my one visit there. I staid but a week, and I never
                  can forget!"
               "Or forgive," she added.
               "Ah! that, yes. One does not hate the poor islanders, one only pities them;" and
                  it was delicious to hear the way in which he said it. If Albion had been situated
                  near the North Pole, and its inhabitants an inoffensive race, doomed to hunt seals
                  and live on train-oil, he could not have expressed more commiseration by his
                  tone.
               "I should like to see Italy again," she said; "I have not been there in years.
                  Rome must be very pleasant now."
               "Yes; since poor Paris is so changed. I shall go there when I return."
               "And you think of deserting us?" she asked. "Are you already tired of our poor
                  country?"
               "The country that has the honor to hold you must always be charming," he replied,
                  in the rather ponderous fashion which was due to the slight admixture of Flemish
                  blood in his veins. "But I do go back very soon. I have told you so before."
               "Yes, but I hoped you might change your mind. It is tiresome to lose people just
                  as one gets really to know them," she said, and felt it very hard work to sit
                  there and talk commonplaces, and lead the conversation up to the point he desired.
                  But it must be done.
               "It is of that I do wish to speak. I came to do so this morning," returned he,
                  fidgeting a little, as the most thorough-bred man will do under the embarrassment
                  of an errand like his.
               "Oh, don't talk of any thing so dismal as your going away!" she said, willfully
                  misunderstanding his words, just because coquetry had grown so much a matter of
                  habit that she could not help indulging in it.
               "But it is of that I must speak, to give a reason for showing you my whole heart
                  and soul!" he exclaimed, warning to his work.
               But the sentence which he thought so neat struck rather heavily on Mrs.
                  Marchmont's ear. She had heard so much glowing talk from really eloquent men, that
                  the baron's poor little periods sounded tame enough. She was not thinking of her
                  own wickedness in allowing him to speak, and making the answer she had decided to
                  give, only wondering how she could ever support life with that unchanging face
                  always opposite her, that measured voice to ring incessantly in her ear, and (it
                  sounds puerile and absurd to write it of her in her state of mind, but I like to
                  show you clearly what an inconsequent, vagrant habit of thought she had allowed
                  herself to cultivate) she wondered if the pointed ends of that mustache would some
                  day put her eyes out when he attempted to kiss her. Then she remembered that he
                  was a Frenchman, and once married. Her face would be of slight consequence; he
                  would be a model husband, visit her occasionally, sometimes breakfast with her.
                  The rest of their two lives would pass free of each other.
               He was heavy and tiresome; it took him a long while to say very little; the
                  slowness of his Flemish intellect rendered him incapable of understanding a jest;
                  he was the dreariest compound of respectable commonplaces; but—a thorough
                  gentleman—he would never in any way violate les
                     convenances. If he even had small vices, and she almost thought they
                  would make an interesting variety, he would hide them so carefully that they need
                  never come under her notice. But he was speaking again, and she must listen. It
                  would not answer to allow him to propose without hearing it. However, he had not
                  yet reached the important words; he had to go through the business in his own
                  methodical manner. Perhaps he thought that as he should be freed from the
                  necessity of making pretty speeches for the future, in case she became his wife,
                  it was his duty to exhaust the whole vocabulary now.
               "I should not have staid in America so long as I have but for the great happiness
                  of finding myself near you," he said.
               "A very nice compliment," she replied; "but it does not count for much, since you
                  talk of running away just as we have become good friends."
               She had not patience to wait while he sidled and maundered up to the goal through
                  a drizzling shower of flattering words. If he wanted to ask her to marry him, let
                  him do it and be done.
               "I like to hear you say that," sighed he; and she thought what a delightful
                  caricature he would make just then, and felt an insane desire to commit some
                  enormity on the instant which would startle him out of his propriety—to dance at
                  him like a maniac, or talk gibberish that he would take for Choctaw, or sing an
                  aria from the "Grand Duchess," but controlled herself. "Ah! yes, they are very
                  sweet words. I would like to hear you say them again."
               Positively, this was too much, when every nerve in her body was out of order and
                  her mind a chaos!
               "Life is not long enough to repeat things," returned she; "and I am never of the
                  same opinion a sufficient length of time to do it. Take care, or I shall say
                  something savage, by way of a change."
               He looked bewildered, and a little hurt.
               "You do always confuse and put me off like that," he said, with another tremendous
                  sigh. "It is not right, when I speak earnestly!"
               "I had not the least idea you were doing that," she replied. "Come, I will be as
                  serious as an academician."
               "Yes; for I came to be serious."
               "What an appalling threat! Really, I think I must call Miss Portman. She can deal
                  with such a mood better than I."
               "I pray you do not call her; do not rise," he said, as usual taking her words
                  literally.
               "But I think it must have been she you came to visit. She is a very serious
                  person," replied Alice, for the satisfaction of teasing him, since there was no
                  other relief to be gained.
               "It is you whom I wished to see, you only; ah! you do know that—you do see my
                  mind."
               "My dear baron, I am the stupidest and blindest of my sex! I need to have any fact
                  clearly pointed out before I can perceive it."
               He sighed for the third time. Now it was because she worried him, broke the thread
                  of his prearranged discourse, and ruined his round of compliments. But he was very
                  much in earnest, and though to his slow comprehension it was somewhat like making
                  love to a meteor, he must tell his story.
               "You are the most wise as you are the most beautiful of your sex," he said. "See,
                  you do so hurry and confuse me that I can not well choose my words. But I wish to
                  say clearly what is in my mind."
               "I am listening," she answered, resignedly.
               "I have told you that I staid here because of you. Now I must return to my own
                  land; but I want you to know—"
               Evidently the sentence was not the exact one he had meant to put in that
                  particular place; for he broke off and consulted the crown of his hat, as if the
                  proper arrangement of words was noted there. Mrs. Marchmont was thinking over the
                  plan which the announcement of his name had suggested. She could get away—be free
                  from Dick Faulkner; oh, if he would only speak and have it over!
               "I am before you this morning," he went on rather more rapidly, as if he had put
                  the sentences in order at last and was encouraged thereby, "as a humble suitor, a
                  poor suppliant upon your bounty; and yet I am to ask that which is priceless,
                  feeling always my own unworthiness."
               It was stilted and strained, more so in French even than English, reminding her of
                  a paragraph out of some obsolete romance; yet it was plain that he spoke
                  truthfully. Somehow the idea troubled her; but she did not interrupt him.
               "I do come to offer you my hand, my title, though in these days it may be that
                  does not count for much. I do come honestly, gravely, as an honorable man should.
                  I have weighed in my mind well the whole matter. I do think that we might have a
                  happy life if, in your great goodness, you could care for me a little. See, I
                  would not have you accept my offer if you can not do that. I do ask your heart for
                  my heart, because I love you very dearly, and must have your love in return for
                  mine; else I should be most miserable."
               
               Once off, he had spoken more fluently than she ever heard him, and the words and
                  manner filled her with such astonishment that she could not break in upon his
                  speech. This was not what she had expected; she did not want this! Why, the man
                  cared for her! It was not her beauty, her fortune—he cared for her; his slow, dull
                  heart was moved, and cried out for crumbs of comfort. Oh, to accept him would be a
                  wickedness beyond even her! She could not! A quick revulsion shook her mind; the
                  full horror and shame of the project she had contemplated stared her in the face.
                  But he had not finished, he was speaking still; she must interrupt, must tell him
                  that it could not be; and then where was she—what was to become of her, then?
               "I could wish you to reflect. I should attend your answer until you have thought
                  well of the matter—"
               "Wait, don't say— Let me speak," she faltered.
               He bowed, looking at her with a certain troubled surprise.
               "I—I can not. Oh, I beg you pardon, baron!" she cried; "I have done very wrong. I
                  did not expect you to speak like this."
               He smiled now; her words had evidently restored his self-complacency.
               "That does not surprise me," he said. "I am a man with a singular control over my
                  feelings. I willed not to show my sentiments until the fitting moment. You have
                  thought me only an admirer—a friend; but see, now I make plain my secret, and I
                  ask you to consider it."
               "But—but when you talk of caring for me—of love!" she exclaimed, involuntarily
                  breaking into English, "oh no, no, I never thought of that!"
               "But it is now that you sall sink," he replied, doing his best with the harsh
                  syllables of her native tongue. "Not so soon, peutêtre, but after I my leave take. Zen you sall sink, and I wait
                  till you comment dit—on raflaict."
               She did not answer; she did not know what to say. He waited for an instant, then
                  took refuge in his own language once more.
               "You may believe me when I say it is all my heart that I bring here. I love you;
                  and I do not lightly speak those words."
               "You must not love me," she said, eagerly. "Had you talked to me about respect—no,
                  no"—for the word applied to herself made her shiver—"I mean if you talked of
                  friendship, that would be well enough, but not love, not love."
               "I must speak that which I feel; it is love," he answered. "See, I have startled
                  you—I had kept my secret too well. You are moved! Let me go away now. When you
                  have thought, you will send for me to hear your answer."
               "No, don't go; we must understand each other fully! Baron, you can't blame me so
                  much as I blame myself."
               "But I can not blame you at all; you have not known. I have been so guarded—it is
                  my habit—that you did not perceive."
               "I thought—I feared you might accuse me of coquetry."
               "No, no," he replied, with a conceit that would have amused her at another time.
                  "I am not a man with whom women coquette. I am too grave, too serious. You have
                  done always what was most charming. But before I go, let me fully explain—"
               "I can't have you," she interrupted; "you must not."
               "You are nervous only," he said, smiling. "See, I shall talk no more about my poor
                  heart; it loves you, and I think you do believe me a man too sober to speak false
                  words. But other views of the affair; I have looked at every side. I am not a rich
                  man—I have my little thirty thousand francs a year, but compared with your
                  American fortunes, it is small."
               He paused, to be certain that the sentences were following in the proper order,
                  and the delay gave her leisure to see the one way of proving to him the
                  impossibility of any idea of marriage between them.
               "You have a right to expect a fortune in return," she said; "a much larger one
                  than your own even, since you have position and title to give."
               "Yes," he said, gravely, "that ought to count. Still, once more in the cause of my
                  poor heart, dear lady! Were you less rich, were your fortune smaller than mine, I
                  would ask you just the same to marry me, if you could be brave enough to forego
                  great wealth."
               She had laughed at this man, amused her friends at his expense, and here he showed
                  himself kind and noble-minded; and she—but oh, what could she expect of
                  herself—lost, fallen!
               "But I have not the great fortune," she said, quickly. "People think me very rich.
                  I must tell you my secret; I know that it is safe with you."
               He looked disturbed now, but made one of his low bows as a sign that he waited for
                  her to continue.
               "I have spent and lost an immense deal of money. I have been extravagant and
                  wicked. I am trying to free myself from debt."
               "That is right; it is like you," he said, his face clearing. "But once your debts
                  paid, all will be well. You do sell your lands—you told me so."
               "Yes; but you can form no idea of what my debts are! It will take nearly the whole
                  sum of money I get to pay them. I shall be poor for years, forced to economize in
                  every way possible."
               "But after that?"
               "Oh, maybe in ten years I shall have a large income again; but it is a chance.
                  Suppose the mines should prove a failure. Don't you see, my fortune will depend on
                  the company's success?"
               "But it is sure; it is only a matter of time."
               "No, no; it is not sure. There is always a risk in such things."
               He sat still for a few seconds, took out his watch, looked at it steadily for a
                  space, then put it in his pocket.
               "I do beg your pardon," he said. "I made myself take those moments to reflect; it
                  is wise always to reflect. Now I shall ask—"
               "Don't ask me any thing!" cried she.
               "It is the nerves always," he said, in the loftily compassionate tone in which
                  certain people address children, though it was too kindly meant to be
                  offensive—"always the nerves, dear lady. I must finish my question. I had arranged
                  it."
               "If he were married and his wife died," thought Mrs. Marchmont, "he'd bury her, if
                  he had made his arrangements, no matter if she came back to life and tried to run
                  away."
               "It is this," he pursued, apparently reading it off the crown of his hat. "I have
                  told you what is the amount of my income; could you be content with that and
                  yours, whatever it may be, added? I have reflected—I did not take much time, for I
                  have studied my nature where you are concerned. I always make a study of my
                  nature; but in all that regards you I have done so to a greater degree than
                  ordinary. So I know what I say, I feel what I do offer. I shall be a man very
                  happy if you can accept."
               She could not laugh. He might talk in fearfully long sentences, but his proposal
                  was that of a good man, and she felt it—a courageous proposal, too, coming from
                  one brought up under such narrowing influences as he had been, with old creeds in
                  regard to the necessity of wealth to support his title added to the rest.
               "I thank you, I do thank you!" she said. "If I were a better woman—I mean if I
                  were not so hopelessly wedded to luxury; if I were able to be reasonable and
                  prudent, it would change matters. But I can not trust myself."
               "You have not thought; you must take time. All people do not study their natures
                  closely enough to reply to grave questions without much reflection," he urged.
               "No, the matter must be settled here—now," she replied, eagerly; and it was an
                  added humiliation in the midst of her self-abasement to feel how utterly unworthy
                  she was of this man's affection, unconscious that her very inability to carry out
                  the wild plan which had risen in her mind was a proof of how much good still
                  remained in her burdened soul.
               "I must tell you plainly, if people knew the real state of my affairs they would
                  call me ruined. I am poor. I must give up my present life, go away where I shall
                  not be tempted into extravagance."
               "We could live quietly at Naples, at Florence; even Pisa is not so bad," he said,
                  hopefully.
               "I can't marry you; I can't!" she exclaimed. "There! it's out; forgive me! When
                  you came in, I meant to; when you began to speak, I meant to; but I understand you
                  better now, and I will not do you so great a wrong."
               "How could it be a wrong to give me my happiness?" he asked, confused again by the
                  energy with which she spoke. "You who are so beautiful, so good—"
               "I'm not good," she broke in, then checked herself in time, and continued, more
                  quietly, "let us put the matter solely on pecuniary grounds; you and I are not two
                  children to be blinded by romance. Honestly, I could not marry any but a very
                  wealthy man. I know how mean it sounds; but I should ruin any other. I might try
                  to be prudent; I could not. What would seem ordinary expense to me would be mad
                  extravagance. No, no, baron; it can not be! I thank you for your offer, I honor
                  you, I like you; but I will not be your wife."
               She spoke so decidedly that he saw she meant every word, and realized that there
                  was no appeal. He looked troubled and distressed, but conducted himself like a
                  chivalrous knight. Perhaps even the crusaders were a little heavy and stiff.
               "You leave me dumb," he answered; "you do not care for me, so I have no hope to
                  offer. Still, I thank you, dear lady. It is something to have loved you. All my
                  life-long I shall feel honored by the thought that I have, though the memory shall
                  bring its little pain, too."
               "I hope not, baron! I shall trust some day to see you happy in the affection of a
                  wife more worthy of you than I should have been."
               "Madame," said he, with one of his eternal bows, "the day may come—I do not yet
                  see it—when I shall ask some good lady to accept my hand, and I shall try always
                  to make her a good husband; but I feel that whatever the happiness may be that
                  comes, it will not be the happiness your regard could have given, and I shall know
                  that my life held one chance of a great success, and missed it."
               Actually she felt the moisture gather under her eyelids—she, who had grown so
                  fierce, so hardened in fighting her terrible battle against the destiny her own
                  recklessness had brought about, that she often thought no tears could ever cool
                  her heart again.
               "You will find a better happiness than such a woman as I could give," she said;
                  "and when it comes you must teach the lady to like me a little. She will not need
                  to be jealous."
               "No," he answered; "because I shall tell her the whole truth at first. One need
                  have no trouble with those whom one loves, if there is only perfect candor and
                  trust."
               He bowed over her hand, uttered his last farewells, and turned to go.
               "Not adieu," she said. "You will come to see me again."
               "Madame, to-morrow a steamer sails for France. If you look, you shall see my name
                  among the passengers," he replied.
               "Oh no! not so suddenly."
               "My business here is done," he said, after waiting to be sure that he did not
                  interrupt her. "I shall go back to my own country. I had so arranged it, in case
                  disappointment overwhelmed me this morning. Once more, dear madame, adieu."
               
               "And a prosperous voyage, and many happy days," she said, tremulously.
               "My thanks—my best thanks. Adieu!"
               He bowed himself out, the door closed, and left her to the reflection that once
                  more an honest heart had been offered for her acceptance, and she forced to let it
                  pass out of reach. Other thoughts came up—thoughts so terrible, so maddening, that
                  she dared not trust herself to their companionship.
               The air of the house was stifling; she would suffocate if she sat there a moment
                  longer. She rang the bell, and asked the servant if he knew whether her
                  riding-horse had been brought to the stables, as she had ordered a few days
                  previous. The horse had been sent over from her Long Island farm, and was ready.
                  She never had to repeat a command in her household.
               "Tell them I want to ride. I will have James to follow me."
               She hurried up stairs; Pauline was not there; she exchanged her dress for a
                  riding-habit, without assistance, doing it all in frantic haste, as if there was
                  some urgent need. Her house was so far up toward the Park, that she could mount at
                  her own door, instead of having to endure the boredom of a carriage on account of
                  crowded streets.
               The trees were already fresh and green, the turf verdant, the air balmy and soft,
                  and the bright spring sunshine making all things beautiful. The rapid exercise was
                  a relief. Away she galloped; on through the Park and out on the Bloomingdale Road,
                  regardless of any surprise that her appearance there, with no other escort than a
                  servant, might occasion. She dashed on, heedless of every thing and every body;
                  and it was only dropping her whip and having to halt, while the faithful James—who
                  thought the end of the world must be near when his mistress obliged him to ride at
                  such a pace—enabled Kenneth Halford to attract her attention. The bright day and
                  his own discontent had tempted him into equestrian exercise also, and he was on
                  his way back to the Park when he saw her.
               "You were riding so furiously," he said, after his first greetings, "that I almost
                  fancied Irving's headless horseman had strayed down from Sleepy Hollow."
               "I hate to crawl," she answered, while he sat marveling at her beauty, familiar as
                  he was with her face. The air and exertion had given a tinge of color to her
                  cheeks, and; her great brown eyes were fairly dazzling. "So, you are on your way
                  home? I might have asked you to ride with me, only I am very stupid."
               "And I too; but if you will permit, I shall go on with you."
               "Why should you be stupid?" she asked, as they passed up the hill. "Haven't you
                  got your strawberries and cream; aren't you satisfied?"
               He was not in a mood to be teased; he did not wish the conversation to stray
                  toward Milly, for he had no mind to be guilty of the meanness of complaint in
                  regard to her.
               "If you say annoying things, I shall ask after your health," said he. "Let's be
                  civil, and keep to generalities."
               "With all my heart, or, better, don't let's talk, just for the sake of novelty.
                  Here's a smooth bit of ground—now for a race. I'll wager six pairs of gloves that
                  Princess and I reach the next mile-stone before your Blueskin."
               Away they dashed, and the Princess and her rider won by a length. What might be
                  thought by several stately ladies of her acquaintance whom they passed in the
                  race, Mrs. Marchmont neither reflected nor cared.
               "I feel much better," she said, when the goal was reached. "Now we can turn
                  homeward. I feel almost human again."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               A COSTLY VENGEANCE.
               PAUL ANDREWS chose that very week to give one of his delightful dinners, and Mrs.
                  Lawrence was invited. He importuned her to bring Milly; for he had heard rumors of
                  the engagement with Halford, and, having a deep-rooted aversion to that gentleman
                  for declining his acquaintance, he thought that to persuade the girl to accept one
                  of his invitations would be a nice bit of vengeance.
               Mrs. Lawrence was a sort of cousin of Paul's, rich, and free to go where she
                  pleased, and having known Andrews in his youthful days, when there was probably
                  some good in him, was ready to believe that he had been injured and maligned, and
                  that very likely he was no worse than other men, only not hypocrite enough to
                  cover up his failings so carefully as they did and keep the varnish of reputation
                  without a crack.
               You must remember Paul Andrews? He shot himself not long since, and, so far as
                  this world is concerned, it was the only wise thing he had done in years. He was
                  as bad, and thoroughly blasé—the word has become
                  so English, that you can excuse it—as a man could well be. His wife had been a
                  gay, reckless woman. I dare say he ill-treated her, as she said; at all events,
                  something drove her quite mad, and she ran off to Europe with a fellow a shade
                  worse than her husband.
               That is a very improper story, told in as few words as I can manage; for it is
                  only as Milly's destiny chanced momentarily to cross his path that I have any
                  thing to do with him. He had returned to New York, after a long absence, having
                  obtained a divorce without difficulty; but the affair had hurt him
                  exceedingly—would have ruined him utterly, had it not been for his high and mighty
                  relations and his money.
               Besides his disreputable and delightful masculine suppers, where there was much
                  fun and more high play, he occasionally gave dinner-parties, at which he used to
                  persuade some one of his feminine relatives to preside, and to which many people
                  would go. In our age, people would rush into the mouth of purgatory for an hour's
                  amusement. The dinners certainly were charming, and Paul an angel of an host,
                  however much of a devil he might have been in his private capacity as a man; but I
                  used to think I would rather see a sister or wife of mine dead than sitting at his
                  table, looked at as he looked at all pretty women, and listening to the
                  conversation which went on there, brilliant as it was.
               Mrs. Lawrence entered readily enough into Andrews's scheme; the more heartily,
                  perhaps, because, knowing that the best-natured people work better for a reward,
                  he promised her, in case she succeeded, a wonderful carved cabinet he owned, upon
                  which her heart had long been set. It seemed to Mrs. Lawrence the most delightful
                  thing in the world to induce Milly to do something of which her aunt would
                  disapprove. "A regular lark," she called it to Andrews, and set herself diligently
                  to work; for Paul had hitherto been deaf to all entreaties and plans for getting
                  possession of the coveted cabinet.
               She failed utterly. Milly would not hear of the thing, and at last grew very
                  indignant, and Mrs. Lawrence could have cried with vexation; she did hate to be
                  thwarted in any project, and the cabinet was such a beauty!
               "You're a foolish little kitten," said she. "Why, the Conways go, and Mrs. Dexter,
                  and Helen James. Dear me, you needn't be so particular! Poor old Paul! Why, I met
                  Kenneth Halford there once, and Mrs. Marchmont." She did not add that Halford had
                  accepted the invitation two or three days after his return, before he knew any
                  thing about the character of the man, and had steadily avoided him since; and she
                  could not know that Alice Marchmont had gone, because she was insane to see
                  Faulkner, and he had forced her into the visit as a means of humiliation. Milly
                  felt the fire blaze up in her heart with new strength. Mrs. Lawrence spoke as if
                  they had been at one of the dinners together, and Milly would ask no
                  questions.
               This injudicious woman pleaded as long as she dared; but Milly held firm, though
                  it flashed through her mind that it would be a fitting punishment to Halford for
                  her to go, and coolly tell him that, if it was proper for him and Mrs. Marchmont,
                  she concluded there could be no objection to her going likewise. But that was only
                  a passing thought. Consent she would not, and finally reproached Mrs. Lawrence for
                  urging her.
               "You know my aunt would not permit it. I think you do very wrong to propose taking
                  me to a place of which she would disapprove."
               "Oh, Eliza Remsen was always terribly straight-laced!" returned free-and-easy Mrs.
                  Lawrence, not in the least offended. "I thought you had more love of fun in you,
                  and would like to go, just because you ought not. Poor Paul! he's not so black as
                  he's painted, in spite of what has come and gone. People don't always get their
                  deserts in this world; if they did, I'm afraid that wild-eyed Mrs. Marchmont
                  Kenneth Halford flirts so with would be out of the pale more than Andrews."
               Milly listened eagerly, though having the grace to blush at her own unworthiness
                  in consenting to hear the slanders which Mrs. Lawrence poured forth without the
                  slightest scruple. She did not dislike Alice, or believe half the things she
                  repeated, but she was an inveterate gossip, from sheer idleness, and such a woman
                  does more harm than a downright malicious scandal-monger; besides, she was so much
                  vexed at losing the cabinet that it was a relief to abuse somebody.
               "I vow Kenneth Halford shouldn't go on as he does, if I were in your place," she
                  added. "You needn't purse up your mouth, Miss Puss! Your aunt the same as told me
                  you were engaged the morning she went away. I'd bring him to terms, if I were you!
                  I was glad to see you flirt with Charley Thorne the other night. I think it
                  touched my Lord Kenneth."
               Milly felt bitterly glad—yes, wickedly glad—with that dreadful exultation which we
                  have at the success of a plan that wounds what we love, while it stings our own
                  souls. He should feel, feel to the core of his heart, that she was not a baby to
                  be punished and sent into a corner. So people noticed his conduct; no wonder! But
                  she would beat him at his own game.
               And there Mrs. Lawrence sat, inventing things, giving a signification to speeches
                  that never was meant, yet not intending any harm; stirring Milly up, as she would
                  have expressed it, for her own amusement, by way of a little amends for the
                  disappointment of having to tell Paul that she had failed in their scheme. She did
                  not even think that she was guilty of wickedness! I declare I sometimes half
                  believe that the sins which will drag us down to hell are those very exploits
                  which we regard so complacently, never ranking them among our sins at all.
               "Well, Milly, I shall say no more," she exclaimed at last. "Put up with Halford's
                  conduct, if you choose. Meekness is interesting; but, thank Heaven, I have a will
                  of my own"—beautifully oblivious of the fact that she was blown hither and
                  thither, like a tuft of down, by the wind of any body's breath who took the
                  trouble to influence her. "Why, when I was your age, I would have done any thing
                  for an evening's sport! Your aunt would never find it out; but let the matter
                  rest. Do as you please, of course. I stand by Paul Andrews; I always shall! When a
                  man begins to go down in the world there is some merit in keeping to your
                  friendship, and I shall do it. I can remember, when we were all three young, Eliza
                  Remsen was pleased enough if he paid her attention, though now you say she would
                  not think his house fit for you to set your foot in."
               "No, I did not say that—"
               "Oh, I'm not particular about words; that was what you meant."
               
               She let fly a few more shafts at Halford and Mrs. Marchmont, and went her way.
                  But, in spite of Milly's determination—stupid obstinacy, Minerva called it—that
                  lady said to Andrews,
               "Keep a place at table. I shouldn't wonder in the least if I brought her at the
                  last moment."
               The things which had been said rankled in Milly's mind, and made her more angry
                  with Halford; but the possibility of going to the dinner did not occur to her.
               It was the very day of the party. Mrs. Lawrence had given up her lingering hope;
                  Paul Andrews had resigned himself to the failure of his plot for annoying the man
                  who had overwhelmed him with civil contempt, and to the endurance, where Milly was
                  concerned, of the smart which the most hardened animal suffers at the knowledge
                  that some innocent creature shrinks from him.
               Milly wanted to see Halford; a change had come over her. Had he appeared at the
                  moment she would have forgotten his sins, and been remorseful over her own errors
                  and shortcomings. She wrote him a note, and gave the man-servant directions to
                  take it to Mr. Halford's hotel. Now Cæsar inherited a full share of the indolence
                  so bounteously bestowed upon the children of Ethiopia, and, feeling no desire for
                  a walk this morning, gave the note to a Bismarck-tinted friend of his, who had
                  dropped in to pay him a visit, and must pass Halford's lodgings on his way home.
                  Fascinating Hannibal took the letter, and promised faithfully to leave it; but he
                  chanced to meet a salmon-hued lady of his acquaintance on the road, and was
                  beguiled into a promenade, and the note in consequence was forgotten.
               Milly waited and waited. The day was passing; no answer—no message. She rang the
                  bell to inquire if the note had been sent. A maid-servant hurried off to ask
                  Cæsar, and came back with the positive assurance that he had dispatched it without
                  delay. Still Halford did not make his appearance. Milly had leisure to pass
                  through a thousand changes of feeling. She cried from disappointment; she grew
                  angry; she excused him, only to bestow increased blame a moment later; then she
                  cried again, and after those last tears felt harder and more resentful. If he had
                  even answered her note, offering any excuse whatever for his refusal of her
                  request, she could have forgiven him; but to be treated with this utter show of
                  indifference was more than Milly could bear.
               It was late in the day when Mrs. Lawrence's carriage stopped at the door, and the
                  servant came up to say that Mrs. Lawrence wanted her to go and drive, only she was
                  to make haste. Milly did not wait to reflect that she was in no mood to endure any
                  body's society. She threw on her bonnet and mantle, and ran down stairs.
               "Actually here!" exclaimed her friend as she appeared at the door. "Milly, you are
                  an angel not to have kept me waiting."
               Milly laughed discordantly; the color rushed over her cheeks; she stepped into the
                  carriage, and off they drove. Mrs. Lawrence talked about the dinner—regretted that
                  she could not have Milly with her; but the girl was too busy with her thoughts to
                  pay much attention to the remarks or her own answers. They took a few turns about
                  the Park, then Mrs. Lawrence complained of feeling cold, and they turned homeward
                  down Fifth Avenue.
               "I want to stop at Mrs. Delancy's a moment," Mrs. Lawrence said. "I'll not make a
                  call. It's just to ask about a servant who used to live with her."
               Milly declined going into the house, so her friend left her in the carriage, and
                  went upon her errand. Milly sat idly looking through one of the windows, watching
                  the gay equipages dash past, thinking how contented every body appeared, and
                  wondering why the change in her life, which had promised such happiness, should
                  have brought her this great trouble—wondering, fretting, and bemoaning her
                  wretchedness, without having the least idea that her own actions could have mended
                  matters.
               Suddenly down the avenue passed two persons on horseback, riding fast, talking and
                  laughing gayly. These were Mrs. Marchmont and Kenneth Halford. One glance she had,
                  and they were gone; and there Milly sat, her blood turning to ice about her heart,
                  and her head reeling till the long rows of houses seemed to totter, as if about to
                  fall in one common ruin.
               Do you know what it is to be frantically, insanely jealous? To go so mad that, for
                  the time, you would sell body and soul to be avenged—to do something that should
                  destroy yourself, here and hereafter, that the false one might have eternally to
                  regret the misery as of his causing? If you do not, pray to God to keep you from
                  such phrensy and the calamities you may bring down under its influence.
               Milly sat with her hands clenched in her muff, her teeth set, and her eyes blazing
                  with a light that had never before shone in them, her whole mind lost in a whirl
                  of fierce emotion which shook her every nerve. Back came the widow, and they drove
                  away through the gathering twilight, Mrs. Lawrence rattling on about some
                  wonderful story she had heard during her visit, till at length Milly interrupted
                  her by exclaiming, suddenly,
               "I will go with you to this dinner!"
               "Oh, you darling girl; I am so glad! Now you are behaving sensibly! Your aunt will
                  never know it."
               Little cared Milly, at that moment, if the whole world knew of it. What were any
                  consequences that might arise to her? Kenneth Halford should be made to feel—that
                  was all she thought of; the worse the place, the greater the wound to his pride!
                  Go? Why, she would have gone, she thought, if the fiend had guarded the door, and
                  claimed her soul for his forfeit!
               "You shall have a charming evening," pursued sued Mrs. Lawrence. "Do wear the blue
                  dress and silver ornaments you wore last at my house."
               "I shall go," repeated Milly, in the same defiant tone—"I shall go."
               They reached the corner of the street where Mrs. Remsen lived.
               "Let me out here," said Milly; "I'll walk home."
               "It's only a step—you'd better drive."
               "No, no; I want to walk—I must walk," returned Milly.
               "I shall call for you at half-past seven, precisely," said Mrs. Lawrence. "Now,
                  pray look your sweetest. How lucky that Maud went with her mother! You'll have no
                  one to prevent you."
               Milly was out of the carriage before it fairly stopped, and hurried along without
                  a parting word.
               "I do think she must be mad," said Mrs. Lawrence to herself. "What has come over
                  her, to look like that? She must have seen or heard something of Halford that has
                  made her horribly angry. Well, I don't care what it is—she's going with me! Mr.
                  Paul Andrews, the sooner you send me that lovely cabinet the better. I have kept
                  my word. I do so hate to be beaten!"
               She drove on in the best possible spirits, debating with herself as to which
                  particular salon should enshrine her
                  long-wished-for treasure, and laughing as she thought of Kenneth Halford's fury
                  when he heard of Milly at this dinner; and he would quickly hear of it. Dick
                  Faulkner would take care of that.
               Of any evil consequences to Milly, beyond a lecture or a lover's quarrel, soon
                  made up, she never dreamed. She only looked at the mischief and amusement, and was
                  as happy as a boy over a pocketful of stolen apples.
               Milly got into the house and up to her room. She took no time to think. Think,
                  indeed! You might almost as well have asked red-hot lava to pause for reflection
                  as her dizzy mind.
               It was already late, so she dressed herself, looking more lovely than she had ever
                  done in her life. This culmination of the excitement of the past weeks into this
                  fever had done its work. She was lovely; but not like the dreaming, romantic Milly
                  of so brief a time back. To one who understood what made the change, there would
                  have been something piteous in the eager face with its flashing eyes, the scarlet
                  spots on either cheek, and the defiant smile on the lips which had so lately been
                  tender and tremulous.
               Half-past seven came very soon. The carriage was at the door. Mrs. Lawrence came
                  into the house, to be certain that Milly was dressed to please her, and, as the
                  girl ran down stairs with her white cloak on her arm, could not refrain from
                  exclaiming, aloud,
               "You were always pretty," she cried, enthusiastically; "but to-night you are
                  positively beautiful!"
               Milly jested and laughed, and the false excitement supported her until it was too
                  late to retreat or think. She was in Paul Andrews's drawing-room; he was holding
                  her hand, looking into her face with his languid eyes, and uttering fulsome
                  compliments.
               Then her reason came back. She realized the full insanity of her step, saw clearly
                  what she had done. She looked about at the people; men whom she met at large
                  balls—two or three known to her by sight as reckless and dissipated; women, with
                  several of whom she had never been allowed to be on speaking terms; others, with
                  whom she acknowledged acquaintance, protected as they were by their husband's
                  names; and every body looked a little curiously at her, as if wondering by what
                  odd chance she was there.
               Milly's rage and jealousy could not keep up to their white-heat any longer. She
                  was glad to creep into a chair, and do her best to prevent her teeth chattering,
                  from the chill which shook her, unable to talk to those who approached,
                  transformed at once into so commonplace a girl that Paul Andrews regarded her in
                  disgust. He would have been ready to throttle Mrs. Lawrence for swindling him out
                  of his cabinet, only he consoled himself by recollecting that at least her
                  presence in his house would punish Halford.
               Nor did Milly improve after the party was seated at the table. The color would not
                  come back to her cheeks, nor the light to her eyes. The jests at which the others
                  laughed only puzzled her; or, if she dimly understood, they filled her with
                  horror. She was seated near Andrews; but, after trying to talk with her, and
                  receiving only monosyllables in reply, he gave up the task in a rage, wondering
                  what people saw in the washed-out little thing to admire, and thinking that Helen
                  James, if somewhat passée, was worth a dozen
                  like her.
               It seemed to Milly that they remained a lifetime at table. It was all like a bad
                  dream. The noise, the laughter, the quantity of wine the men drank, the freedom of
                  the women's talk—the whole affair was insupportable. Toward the close of the
                  dinner, Dick Faulkner made his appearance, and there was much chatter over his
                  excuses for not coming in earlier.
               "I think Andrews said supper," he averred; and it was evident that he had been
                  drinking freely. Then he saw Milly, and called out with his usual insolent
                  familiarity, though she scarcely knew him,
               "Ah, Miss Crofton, delighted to see you here. Mrs. Lawrence is showing you a
                  little life, eh?" Then he recollected his wife's gossip about the engagement
                  between Milly and Halford, and added, "I say, Paul, where's the book-man—Halford,
                  you know?"
               "Not invited," returned Andrews, curtly.
               "Nor Mrs. Marchmont?"
               "She—she couldn't come."
               "Does Halford's name naturally suggest hers?" somebody asked.
               "Oh yes," returned Dick, with an evil laugh; for the intimacy between the two had caused him
                  almost as much annoyance as it had Milly.
               "Here's her health—a bumper to Alice Marchmont!"
               It was so plain that he was partially intoxicated that the women made a move to
                  leave the table. Milly thought she must die before she could get out of the room.
                  When they returned to the salon, Milly begged
                  Mrs. Lawrence to let her go home; but her friend would not listen to it.
               "What nonsense! after coming," she said. "I can't imagine what ails you to-night;
                  you don't look or act like yourself."
               "I don't feel like myself, either," replied Milly, with a quivering lip. The
                  excitement which had given her a false courage was gone, and she never felt more
                  like a burst of babyish tears in her whole life. "I do so want to go," she
                  pleaded.
               "Oh, wait a while!" said Mrs. Lawrence, longing to doze in peace till the men
                  appeared. "You can't go yet; it would look so odd. Paul would be vexed, and scold
                  me."
               So Milly took refuge in a corner, and occupied herself, as shy young ladies do, by
                  turning over a volume of engravings, and none of the women paid any attention to
                  her beyond a contemptuous assent to Paul Andrews's dictum that she was a poor,
                  washed-out thing, and not worth the talk her coming out in society had caused.
               After a while her retreat was invaded by Dick Faulkner, and then Milly decided
                  that she must die outright. He sat down by her and began to talk pleasantly
                  enough. The extra wine he had drank since the ladies left the room had removed the
                  apparent traces of having too deeply indulged; but he was affected by it in a
                  certain way. Quietly as he talked, he could not keep from touching on subjects and
                  throwing out hints which he would have avoided at another moment.
               "Is Mrs. Marchmont a friend of yours?" he asked.
               "I know her—meet her very frequently," Milly replied, wishing only that he would
                  take himself off.
               "You mean you don't like her. I've watched you both this last fortnight! I'm fond
                  of studying people. You hate her, Miss Crofton."
               Milly was not too much subdued to look offended, but remained silent.
               "You'll not own it," he continued; "but all the same, you can't deny—yes, you hate
                  Alice Marchmont."
               "If I did, Mr. Faulkner, I really can not see that the fact could interest you
                  enough to repay discussion."
               "It might; wait a bit! I'm not sure, but I hate her myself, at least—"
               Here he became conscious that his tongue threatened to stray into disclosures in
                  regard to his private sentiments, and stopped.
               "I must ask Mrs. Lawrence to let me go home," Milly said. "I am tired."
               "Just a moment. I want to say something to you," pursued Dick, wondering how he
                  could manage to annoy Alice Marchmont by letting her suppose that he had given
                  Milly a dangerous hint about her affairs. "I say, the bewitching widow has been
                  worrying you a great deal of late."
               "You must excuse my listening," said Milly, in a trembling voice, which she tried
                  in vain to render firm and dignified.
               "Now, you'd better—you'll be glad after," urged he; and, as he had placed himself
                  in front of the taboret where she sat, it was impossible for her to rise until he
                  moved. "They say you are engaged to Kenneth Halford; but she sees him oftener than
                  you do."
               Milly had tried to get out of her seat, as he spoke those first words, but the
                  conclusion of his sentence made her sink back.
               "Please to let me go away," she said, faintly.
               "In a second. No matter what my reasons are for warning you, I do—"
               "I don't want any warnings!" Milly broke in.
               "I think I must give you a spell that will leave her powerless to harm you—petrify
                  the white witch, eh? as the princess does in the legend."
               Milly did not try to interrupt him now.
               "Where was I? Oh! the first time she annoys you, just whisper in her ear—mind you
                  do it skillfully—'Dick Faulkner says "the Ides of March" have come, but not
                  gone.'"
               He moved away, and allowed her to escape. She hurried back to Mrs. Lawrence's
                  side, and again pleaded to go home. Paul Andrews happening to overhear her
                  request, said,
               "I am sorry you so soon repent having honored my house with your presence, Miss
                  Crofton."
               Of course, she had to set matters straight, but succeeded very indifferently.
               "I am too stupid even to be polite," she added, beginning to laugh, for fear she
                  should cry; and Andrews did not contradict her assertion.
               "Nobody will go these two hours," said her silly friend; "and I promised to play a
                  game of whist."
               "You needn't go. The carriage is here: only let them take me and come back for
                  you," whispered Milly. "I can't stay—I'm ill."
               She looked so, in truth. Mrs. Lawrence began to grow alarmed, and eager to escape
                  further responsibility.
               "Well," she said, "if you will go, you will! Paul, tell them to order the
                  carriage. Miss Crofton is going."
               Milly got away. Mrs. Lawrence accompanied her, kissed her at the head of the
                  stairs, and called her a foolish child; but Milly could only think of the
                  happiness of escaping.
               "It's a dead loss," Andrews said to his relative, as she returned to the
                  drawing-room. "Your little friend is the most consummate idiot I ever saw in my
                  life! I hope your house will burn the day you get the cabinet."
               The instant Milly reached home she rushed up stairs and flung herself on the bed.
                  All she had gained by the step, which in her frenzy she fancied would be so great
                  a triumph over Halford, was an intense headache and an intolerable fear of her
                  aunt's discovering her adventure. She had not even the pleasurable excitement
                  which might have lent an interest to her freak. There had been no pleasure, no
                  success. She had not appeared a sort of drawing-room meteor to Paul Andrews and
                  his guests. She had sat among them, pale and stupid as an overgrown school-girl,
                  suffering from shyness and too much plum-cake.
               Verily, Milly's taste of stolen fruits was not sweet! The apples of Sodom had
                  turned to ashes on her lips.
               She lay on her bed, and shook and shivered, and could only get warm as she
                  remembered Andrews's false smile, or the echo of some of those horrid jests
                  haunted her. Then she seemed burning up with shame, and fairly wished the floor
                  might open and let her away down into the dark, and hide her forever from her fear
                  and humiliation. When that crisis passed, she could remember Dick Faulkner's
                  words, and there appeared more meaning in them than had struck her at the
                  time.
               "I am glad I went," she thought, in a quick reaction of resentment; "glad—glad!
                  Every body knows that he is false to me. I knew it before, only I tried not to
                  believe it. But I'll tell her. If he knows something that can frighten her, she
                  shall think he has told me. I'm not likely to forget his words! I wish it was day.
                  I wish I stood face to face with them both. Oh, I shall go mad!"
               So Milly battled with her demons, and yielded to the fierce dictates of her
                  jealousy and her rage, till it fairly seemed as if weeks must have elapsed in that
                  vigil, the pure, girlish face looked so worn and seamed with misery and
                  passion.
               While she struggled the night through in her pain, Alice Marchmont held a watch
                  darker and sterner than this of a young girl's heart troubles. It was almost dawn
                  before she finished a letter many times interrupted, two or three copies
                  impatiently torn, but the task always resumed; and at last it was done.
               Then the restless march was resumed, fright and despair tugged at her soul as they
                  had so often done before, and the quiet seemed full of voices that mocked coldly
                  at her agony, and repeated the story of her shame. Thus she wore the darkness out,
                  and saw the dawn break chill and gray, then crept to her bed, not so much to sleep
                  as to shut out the hateful light which she could have prayed never to see
                  again.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               TWO LETTERS.
               AFTER that unquiet vigil, and the heavy, unrefreshing sleep which followed, Alice
                  Marchmont appeared down stairs at her usual hour in the morning, determined in
                  nothing to vary from her ordinary habits during these dreadful days, as though
                  holding fast to such trifles was the one gleam of security in her awful suspense.
                  Some way, when she forced herself to go on in the accustomed routine, there were
                  moments in which she could almost persuade herself, even now, that her fears could
                  not all be real, since nothing in her daily life was changed.
               Miss Portman was already out on a shopping expedition, from a sense of duty, with
                  some country friends; so Alice had the freedom of the library, and was at liberty
                  to be idle and dull, without having to answer troublesome questions. The
                  unrestraint did not last long, however, for the servant came to say that Kenneth
                  Halford wished to speak with her, and Mrs. Marchmont roused herself from her
                  apathetic reverie, remembering that she had a sharper scrutiny to baffle than the
                  observation of her timid, easily satisfied relative.
               "This is a fearfully early visit," he said, as he entered; "so I beg your pardon
                  in the commencement."
               "It is almost noon," she replied; "so your excuse is a polite way of telling me
                  that I am a lazy woman—a bit of revenge, I suppose, for my having won yesterday's
                  race. The gallop did me a world of good. I mean to ride every morning."
               In spite of his feeling it necessary to excuse his appearance at this hour, he had
                  already stopped at Mrs. Remsen's house to inquire after Milly; for the not seeing
                  her on the previous day had given him time somewhat to forget the numerous
                  annoyances she had caused him of late. But Milly had gone with one of the little
                  children to the dentist's, so he could only go into the nearest florist's, and
                  scribble an affectionate note, to be sent with choice flowers—a note telling her
                  that he should be too much occupied to return, but he would see her that night at
                  Mrs. Lawrence's reception. Then he walked on to Mrs. Marchmont's, for there was
                  something which he felt he ought to say to her, though the necessity was any thing
                  but agreeable.
               The two talked the ordinary commonplaces of conversation for a few moments; but he
                  was a man who liked to get an unpleasant thing off his mind as quickly as
                  possible, so he took advantage of a break in the talk to observe,
               "Perhaps you will think my errand here an impertinent one; but I could not resist
                  coming."
               Naturally her first thought was that he had learned the truth; she was always
                  expecting somebody to overwhelm her with it. Not even a servant could enter the
                  room hastily in these days without giving her a sensation of terror. She became
                  languidly composed at once. Her ability to endure still, shaken and unnerved as
                  she was, had something wonderful in it.
               "What an appalling commencement!" said she, in her most indolent voice. "You would
                  pique my curiosity, if I had any left."
               "We are such very old friends that I thought I might take the liberty," he continued, rather
                  hesitatingly.
               "Tell me what you want to, and excuse yourself afterward," she said, her tone
                  growing suddenly impatient, though she looked as unmoved as ever.
               "A friend of mine—a business man—told me last evening that there were vague
                  reports in circulation about your affairs—"
               "Do you mean business affairs?" she interrupted.
               "Yes, of course. Now, as I knew that you were negotiating with the South-western
                  Company for the sale of your Virginia lands, it occurred to me as possible that
                  the stories might have a malicious origin—that is, might be the work of some
                  persons who wanted to prevent the sale, either because they had coal-lands in the
                  same neighborhood, or—"
               "The sale was effected several days ago. I have received the first payment," she
                  broke in again, utterly incapable of listening to his explanation, which in his
                  slight embarrassment he made tedious, as people always do when afraid of saying a
                  wrong word.
               "Then I disquieted myself needlessly," he replied, "and I am very glad of it. I
                  congratulate you on your success."
               "Thanks; success is invariably so pleasant," she said, bitterly. "But you have
                  roused my curiosity, though I just denied possessing any. Tell me exactly what
                  your friend said."
               "It was only a vague story. I could not make much out of it," he answered,
                  evasively, wishing heartily that he had held his tongue, or, at least, been
                  sensible enough to ask outright if she had sold her lands, instead of repeating
                  the gossip.
               "You can tell me what he said," she insisted, with a flash of the imperiousness
                  which had grown upon her of late. "From whom did he say the report came?" She knew
                  what the answer would be, and dreaded to hear it, yet, when he hesitated, could
                  not help asking more sternly, "Who originated the report, Mr. Halford?"
               "I believe it was Mr. Faulkner. At least, it was he who repeated the gossip in my
                  friend's hearing."
               She did not stir; not a line of her face altered.
               "I want to hear the whole conversation, word for word," she said, slowly.
               "Why, it was little more than a hint that the company had better be careful. It
                  struck me as meant to cast some doubt on your titles. It is of no consequence
                  since the sale is effected."
               "Where did it take place? when?"
               "Two or three days ago—more than that, I believe; but I only heard of it
                  yesterday. It's not worth thinking about now, though! I presume some disappointed
                  land-owner invented it," he replied, careful only to answer the last clause of her
                  question.
               "I asked you where."
               "Upon my word, I—"
               "I have a reason for wishing to know, Mr. Halford. I beg you to tell me the place
                  where the conversation occurred, and, as near as possible, the words used by Mr.
                  Faulkner."
               He could not help mentally comparing the wayward, pretty imperiousness of Alice
                  Berners in the old days with the overbearing haughtiness which this woman at times
                  displayed, thinking, as he had often done, how sad it was that life should have
                  changed her so utterly.
               "It was in a room of a café near Wall Street—a place where the brokers go a great
                  deal. Faulkner was there lunching with a couple of men; they had just struck one
                  of their grand coups, and were having a
                  Champagne-breakfast after—"
               "And having drank too much, were talking about the women of their acquaintance; I
                  understand! Don't hesitate. I am a good many years past the possibility of being
                  shocked by the way in which bad men talk. What was said about me?"
               "I am sorry I mentioned the subject—"
               "I said that I did not want excuses!"
               Her haughtiness would have been insufferable, only, guarded as her face was, he
                  read something there which filled him with pity.
               "I only meant to add that, having done so, it was better to tell you just what
                  occurred. Not very dreadful, after all."
               "Not when one has lived long enough to know what men are. I beg your pardon."
               "My friend was lunching at the next table. The first thing he heard was some
                  chatter—"
               "The words, if you please."
               "These," he replied, a little out of patience: "One of Faulkner's companions said,
                  'So the fascinating widow is trying to sell her lands; they say she is rather
                  pushed.' The second man asked, 'Who says so? I don't believe it.'"
               "And he—Faulkner?"
               "He had evidently been drinking too much—"
               "He said—"
               "'I believe it, and I know it! I'd advise any body who means to take Mrs.
                  Marchmont's note or buy lands of her to make sure of the indorsement on the
                  titles.'"
               "Was that all?"
               "Every word. My friend said the two began to chaff Faulkner, to tell him that
                  probably you had snubbed him, and he changed the conversation, apparently
                  discovering that he had said more than he intended."
               "I thank you for coming," she said; "it was very kind of you."
               "Very useless, under the circumstances."
               "No matter. Oh, this world, this disgusting world, where a man like that is
                  allowed to go about staining women's names by the mere taking of them on his
                  lips!"
               "Certainly, had there been the least reason, you have friends enough who would
                  call him to account," he said.
               "No, no; nothing so bad as that could happen—the surest way to ruin a woman that
                  ever men invented! Oh! you would not—promise me, no matter what you heard—you
                  would not do that!"
               "There will be no necessity; he will never dare."
               "Oh, there is nothing he would not dare!" she cried, recklessly, and as soon as
                  the words were spoken knew she had revealed the fact that for some reason she
                  feared this man.
               "What do you mean?" Halford asked, eagerly.
               "Only that he is a brute and a coward," she answered, her voice once more
                  disdainful and quiet.
               "We are very old friends, Mrs. Marchmont. I wish I might say to you all that is in
                  my mind."
               For the first time it occurred to him to connect the troubles which he felt
                  certain oppressed her with Faulkner.
               "It could do no good," she said; "but I am grateful for your kindness."
               She turned away her head, but, quickly as she moved, he caught the expression of
                  her face. This sympathy had shaken her out of that unnatural self-control. He
                  thought, if he lived a hundred years, he could never forget her countenance as it
                  looked then, with its dilated eyes and the features fixed in the awful whiteness
                  of wrath and despair.
               "You suffer!" he exclaimed. "Is there nothing I can do? Can you think of no way in
                  which I can serve you?"
               She turned back at the sound of his voice; drew her hand across her forehead, and
                  looked at him with a strange ghost of a smile upon her lips, past caring what he
                  thought, past caring how fully she betrayed her wretchedness, in the intense
                  longing which had come over her for some human sympathy in the darkness.
               "Again I thank you," she said, in a cold, grating voice; "you have done all that
                  you can in making the offer. No human being could help me further, and I think
                  Heaven will not."
               It seemed heartless to remain silent; but what could he say? It was impossible to
                  intrude upon her secrets, whatever they might be—to ask the slightest question as
                  to the cause of her distress; yet it was dreadful to leave her alone in a misery
                  so deep that even faith in the Divine mercy had deserted her.
               After a little she spoke again:
               "I believe that sounded wicked; I did not mean it so. It was weak, too, and that
                  is almost more unpardonable. I am bold and self-reliant enough"—she had nearly
                  said, desperate—"but sometimes I am forced to remember that I am only a
                  woman."
               "If you would let me speak; if I could venture to without appearing downright
                  insolent!"
               "I should not think you so; but there is nothing more to be said. See, I have not
                  tried to hide from you that I suffer—it is a great deal for me to confess. I could
                  not do it to any body else! Only forget it; don't let me ever see the
                  consciousness in your face."
               "If it is about business—if you would only tell me."
               "It is not."
               She had begun to tell a lie; she would not do it. She was weary of her burden of
                  dissimulation. It was enough to bear the stain of guilt, the awful memory which
                  placed her in the rank of men and women outside the pale of humanity; she would no
                  longer add to that the petty falsehoods wherewith the weakest of her sex shielded
                  their little sins.
               "Impossible, was what I meant to say—impossible!"
               The tone, the look, told him that, whatever, her trouble might be, she had
                  regarded it on every side, and knew that an iron door shut between her and any
                  hope of assistance. He comprehended that at this instant it was neither pride nor
                  fear which kept her silent, nothing but the utter impossibility of any aid
                  availing.
               "I am deeply grieved," he said, touched to the heart. "I know that sounds very
                  poor; but it is all I can say."
               "It is a great deal," she replied, with that same phantom of a smile still upon
                  her lips. "There is no other human being who has seen enough even to say so
                  much."
               He saw that she was wholly unfit for further conversation, and rose to go.
               "I can't bear to leave you like this," he said; "but I believe it is the kindest
                  thing I can do."
               "Yes, the very kindest. You know I am used to bearing my burden alone."
               It was the more painful to witness her wretchedness, and remember that she had the
                  whole world at her feet, and she with some secret weighing on her soul which shut
                  out any possibility of peace.
               "He returned quickly to her side, saying,
               "If there should arise a moment when I could help you—"
               "I would ask your assistance—yes; but there never will. I don't know what you must
                  think, Kenneth; I don't much care! When you entered this room I did not believe
                  any thing could ever make me admit to a human creature that I suffered."
               "But you are not sorry that I know?"
               "I am glad—glad! Don't be troubled; don't think about me! How kind and good you
                  are! And you are happy—tell me that you are?"
               He forgot the annoyances and doubts of the past weeks, or, rather, they seemed as
                  nothing in the presence of her misery, and Milly's image rose before him like a
                  vision of rest.
               "Yes," he answered; "I have more contentment than I deserve."
               "Not more; and I am glad! When you see me again I shall be like myself, and you
                  can forget. Better so."
               He went away, and many times during the morning, busy as he was, he remembered and
                  pitied her, yet could not help contrasting her with Milly, and feeling a certain
                  exultation in the midst of his
                  thankfulness, that his choice had fallen upon his childish, unworldly young
                  betrothed instead of this woman, weighed down in the midst of her splendor by some
                  secret which she must guard alone. He thought no evil of her, as many men would
                  have done. Whatever her faults might be, he knew that she was pure enough even to
                  be Milly's friend. He could only account for her misery by supposing one of two
                  causes. He had always believed that she had some unfortunate attachment since the
                  day when his sense of honor led him to offer her his hand, though he had been
                  forced to acknowledge that it could not be for any man whom he ever saw near her
                  now. Besides this, he feared that she was in terrible business embarrassments;
                  perhaps Faulkner had deluded her into one of his brilliant schemes, and she found
                  herself surrounded by difficulties, even cramped for money, which would be fearful
                  to her. But he got no nearer the truth than that in his fancies, and gladly as he
                  would have aided her, he felt that he could not offer moneyed assistance. It would
                  appear an insult. So he thought a great deal about her as the day wore on, but
                  more about Milly. He had been a little hard of late; he had expected too much of
                  this pretty child. He should see her to-night; he would change back to the old
                  manner at once; pet her into the cheerfulness and amiability formerly her chief
                  charm. He had been wrong, possibly. He must not train and develop her too rapidly;
                  he would be very patient henceforth with his flower, even at the sacrifice of his
                  own tastes and comfort. He wished that the evening were come; he was wild to see
                  her again, and he smiled at his boyish impatience, but felt glad that he was
                  capable of it.
               After he had gone, Alice Marchmont sat by the window where he left her, staring at
                  the blue sky, with a face such as an old painter might have given to a lost spirit
                  gazing up through the blackness of purgatory toward the light of the far-off,
                  unattainable heavens.
               At last she drew from her dress the letter which she had written the previous
                  night, tore it slowly into fragments, went to the hearth, and flung them into the
                  flames.
               "Burn," she thought; "oh, I wouldn't care if it was your soul or mine!"
               She walked up and down the room in one of the eager marches in which nowadays she
                  so often tried to tire herself, then after a while sat down at a table and began
                  to write. She must send some message to Faulkner; she could wait no longer. But it
                  would have been madness to forward the epistle she had consigned to the flames.
                  There must not be a line or word which the whole world could not see; yet she
                  found it difficult to write, making several commencements, tearing them up, even
                  flinging aside her pen often, as if half decided to let matters take their course.
                  But it was finished at length—a simple request in the third person, that Mr.
                  Faulkner would have the goodness to call upon her at his earliest convenience upon
                  a matter of business.
               Once written, a spasm of mad anxiety came over her; she folded and sealed in great
                  haste, rang the bell, and ordered the man to send it to Mr. Faulkner's office—he
                  was sure to be there at that hour—and see that the person waited for an
                  answer.
               It was a full hour and a half before the messenger returned, an eternity in the
                  mood which had taken possession of her. Ferguson, the model of an English servant,
                  appeared at last; but, before he left her to read the note he brought, had to
                  explain that the delay was not the fault of the boy in buttons who had taken it.
                  Mr. Faulkner was not at his office, and the small emissary had been obliged to
                  return up town to the gentleman's private dwelling. Having satisfied his
                  conscience by justifying the small boy, he bowed himself out, and Mrs. Marchmont
                  was free to open her letter.
               "I am so grieved," wrote the insolent wretch, without preface of any sort, "to
                  disappoint the most charming woman in the world; but I can not come this morning.
                  I was just getting into the carriage to drive to the railway when your note
                  reached me. I have come into the house to write my excuses, and say how grieved I
                  am that I must defer the happiness of an interview—a happiness of which I have
                  been so long deprived. But I am forced to leave town on business, and shall not
                  return until Sunday. However, I shall meet you that evening; for I know you are
                  invited to Mrs. Granger's dinner. We can have a little conversation, and arrange
                  any time that suits you best for me to come to your house. My time is always at
                  your disposal; and I am, as ever, the most devoted of your slaves, DICK
                  FAULKNER."
               She tore it with passionate fury, as she would have torn his black heart at that
                  moment if it had been within her reach!
               Four whole days to wait—almost five—for it was only Wednesday now. Oh, those
                  days!
               The man-servant appeared with another note, one of John Worthington's pleasant
                  epistles. How the sight of his signature at the bottom of the page burned her
                  aching eyes! He wrote, begging her not to forget that he had changed his weekly
                  dinner-party to this night. It had always been her habit to come to him once a
                  fortnight, but it was an age, owing to her unpardonably long stay in Washington,
                  since he had seen her at his table.
               She could not go—she would not! She had borne so much that she could not trust her
                  fortitude as she did at first. Sit by John Worthington's side to-night, meet his
                  kindly smile; no, it was beyond her power of endurance! She wrote, telling him
                  that she should be unable to come. She had promised Mrs. Lawrence, without fail,
                  to be at her reception, and could not break her word, as she had treated the
                  little woman shamefully all winter.
               "That would seem no reason to refuse your dinner," she wrote, "only I promised you
                  weeks ago not to be so dissipated any more. Therefore, I can only go to one place
                  in the same evening. You see what it is to make wise laws; the fulfillment of them
                  is sure to fall unpleasantly on yourself. I hope you will miss me terribly, and
                  that your party will appear as stupid to you as mine is certain to do to, yours
                  faithfully, JOHN WORTHINGTON."
               That was the signature she had written! She saw it as she began to fold up the
                  sheet. The bewildering agony caused by the sight of his name had so confused her
                  faculties that she had actually put his signature to her note, in his writing,
                  too! She had a brief season of enacting insanity, the poor soul! then the letter
                  was destroyed, burned, and another written. She was so nervous and afraid now that
                  three separate times, after sealing and directing it, she tore the note out of the
                  envelope, to be certain that there was no treacherous mistake. Even after the
                  letter was gone she fell to thinking about it, and was ready to send after the
                  messenger, rush to the house herself and get possession of it before Worthington
                  returned home, lest there should be some betrayal of her secret in its pages.
               So the day dragged by; it seemed more endless and horrible to Alice than any of
                  its predecessors. Then she remembered that she had said the same of each in turn
                  since the night which shut her out forever from the possibility of innocence or
                  peace.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               "THE IDES OF MARCH."
               THE next morning Mrs. Remsen and Maud returned, and Milly was obliged to exercise
                  a little self-control. Miss Maud was more tiresome than usual, for she wanted to
                  relate a romantic episode which had befallen her during her absence. Unluckily,
                  Milly soon discovered from Maud's contradictions that one portion or the other of
                  the story must be a figment of the imagination. She was ill-natured enough to
                  point out the discrepancies, and Maud flew into a passion. After lavishing a few
                  flowers of rhetoric upon her cousin, she departed to visit her sister, Mrs.
                  Ramsay, who would listen with less critical acumen than Milly displayed.
               Later there came a brief note from Kenneth Halford. He could not call, because
                  there was another wearisome meeting of a learned society in which he was
                  interested; but he would see her that evening at Mrs. Lawrence's. Not a word in
                  reference to the request she had written him the morning previous; no reason for
                  not having come to the house.
               "He does not condescend to excuse himself," Milly thought. "My letter was not
                  worth a mention."
               This slight was almost more unpardonable than all which had gone before, and Milly
                  a hundred times inwardly vowed that she would never forgive him, and brought her
                  passion up to fever heat again by the persistency with which she fastened upon
                  that resolve. Let him go back to his old love; let him do what he pleased with his
                  life, so that he left her in peace!
               It was a dark day, indeed. Aunt Eliza herself was not in her usually equable mood,
                  naturally enough, after having traveled all night, and Milly's manner was not
                  calculated to soothe her. Mrs. Remsen asserted that she had hurried back expressly
                  on Milly's account; but Milly, in her misanthropy, her new unbelief in every thing
                  and every body, told herself that if her aunt had not been as crazy for amusement
                  as a girl of sixteen she would not have returned; very ungrateful on the young
                  woman's part, and she knew it, and was more irritable with her relative on account
                  of the knowledge.
               Milly's dress for the evening was not finished. Milly boldly declared that she did
                  not care whether she went or staid at home, and Mrs. Remsen was divided between
                  wrath and astonishment. She forced Milly to work, and sat down to assist, for a
                  good deal of the girl's finery had to be arranged by their own hands, stylish and
                  French as it always looked. It had been too late in the season for her aunt to
                  afford her the extravagance of a new gown, though she was engaged to a rich man;
                  so there was serious business in hiding a silk already worn under some wonderful
                  combination of ribbons and tulle.
               "I thought you would have had it done days ago," said Mrs. Remsen. "The idea of
                  leaving it till the last minute!"
               "I hate the sight of it," returned Milly. "I wish there were no such things as
                  balls. I'd rather not go."
               "Of course you must go," said Mrs. Remsen. "I never saw a girl like you; the wind
                  is not more changeable! What on earth ails you lately, Milly?"
               "Nothing," said Milly; "only I hate parties."
               She ripped the trimming off the silk skirt with incautious haste, tore the fresh
                  tulle which was to cover it, and altogether made such havoc that, but for Aunt
                  Eliza's patience and skill, the gown would have been a dismal failure.
               "I could shake that girl with pleasure," thought Mrs. Remsen, but restrained her
                  rising temper. Milly was soon to be rich and independent; too severe a lecture
                  would not be proper under the circumstances.
               The evening came at last, and they were on their way to Mrs. Lawrence's, with
                  Milly, out of her passion and bitterness, wishing that she were driving to her own
                  funeral instead of a ball.
               They had not been long in the house before Mrs. Marchmont appeared in a costume
                  which so lighted up her pale beauty that it seemed to have increased from the
                  winter's dissipations, the late suppers, the interminable German cotillions tillions which had worn the freshness
                  out of so many faces, youthful and blooming when the season began. Since her last
                  effort to soften Milly, Mrs. Marchmont paid very little attention to her during
                  the few times they had met. She was growing into the habit of looking over Milly's
                  head, and ignoring her girlish airs of state and dignity; not that Alice really
                  cared about her manner, except from considering it an impertinence.
               To-night Milly vowed that she would not in any way notice the woman, even if Mrs.
                  Marchmont addressed her outright. She neither cared how it looked nor what people
                  thought; she would not do it, and there was an end.
               As ill luck would have it, not ten minutes after Milly formed that resolution, her
                  furbelows caught in a stand of plants while dancing at the end of the room, and
                  her dress would have been absolutely ruined had not Mrs. Marchmont chanced to be
                  near. She darted forward, and extricated Milly, who was only giving fierce tugs
                  which threatened utter annihilation to her draperies, while her partner made
                  matters worse by his assistance, with the awkwardness common to the male sex in
                  the presence of such disasters. The skirt was loosened before Milly had time to
                  see who had aided her. She turned, exclaiming, "I am so much obliged—" saw that it
                  was Mrs. Marchmont, and left her sentence unfinished, while her face changed so
                  quickly that a mole could have discovered she would rather have had body and soul
                  torn into fragments than be indebted to this woman for her release.
               Alice perceived it plainly, smiled down at her from her superior height with a
                  careless contempt which few of her sex could have equaled, and said, in her most
                  indifferent voice,
               "Pray don't thank me, Miss Crofton. I did it for the sake of the flutings; I can't
                  bear to see a pretty dress ruined."
               Then she swept Milly an overwhelming courtesy, and was gone.
               Between shame at her own rudeness, rage at the lady's cool scorn, and various
                  other contending emotions, Milly stood speechless. But it was necessary to remedy
                  the misfortune to her attire, so she asked Charley Thorne to take her up stairs,
                  that she might find some one to mend her puffs and flounces. She could hardly
                  stand still while the maid was setting her to rights, and lamenting the accident,
                  and congratulating her that it did not show in the least where it was pinned.
               "Thanks," Milly said, impatiently; "any way will do. Oh, I don't care how it
                  looks!"
               She turned into the hall, took Charley's arm again, and went down stairs. The
                  first sight that met her eyes was Kenneth Halford dancing with her enemy. He had
                  just arrived, and Mrs. Marchmont wickedly took possession of him at once. When the
                  galop was over, he came to Milly as she stood leaning against a pillar at the
                  upper end of the great drawing-room, while Thorne had gone in search of a glass of
                  water at her request, for her throat seemed on fire.
               "At last!" exclaimed Halford, the unavoidable separation of the past few days
                  having left him forgetful of every thing except his love. "Oh, my dearest Milly,
                  it has been an age since I saw you!"
               She turned upon him in a kind of suppressed fury.
               "How dare you speak to me?" she said. "Don't come near me again to-night!"
               It was very absurd, I know, but, considering all that she had undergone, perfectly
                  natural, and it was just as natural that Halford, entirely ignorant of her cause
                  for indignation—a real cause this time, since she had every reason to suppose that
                  he had received her note—should walk away without reply.
               Mrs. Marchmont was punishing her cruelly for her rudeness; Halford was punishing
                  her from a determination that she should feel what it was to give him grave
                  offense; and after that he and Alice were led on by that spirit of coquetry which
                  seizes most people under the influence of a mood like theirs. They danced, they
                  talked, they were as careless of appearances as two people are when the man is
                  furious against some one whom he loves, and the woman a soured, imbittered
                  creature who has rushed forth for an evening's excitement to escape the horrible
                  spectres which haunt her solitude.
               Just as it began at a ball, so it ended. In the very chamber, the tiny,
                  half-lighted boudoir, away from the noise and glare of the ball-room, where
                  Kenneth Halford had held Milly to his breast, and lifted her by his whispers into
                  a new world—in that very spot, the beautiful realm which had been tottering for
                  days, as if shaken by an earthquake, fell into fragments at Milly's feet, and
                  crushed her heart under its ruins.
               Milly had borne her torture until she could endure no further; she had danced and
                  flirted with Charley Thorne, almost unconscious what she did or said, and at last
                  she must have a few moments to herself. She ran up stairs, and got into the first
                  empty room she could find, saw with a shudder that she had entered the boudoir,
                  but would not retreat. It was added wretchedness to stand there and recall the
                  events of that night which looked so far off—only a few weeks distant—but seeming
                  whole years away, and Milly forced the fresh agony mercilessly upon her soul.
               She stood shrouded among the window-curtains, completely concealed from view, when
                  into the boudoir came Kenneth Halford and Mrs. Marchmont. They were laughing and
                  talking, saying all manner of ridiculous things which both knew meant nothing
                  whatever; for each understood the other too well not to perceive that this gayety
                  rose from bitterness and trouble.
               They were speaking of the past, the days when Alice Berners had been a dreaming,
                  happy girl; and before Milly could regain self-possession session enough to make
                  her presence known, she caught words which, to her distorted senses, shook the
                  very ground from under her feet.
               "Never to love as he had loved then—"
               Milly heard that broken sentence from Halford's lips; the rest was uttered in
                  French, too rapidly for her to understand; but she had no need to hear more. It
                  was enough, surely it was enough!
               Then she saw Halford raise Mrs. Marchmont's gloved hand—that slender, beautiful
                  hand—and touch it with his lips. Sparks of fire danced before Milly's aching eyes;
                  a whole volume of passionate utterance could not have meant more to her jealous
                  fancy. Before she could carry into execution her idea of confronting them, Mrs.
                  Marchmont uttered some laughing ejaculation, and Halford passed out of the boudoir
                  as she turned to leave by a door that led into the dressing-room.
               She walked so close to Milly that the girl felt the touch of her garments, and
                  shrank back with a faint exclamation of horror, as if something noxious, deadly,
                  had brushed against her.
               Mrs. Marchmont caught the sound, and looked back. Milly's quick movement had
                  disarranged the curtains so that she was visible.
               "Is that you, little Miss Milly?" the lady asked, laughingly, and with perfect
                  composure. "I did not see you."
               The tone, the epithet, what seemed to the girl a wicked triumph in the dark
                  eyes—all helped to render her more insane.
               "It was natural that you should not," she answered, in a voice so sharp that, even
                  through her rage and bewilderment, the tone struck her own car as strangely as if
                  some evil spirit had hissed the words from between her parched lips.
               The voice was so full of insulting significance that Mrs. Marchmont could not
                  resist saying,
               "You place a more modest and proper estimate on yourself than I should have
                  expected, dear Miss Milly."
               "Have the goodness not to speak my name," she exclaimed. "I don't wish to hear it
                  from your lips."
               Mrs. Marchmont laughed; the scene appeared so ridiculous, Milly's manner so
                  exaggerated, that she could not remain serious.
               "Not tired of your name already?" she asked, while Milly shook with a new spasm of
                  fury at the sound of that cruel merriment. "Ah, you see, you girls of to-day live
                  so rapidly!"
               "At least, we have a sufficiently bad example in the women old enough to know
                  better," retorted Milly.
               "You should take warning from it, child! Don't you understand that we
                  good-naturedly make light-houses of ourselves to show you the way you ought to go?
                  But, all the same, it is very naughty of you to remind me of my immense age." And
                  she laughed again.
               "You laugh—you dare to laugh!" Milly muttered, while her white teeth, set hard
                  like a vise, showed through her parted lips.
               "Verily, mademoiselle, I have no great dread of so doing," replied Alice, quietly.
                  "But permit me to ask the meaning of this little private ball-room tragedy? I am
                  out in my points from not having an idea of the part I am expected to play."
               "You are always ready to act any part that is treacherous and false," cried Milly,
                  too mad by this time to attempt the slightest restraint or care if she made
                  herself ridiculous.
               Mrs. Marchmont had wholly forgotten the scene of a few moments before; had been so
                  busy with her own thoughts that she hardly noticed Halford's kissing her hand; but
                  she remembered it now, and knew that Milly must have witnessed the whole.
               "Ah!" said she, with malicious emphasis, "you had not just entered the room."
               "I was here when you came," answered Milly, defiantly.
               "And you staid?"
               "I staid."
               "That is," returned Alice, "you remained quiet—listening."
               The retort was cruel, but Milly's unlady-like manner provoked it. She was sorry in
                  an instant.
               "Not listening," Milly said; "I had no wish to hear a word; but I saw—"
               She broke off abruptly, suddenly recalled to a sense of the way in which she was
                  exposing her misery.
               "Truly, you saw!" cried Alice, mockingly. "How shocking! Pray, don't compromise
                  me; that would be very heartless."
               Back to Milly's mind rushed the words Dick Faulkner had spoken, and she cried,
               "If I'd wished I could have done that before."
               There was such meaning in her voice that Mrs. Marchmont stared in wonder and
                  dread.
               "May I ask the solution of these mysteries?" she asked, coldly, without a trace of
                  her inward emotion apparent in features or manner.
               "It would be very easily given," replied Milly, laughing in her turn.
               "Really? Then perhaps you would be kind enough to offer it, though I fear you
                  mistake in supposing it can possess the slightest interest for me," Alice
                  said.
               The playful contempt with which she still spoke angered her listener more than the
                  harshest words could have done, because it seemed to denote that she was a rude,
                  unreasonable child, not to be treated with a show even of seriousness.
               "I make mistakes less often than you think, Mrs. Marchmont," returned Milly.
               "You are more fortunate, then, than the rest of our sex. I congratulate you on
                  your wisdom and prudence."
               Her sneers were what Milly could least endure. She turned to move away and end
                     the interview; perhaps she would
                  have obeyed the impulse had not Alice laughed again. Milly confronted her
                  suddenly, saying,
               "Would you like to hear a message that was given me last night?"
               "Well, that would depend," drawled Alice. "Now it is a message—the interest grows!
                  But—one thing—are you sure it was meant to be repeated for my benefit? I never
                  care to hear what was only intended for other people's cars."
               "It was for you, and from Mr. Faulkner."
               Alice Marchmont retreated a step, and stood looking full at her with fiery
                  eyes.
               "A valuable acquaintance for a young lady!" said she.
               "He is your acquaintance, not mine; but he gave me the message."
               "The mystery grows deeper," returned Alice, slowly; but now a tremor ran through
                  the scornful voice, and Milly caught it, and was so unwomanly in her passion that
                  she rejoiced in having at last pierced the haughty woman's armor.
               "Would you like me to explain? Are you as anxious as you were a moment since?"
               "Whenever you can sufficiently come down from histrionics to do so rationally,"
                  answered Alice, clutching desperately at the self-control which threatened to
                  escape her.
               "I fancy I can at least make myself intelligible," sneered this transformed Milly,
                  who might have been startled to see the passion-lined face with which she
                  confronted her enemy.
               "It would be somewhat more interesting than this theatrical display, though I do
                  full justice to your dramatic talent," said Alice.
               "You shall have your way, then—"
               "Oh yes! by all means—the message," interrupted Mrs. Marchmont, while her heart
                  beat almost to suffocation at the idea that any hint of her story had come into
                  the possession of this girl, who had unexpectedly changed from childish
                  thoughtlessness into a woman's implacability. "Very good of you to take so much
                  trouble for a person you seem to hate so energetically," she continued, trying for
                  any careless words which should give her an instant's breathing space to call up
                  her strength before this blow, whatever it might be, should strike her.
               "I did not seek the office—it was forced upon me. I had no desire to occupy myself
                  with you or your secrets."
               "Secrets now! Why, you talk like an astrologer. Are you sure you have not dreamed
                  the whole matter?"
               "You shall judge of that for yourself."
               "Oh, I don't believe you will ever give me the opportunity! I have been trying to
                  urge the oracle into speech for the last five minutes," said Alice.
               "Mr. Faulkner bids you remember that the Ides of March have come, but not gone,"
                  returned Milly, slowly.
               Mrs. Marchmont stood motionless: not a muscle quivered; her eyes never wandered
                  from Milly's face; despair and agony worse than death tore at her soul, but she
                  was prepared; and there was no show of emotion, save the hard ring of her voice,
                  as she said,
               "Was that all?"
               "All I was to tell you," replied Milly, "Enough, too, I fancy."
               "We shall see that later," Alice said. "You must have seen Mr. Faulkner in one of
                  his fits of intoxication—a singular time for a young lady to converse with him;
                  certainly, it was not in your aunt's presence."
               "You want to find out if any body else knows. There does not. I don't want to talk
                  to you any more."
               She turned abruptly away, and Mrs. Marchmont passed into the dressing-room,
                  closing the door behind her. As Milly sank into a seat, she heard Halford's voice
                  saying,
               "I have looked for you everywhere! Your aunt's head ached so fearfully that she
                  has gone home, leaving you to the care of Mrs. Ramsay. May I come in? Are you
                  vexed yet?"
               She was standing in the centre of the room before he finished speaking. She said,
                  in a husky tone,
               "Come in—yes, I want you! I have something to say, and you must hear me. I set you
                  free. You are a bad, false man, and from this night I will never speak to you
                  again!"
               "Milly!" he exclaimed.
               "Don't call me by that name. Don't let me hear it again."
               "What ails you?" he asked. "Are you mad, child?"
               "Yes—child!" she repeated, with such bitterness that all the suffering of the past
                  weeks seemed to burst out in the tone. "That is what you thought me—a child!"
               He caught her hands, and held them fast in spite of her struggles.
               "Don't look so," he said; "be quiet, Milly! What is the matter?"
               "Let me go—don't touch me—don't come near me!"
               He was so startled by her emotion, and his dread of its effect upon her, that
                  there was no room in his mind for anger.
               "I love you," he said, roused into an earnestness which had never warmed his voice
                  before. "You know that I love you, dearest child!"
               She forced herself away from him, and leaned against a table, panting for
                  breath.
               "You loved me as you would a child," she said; "and I tell you I am a woman strong
                  to love, strong to hate, and I hate you; hate you with a force my love never had;
                  bate you for the knowledge you have brought to me; hate you for the woman's
                  experience which has taken away my youth; hate you for what you are—for what you
                  have made me!"
               "Milly, Milly!" he could only exclaim, stunned by this passionate utterance, this
                  outburst of fiery strength from the creature who had been his sunbeam, his
                  blossom.
               The real nature, which happiness might have developed slowly into perfection, had
                  sprung to sudden maturity, warped and distorted under the suffering of the past
                  weeks, and the madness of the past hour. Milly's childish innocence, Milly's
                  May-day were gone forever.
               "What has changed you like this?" he demanded. "What has happened? Tell
                  me—explain."
               "Explain?" she repeated. "I was here in this room. I saw and heard you."
               "You are wrong," he said. "I see what you think; but you are mistaken. I love you,
                  Milly, I love you!"
               "You don't love, me—you don't know me! If you ever eared, it was because you
                  thought me a child. I am a woman, and a bitter one!"
               Her passion revolted him. He began to grow angry.
               "You act like a crazy creature," he said. "Speak sensibly; explain what you
                  want."
               "Go out of this room," she answered, "and as you go, remember that you pass out of
                  my life forever. Go!"
               His mood changed, his anger subsided. There was a depth, a fearful reality in her
                  manner and words which he had not at first comprehended. He could not lose her
                  like this. There was a revelation of character he had little expected. Could this
                  bitter, unyielding woman be the child whom he had played with and sought to punish
                  into obedience?
               "Only listen to me, Milly!"
               "There is no need; I tell you I saw and heard."
               "But you are mistaken. Let me explain—"
               "Oh, stop!" she interrupted, with a gesture of absolute abhorrence. "There has
                  been falsehood enough, deceit enough! I don't know why you trifled with me, out of
                  your pitiful man's vanity; but don't attempt it any more."
               "How can you venture to accuse me of falsehood?" he asked. "By what right do you
                  suspect me of treachery? I tell you that what you saw and heard can be easily
                  explained."
               "I want no explanation. I will hear none."
               "Then you are madder than I thought."
               "Not mad now; coming to my senses. I have been mad. Oh, I don't care for
                  to-night—that was only the proof! But these weeks of wretchedness—the misery you
                  have made me endure! I don't forgive these. I never will!"
               "And have I had nothing to endure, Milly?" he asked, controlling himself from the
                  very sight of her agitation. "Have I had nothing to complain of?"
               "Nothing," she retorted; "nothing."
               "Do you call your caprices, your ill-temper nothing?"
               "There has been only what you brought on us both. You goaded me into my caprices
                  and ill-temper."
               Had she been jealous from the first of Alice Marchmont? Jealous, and concealed it
                  as long as possible, so that her annoying ways, her perversity, had been outbursts
                  from that silent well of trouble, instead, as he had fancied, a pretext to indulge
                  her willfulness. His temper was naturally hasty, but he had much more self-control
                  than Milly, and these thoughts enabled him to reason and plead with her.
               "Perhaps I have been wrong," he said; "but it was unintentional. I beg you to
                  believe that."
               These were words which Kenneth Halford had never expected to speak to his blossom,
                  a concession which might have led to good results had it come earlier; for it
                  meant a good deal, when one considered his character and the patronizing nature of
                  his affection for Milly. But it was too late. At this moment the avowal seemed a
                  fresh insult.
               "If I have been wrong," she answered, "I am not sorry! If I have made you feel, I
                  am glad. It was very little I could do to repay the suffering you brought upon
                  me."
               "Why were you silent, why—"
               "You deceived me from the first."
               "Say what you will, Milly, you know I loved you."
               "Admitting that you did, it was as a child—a baby. I tell you again that is what I
                  can not pardon. You see your mistake now. I am no child, but a woman. You must
                  know that you can not care for me."
               "I do, Milly—indeed, I do!"
               "To say that with your kiss warm on that woman's hand—your old love. Oh, she is
                  fit to be! I tell you that your affection is an insult to a good, honorable girl.
                  I will never hear of it again."
               "This is too much!" he said. "No man could be expected to endure such language,
                  such unwomanly taunts."
               "If I am unwomanly, it is your fault. You are to blame for every thing—every
                  thing!"
               Milly was thinking as she spoke of that dinner at Paul Andrews's house, divided
                  between shame and a desire to fling the story down upon him, to prove that she
                  could be as reckless as he, and cared as little for consequences when thus driven
                  out of herself.
               Just then Adelaide Ramsay came into the room. Seeing them both so visibly
                  agitated, she hurried forward, saying,
               "I don't wonder you are furious, Mr. Halford. I never heard of any thing so
                  atrocious in my life! Many a man would break with her outright, and nobody could
                  blame him. What mamma will say, I can't imagine. You may thank your stars, Miss
                  Milly, that she has gone home with a headache."
               The pair gazed at her while she poured forth this harangue with wonderful
                  rapidity, gazed, divided between surprise and indignation.
               "You needn't look like that, Milly," pursued Adelaide. "I am your cousin, and have
                  a right to speak. The pity is that you were always too headstrong to listen to me
                  as you ought."
               "If Miss Milly is as much at a loss as I am to discover Mrs. Ramsay's meaning, she must be
                  puzzled, indeed," said Halford, with his most magnificently freezing air.
               "Oh, that won't do for me! It may answer for the world; but with me!" cried
                  Adelaide, shaking her head until the flowers and butterflies and bows and false
                  hair and miracles of all sorts which crowned her apex threatened to desert her
                  utterly. "And I side with you, Mr. Halford. I promise you that—entirely."
               Halford looked at her, more and more mystified; but Milly understood now to what
                  her cousin alluded. The story of the dinner had already spread abroad, and she
                  supposed they were quarreling over Milly's escapade.
               "Go away, Adelaide," Milly said; "I don't want you here. We were not talking of
                  what you thought. Go away."
               "I know you were talking of it," she replied, "and can see that Mr. Halford is
                  furious, and so will mamma be, and I shall tell her—and the things people will
                  say!"
               "Tell what you like and whom you like," said Milly, with a haughty gesture of
                  dismissal which Adelaide did not regard.
               "You are bold enough about it! To go to a dinner at Paul Andrews's house—good
                  heavens! Indeed I shall tell mamma! Why, you will be ruined if it gets out!"
               Kenneth Halford had been sufficiently agitated before, but now he turned pale as
                  death. He never looked at Milly; he evinced no sign of anger; he only said to
                  Adelaide, in a low, quiet voice,
               "We were not speaking of that affair. Mrs. Ramsay will confer a great favor on me
                  by not mentioning it either to her mother or any one else."
               Mistress Adelaide sailed out of the room in a towering passion with them both, but
                  feeling very uncomfortable under Halford's open contempt, and conscious that her
                  spite against Milly had led her into an exceedingly rude action. Whatever her
                  sentiments might be, or her behavior among her relations, before the world in
                  general she liked to appear a lady. She was gone, and Halford turned on Milly.
               "You went to Paul Andrews's dinner?"
               "Yes," she replied, defiantly. "Where I go or what I do is no affair of yours, Mr.
                  Halford. I have already told you so."
               "No wonder Mrs. Ramsay was beside herself," he said, ignoring the latter part of
                  her speech. "To go to that man's house—"
               "And that I went was your fault, too," interrupted Milly. "You would not even
                  answer my note. I was not worth so much attention. You could not spare the time
                  from that woman."
               "What note?"
               "The one I wrote you yesterday; probably you have forgotten."
               "I received no note from you yesterday, Milly."
               Milly laughed her unbelief of the assertion. Oh, such a bitter, harsh laugh to
                  hear from lips so young as hers!
               "I don't know what you mean, Milly."
               "You did not even have an appointment with Mrs. Marchmont?" sneered Milly.
               "I was out on horseback and met her; I rode home with her. I had no note from
                  you."
               He began reproaches for her rashness in going to the dinner; Milly replied with
                  renewed anger and scorn, and so they went on until words passed between them which
                  could not be forgotten or forgiven. Milly upbraided him with having made a secret
                  of his former engagement, broke their own so decidedly that there was nothing for
                  him but to submit. At last she cried out,
               "Go away—go! I hate and loathe you more than ever! You are perjured every
                  way!"
               Kenneth Halford flung back some last angry words, and went from her.
               Milly dared not stand there, dared not think; all her energies were bent in an
                  insane determination to hide what she suffered. Down into the ball-room she
                  hastened; some one asked her to dance. She was whirling through a waltz, she was
                  laughing and talking as wildly as Mrs. Marchmont herself, her eyes were blazing,
                  her cheeks scarlet; those who knew her best looked on in wonder; men crowded
                  about. She was a new creature, and they could only marvel at the change.
               Adelaide tormented her to go, threatened to leave her; but Milly never heeded. It
                  was almost daybreak when she consented to leave, laughing and coquetting to the
                  very door with the men who hovered about her. Then forth from the last ball of the
                  season Milly Crofton passed, leaving her youth behind forever.
               The latest sight she beheld was Halford bending over her foe—the latest sound she
                  remembered hearing, that woman's mocking voice!
               She was at home. As she reached her aunt's door, Mrs. Remsen came out in her
                  dressing-gown, demanding the reason of her late return; but Milly would not
                  speak—she could not. She rushed on to her chamber, tore off her cloak, then her
                  overstrained nerves gave way, and at length a merciful insensibility put an end to
                  her sufferings for the time.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               THE MORNING AFTER.
               MILLY must have lain a long time on the floor in a swoon, for when she came to
                  herself the daylight was streaming broad and full through the curtains; the fire
                  had died out entirely, and she was so chilled and weak that at first she could
                  neither rise nor comprehend what had happened.
               Then all came slowly back the terrible memory of the past night! Milly dragged
                  herself to her bed, and lay down—lay there for hours—not sleeping, not even
                  thinking connectedly—a wild whirl in her brain; but with the stern unforgivingness
                  strong in her mind. At last she heard some one knocking at her door. It was a
                  servant, sent by Mrs. Remsen to know if she was coming down. Milly began to
                  realize that life must go on again. She could not remain there in her solitary
                  anguish; she must go forth and meet her aunt, give explanations of all that had
                  happened, listen to blame and reproaches, and live and act like other ordinary
                  mortals. She threw off her crushed ball-dress and managed to get into a
                  morning-gown, but did not leave her chamber.
               Then Mrs. Remsen came up; she was very angry at Milly's staying so long behind her
                  at the ball; had been frightened by her appearance when she ran past her on her
                  return; still more angry and alarmed as she thought the matter over and became
                  convinced that something very strange and unpleasant had occurred. Upstairs she
                  marched, and knocked loudly at Milly's door; but there was no response.
               "Open the door, Milly!" she exclaimed. "I insist on coming in."
               Milly hesitated a little, then allowed her aunt to enter. As well now as ever, she
                  said to herself. The scene and the contest must come; let her get them over, and
                  be done. She did not notice her aunt's look of astonishment, listened passively
                  while she broke into a torrent of exclamations and inquiries, and insisted upon an
                  explanation of this mysterious conduct. Milly sat down, calm from the exhaustion
                  which follows such fearful excitement, but so determined that her aunt's anger had
                  slight place in her thoughts.
               "Are you ill, Milly?"
               "No," returned Milly, wearily.
               It was such an effort to speak! If she could only be left quite alone; not
                  compelled to see the face of any human being, allowed to wear out in utter
                  solitude the first hours of the anguish which had come upon her!
               "You look dreadfully ill," pursued Mrs. Remsen; "you are white as a ghost, and
                  your eyes look as if you had not closed them during the night."
               There was no need of answer. Milly sat dumb.
               Mrs. Remsen's anxiety at her appearance was merged in curiosity to know what had
                  happened, and a sudden dread that by some folly Milly had endangered her whole
                  future.
               "If you are not ill," she said, with no great amount of tenderness in her voice,
                  "will you tell me what is the matter?"
               "I am very tired, aunt," replied Milly, resolutely. "I wish you would not make me
                  talk this morning."
               "This is too ridiculous!" exclaimed Mrs. Remsen, beginning to feel very indignant.
                  "I insist upon an explanation. Milly, what has happened to you?"
               She was silent. How could she put her misery into language to that woman standing
                  so coldly before her? How could she cry out that her heart was broken? The whole
                  world, the beautiful world where she had been wandering, laid in ruins at her
                  feet, with every sweet hope, every youthful joy crushed under them!
               "Will you tell, now?" urged her aunt.
               Milly tried to speak. There was a suffocating sensation in her throat which kept
                  the words back; the only sound she could make would be a groan; and, even in that
                  early stage of her trouble, Milly had strength of soul enough to be determined on
                  hiding the full depth of her suffering.
               "Have you quarreled with Kenneth Halford?" asked her aunt. "I suppose that is the
                  trouble—I thought so last night. You are a very foolish girl; but there is one
                  consolation, lover's quarrels are easily remedied."
               She spoke lightly, forcing herself to believe that Milly's pain was only caused by
                  youthful exaggeration of some very trifling difficulty, which would be set at rest
                  before the day ended.
               "Just tell me what you quarreled about; for you did quarrel with Mr. Halford,
                  didn't you?" she continued. "It seems very dreadful to you, I have no doubt; but
                  you may be quite sure that a few words will set matters straight, and you will be
                  even happier than before."
               "Set matters straight! Be happier than before!" Milly could have repeated the
                  assurance in an insane shriek. There she sat, struggling with her trouble—a
                  trouble that had transformed her suddenly from girl to woman, and must blast her
                  whole youth; and this worldly-minded aunt, unable to see the change in her, stood
                  talking as if she were still a child, to be coaxed and fondled back to good
                  behavior.
               Milly heard her aunt's voice again, but it sounded faint and as if it came from a
                  great distance. The very objects about the room, so familiar and treasured, looked
                  strange to her, as if the whole aspect of the apartment had altered during the
                  night.
               "Now tell me all about it, Milly, like a dear, good girl," Mrs. Remsen was saying.
                  "I promise that every thing shall be set right. You shall not be called upon to
                  make concessions or do any of those things girls think so very humiliating; every
                  thing shall be arranged. Only tell me."
               Milly did not speak; the idea of putting her misery into words was a new torture,
                  and it would be still worse to tell the story of her lover's treachery, to
                  describe the scene she had witnessed, to go over the gradual growth of her doubts
                  till they had culminated the previous night. And her aunt would spare her nothing;
                  Milly was sure of that. She would insist on a full and explicit account,
                  regardless of the girl's pain; so Milly sat there silent, not stubborn, but
                  because it was so hard to begin the sickening tale.
               "Now, don't be obstinate, Milly; it is only foolish, and I give you the credit of
                  not being like girls in general. What did you and Mr. Halford quarrel about? Don't
                  say you have not quarreled, for I am sure of it."
               She seated herself beside Milly on her sofa, and remembering all that depended upon this
                  marriage, not only for Milly, but herself, she grew more gentle in her desire to
                  bring her niece into a conciliatory frame of mind; but Milly shrank from her,
                  could not bear her touch, nor any one near her just then, and she turned away.
               "I declare, Milly, one would think you were acting a play!" said her aunt, growing
                  angry again. "I don't suppose you have been struck dumb or are quite out of your
                  senses. I beg you will not be ridiculous."
               These words did Milly good; they gave her strength. No, her suffering must not be
                  made despicable. She would be like herself, or, if not that, perfectly calm. Let
                  her aunt question; each inquiry was like pressing a hot iron upon her wounds; but
                  she must grow accustomed to endurance. If the story must be told, as well now as
                  ever. So when her aunt said again,
               "Will you tell me what is the matter between you and Mr. Halford?"
               She answered in a sharp, strained voice,
               "I shall not marry Mr. Halford. I have told him this; I no longer love him."
               She closed her lips firmly, and sat looking in her aunt's face, utterly
                  indifferent to the incredulity and wrath which she read there.
               "Not marry Kenneth Halford?" cried Mrs. Remsen. "Oh, you must have gone mad—quite
                  mad!"
               "I am not mad, Aunt Remsen," returned Milly. "I know very well what I am saying: I
                  shall not marry Mr. Halford."
               "And you have told him so?"
               "I have told him so." Still in the same quiet voice.
               Mrs. Remsen leaned back aghast; the affair began to appear more serious than she
                  had expected; still she could not believe that the difficulty was beyond remedy.
                  Of course Milly's declaration went for nothing. Young women frequently made such
                  resolves, when angry, for the express purpose of being teased into breaking them.
                  Mrs. Remsen would be cool. She had an idea that Milly could be abominably
                  obstinate, if thoroughly aroused; she would be cool. She must get to the bottom of
                  the matter without delay.
               "At least, you can give some reason for this extraordinary determination, I
                  suppose?"
               If it were possible Milly's white face grew whiter when her aunt's question
                  obliged her to think of the reason she must give for her conduct: the words she
                  had heard Kenneth Halford speak to Mrs. Marchmont—the words—the kiss upon her
                  hand!
               Mrs. Remsen looked at her in amazement. She knew that it was not in Milly's nature
                  to betray deep feeling easily. She had no girlish fondness of moaning for the
                  edification of her friends on every plausible occasion, and wearing her sorrows
                  painted upon her countenance. This made her aunt wonder; unable to understand the
                  mingled storm of pain and indignant scorn which swept across her features while
                  she recalled the scene of the previous evening as it was impressed upon her
                  excited mind.
               "Don't look like that, Milly!" Mrs. Remsen exclaimed, not knowing in the least
                  what to think of the girl in this new phase of character. It was not in her
                  disposition to open her arms and bid her niece come and rest therein like a
                  stricken deer. Moreover, she felt instinctively that Milly would have preferred
                  the coolest contempt to such an effusion of pity and tenderness.
               "What horrible thing can Kenneth Halford have done that you should look like
                  this?"
               "He has done what I never can—never will forgive! If I believed my heart weak
                  enough to pardon him and receive him again, I would tear it from my bosom with my
                  own hands!"
               Could this be Milly, uttering these wild threats with such passion? No wonder Mrs.
                  Remsen asked herself this question, as Kenneth Halford had done on the preceding
                  night. If it was Milly, it certainly was not the same creature who had been
                  treated as a child, supposed to have no thoughts or feelings beyond those common
                  to girls of her age—not the Milly who, a month ago, just one little month, had
                  been so loving, so confiding, with her heart so full of sunshine, her eyes so glad
                  with content. No, never that Milly any more. She was gone—dead in this sudden
                  wreck of hope and trust. The creature who had taken her place was a woman, bitter,
                  and even defiant, with a knowledge of evil forced upon her of which the other
                  Milly had been entirely innocent.
               A perception of this change came over Mrs. Remsen's mind. She began to see with
                  what and whom she had to deal. There must be something very black at the bottom of
                  all this; but it should be cleared up, set right. Fortune, position, a successful
                  future could not be flung aside for any reason that the heart alone might dictate.
                  The bare possibility of a disaster and failure roused Mrs. Remsen to extreme
                  anger.
               "You certainly are crazy, Milly," she said. "This is some fancy you have taken,
                  some wild fit of anger at a small offense—"
               "Fancy!" interrupted Milly, while two scarlet spots began to blaze in the
                  whiteness of her cheeks. "You will have me speak, you will make me put my shame
                  into words—shame for one of my age to have the knowledge of sin forced upon
                  her!"
               "What, for Heaven's sake? He could have done nothing so terrible as your words
                  would imply! You don't know what you are saying, you can't know."
               "If you had seen your husband bending over another woman, kissing her, speaking
                  words of love in her ear, would you have known what it meant?" cried Milly, in a
                  sharp, frightened tone. "Let me alone, aunt; don't ask me questions—I shall not
                  answer. It is bad enough to know this without being forced to put it into words.
                  Let me alone, I say."
               Mrs. Remsen turned away, utterly bewildered dered. She could not trust herself to
                  speak for the moment. She was sorry for Milly, but furious with her, with Halford,
                  every one, because this sudden barrier had come between her and the fulfillment of
                  her wishes.
               "It is that Mrs. Marchmont!" she exclaimed, wrathfully, after a long silence which
                  Milly could not break.
               "You see!" exclaimed Milly. "You had noticed; you knew that he loved her; you
                  knew—"
               "I knew nothing of the kind," retorted her aunt; "I don't believe it now. She is
                  an abominable flirt, and the best of men will humor such a woman."
               "Humor!" repeated Milly.
               "Yes," continued Mrs. Remsen; "it's their way, I suppose, because she is so
                  beautiful. I don't pretend to defend the thing, but all men will do it. I have no
                  idea that there was any thing wrong in what you saw or heard—just ridiculous
                  gallantry and coquetry. The truth is, you have been behaving as badly as possible
                  to Mr. Halford for several weeks. You were jealous of Alice Marchmont all the
                  time, and I was sure of it. If you had but spoken one word to him, it might all
                  have been set right."
               "Would you have had me beg and implore him to be true?" cried Milly. "Am I a dog
                  to be petted when he chooses, and sent into a corner when he grows weary of me?
                  Oh, Aunt Remsen, you don't know me! I am no longer a child; I am indeed a woman,
                  to feel with all a woman's passion, and hate with all her strength."
               This was a new sort of talk in Mrs. Remsen's experience of young ladies; and she
                  was at a loss what to do or how to receive it. She did what most women would have
                  done under these aggravating circumstances—grew more angry, and commenced the
                  detail of her own personal wrongs and injuries arising out of the affair.
               "After all the pains I have taken," she said, "to be treated in this way! I have
                  been a good mother to you, Milly; I have brought you up with every care, kept Maud
                  out of society on your account, and now you behave in this unheard-of manner."
               "Would you have me marry him?" demanded Milly, with a flash of indignation in her
                  eyes.
               "Girls can't break engagements with impunity," urged Mrs. Remsen, evasively.
               "If I had been his wife, I would have left him," said Milly. "There are many
                  things I could bear patiently—neglect or ill-treatment; but when one whom I have
                  loved shows me that I have deceived myself, that his heart is not mine, there is
                  no power strong enough to keep me with him—my love is dead."
               "There are other things to be thought of in marriage besides love," returned Mrs.
                  Remsen.
               "I know you believe so; I told you in the beginning aunt, that I did not care for
                  other considerations. You laughed at me, and thought it a girlish folly; but I
                  meant it. If I marry a man, I must respect and love him. Since my engagement I
                  have seen all these things still more clearly. I do not love Mr. Halford; I do not
                  respect him; I consider him false and despicable! I can not marry him—I will
                  not!"
               "What am I to do? I can't give you another such winter. I am embarrassed as it is;
                  and, after all, you are not my daughter, though I have been so fond of you. Oh,
                  you mad, crazy girl!"
               "I don't care to go again into society, aunt. I will help you all I can. Send away
                  the governess. I'll teach the children; I'll sew; I'll do any thing—any
                  thing!"
               "Do be sensible, then, and look at matters in the usual way," replied Mrs. Remsen,
                  not yet despairing of bringing her niece to reason, or, more strictly speaking,
                  unable to cease urging her arguments, even after they were thoroughly exhausted.
                  "I don't at all understand the affair yet; no one could, I should think. Do pray
                  explain—"
               "Have a little mercy, Aunt Eliza! Can't you see how you hurt me?"
               "It's very well to have such sensitive feelings," cried Mrs. Remsen, anger getting
                  the upper hand again; "but they are more natural in a novel than in real life. I'd
                  rather see a young lady show docility and obedience, be a little more ready to
                  rely upon the advice of friends, than turn like a serpent to sting the bosom that
                  has warmed her."
               Mrs. Remsen was slightly indulging in high tragedy, too; but as hers sprang from
                  disappointed worldliness, it was rather ridiculous; while Milly's, however
                  exaggerated, had the dignity which only real suffering gives to such
                  expressions.
               "I've no wish to make you unhappy, Aunt Remsen," she said. "I am very grateful to
                  you for your goodness; but don't reproach me for what is no fault of mine."
               "It is your fault, I tell you, Milly! For a long time you have irritated Kenneth
                  Halford in every way—"
               "He tortured me," broke in Milly, roused to passionate self-exculpation; "he stung
                  and wronged me; he followed that woman about, and left me."
               "Did you expect to keep him fastened to your chatelaine like a gold breloque?" asked Mrs. Remsen, sarcastically,
                  interrupting in her turn, as even ladies will when excited.
               "I expected him to love me as he had promised," answered Milly, resolutely. "I
                  expected him to keep his vow in deed and in thought. As well be actually false to
                  me as allow his mind to stray."
               "You are absurdly and insanely jealous," said her aunt. "That is exactly what ails
                  you."
               "Not now," replied Milly, bitterly. "One must love to be jealous, and Kenneth
                  Halford has killed my love with that one blow."
               Mrs. Remsen fairly ground her teeth. I am sure she must have regretted not being a man; a little hearty plain-talk would
                  have been such a relief, and a sort of safeguard against breaking a blood-vessel,
                  which she really thought she must do.
               "I don't believe," she almost shrieked; "no, I don't believe out of a mad-house so
                  crazy a creature was ever seen! I thought you had common sense, and here you show
                  yourself the most doleful fool that ever worried a woman's life out. I'd like to
                  put a straight-jacket on you, and send you up to Bloomingdale! I would, indeed. I
                  verily believe it would be the proper place for you."
               "Send me, if you like, Aunt Eliza; I'll go there or anywhere you please."
               "Now, don't play the martyr," groaned Mrs. Remsen. "For Heaven's sake, don't add
                  that to all the rest, unless you wish to make me as crazy as you are."
               "Perhaps I had better go away," pursued Milly, catching at the idea with a feeling
                  of relief. "It might be better for all of us."
               "And where in the name of goodness would you go?"
               "I don't know; I think I don't care. I could teach children—"
               "For pity's sake do be quiet! I shall certainly go out of my senses! My niece a
                  governess; it would be a pretty story to tell, wouldn't it? Do you wish to ruin us
                  all utterly, have people call me the most cruel woman that ever lived, and see
                  Maud's prospects completely destroyed?"
               "Then what can I do, Aunt Remsen? Only suggest something that will prevent my
                  being a burden to you, and I will obey."
               "There is but one thing to be done; a bat could see it plainly," retorted Mrs.
                  Remsen, as if deciding upon young women's futures was the ordinary occupation of
                  the mysterious beast she mentioned.
               "Tell me; only tell me," begged Milly, wearily.
               "Let me send for Kenneth Halford, and get a frank, full explanation of this
                  affair."
               "Never—never!" cried Milly. "Any thing but that!"
               "Of course, I knew you would say so! Any thing except the only thing that can be
                  done."
               "There is no explanation possible."
               "Now, Milly Crofton, that is just romantic nonsense, nothing more. Listen to me!
                  You will have to live in the world, not in a novel. You will have to do as other
                  women do, put up with such kind of trouble. Romance is all very well, and love is
                  all very well; but they are rank nonsense when carried too far. Neither of them
                  endures beyond five-and-twenty. When a woman marries, she should look at the
                  future. As she grows old, she wants position and money; without these, all the
                  love that ever poet dreamed of becomes the most utterly worthless drug that it is
                  possible to imagine."
               Milly was listening, grown so quiet that Mrs. Remsen thought her words were
                  beginning to have an effect.
               "Go on," said Milly, when her aunt paused for breath, speaking with a calmness
                  that would have sounded ominous had the lady been sufficiently composed to notice
                  it.
               "So I say, when a girl has found these things as you did, let her take no notice
                  if the gilding wears off her romance; let her trust to her woman's tact to keep a
                  certain hold upon the man she marries; in short, let her take the benefits Heaven
                  offers, and not demand impossibilities."
               She ceased, overcome by her own eloquence, and Milly, looking intently in her
                  face, asked,
               "You think I have no reason to feel hurt and outraged?"
               "I don't say that; it's aggravating to see one's lover devoted to another woman;
                  but they will all of them do it! I am sure Mr. Halford only wanted to punish your
                  caprices. Talk quietly with him."
               "No, Aunt Eliza, I can not blind myself. He knew this Mrs. Marchmont long ago; he
                  loved her! He was pleased with my girlishness, and engaged himself to me
                  thoughtlessly. Then this woman resumed all her old power over him."
               "I don't believe a word of it all!"
               There was no logic in the assertion, but it was the best Mrs. Remsen could do
                  under the circumstances. Flat denial was the only ground left for her to take.
               "Aunt Remsen, if there were no other reason, I would not marry him now that I know
                  he thought me a child; loved me only as he might some pretty plaything."
               "Time enough after you are married to show him that you are not," urged Mrs.
                  Remsen.
               "Oh no; for I should only bring untold misery on myself. I could not be patient
                  when I saw that he considered me incapable of sharing his loftiest feelings, his
                  deepest secrets. I should weary him with my anger and my importunities. Every week
                  would separate us more widely."
               Where, in Heaven's name, had this child learned such arguments? Mrs. Remsen stared
                  at her with something of the feeling a person might have if a pet song-bird, that
                  had been content with its lumps of sugar and its gilded cage, suddenly transformed
                  itself into a mountain eagle, beating against the bars of its prison, struggling
                  fiercely with every thing which opposed its flight, and betraying in every
                  movement the uncontrollable spirit of its race.
               "I say," continued Milly, "that, putting all else aside, this view of the case
                  would be enough to make me break my engagement."
               Mrs. Remsen groaned again.
               "Aunt Eliza, I have only been childish and thoughtless because I was happy. My
                  love seems to have changed me entirely, and roused deep feeling and keen
                  perception that I did not know I possessed. Suffering has made me so much older,
                  that it seems out of my power to go back to my girlish carelessness."
               Mrs. Remsen sat up in her chair, and gurgled in her throat in the vain effort to
                  speak, and stared aghast and helpless.
               "I can remember my mother; I know now what she suffered? She married a man older
                  than herself, who regarded her as a child, and could never be made to understand
                  that as the years went on her intellect widened to the fullness of his. He sought
                  companionship among women of the world, and crushed her by his unrecognition of
                  her claims, until she drooped, faded, and dropped into her grave, glad to be at
                  rest."
               Mrs. Remsen was silent, a little awed, and much softened. Her love for that
                  sister, so early dead, had been the purest, the least selfish feeling of her whole
                  life.
               "I should not do that," Milly went on, her voice hardening and her face growing
                  stern; "I could not allow myself to be crushed without a struggle. In time I
                  should surely come to hate the man who, from pride and blind conceit, refused me
                  my true place in his heart. I should become capable of any act which might wound
                  and teach him that the creature he had looked down upon and petted like an infant
                  was able to sting his very soul and ruin the life in which he thought she made so
                  small a part—a thing pleasant to have, like flowers or music, but, like them, to
                  be put aside whenever it should suit his lordly will."
               Mrs. Remsen was still dazed; but she must say something. Her experience, her
                  worldly wisdom would not allow themselves to be completely silenced by this
                  strange creature that Milly had come to be.
               "You should say all that to Kenneth Halford," she began; but Milly went on, almost
                  without a pause.
               "I say it to him! If he could not see it, better to part. Since he loved only a
                  child, it was not I whom he loved, for I am one no longer. He wanted a plaything;
                  he must look elsewhere. Let him buy one with his wealth and position. My heart is
                  beyond his purchase."
               "I tell you, Milly, these feelings will pass out of his mind," urged her aunt; "he
                  will love and respect you after this."
               "You forget the rest," replied Milly; "or, rather, you will not remember; but I
                  can not forget! He has put a gulf between my heart and his that he could never
                  cross."
               "Your jealousy again."
               "Call it what you please."
               "Just follies that torment you."
               "Think so, if you will, you can not persuade me. I saw them together—I heard his
                  words. I can not go over all these things again. It would be of no use."
               She began to tremble again, and leaned wearily back in her seat; she had not
                  tasted food that day, and after her long fainting fit and terrible excitement she
                  was thoroughly exhausted. It was more plainly visible now, in contrast to her
                  recent passion and firmness.
               "You are ill, Milly. Oh, you will kill yourself!"
               Milly shook her head.
               "No, Aunt Remsen; people can't die so easily. I used to think a great trouble
                  would kill suddenly; but now I believe it must take years and years, when one is
                  so young and strong as I."
               She looked too pale and haggard, now that the color which excitement had brought
                  to her face began to die out, to be scolded much more.
               Mrs. Remsen sat puzzling her brain as to what could possibly be suggested further
                  as at all likely to have influence upon the girl; but she could only go over the
                  old arguments dressed in a little different fashion, and they proved as
                  ineffective as before. At last Milly cried out, in a voice which fairly frightened
                  her,
               "Let me alone, Aunt Remsen; let me alone, I beg!"
               And there was no opportunity to scold or argue more just then, for, as she spoke,
                  Milly fainted entirely away. Mrs. Remsen was a sensible woman, so, instead of
                  shrieking for help, she managed to lift her to the bed, and worked over her until
                  she recovered consciousness again. Mrs. Remsen had a horror of scenes, thought
                  them positively vulgar. People who have no great degree of feeling are much given
                  to that opinion. Any thing which thoroughly arouses them from their selfish
                  comfort is so tiresome and mauvais genre.
               But, with all her foibles, Mrs. Remsen was kind-hearted, as I have said; and just
                  then her irritation and disappointment were forgotten in anxiety, and she did
                  every thing that could be of use in the gentlest and most womanly way.
               Milly turned her face from the light, and closed her eyes as if she were going to
                  sleep—a mere artifice to induce her aunt to leave her.
               "You can rest now," said Mrs. Remsen, "and be quite restored when you wake;" and
                  she kissed her, as women do kiss each other—touching the face to be so honored
                  with the tip of the nose—and went out of the room.
               Milly was so fortunate as to lie on her bed all the morning unmolested, her aunt
                  having told Maud and the servants that she was ill with a nervous headache, and on
                  no account to be disturbed. Maud, at least, was not likely to intrude upon her,
                  under such circumstances; for that young lady was as much out of her element in a
                  sick-room as a useless creature could well be. Mrs. Remsen took a little time to
                  deliberate, and then she sat down and wrote a note to Kenneth Halford.
               She commenced thus:
               "MY DEAR FRIEND,—Our little girl is quite ill—"
               Then she hesitated. She had much womanly delicacy in her composition; she could
                  not appeal to his sympathy by exposing Milly's weakness. She reflected a little
                  longer, and, after much trouble and many erasures, wrote and dispatched the
                  following:
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "DEAR MR. HALFORD,—I wish you would come and see me as soon as you
                              receive this. You and I are old friends, and can afford to talk openly
                              with one another; and I am sure you feel that in any thing I might say
                              I should have your happiness, and that of our fanciful little Milly,
                              very closely at heart.
                           "So come and talk with me, and let this light cloud be swept away by
                              our mutual endeavors before it grows darker; come, with your usual
                              kind frankness, and be certain that you will find me now, as ever,
                              your very sincere friend,
                           
                              ELIZA REMSEN."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Mrs. Remsen felt a sense of relief when her missive was gone; at least, she had
                  done something, and that is always a comfort when one has been at a loss. Halford
                  would at once obey her summons; of that she felt certain, and the more she
                  reflected the more confident she became that every thing would end well. Her
                  spirits returned, her distress and irritation passed away. Several times she stole
                  up to Milly's room on tiptoe and looked in. The girl's face was buried in her
                  pillow, she seemed to be sleeping quietly, and with each visit Mrs. Remsen felt
                  her hopes revive. But only too soon the final blow overthrew them utterly. As she
                  was descending from one of these expeditions she met Cæsar, the man-servant, with
                  a letter in his hand.
               "For madam," he said, with one of his grand bows. "The individible did not wait
                  for no answer."
               Mrs. Remsen glanced at the superscription. It was in Halford's hand, and she went
                  into the little reception-room to read it.
               "All will be arranged now," she thought, as she tore open the envelope in haste.
                  "I am very glad I wrote."
               She unfolded the note, glanced at the date, and with a start and an exclamation of
                  mingled wrath and dismay, hurriedly read the contents. This was Kenneth Halford's
                  answer:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Steamer Laura, 12 M.
                           
                           "DEAR MADAM,—Your note has just been brought to me; the date above
                              will explain my hurried reply. I am leaving for South America. The
                              task of explanation remains with your niece, who last night brought
                              our engagement so decidedly to an end that my own self-respect renders
                              it impossible to me to employ any means—if such were in my power—to
                              change her determination.
                           "I wish you and yours every happiness, and trust that the years which
                              will probably elapse before my return may not wear from your mind all
                              kindly recollections of
                           
                              "KENNETH HALFORD."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Mrs. Remsen read the letter twice, as if she found it difficult to understand the
                  contents, crushed it in her hands as dramatically as an actress could have done,
                  and between rage and disappointment came near a fainting fit herself.
               "Gone to South America!" was all she could utter, in a voice that would have done
                  justice to Queen Constance's famous speech, for the first time conscious of her
                  own utter helplessness. He had put it beyond her power to do any thing now. "Gone
                  to South America! Two mad people together, and I am to bear the consequences of
                  their folly!"
               Yes, Kenneth Halford had gone. In his anger with Milly, his sorrow at having lost
                  his beautiful hope of peace, his bitterness toward himself and fate, he had
                  gone.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               HORTENSE'S WISDOM.
               LIKE most people disappointed of their plans, Mrs. Remsen had not magnanimity
                  enough to bear her mortification and Milly's conduct with any degree of patience.
                  She sat holding Kenneth Halford's letter in her hand, as yet too confused and
                  angry to see her way. Before she had composed her mind beyond the desire to go up
                  to Milly and overwhelm her with fresh reproaches, Adelaide Ramsay hurried into the
                  room, having seized the earliest opportunity to acquaint her mother with the
                  affair of the dinner-party, in spite of Halford's prohibition.
               Mrs. Remsen was looking so white and amazed that Adelaide knew something
                  extraordinary must have occurred; she glanced at the note in her mother's hand,
                  recognized Halford's writing, and jumped at a conclusion in a flash.
               "Has he broken with her?" she demanded, breathlessly. "I don't blame him in the
                  least; any man would have done the same. I only wonder you have patience with her,
                  to lose a match like that; but she deserves it all and more."
               Mrs. Remsen only leaned back in her chair, and stared at Mrs. Ramsay without
                  reply. It was evident that people had conspired to drive her out of her senses!
                  What was this which she did not know—what further mystery was at the bottom of
                  Milly's conduct and Halford's departure?
               "I don't wonder you look as if you had fallen from the clouds, mamma," pursued
                  Adelaide. "I never heard any thing so horrid in my life, never! But what does he
                  say? Let me see his letter."
               Mrs. Remsen allowed her to take the epistle, and sat steadying her dizzy head upon
                  her hand while Mrs. Ramsay perused it.
               "Gone to South America—actually gone! Well, Miss Milly has concluded her affairs
                  finely! 'Leave the explanation to your niece,'" she read aloud, "'who has brought
                  our engagement so decidedly to an end.' Oh! that's all nonsense, you know. But
                  it's very good-natured in him to allow her the credit of breaking it, I am sure;
                  but he really did it himself, any man would; and so proud as Kenneth Halford has
                  always been—"
               "In Heaven's name, Adelaide, tell me what you are talking of?" broke in Mrs.
                  Remsen. "Milly has nearly crazed me this morning, and you now seem determined to
                  finish the work."
               "What have I done, mamma? You don't expect me to take her part! I think Halford is
                  right; he ought to throw her over; she quite deserved it."
               "I don't know what you mean," groaned Mrs. Remsen. "Milly broke the engagement
                  herself, and it is the maddest thing ever a girl did."
               "Now, that is the sheerest nonsense," said Adelaide, with her usual respectful
                  candor. "Of course, one must say so. It is the only loop-hole of escape for
                  her."
               "I declare I think I shall go mad, among you all," cried her mother. "Do talk
                  connectedly, Adelaide, and explain yourself."
               "Why, mamma, I think your brain is turned. I'm sure I spoke plainly enough. It was
                  the quarrel about the dinner that made him do it. I came to tell you, but it seems
                  Milly has already confessed it herself."
               "Dinner!" repeated Mrs. Remsen. "What dinner, Adelaide?"
               "Then you don't know—she didn't tell you?"
               "Tell me what? Heavens and earth! Adelaide, what is it?"
               Mrs. Ramsay at last perceived that her news had not been forestalled, and she
                  burst forth with the energy peculiar to people when able to impart unpleasant
                  tidings in regard to some one whom they heartily dislike.
               "Day before yesterday Milly went to a dinner given at Paul Andrews's. Halford
                  discovered it, and this has caused the trouble between them."
               Mrs. Remsen rose from her chair and sank back in it again; she could only repeat
                  in a choked voice,
               "A dinner-party at Paul Andrews's house!"
               "Yes, mamma; Mrs. Lawrence took her there, and Milly did it on purpose to vex
                  Halford, who has a mortal horror of the man. She ought to be shut up in a convent;
                  there's nothing bad enough to do to her! Now you understand it all. Of course,
                  Halford has broken with her."
               Mrs. Remsen's first impulse was to fly in search of Milly with some undefined idea
                  of putting an end at once to that young lady; but she controlled herself, and made
                  Adelaide relate such particulars as she could vouch for. It was difficult to keep
                  Mrs. Ramsay's imagination down to a plain statement of facts, as she had a marked
                  talent for embroidery. She ended her story with the interview she had personally
                  interrupted at the ball, in describing which she was able to employ her most
                  gorgeous colors, and her mother could not demand authority.
               "I always insisted to you that she was the worst girl in the world; I hope you are
                  satisfied of it now!" she added, by way of conclusion. "The idea of indulging her
                  as you have, of leaving her in Mrs. Lawrence's charge during your absence! I
                  thought you must be mad at the time."
               Mrs. Remsen was not a worm to endure even the slightest trampling meekly; no, even
                  though it was the most humiliating hour of her life.
               "You would never see after her," she said. "You are almost as much to be blamed as
                  Milly."
               "There, mamma, you needn't attempt a word of that sort; I am married now, and my
                  days for being lectured are over! I don't like Milly; I never did; and I wasn't
                  going to bother myself with her. She has ruined the best chance she will ever
                  have, and I wash my hands of her and her affairs."
               "What will people say?" moaned Mrs. Remsen.
               "Say she deserves it," said Mrs. Ramsay, viciously.
               "Adelaide," urged her mother, "for all our sakes we must declare that she broke
                  the engagement. Halford's letter is proof of that."
               "Oh! say whatever you please; I've no objection to repeat it; but people will
                  believe what they choose. I've done; I shall not say another word against her,
                  only I don't pity her in the least."
               "Pity her!" cried Mrs. Remsen. "I ought to put her in a strait-jacket!"
               "A very good idea, mamma. Now I must leave you. Where is Maud? I want to see her a
                  moment about that worsted-work; I suppose she has been too lazy to finish it."
               She took herself and her finery out of the room, dismissing all thoughts of
                  Milly's troubles in her own particular affairs, and leaving her mother to her
                  reflections.
               After a few moments Mrs. Remsen rose and went up stairs, determined to "have it
                  out" with Milly. But when she reached the chamber she found the girl really
                  asleep, and looking so pale and ill that the aunt could not find it in her heart
                  to obey her first impulse and waken her. She could not help being sorry for the
                  child, in spite of her anger, so she turned away. Out of sight of Milly's worn
                  young face, her wrath returned, and a restless night did not leave her in a more
                  placable mood.
               At noon the next day Milly had not appeared, and Mrs. Remsen went out to make
                  visits without having seen her. During her absence she learned, to her horror,
                  that Milly's escapade was quite well known, and Halford was said to have left her
                  in consequence. There was no doubt that these ill-natured reports would hurt her
                  fearfully; and any hope of seeing her safely married and out of the way grew
                  fainter with each visit in Mrs. Remsen's mind. She made the best she could of the
                  affair. To those who knew of the engagement she avowed that Milly had dissolved
                  it, and even showed Halford's letter to a favored few; but people are not easily
                  led to believe that which they would rather not, and the world seems often to
                  prefer thinking ing the worst. Mrs.
                  Remsen hastened to confront Mrs. Lawrence; she must give herself that small spark
                  of satisfaction. I suppose few women ever received from one of their own sex a
                  more dreadful "wigging" than that rattle-brained lady caught at the hands of Eliza
                  Remsen. To make matters worse, Mrs. Lawrence was as impulsively warm-hearted as
                  she was thoughtless. She had only taken Milly to the dinner for "the fun of the
                  thing," and was truly grieved to hear that it had been the means of bringing such
                  trouble upon her.
               "I never was so sorry," she said over and over again. "If ever I can make it up to
                  little Milly, I will; indeed I will!"
               "If you will please leave her to me in future, and have no further care for her,
                  it is all I ask of you," retorted Mrs. Remsen, finally.
               Mrs. Lawrence was not angry; she continued her remorseful apologies and malapropos
                  suggestions until Mrs. Remsen departed in a state of subdued fury. Indeed, the
                  kind-hearted widow went about doing battle valiantly for Milly, declaring
                  point-blank that she had never been at the dinner; and when this did not answer,
                  she averred that the child went with her, not knowing whose the dinner was, and
                  hurried off as soon after she discovered the truth as civility would permit. She
                  affirmed, moreover, that Halford had flirted so outrageously with Alice Marchmont
                  that Milly could no longer endure it. I am bound to say that in her desire to
                  screen her favorite she tried to blacken poor Mrs. Marchmont's character
                  unmercifully, and committed numberless sins in the way of untruths. She brought on
                  a fierce enmity between herself and Paul Andrews, and did so fight like an amiable
                  dragon, right and left, in Milly's cause, that she really softened somewhat the
                  reports; but Mrs. Remsen did not forgive her any the more.
               When people have really done one an injury, it is only tantalizing to find them
                  sorry and ready to atone; one would rather they remained stoical and indifferent,
                  so that there should be no drawback to nourishing a genuine hatred and applying
                  the objurgatory Psalms to their cases when one reads the Bible.
               But, while Mrs. Lawrence was going about on her errand of penitence, Mrs. Remsen
                  had descended upon Milly almost as belligerent as the Assyrian of old, and there
                  was no kind angel to protect the poor, foolish child.
               "I never expected to be so stunned and shocked in my life—never!" cried Mrs.
                  Remsen. "I could not at first believe it; I can hardly do so now! To do a thing
                  like that—a young girl! Why, Milly Crofton, I should think you would expect some
                  horrible judgment to follow such conduct!"
               "I am very sorry I went, Aunt Remsen, for your sake," said Milly; "but I had
                  suffered so much, and when he neglected my note in order to go out with that
                  woman, I did not care what I did. I only wanted to hurt and offend him most."
               "But you have hurt yourself more!"
               "After all, a great many people go to Mr. Andrews's dinners. Oh, I don't care what
                  they say!" said Milly, growing desperate.
               "No wonder Mr. Halford broke the engagement—"
               "Oh, Aunt Remsen, I told you he did not! I did that myself before Adelaide came
                  in; he knew nothing of the dinner until she told him—paid very little attention to
                  it then."
               "But this thing ought of itself to have made you try to effect a reconciliation,
                  for your own sake."
               "Never, Aunt Remsen; not if I were actually to be disgraced! People must say and
                  think what they please, pity or blame me, believe that he left me or not. I would
                  not be reconciled to this man if he came to kneel at my feet and implore it."
               "No more stage effects, I beg," returned Mrs. Remsen. "There is no danger of your
                  ever seeing him again; a prouder creature does not live than Kenneth Halford—"
               "And-my pride is equal to his; I will stoop no quicker than he would."
               "Milly, I will not have you talk so—it is abominable! At least, you might appear
                  sorry."
               "I can not act a lie; and my love has gone out forever," said poor Milly,
                  believing what she said. "You would not have borne it any more patiently than I
                  did; no woman could have done so."
               "You know very little of what women are obliged to endure."
               "That is when it is too late to find a remedy," replied Milly. "A wife may be
                  forced to bear such ignominy, to hold fast her heart to keep it from bursting, and
                  still smile patiently before the world. I was able to break my bonds and end my
                  pain."
               "You talk like an idiot!" exclaimed the exasperated Mrs. Remsen. "It is useless to
                  say more to you."
               "If you will only leave me to myself, I shall be so very thankful."
               "That is very well, now that you have done all the mischief you possibly can. If
                  you had the smallest particle of gratitude or decent feeling in your composition,
                  you would remember the trouble this brings upon me."
               "I do remember, Aunt Eliza, and I am indeed sorry for it; but I can not help that
                  now."
               "Such a future!" groaned her aunt. "I thought you were going to be so happy! I was
                  very fond and so proud of you; I loved you because you were so like your mother;
                  and now—that you should treat me in this way!"
               "I couldn't help it, Aunt Remsen; indeed, I couldn't help it," pleaded Milly.
               "What am I to do?" pursued Mrs. Remsen, once more growing eloquent upon the
                  subject of her own personal grievances. "Maud can't be kept back any longer; it
                  wouldn't be fair; she would never submit to it, and I can't take you both out next
                  year. It's quite out of the question."
               "Oh, Aunt Eliza, I don't wish to go anywhere again. I have told you that, and I
                  will teach the children."
               "Now, that is nonsense. You know I can not let you do such a thing. You know I
                  would not; it only sounds more foolish and ungrateful than the rest."
               "I did not mean it so, indeed, Aunt Eliza," said poor Milly.
               "And I had hoped so much from you," Mrs. Remsen quavered, not heeding Milly's
                  words. "Mr. Halford could have placed Bob in the Naval School. I could have bought
                  that house I wanted on my own terms, with him in the family. Oh, Milly, I think
                  you are the most atrocious girl I ever heard of!"
               As she thought of her wrongs anger was uppermost again, and she scolded until she
                  raised a corresponding tempest in weary Milly's mind at last.
               "Let me go away; send me away," she sobbed. "I can not stay here. I can not bear
                  such scenes. You will kill me! I shall go out of my senses if you do not let me
                  alone!"
               Then the passion in each feminine breast broke into hysterical sobs, and finally
                  both wept themselves into tolerable composure. It was altogether the best thing
                  which could have happened; Mrs. Remsen could talk no more, and Milly was left to
                  weep herself to sleep—the only lullaby she was likely to find at present.
               Of course, this conversation was only the beginning of many similar scenes, before
                  they had learned to look the matter full in the face and call up a little
                  resignation. It was well for Milly that her cousins were so hard upon her, as Mrs.
                  Remsen was forced at last to defend her a little; and this fact kept matters from
                  reaching their extreme limit of endurance between Milly and her aunt.
               Maud would have been a perfect little wasp if she had dared; indeed, she never
                  failed to tease Milly when she found a safe opportunity. Adelaide Ramsay "cast
                  Milly off," as she had pompously declared she should do; but, as she had always
                  been as indifferent and cold as possible, the additional ill-nature was not
                  sufficiently apparent to be painful. As for Hortense, the intellectual daughter of
                  the family, she descended sufficiently from the elevation of her missions and
                  ologies to be fearfully shocked; but her mind was so filled with the sufferings of
                  missionaries in the South Sea Islands, and the probable appearance and tastes of
                  the inhabitants (if any such existed) of the regions about the North Pole, that
                  she could not be expected to dwell upon Milly's poor little troubles.
               She came to the house during the first excitement, saw Milly, and deluged her with
                  wisdom and advice; but under all her learned follies she had a more tender heart
                  than either of her sisters, and did not reproach her with so much cruelty.
               "It all comes of your having an undisciplined mind," she said. "Oh, Milly, I told
                  you long ago that you ought to undertake a course of mental philosophy, or even
                  geology or conchology, or at least something really to develop your reasoning
                  powers."
               "Never mind, Hortense," replied Milly, honestly grateful for such good-nature; "I
                  can study now."
               Mrs. Maynard rushed into a long dissertation, in which she proved satisfactorily
                  to herself that the world could never revolve properly in its orbit until women
                  should be differently educated. Then she branched off in modest praise of her own
                  mental qualifications, reached the fertile subject of her grand occupations, and
                  the thorough manner in which she was fulfilling her destiny, and ended with this
                  climax,
               "If I were you, Milly, I would be a missionary!"
               Mrs. Remsen entered the room in time to catch these last words, and, her patience
                  in these days being mere thread-paper, she exclaimed,
               "I declare, Hortense, I almost think you are a greater idiot than Milly
                  herself!"
               Hortense smiled in lofty compassion. She could not be ruffled, because her wisdom
                  was deemed folly by those who were too ignorant or too shallow-minded to
                  comprehend its depth.
               "Mamma," she said, grandly, "you never did understand me; but I am not to blame
                  for that. You may call my life folly; you may consider the approval of such men as
                  Professor Drivler and Doctor Brazen not worth having, but I can not agree with
                  you. In his day Galileo was regarded as a madman and—"
               "Oh, Hortense!" broke in her mother, giving herself an exasperated shake.
               "One moment, mamma, then I have done! Where was I? These constant interruptions
                  render connected thought impossible. Oh! I repeat what I said, for I did not make
                  the assertion without due reflection; if I were Milly, I would become a
                  missionary."
               "She is about as fit for it as her white kitten is to become a bishop," returned
                  Mrs. Remsen. "Milly has thwarted her own destiny! She was meant to be rich—a woman
                  of the world—"
               "Oh, mamma!" sighed Hortense, interrupting in her turn, while Milly leaned back in
                  her chair and felt contemptuous of both. "Do you believe there is no higher
                  destiny than being a butterfly, thinking only of dress and trivial amusements, of
                  the attractions of wealth and the enervating weaknesses in which most women pass
                  their lives?"
               "Hortense," said her mother, "I don't mean to argue. I am quite willing to admit
                  that in your case the learned and high-minded style succeeded admirably. But it
                  strikes me that, in spite of your wisdom, you were not unwilling to marry a rich
                  man; that you think as much of dress as we frivolous women; and enjoy your wise
                  dinners and stilted reunions in quite as dissipated sipated a fashion as we do balls and operas,
                  besides taking your fair share of them, too."
               Hortense smiled benignly—a smile meant to express the wide difference between
                  their conduct and her habit of varying the important duties of life by lighter
                  pursuits at convenient seasons.
               "If Milly were like Angelene Davidson, she might lecture."
               Mrs. Remsen shrieked.
               "Only a prejudice on your part, mamma," interposed Hortense, equably.
               "I beg you won't go on talking of it, at all events," shivered Mrs. Remsen.
               Hortense smoothed her ruffles, smiled complacently, and meditated an overflowing
                  of eloquence; but concluded that it would not be worth the trouble, considering
                  her audience, and continued,
               "If it had pleased Heaven to make her a woman of genius, she might write
                  something, or paint."
               "It did not," said Mrs. Remsen, "and I thank Heaven for it. She has given me
                  trouble enough as it is; goodness knows what might have happened if she had been
                  troubled with soul-pinings and aspirations."
               "She is, indeed, happier. The children of genius suffer anguish of which the world
                  little dreams;" and Hortense sighed as if she had a soul as full of poetry and
                  pangs as Sappho herself.
               "There is only one thing for Milly to do," said her aunt; "let her write to Mr.
                  Halford; let her say—"
               "Aunt Remsen," interposed Milly, "it is perfectly useless to go over all that
                  again. I have told you I would never do it; I had much rather die!"
               "Oh, Milly, your obstinacy will kill me!" cried Mrs. Remsen. "I can not endure
                  this much longer."
               "Mamma," said Hortense, assuming the attitude she affected when about to get off
                  something particularly brilliant, "in some respects Milly is right—woman's dignity
                  must be maintained! I am sorry for her in many ways; but I say frankly, suffering
                  is good for her; bitterness is a tonic. Let Milly be brave, press her thorn of
                  suffering to heart, go on unflinchingly, and out of the darkness and trouble will
                  come consolation and wisdom!"
               Milly had a dim idea that Charlotte Brontë had said the same in a better way, but
                  she held her peace.
               Mrs. Remsen was goaded beyond endurance, and exclaimed, "If you can not do better,
                  Hortense, than uphold Milly in her wickedness, you had better be silent."
               "I do not uphold her, mamma; I blame her; but I pity her, too, because I see so
                  plainly the causes which have brought this affliction upon her," continued Mrs.
                  Maynard, waving her hand in the air, as she careered, well-mounted, upon her
                  oratorical hobby. "Women's minds are not properly developed, women's souls not
                  thoroughly roused from the chaotic—"
               "Hortense," snapped her mother, dismounting her with cruel haste, "you may as well
                  stop talking, for I can not understand one word you're saying."
               Hortense sighed and frowned ominously, then decided to smile again from the height
                  of her superiority, and shook out her flounces preparing to depart.
               "It seems my advice can not aid you," she said, with an accent of serene pity for
                  their weakness. "Professor Drivler says he would rather have my opinion on certain
                  subjects than that of most of the scientific men in America; but—well—neither you
                  nor Milly is Professor Drivler."
               Milly thought of the professor's crooked nose that seemed always trying to go
                  round a corner before him, and congratulated herself upon the fact her cousin had
                  stated.
               "Oh, Hortense," said Mrs. Remsen, unable to keep the peace; "you are a pretty
                  woman, and you have really a fair share of brain; but your 'ologies and the
                  flattery you receive are quite turning your head, and destroying your common
                  sense."
               "Mamma, Jean Paul Richter says—"
               "I don't at all care what he says. The opinion of a musty old Dutchman isn't going
                  to help me out of my troubles."
               "Oh, mamma, if we could only learn to receive troubles aright! The crushed grape
                  yields the wine—"
               "But I am not a crushed grape; don't talk nonsense."
               Milly couldn't help an actual laugh. It was many days since she had felt in the
                  mood to laugh.
               "You may find laughing matter in this affair, but I don't," said her aunt,
                  adopting the injured tone.
               "Mamma," said Hortense, "you are so worldly."
               "I suppose I was intended to be so, or I should have been sent somewhere else to
                  live! It is easy for you to preach—not a care in the world, plenty of money, and
                  even your household affairs troubling you no more than if such things did not
                  exist."
               "Do you think my mind is to be brought down to a level like that?" demanded
                  Hortense, vehemently. "Do you suppose I would fold up my talents in table-cloths,
                  and wear out my brain consulting about what I should eat?"
               "Nevertheless, you seem to enjoy your good dinners quite as much as any one."
               "I could dine off the simplest fare," returned Hortense, "provided I had
                  intellectual intelligences to share it."
               "But you would not have them," retorted her mother. "They take good care to carry
                  their intellectuality where nice dinners are to be found."
               Hortense held up her hands in holy horror of such heretical opinions, and as she
                  did so her eye caught a new bracelet she wore.
               "Isn't it pretty?" she said, extending her arm toward Milly. "It was the only one
                  in that pattern that Tiffany had."
               Milly thought bitterly, "They would talk of themselves and their petty affairs if
                  I was lying here dead! Hortense is kinder than the other girls, but even she has
                  no more heart than one of her big books; and Aunt Eliza is killing me with her
                  uncertain tempers—one moment pitying, the next abusing me for my ingratitude."
               "Adelaide will be horribly vexed," said Mrs. Remsen. "She told me about the same
                  bracelet yesterday, and said she had almost teased Mr. Ramsay into buying it for
                  her."
               Hortense smiled complacently. In spite of her lofty aims, she was woman enough
                  thoroughly to enjoy the delight of possessing a thing some one else had been eager
                  to procure.
               "I think little of such trifles," she observed, with superb indifference. "If I
                  had to wheedle and tease as Adelaide does to obtain them, I should go
                  without."
               "Perhaps," added Mrs. Remsen, doubtfully.
               "If she would only go away," thought Milly. "I shall hate them all soon. If I were
                  only quite alone—away in a Western forest, where no human being could reach
                  me!"
               But the Western forest was not accessible; she was obliged to remain quiet, and
                  receive Hortense's parting words of counsel.
               "You ought not to sit down idly and grieve," she began; but Milly flashed out at
                  once. Any thing like pity she could not endure.
               "I am not grieving; I have nothing to grieve over. Be good enough to understand
                  that perfectly, Hortense."
               "Nothing to grieve over?" cried her aunt. "Oh, you are a wicked girl—and the
                  trouble you have given me—the pain and the disappointments!"
               "I did not mean that, Aunt Remsen; I am sure you know what I intended to say quite
                  well. I am sorry to disappoint you, heartily sorry; but I have no other trouble to
                  grieve over."
               "Then you really did break the engagement?" asked Hortense.
               "Yes, and I should do it again with the same reason."
               Mrs. Remsen leaned back in her chair and emitted the most dolorous groan to which
                  she had yet given vent. She had become an adept in the art during these past few
                  days, but this latest effort was such a triumph that it quite startled her
                  listeners.
               "Why. Adelaide said Mr. Halford did it," returned Hortense, as soon as she had
                  sufficiently recovered from the effects of her mother's moan to speak again.
               "Adelaide is a chattering magpie," cried Mrs. Remsen, roused to speech again.
                  "Things are quite had enough. She needn't try to disgrace Milly by spreading such
                  reports."
               "Oh! she only told me; she will be careful before the world, but among
                  ourselves—"
               "Among ourselves the matter need not be discussed," interrupted Milly, with the
                  new firmness and decision she had gained of late. "I beg you to understand, once
                  for all, Hortense, that I broke my engagement with Mr. Halford because I found I
                  did not love him. I never wish to hear his name mentioned again."
               "This is the way she goes on," said Mrs. Remsen, disconsolately; "it is enough to
                  drive me distracted."
               "But, mamma, if she found that a youthful fancy had deceived her, it was wise to
                  pause in time."
               "I shall go to my own room," replied Mrs. Remsen. "I will not hear such language
                  applied to the subject. If you choose to encourage Mildred in her wickedness—"
               "I don't, mamma; you misunderstand me. Regarded from a worldly point of view—and
                  one of the worst features of the life and education of the present age is the fact
                  that we must often be, to a certain extent, worldly—Milly has done a very unwise
                  thing."
               "I do not want advice, Hortense. My aunt is the only person to whom I should look
                  for it."
               "And much attention you pay to it, after it is given," said Mrs. Remsen.
               Hortense did not allow her equanimity to be disturbed by Milly's hasty words; she
                  only looked pityingly at them both, thinking what weak creatures they were, and
                  how differently she would behave in the place of either.
               "You comprehend me as little as my mother does, Milly," said Hortense, with her
                  loftiest air. "I could say nothing sadder. But I must go now: I have to attend a
                  meeting of the Shirt-sewers' Union and see the Committee on the Hayti Fund, and
                  Professor Drivler dines with us, Oh, Milly! and Mrs. Tonguay, too. If you could
                  only hear her talk, it would do you a world of good."
               Milly found herself shuddering at the bare idea.
               "I don't wish to hear any one talk just now," she said: "My head is aching
                  fearfully."
               "And my heart aches, too," added her aunt, in her very saddest voice. "I do think
                  I am the most unfortunate woman in the world. What your dear mother would say to
                  you if she were alive, I can not imagine."
               Milly remembered how that mother had suffered, and became softened by the thought
                  of the sympathy she would have had for this distress, till a wish rose in her mind
                  to be quietly at rest by that mother's side under the green turf, far away from
                  the bustle and weariness of this life.
               "Well," said Hortense, "it seems I can say nothing to aid either of you. Mine
                  would be a life thrown away, indeed, if my opinion were of as little importance
                  everywhere as it seems to be here."
               
               "Now, Hortense, don't talk nonsense," interposed her mother.
               "Oh, mamma, it is indeed so! I can see it plainly. Not that I am angry; I only
                  think how astonished Professor Drivler and others of my friends would be if they
                  saw it. But good-bye to you both. Come and see me very soon."
               She gave her mother a dutiful kiss, and Milly a patronizing tap upon the shoulder,
                  smiling grand commiseration of their folly in not seeking and using her advice.
                  Before she reached the foot of the stairs, Mrs. Remsen remembered something that
                  she wished particularly to say to her daughter, and hurried out; so Milly was left
                  to a little quiet, a thing she most longed for and greatly needed.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXX.
               DESPERATE.
               IT was Saturday at last. Alice Marchmont had remained shut up in her room for two
                  days, so that no report of Milly's broken engagement or Halford's departure had
                  reached her, as Miss Portman was always glad to stay at home, and had taken
                  advantage of her cousin's indisposition to close the doors against visitors, and
                  live as solitary and unsociably as an ancient nun.
               This morning Mrs. Marchmont decided to go to Milly. At least, she had a right to
                  demand from the girl how much Dick Faulkner had revealed in regard to her affairs.
                  No matter how Milly behaved, she could not be in a worse position, and she desired
                  before the next night's meeting with Faulkner to know exactly where she stood, so
                  far as the babblings of his wicked tongue were concerned.
               She drove to Mrs. Remsen's house, and sent in her card to that lady herself,
                  tolerably certain that if she asked for Miss Crofton she would be denied
                  admittance. Mrs. Remsen was not at home, but Miss Maud happened to he in the
                  reception-room, and gave orders that the visitor should be shown in. She had an
                  envious admiration for Mrs. Marchmont's beauty and grace, and as she seldom had an
                  opportunity of seeing her, determined to have that satisfaction now.
               So Alice entered and was very gracious, according to her habit with young girls,
                  and Maud, bold as brass, began to explain that her mamma was out, and that she,
                  Maud, would never be forgiven if she did not detain Mrs. Marchmont till the
                  mother's return.
               Mrs. Marchmont was very willing to be detained—at least, for a while—and though
                  she had only seen Maud a few times had sufficiently guaged her mental calibre to
                  know how to flatter her into a complacent mood. That result gained, Alice said,
                  sweetly,
               "My visit was partly for your cousin, Miss Crofton. I wanted to see you all. Is
                  she in?"
               "Oh, yes," Maud answered, volubly, "she's up in her room—been playing invalid
                  since Mrs. Lawrence's ball."
               "Indeed! Not seriously indisposed, I trust."
               "Bless me! no," returned the magpie; "just one of her fancies. I suppose she's
                  sorry, now it is too late."
               Alice was too busy with her own reflections to notice the girl's words, and only
                  said,
               "Would you be kind enough to let her know that I am here?"
               "To be sure," said Maud; "but I don't believe she will come down. She stays in her
                  room, and acts as if she was possessed."
               She rang the bell, and sent up Mrs. Marchmont's message; presently back came the
                  answer. Miss Crofton was particularly engaged, and could see no one.
               "Just like her," pronounced Maud; "but I'll tell mamma how rudely she
                  behaves—ill-natured thing!"
               "But you," said Mrs. Marchmont, with her blandest manner and her sweetest smile,
                  "are so kind and frank that I am sure you will do me the favor to say to your
                  cousin that I wish particularly to see her. I have a reason."
               "Of course," said Maud, instantly devoured by a rampant curiosity. "What shall I
                  tell her you want?"
               "She might be vexed if I did not tell her first," urged Alice, gently.
               Maud had to go away unsatisfied, and having after a good deal of difficulty
                  obtained admission to Milly's room, delivered the message.
               "I shall not see her," cried Milly, to whom the visit seemed a crowning
                  insult.
               "Then I'll ask her to tell me," said Maud, anxious to have her curiosity
                  gratified.
               "You will attend to your own affairs, if you please," returned Milly.
               "It is my affair," said Maud, in a passion at once. "You need not try to treat me
                  like that any longer. You'll never be married now."
               "Have the goodness to go away," was the only answer Milly made.
               "I'll go and tell Mrs. Marchmont you say you'll not see her."
               "If you add that I will not, now or ever, I shall be much obliged," returned
                  Milly.
               Down stairs flew Maud and repeated what Milly had said, adding a rapid account of
                  her cousin's late misdemeanors, including the story of the broken engagement,
                  which Maud vowed was Halford's work because Milly went to Paul Andrews's dinner.
                  Mrs. Marchmont was shocked and pained, but the reason Maud gave prevented her
                  blaming herself for any share in the catastrophe. She got away from the girl's
                  chatter, and hurried out of the house, having gained nothing by the step, as she
                  bitterly thought, except to afford that heartless Milly a fresh triumph. The
                  creature would believe that she had been frightened into an attempt to sue for
                  mercy.
               The day got by—the evening. She went to the opera, in spite of Miss Portman's
                  expostulations lations; and that lady drove her nearly wild the whole evening by
                  her sighs and head-shakings, and her assurances to every body who entered the box
                  that Mrs. Marchmont ought to be at home and in bed. But Alice bore it; she bore
                  the next day's suspense, too; bore seeing Miss Portman depart for church, and the
                  recollection of all which kept herself from joining in the services she had once
                  so dearly prized.
               Alice Marchmont went to Mrs. Granger's dinner, and found, just as she expected,
                  several of the leaders of the fast set which she had grown to abhor in the depths
                  of her heart. Dick Faulkner's wife was there, indulging in her little attempts at
                  stinging with sugared words; and, yes, there was Dick himself—Alice saw him bowing
                  to her; and though she had been so anxious to discover what his first look would
                  reveal, it told her very little.
               He did not offer to approach her; he looked much as usual, she thought, only paler
                  and more insolent, so that she was sure he had been off on some carouse, such as
                  people said had become frequent with him of late. The half-hour of waiting was
                  nearly over before he came near her. Mr. Lewis had just left her to speak with
                  some new-comer; she could feel Dick Faulkner's approach, and shuddered as if some
                  noxious reptile were crawling toward her.
               "I was so sorry not to be able to go to you the day your note reached me," he
                  said. "If you knew what a pleasure it was to me to see even a line of your writing
                  once more!"
               She just regarded him with a glance of surprise and disgust which sent the blood
                  to his face.
               "You do not believe me?" he persisted.
               "I did not listen to what you said," she replied. "There is only one subject upon
                  which I propose to converse with you."
               He turned away without another word, just giving her one look out of his black
                  eyes which was absolutely like a flash of fire.
               Dinner was announced. Mr. Lewis came to take her in. It seemed to Alice Marchmont
                  that they were walking over a mine which was ready to explode, and that she had no
                  power to save herself—as like a night-mare as if she had been actually in the
                  midst of a horrid dream. She was very gay, though, after the dinner fairly
                  commenced; indeed, she could not tell what demon possessed her, but she could not
                  resist saying the most stinging things to each and every one in turn, and
                  especially tormenting Dick Faulkner. All the while she felt that he was capable of
                  suddenly crying the truth about her in the cars of the charming assembly.
               He persisted in talking to her; he was seated nearly opposite, and she could see
                  that he drank even more wine than usual. She would have been glad of any excuse
                  for getting away from his neighborhood; if she could only faint, as she had done a
                  few weeks before! But, no, her nerves seemed braced as they had not been during
                  all these months, and she could not resist daring the danger in every way.
               I once heard a man describe being on a railway-engine and seeing a train shoot
                  round a curve toward them, the engineer trying vainly to slacken the speed; he
                  knew that an instantaneous death menaced him, yet he could only stand there and
                  stare at it coming nearer and nearer—utterly incapable of any effort to save
                  himself, if such had been possible—could only stand and stare, while it seemed
                  like some hideous dream, and through the suspense in which every faculty was
                  centred flashed broken thoughts and sudden memories of half a lifetime gone by. I
                  can think of nothing that forms so fit a comparison for Alice Marchmont's state of
                  mind.
               She was watching the danger; she knew it came nearer and nearer, yet, through her
                  own reckless talk, through the idle laughter and conversation which went on about
                  her, all manner of things, trifling and grave, events of her past existence would
                  arise.
               She could remember a wood where, as a child, she had found wonderful flowers—the
                  variegated blossoms in Mrs. Granger's coiffure
                  recalled them; she could see the lofty pine-trees and her little child-phantom so
                  plainly. Some trivial game with a playmate; a sunny June morning long ago, with
                  Kenneth Halford coming over the lawn to the house, and her old self watching him
                  through the Venetian blinds. Any thing, every thing that was utterly removed from
                  the present; and always she could catch the flash in Dick Faulkner's eyes,
                  observant of her wherever he looked, with whomsoever he talked, and knew that the
                  danger was coming more and more near.
               They were discussing a late English novel, a story of a woman's guilty secret
                  ending in discovery, ruin to herself, and disgrace to those connected with her; an
                  adventuress, who had made for herself a place and retained it safely, until out of
                  her own past rose the ruin which overwhelmed her.
               "The best part of the book is, that it is true to nature," exclaimed Dick
                  Faulkner, suddenly, as the rest were leaving the subject.
               Every one was the more astonished because literature was not his forte, and he had
                  been drinking much Champagne while the volume was under consideration.
               "Mr. Faulkner means to astonish us by appearing in a new character," Alice could
                  not avoid saying; "a criticism of a novel. Really, Mr. Faulkner, we shall expect
                  to discover that you have been all this while a genius in disguise, writing the
                  cleverest reviews and hearing us admire them."
               "I thought you disliked novels, Mr. Faulkner," said the hostess.
               "But I do read them occasionally, though I think Mrs. Marchmont considers me a
                  dunce," he said, with his wickedest smile at Alice.
               "Oh no! At least, I never thought that," she retorted, laughing, but with
                  emphasis.
               
               "At all events," continued he, "I read this book; and I must insist that it is
                  natural."
               "Ah, very well," said Alice, mockingly; "I retire from the contest. Mr. Faulkner's
                  opinion is doubtless founded upon his choice of acquaintance among the sex, and
                  ought to be as convincing as a veritable argument."
               "I think it natural," he went on, in a dogged manner, "because I once knew of a
                  case which was a parallel, at least."
               "Let us hear it," cried Mrs. Granger. "I dote upon true stories. You are sure it
                  is true?"
               "Perfectly sure," he said. "That would be its sole merit in my way of telling; I
                  can only give the bare details, and Mrs. Marchmont already laughs at me for
                  getting out of my line."
               Such an evil smile! did the others notice?
               "I promise not to laugh," she said, "oh, most modest raconteur; but at the same time I reserve to myself the privilege of
                  doubt if the story is about a woman. You masculines are never correct in your
                  judgments of us."
               "I don't judge. This is the story—the man told me who knew. A lady, a great lady,
                  as the novels would say, courted and spoiled by the world, found herself getting
                  dreadfully into debt—"
               "Oh, it's a vile slander," interrupted Mrs. Granger. "We won't hear him, will we,
                  Mrs. Marchmont?"
               "Yes; we shall want to know how to act when we get into debt," she answered.
               She leaned back in her chair, her fingers trifling with a bunch of grapes, and her
                  eyes turned full upon Dick Faulkner's face with a calm smile.
               "She must have been a Frenchwoman," said Mr. Lewis. "Wasn't she a Frenchwoman,
                  Faulkner?"
               "Oh yes, say a Frenchwoman, if you like," he answered; "shall we, Mrs.
                  Marchmont?"
               "Call her the Queen of Sheba, if you will; but please do tell us what she
                  did."
               It was coming! At least, suspense was over; that seemed, strange as it sounds, a
                  little comfort.
               "She had to pay a sum of money."
               "Well," said Mrs. Granger, "she sold her jewels?"
               "No!"
               "Got married?" suggested some one.
               "No, that wasn't in her line. Make a guess, Mrs. Marchmont."
               She held up the cluster of grapes in a pretty way, and said, carelessly, never
                  once taking her eyes from his face, and making him feel their power through all
                  his rage and the recklessness caused by wine, "I shall not guess; I'll wait and
                  pronounce a verdict."
               "She committed a forgery!"
               The women cried out in horror.
               "An utter libel!" exclaimed Mrs. Granger.
               "Really, Dick," said his wife, "you will never succeed as a conteur if you can't keep nearer to the
                  probabilities."
               "She committed a forgery!" repeated he.
               The cluster of grapes had not fallen from Alice Marchmont's white fingers; she had
                  not stirred, not even seemed to breathe.
               "Was she found out?" asked some one.
               "Else I should not have heard it, I suppose," said Faulkner. "Yes; a man found it
                  out—a man who had loved her, and whom she had treated in a most outrageous
                  manner."
               "What did he do?" inquired a half-dozen voices at once.
               Dick Faulkner looked again at the graceful figure opposite—the white hand held the
                  grapes, the eyes regarded him still, the lids just a little drawn over the dilated
                  pupils; but the whole attitude of careless elegance unchanged.
               "What do you suppose he did, Mrs. Marchmont?"
               "That would depend on the man," said she, speaking without apparent effort. "Was
                  he a gentleman or a villain?"
               "Oh, do tell us what he did!" implored the other women.
               Alice looked at him still. For the life of him he could not finish; his story was
                  falling flat enough, from the utter impossibility of rousing the slightest show of
                  emotion in her face.
               "Perhaps he paid her debts," said Mr. Lewis, "by way of being heroic."
               "I don't know what he did," said Faulkner, drinking off his glass of Champagne. "I
                  only wanted to show you that there was nothing improbable in describing a woman of
                  position as doing all sorts of out-of-the-way things."
               There was a general chorus of indignation at his attempt at a story, and by the
                  time this was ended the ladies rose from the table.
               "I have been learning billiards, Sophy." Mrs. Granger said to Mrs. Faulkner as
                  they ascended to the drawing-room.
               "Oh, let us go and play!" she answered. "Those tiresome men will stay down there
                  for an hour, and it is so stupid for us four, all women."
               "Shall we go?" asked Mrs. Granger.
               "Go, you two, and take Miss James for umpire," said Alice. "I want to go to sleep
                  in the bay-window. I'm tired."
               "You haven't looked well for a month past," said Mrs. Granger; not that she had
                  thought of it before that minute.
               "Nonsense: I am quite well. Go and play your billiards."
               So the three went down the stairs again, the billiard-table being on the
                  dining-room floor, and Alice went on up into the great salon that she so disliked,
                  with its collection of gilded fripperies, and thought that it looked to-night more
                  than ever like an upholsterer's shop.
               She had not long to wait. She knew Dick Faulkner would follow her, and she had
                  scarcely seated herself when he came in. He walked straight toward her sofa, and
                  sat down by her side.
               "The other ladies are playing at billiards," said she, with a little yawn,
                  spreading out her robes between them.
               "I know they are; that is the reason that I came up."
               "Hadn't you better join them?" she asked, sweetly. "I told them I was going to
                  sleep, and I am nearly so now."
               "What did you think of my story?" he asked.
               She was fanning herself negligently, as if making an effort to keep awake.
               "Frankly," said she, "it was not a success. Either the audience was not
                  sympathetic, or you were not in the vein for story-telling."
               "What would they have done, do you suppose, if they could know it was the truth,
                  as you and I did?"
               The fan dropped from her hand, and as it hung to her wrist by the silken cord, it
                  rattled against the side of her sofa under the sudden nervous trembling which
                  seized her. The next thing she knew this man had both her hands in his, was
                  holding them in a close, painful grasp, and saying, in a rapid, suppressed
                  voice,
               "I love you, Alice—I love you! Don't be so hard—you shall hear me now! Never mind
                  the note; don't think about it! Oh, Alice Marchmont, I'd give my soul for just one
                  smile! Only love me, do try to love me!"
               She made one effort and freed her hands, so sick and faint, with a blinding spasm
                  of indignation and outraged womanhood upon her, at his touch.
               "One word more," she said, starting to her feet, and speaking in a voice of icy
                  coldness, "and I will summon your wife!"
               "Call the whole world," he exclaimed, with a burning, beseeching look. "I'm not
                  ashamed of loving you! I'm sick of this farce of respectability! Call—ah, you
                  don't dare!"
               "Continue, and you shall find that I dare any thing—"
               "Don't put me in a rage," he interrupted. "You have driven me nearly desperate
                  during these weeks; you can't go further! I swore you should not escape me. Don't
                  make me talk to you like this! Let me tell you I love you as no man ever
                  loved—"
               With the remembrance of all she had done to escape this wretch, to be obliged to
                  suffer the contamination of such words!
               She made a step toward the bell.
               "Take care," said he. "Call, and it will then be too late; you will make me so
                  furious that I shall speak what can't be taken back!"
               "There is nothing more you can say to harm me! Great Heaven!" she cried, "if there
                  were, don't you know I'd hear it sooner than such words! If I were drowning, and
                  only your hand could save me, do you think I would be degraded by its clasp?"
               "The hand that has held a pen to sign a forged name can't easily be damaged," said
                  he, with a sneering laugh. "There, it's out now! You want war—and you shall have
                  it! You won't let me love you? Then you shall give up to my hate."
               She sank back into her seat.
               "Yes, that's better," said he.
               "I am waiting for an explanation of your words," she said, with forced calmness.
                  "You will be pleased to state distinctly what you mean."
               "What is the use of this?" he exclaimed. "No trouble shall come to you; I have
                  sworn that! But there's no good in keeping up this pretense of bravado. I'd sell
                  my soul for you."
               She turned her back on him in silence.
               "Better not," he half whispered. "Remember the note—it's a nice signature—looks
                  well—John Worthington!"
               With one last superhuman effort at self-control she faced him again.
               "Exactly," she said; "the note with his indorsement upon it. I am ready to pay you
                  the money."
               He laughed scornfully.
               "There's not money enough in Wall Street to buy it," he said; "so there's no good
                  to talk of that."
               "It is mine; you are bound to give it up!"
               He laughed again. Nothing could save her! she must go over the precipice—after
                  all, after all!
               "We shall see what John Worthington will say to your writing his name on the back
                  of the little paper," he said.
               "I think he is quite able, Mr. Faulkner, to manage his own affairs. Is there any
                  thing extraordinary in his obliging as old a friend as I am in that way, if I had
                  chanced to need?"
               "Yes; for I heard him say he had never done such a thing for any human being, and
                  never would."
               "He is a thorough gentleman, incapable of compromising a woman by talking about
                  her affairs."
               "Will you say that he indorsed this note?"
               "I will not talk further with you on any subject, Mr. Faulkner! You first insult
                  me with your love—your love— Great Heaven! that you should dare to
                  misuse such a word!"
               "Go on, now. I would not stop you if I could."
               "After that, you accuse me of forgery!"
               "As I will do to-morrow to John Worthington."
               "And John Worthington will have your heart's blood in return. Nonsense, Mr.
                  Faulkner, I am not to be terrified into listening to your offers of affection. Is
                  that the only way in which you have been able to bring any woman near to you? I am
                  of a different make, believe me."
               "At all events, I shall ruin you," he went on, as if she had not spoken.
               "And I say it is not in your power. Since you can't avenge, you had better take
                  your money."
               "I mean to have both," he answered.
               "The next time you take the liberty of supposing a lady to have committed a crime,
                  go differently to work, if you wish to terrify her," she said, struggling still, vain as she knew the
                  effort to be.
               "It came to me in a flash," he went on, still paying no attention to her words.
                  "You may believe I was waiting till something should happen to put you in my
                  power! When I saw that note in old Hermans's desk, it was all plain to me. He told
                  me in the beginning you had given one—"
               "After you had told him the amount, and by your falsehoods made him believe that I
                  had confided in you."
               "Just as you please. At least, I found out that to pay me off you had given the
                  note; it flashed across my mind then—the story you and John Worthington were
                  telling last summer about your learning to copy his writing—bah! It was as
                  transparent as day!"
               "Have you nearly finished, Mr. Faulkner? All this is very tiresome."
               Again, as she stood there in her scornful beauty, though trembling in every limb
                  with terror and despair, the gust of passion swept over him, and he cried out,
                  "Only let me love you; give me one gentle word—a smile; you know I am your
                  slave—"
               "Not if it were to save my life—my soul!" she broke in, with a gesture of
                  loathing.
               "Then to-morrow I go to John Worthington; he shall know it. I'll take Hermans with
                  me. Don't suppose me a fool; of course he'll hold his tongue, but I can let the
                  world know, and how do you think he will like that? You, that live to be admired
                  and respected! Bah! my revenge will be more complete than if I saw you in
                  prison!"
               She was wringing her clasped hands, struggling for breath; he had touched the
                  right chord at last.
               "Take in the newspapers, Mrs. Marchmont," he continued; "I promise you there shall
                  be paragraphs worth your reading. Then, if you like, prosecute the editors, and
                  when the case comes on see if John Worthington is able to swear that he indorsed
                  that little bill."
               She heard doors open and close on the floor below, the click of billiard-balls,
                  the voices of men and women as the former left the dining-room to overlook the
                  ladies' game. They were not yet coming up—no hope, no help possible.
               His voice again took that pleading tone worse to bear than his threats and
                  unmanliness.
               "Alice! Alice! only think! It isn't too late; let us forget every thing! Go away
                  with me—let me take you to Italy! I'll make your life like a dream of
                  happiness!"
               She turned and fled. At this instant he heard a step on the stairs, and thought
                  that had frightened her. He followed her, whispering, "I'll come to you to-morrow;
                  think of it. You may save yourself yet."
               She got up into the dressing-room; she did not faint; she had only one thought—to
                  get out of the house, beyond the sight of that man, the sound of his voice. She
                  must not faint or go mad there; and yet truly it seemed to her that the final
                  crisis had arrived; her reason was in danger. She drank some water, and wet her
                  forehead with the icy drops; she groped about, blind and dizzy, feeling for the
                  bell-rope; reached it at last, and rang. She had got into a chair when Mrs.
                  Granger's maid came.
               "Order me a carriage, please," she said; "I am not well, and must go home."
               "Oh, Mrs. Marchmont, you do look so white!" the girl exclaimed, and she was
                  voluble in offers of assistance and exclamations of distress, before Alice could
                  speak again; for Mrs. Marchmont was the admiration of the domestics, on account of
                  her kind ways and words, wherever she went; and Mrs. Granger's French-woman in
                  particular cited her as "the one properly dressed lady in America."
               "Shall you have the salts? Is it like au evanouissement? I go to call madame—"
               "No, no!" said Alice; "don't disturb her. It is nothing but fatigue. I want to get
                  home; just call me a carriage."
               "But madame's has this instant arrived; it waits."
               "Then find my wraps—yes, that is all. Thank you!"
               She ran away, with the kind creature's expostulations in her ears.
               "Tell Mrs. Granger I was so unwell I had to go home, and would not disturb her,"
                  she had sense enough to say, remembering, even then, that her conduct would need
                  some excuse. There was no one in the drawing-rooms as she hurried past the doors,
                  no one in the hall below, and she left the house unobserved. She sprang into her
                  brougham, and, as the man was closing the door, said,
               "Drive to Mr. Worthington's; go quickly!"
               She allowed herself no time to think. The order had been given without any actual
                  volition on her part. She had not meant to go there. She had not even been
                  thinking. She covered her face in her wraps, and cowered down in the seat till the
                  carriage stopped. The man ran up the steps and rang. She saw the door open, got
                  out of the brougham into the hall. The housekeeper came into the hall, and
                  said,
               "Oh! Mrs. Marchmont, you have driven round for Miss Portman. They are not back
                  yet. Indeed, I think Miss Constance was to take her home."
               "At all events, I will wait. I want—is Mr. Worthington in?"
               "He's in his study, ma'am."
               "I will go to him," she said, and went on through the hall. As she reached the
                  study door, it opened. Mr. Worthington had heard the voices.
               "Mrs. Marchmont!" he exclaimed; "and Constance has not come yet."
               He caught sight of her face, never staid to utter another word, but led the way
                  into the room and closed the door. She covered her face with her trembling
                  hands.
               "Shut the door, John Worthington," she said, hoarsely. "Shut it close!"
               A fearful premonition of trouble came over him as he looked at her standing there
                  like the ghost of her former self.
               "In Heaven's name, Alice, what has happened?" he exclaimed.
               "Do you remember your promise?" she gasped, uncovering her haggard features, "to
                  be my friend—to forgive—"
               "Alice! Alice! always!"
               "Then the time has come! God help me! John Worthington, I have no hope of help
                  even from you!"
               As Alice Marchmont spoke these words, she tottered back and forth, and seemed
                  about to fall. Mr. Worthington started forward, but she would not let him support
                  her.
               "Don't touch me," she cried, "don't touch me! You are a good man—an honest man.
                  You should not touch one like me!"
               "Alice! Alice! are you mad?" he asked. "Sit down—you are falling!"
               "No, I must not. Mad? I don't know. Perhaps this is the last time we shall ever
                  stand face to face. Did I ask you to forgive me? I can't expect that; you will
                  hate me!"
               He thought she must be raving; he tried to take her cold hands and put her in a
                  chair. She retreated from him, only crying again, "Don't! don't touch me! I came
                  here to tell you. Let me do it, quick! Oh, my sin! Oh, my God, John Worthington,
                  my shame!"
               He made a step backward, putting out his hand as if to check her revelation, his
                  face as white as her own.
               "I'll not believe it!" he cried. "If an angel from heaven told me you were guilty,
                  I'd not believe it. You are mad, Alice—you must be mad!"
               "I think I have been mad," she moaned. "I do think that, though it is no
                  excuse."
               He sat down in the chair which he had pushed toward her; the great drops of
                  perspiration stood on his forehead.
               "Tell me your trouble," he said, in a slow, difficult voice; "tell me."
               She flung up her arms with an appealing gesture, and sank on her knees at his
                  feet.
               "Don't, Alice!" he pleaded. "I can't bear this. I can't see you humiliated."
               "The only place for me, the fittest place," she said, "except the prisons where
                  such women as I have been sent! I forged your name, John Worthington!"
               She tried hard to keep back the hysterical spasm, fought against it bravely; but
                  it would have its way. She struggled there at his feet in tortures pitiable to
                  witness. He had not spoken; she felt him raise her in his arms and carry her to a
                  sofa. He brought water, and after a time she could swallow a few drops. He bathed
                  her forehead gently, and soon she was able to speak.
               "You will think I am making a scene," she said, brokenly, "to enlist your
                  sympathy—"
               "Hush! hush!" he interrupted, finding words at last. "Don't say such things to me!
                  I am thanking the Merciful Father that it is not the old story—the sin I should
                  have expected from another woman's lips!"
               "He pities me!" she sobbed—a dry, choking sob, more painful than tears. "I don't
                  deserve it, I don't deserve it! Oh, you don't understand, you don't know what I
                  said! I have forged your name."
               "And did I not promise you that there should be nothing which I would not do for
                  you?" he said. "Surely I can let you use my name. Only be calm, be quiet, and tell
                  me every thing. The worst is over for you now—nothing shall touch you."
               "Oh, nothing could be so horrible as what I have endured! If I could have asked
                  God's help, as you did just now, this would not have come to me! I have been so
                  wicked in my pride. I have forgotten every thing in my mad vanity, or I should not
                  have been left to fall into this fearful sin."
               "A sin, Alice, for which your bitter remorse is atonement—your confession ample
                  amends."
               "Oh no, no; I should never have made the confession if escape had been
                  possible—there is no help! But I have suffered, oh, I have suffered! Such days and
                  nights, John Worthington! if I could tell you the half! No wonder I have grown
                  pale and old in these weeks; and there is gray in my hair, John! Oh, it seems as
                  if I had lived an eternity since that fearful day!"
               "My poor child! Poor little Alice!"
               She could not see the movement he made as if he would have taken her in his arms,
                  and shielded her against his heart even, from every painful memory. She had buried
                  her face in the cushions at the sound of his tender words, and cried out,
               "Don't speak so to me; you'll kill me with your kindness! I can't bear it!"
               He sat down by her side, smoothing her hair gently with his hand, but not speaking
                  till the sobs were checked again, and she lay quiet.
               "When you can, you shall tell me all about it," he said. "I would not ask you to
                  say another word, only that it will be better for you to tell me, and then I am
                  quite sure I can arrange every thing."
               "I can tell you," she answered, sitting upright, and trying to look in his face.
                  The emotion she saw there, and above all the yearning pity, so overwhelmed her
                  with remorse that she could only fall at his feet once more, crying,
               "Forgive me! only say you forgive me! But don't speak so kindly, don't look like
                  that! If you do, I think I must die here."
               The tears rained down. For weeks she had been able to shed none, but now it seemed
                  as if she would weep her very life away. He let her cry. He knew how near madness
                  she must have been, and that nothing could help her so much as those tears. He did
                  not attempt to raise her. She sat there at his feet, shedding those blessed tears, and at last she heard his
                  voice, saying softly,
               "Hear my prayer, O Lord! and let my crying come unto thee. Hide not
                  thy face from me in the time of my trouble; incline thine ear unto me and hear me.
                  Yea, like as a father pitieth his own children, even so the Lord is merciful."
               The blessed words from the dear Liturgy, which had once been so familiar to her.
                  Even her tears slowly ceased, and it seemed to Alice Marchmont as if God had sent
                  one of his pitying angels to whisper these assurances in her agony. They sat in
                  silence for a little, then she said, in a quiet voice,
               "I can tell you now—all the miserable story."
               She sat there at his feet and told it, concealing nothing, and beginning further
                  back than the time when I took up the record of her life. She told him of the old,
                  old days of her girlhood, when they had separated her from all that would have
                  made her girlish happiness. She told him of the lonely years with a husband who
                  had not been as tender as he ought of the young creature he had taken to his
                  keeping, for she had not deceived him; when he had married her, he knew that she
                  had no heart to give him. She kept back no detail of her wicked extravagance
                  during the ensuing years, when she had been dazzled by her newly-regained liberty
                  and the adulation of the world; while in her ignorance and folly it had seemed to
                  her that her fortune was inexhaustible—without the slightest thought she had spent
                  the thousands lying ready for investment at the time of her husband's death.
               Dick Faulkner's connection with her life; her allowing him to win money for her;
                  her debts and troubles, and the harassing sense of degradation; her permitting him
                  to keep on, because each week she believed his promises, and that she was about to
                  realize a sufficiency to pay him and all her other debts. She kept nothing back.
                  She made no effort to excuse herself; she did not think that excuse was possible.
                  But it was a blessed comfort to sit there, at his feet, and tell the whole; to
                  feel that she had no longer to bear her guilt in secret; that, whatever might
                  come, she had done all she could to atone; and now, whatever he decided upon she
                  was anxious to do.
               "I want you to tell me," she said; "and I'll do it. I can't thank you for your
                  kindness, but oh! John Worthington, you are a good man; and when you meet my
                  father in the other world—the father who died when I was an innocent little
                  girl—he'll thank you for your kindness to me."
               "Don't talk of thanks, Alice; there's no such word between you and me—you—"
               "Because you pity me so," she exclaimed, "you feel so now; but oh! to-morrow and
                  to-morrow, and for all times to come! You'll think then—how can you help it? not
                  harshly, I know; but you'll always remember! You wouldn't like to see me near
                  Constance; then you would think of it. I must go away; I can not look at the face
                  of any human being I have ever known. Ah, how lonely! John Worthington, if only
                  people could know in advance the bitterness of sin, they would keep their hearts
                  right by prayer—if only they could know!"
               "Alice, I can't hear you talk like this! Child, the Saviour forgave all penitent
                  sinners. Repentance brings a sure forgiveness; and a sin forgiven is swept away
                  forever out of the soul, only as its memory keeps the heart full of thankfulness
                  to Him who died for us."
               "You are so good—so good! You don't despise me as I do myself?"
               "My child, what right have I to despise a penitence that the Highest of all finds
                  acceptable?"
               So many years since she had heard such words, or thought such feelings
                  possible!
               "You must not talk any more to-night," he said; "you must have absolute quiet, and
                  leave this matter to me. Will you stay here, or will you go home?"
               "Oh, let me go home—let me go now before Constance comes! I can not, must not see
                  her!"
               "You shall go home. Don't look so frightened; you are worn out."
               "It comes over me anew," she sighed, "each time I think. Yes, let me go home."
               "And don't think about this any more: think of nothing to-night but rest. These
                  weeks are gone—dead; there is nothing needed but that man's silence and the note,
                  and both are easy to have. His manner of obtaining it has placed him in our
                  power."
               "Oh, does it? Can you get it?" she asked, remembering once more the dreaded
                  world's scorn, which she had nearly forgotten in John Worthington's forgiveness.
                  "You'll send me word? Oh, I remember—he said he should come to-morrow. Don't let
                  him come to-morrow; I can't bear it!"
               "There is no danger of his troubling you again at any time. I have your authority,
                  and shall prevent it. I shall see you to-morrow morning, and meantime you will try
                  to rest?"
               He wrapped her up tenderly, and said,
               "I shall tell Constance you waited—no one will think there was any special reason
                  for your visit."
               "You think of every thing!"
               "All I want is to think of something to give you a night's sleep."
               "And I haven't had one in so long—so long! Oh, those nights!"
               "Don't think of them; all that is ended now, and you can rest," he said. "Come,
                  now; I will put you in your carriage."
               She hesitated a little.
               "What is it, Alice?"
               "Oh, I can not say it! I haven't any words—"
               "It doesn't need saying, Alice."
               As he put his hand on hers to draw it through his arm, she bent her head and
                  pressed her lips on it with a feeling of such pure devotion as she had never felt
                  for any human being since the day when she could recollect her father's pardon for
                  some childish fault. She felt his strong frame quiver in every nerve, but he did
                  not speak.
               They went through the hall in silence, and he placed her in the carriage.
               "Good-night, now," he said. "You promise me to rest and sleep?"
               "Yes, and I think I can, too. I owe it to you; whatever peace my life may ever
                  find, I shall owe to you."
               She was driven away, back to the home she had left with such a frightful sensation
                  of having in the world no place of refuge. She entered it now with the feeling of
                  one who had seen an earthquake suddenly yawn before his feet, and when he seemed
                  about to be over-whelmed in the darkness the chasm closed, and the stars came out
                  in the heaven above.
               That night a merciful slumber without dreams locked her senses, so long stranger
                  to them, and gave her new strength to meet the waking and the new day which must
                  come.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               CÆSAR'S CONFESSION.
               So these first days dragged by for Milly. There were useless discussions between
                  herself and her aunt, endless reproaches and complaints, which threatened to end
                  in destroying all affection between the two.
               Milly was determined to be brave and show no wound. She saw every one who visited
                  at the house, and forced herself to appear the same as usual. She laughed and
                  talked so gayly, and played her part so well, that the world went away completely
                  puzzled, and almost inclined to believe that she had had matters her own way where
                  Kenneth Halford was concerned. But the reaction when she was once more alone was
                  terrible. It was well for her that spring had come and the festivities of winter
                  were nearly over, and people busy preparing to get away from town, or the strain
                  upon her nerves would have broken her down completely. As it was, they were worn
                  to the most acutely sensitive state; the sudden opening of a door made her spring
                  from her chair; a loud voice would give her a headache which lasted for hours. She
                  was obliged to see Mrs. Lawrence; for, notwithstanding Mrs. Remsen's lecture, the
                  little woman was so conscience-stricken about Milly that she actually made her way
                  into her presence one day when she had met the belligerent aunt in the street, and
                  knew she might enter the house in comparative safety.
               "Oh, Milly, little Milly!" she exclaimed, beginning to cry at once, "I am so
                  sorry; I never meant you any harm, believe me. I just thought it fun, and I have
                  quarreled with Paul Andrews, and I've told every one you didn't go; and if you
                  did, it was without knowing whose dinner it was; and I wish my feet had been cut
                  off before I did it;" and here she broke down, and Milly had to comfort her—it was
                  the first sincere sympathy the poor child had met with.
               "Dear Mrs. Lawrence, you have done nothing; I don't care about these ill-natured
                  reports."
               "Yes, but I've ruined your happiness; your engagement is broken off."
               "But not on that account. It was all my own doing. Mr. Halford did not even know
                  of the dinner until afterward."
               Mrs. Lawrence brightened wonderfully, and very soon was offering protestations of
                  friendship for the future without stint.
               "I wish you would be my guest at Newport this summer for a nice long visit; I'm
                  sure your aunt must be horrid cross just now. Won't you promise, dear?"
               But Milly had no desire for gayety; moreover, she would not have chosen to trust
                  herself to Mrs. Lawrence's care, even if her aunt would be willing—a thing not
                  probable.
               "If ever I can help you, dearest little Milly, you may he sure I will. I declare,
                  if I should die before you are married, I'll leave you all the money I can will
                  away from my husband's relatives—see if I don't!"
               Milly assured her that she much preferred her continuing to live, and made her
                  laugh at the droll speeches under which she was learning to conceal her
                  suffering.
               "I do wish you would come and see me; but I don't suppose your aunt would let
                  you," said Mrs. Lawrence.
               "No, I suppose not," Milly said, frankly.
               "Well, I can't blame her. Of course, she is furious about your losing such a
                  chance, and blames every body concerned; but you are not angry with me, little
                  Milly; you are sure you are not?"
               "Indeed I am not, dear Mrs. Lawrence; I think you are as kind-hearted as it is
                  possible to be, and I like you very much."
               "You are a little darling!" cried she. "I just wish you were my own niece; you
                  should break as many engagements as you pleased; you would be so nice to have
                  always near one."
               Milly thought of her own temper and bitter feelings of late, and was heartily
                  ashamed to be the recipient of so much praise; but Mrs. Lawrence would not hear a
                  word to gainsay her own opinion.
               "I like you so much more than any young lady I ever knew," she said. "If you
                  should ever need a friend, do promise to come to me. I suppose I must go now. If
                  your Aunt Remsen found me with you she would be furious; but I was quite
                  determined to see you."
               "And you must go away feeling that you have never done me any harm," said
                  Milly.
               "That will be a great comfort, and you really don't look unhappy. People think me
                  frivolous and silly; but I do love you, and can understand you. I used to be a
                  different sort of woman once—indeed I
                  did!" She sighed, and the tears came into her eyes; tears for some faded romance
                  in her younger days; but she was too cheerful really to repine.
               "The Lord knows when I shall see you again," she said. "I am going down to the
                  Island soon, my dear. Keep up your courage, and remember what I have said."
               She kissed Milly a dozen times, repeating every sort of extravagant proffer, and
                  went away greatly relieved in her kind heart and mind. Then, before many days
                  foolish young Charley Thorne must needs present himself to Milly, and, after many
                  pretexts and transparent evasions, pour out his tender story.
               "Oh, Miss Milly, it wasn't for any of these things that I came—you know it wasn't!
                  I love you so—I have always loved you! I was broken-hearted when I heard you were
                  engaged to Mr. Halford; but they say you have sent him off. Miss Milly, I came to
                  ask you to care for me a little—to marry me, and let me try to make you
                  happy."
               Milly was overcome with remorse when she remembered how, in her recklessness and
                  anger with another, she had led this young man on to love her, forgetting that it
                  might be sad earnest to him.
               "I am so sorry, oh! so sorry," she faltered.
               He looked in her face and saw the sympathy there, but nothing more. He was not
                  brilliant or deep, but he really loved her in his boyish, impetuous way, and his
                  love made him clear-sighted enough to understand now that he had no hope.
               "You mean you can't care for me," he said. "I know what being sorry means! Oh,
                  Miss Milly, don't you think you ever could?"
               "Never, Charley, never, I'm quite sure; but I wouldn't have grieved you for the
                  world."
               "Never mind all that," said he, bravely, "only I did so hope; I couldn't help it,
                  you know. For all they said you were engaged, you were so kind and pleasant that I
                  was fool enough to think perhaps you did like me a little, and had been drawn into
                  that other affair against your wishes."
               He said this without having the least idea how his words reproached Milly, making
                  her see her coquetry in an entirely new light—as an absolute sin against that
                  other young heart.
               "I wish you could feel differently about it, Milly; I'm rich, you know, and I'd
                  try so hard to make you happy."
               "Don't, Charley; please don't."
               "I won't say another word if it pains you, Milly. What makes you look so sad and
                  changed? People say you are gayer than ever since Halford went away, but I can see
                  you are not at all the same."
               His love gifted the foolish fellow with new perceptions; he could feel that he
                  beheld another Milly sitting there, very unlike the girl with whom he had danced
                  and made merry, though he could not have explained his thought.
               "I'll tell you what, Milly," he exclaimed, suddenly. "If that fellow Halford has
                  treated you ill, I'll follow him to the ends of the earth and punch his head. I
                  always did hate him."
               He looked eager to be dispatched on the journey at once, and Milly hastened to set
                  his mind at rest.
               "No one has treated me ill, dear Charley; but I have behaved shamefully to you,
                  and I ask your pardon for it."
               "Now, don't," he stammered. "You'll have me making a fool of myself in a minute,
                  and I mustn't do that. Oh, Milly, I wish you could love me! I'm twenty-one now; my
                  fortune is all my own, and I know if you don't marry me I shall get into no end of
                  scrapes, and perhaps ruin myself."
               "Don't say so, Charley, for that would make me very unhappy."
               "Would it—would it, really now?"
               "Indeed, indeed it would!"
               "Then I'll do no such thing. I'll be as steady as a light-house. I'll not spree,
                  even if the fellows do call me a muff," cried Charley, bravely. "I wish I only had
                  a regularly good head-piece— I'd— I'd do something so grand and magnificent that
                  you'd be glad to love me. But I'm good for nothing," sighed honest Charley,
                  "unless it's at getting up tableaux and playing billiards, and they're no good,
                  you know. A fellow can't go about making a picture of himself, or being like that
                  French chap—what's-his-name—that'll send a billiard-ball clear round a corner and
                  bring it back to pocket."
               Milly looked at him and listened; he seemed so very young, years and years younger
                  than herself in her experience and distress; and she envied him his youth and
                  freshness, even his folly.
               "And you are sure you couldn't care for me?" persisted Charley.
               "Only as a sister might, Charley; in that way I care a great deal for you, and
                  always shall."
               "Yes, that's nice," said Charley, doubtfully. "It's what women always say to the
                  men they won't marry. Oh dear! I'm sure I don't know what to do with my life—it's
                  an awful bore, you know! You see I have been building a sort of
                  chateau—what-do-you-call-it?—I never could remember the French word; and now its
                  tumbled about my ears, and I stand like—the fellow among the ruins of Carthage,
                  you know," said Charley, with dramatic effect, recalling the simile from some
                  long-forgotten school-book.
               "But you will try and get over it soon, Charley, and find out how much better it
                  is for you, and cease to care for me in that way."
               "Maybe so," said Charley, ruefully; "so does a fellow get over the toothache, but
                  it hurts deucedly while it lasts."
               Here was Charley Thorne attempting comparisons and being imaginative; but Milly
                  was too sick at heart to smile at his oddities or blunders. She had to send him
                  away convinced vinced at last; but when it came to parting he grew desperate, and
                  nearly blubbered.
               "I never thought I should wish to use my new revolver except for fun," sighed he;
                  "but I'd like to, now."
               He was so dismally in earnest, that Milly's self-reproaches and sorrow for his
                  pain would not permit her to get impatient with the poor boy.
               "Well," cried he at last, "I must say goodbye!" You've made my life a blank, Miss
                  Milly, but it isn't your fault! I feel just like the man in Tennyson, you know— 
                     
                        'Oh, my Amy, mine no more—
                        Oh, the barren, barren moor-land!
                        Oh, the dreary, dreary shore!'
                     
                   Only I don't think you're false or shallow, you know; but I'm sure Broadway
                  and the Avenue will be a desert to me now, and the Park a deal more lonesome than
                  any moor-land."
               He got as far as the door, but had to come back; it was all cruelly serious with
                  him, and he was suffering to the full extent of his capacity. He kissed Milly's
                  hands, quoted more Tennyson, slapped his forehead as he had seen Edwin Booth do in
                  a play, and then he flung himself out of the room.
               As ill-luck would have it, he met Mrs. Remsen in the hall, and as keeping his
                  emotions secret was not an art in which Charley excelled, he was fain to tell her
                  his troubles, and his determination of doing something desperate, before Milly had
                  begged him not.
               Mrs. Remsen was seized with an idea. Why should not Milly take possession of this
                  silly boy and his half-million, and bring him up reasonably? Plenty of girls would
                  have accepted him thankfully. If Milly only would do so, every thing might be
                  arranged, and Mrs. Remsen's anxieties at rest. She contented herself with telling
                  Charley that young women often changed their minds, and that he must not consider
                  all at an end and lose courage. "Faint heart never won fair lady."
               "That's what the play says. Mary Gannon used to do the boy so well in it," said
                  Charley; "but I don't know about it. Milly might do exactly what she pleased with
                  me; I'd never cross her—such a pony-carriage as she should have! I wouldn't even
                  let the dogs into the house if it bothered her;" and after this concession Charley
                  felt that masculine devotion could go no further.
               "I am sure you would be a kind husband," Mrs. Remsen said, determined, under the
                  influence of her new idea, not to see that he was a fool.
               Charley was flattered by the praise, and took himself off less burdened with black
                  despair, though he went along the street muttering,
               "I feel like Mariana in the 'Moated Grange,' by Jove! 
                     
                        'She only said, "My life is dreary;
                        He cometh not," she said;
                        She said, 'I am aweary, aweary,
                        I would that I were dead!"'
                     
                   That's it, for all she wasn't a fellow; it just expresses it."
               He thought of numberless self-pitying and pathetic bits of poetry, and went
                  resolutely home to be miserable over his woes, in spite of meeting Jack Norris and
                  Harry Colville, and other choice spirits of his own calibre, who tried to lure him
                  into Phelan's for billiards, or Delmonico's for luncheon.
               Charley Thorne shook them off impatiently. Billiards, he said, were "a drug;" food
                  was "disgusting." Even the sight of a wonderful little black-and-tan dog Jack
                  Norris had gave him no pleasure, and Harry Colville's stunning trowsers and
                  gorgeous scarf failed to awaken envy in his soul.
               "There's a gulf between me and them," said Charley to himself, as he trudged
                  through Union Square; "a gulf they can't bridge over, except with Byron's 'Bridge
                  of Sighs,' by Jupiter! I know just how those chaps used to feel when they went
                  over it. I shall go out of town; maybe I'd better go back to Europe; that's what
                  the fellows always do in English novels—rush over to the 'Continent.' I wonder why
                  the rest of Europe isn't the Continent as well as Paris, for it's always just
                  going to Paris they mean by it. Oh dear, I'm very wretched! If I was to go and see
                  those terrier-pups to-day; but I sha'n't; I've no heart for any thing now. There
                  goes Tom Sora; and it's Lydia Mason walking with him, and they look so happy—Oh I
                  hate them—I hate the whole world; I wish I was dead!"
               Charley banged his hat down over his eyes, and strode home, as miserable in his
                  own way as more rational and broader-minded people are in theirs.
               Mrs. Remsen was at the same time advising Milly to marry Charley Thorne, and Milly
                  was so outraged that she seemed to have reached the crowning moment of her
                  humiliation and misery.
               "I begin to believe, Aunt Remsen, that you would sell me, body and soul," she
                  said. "I marry that boy, that baby without an idea in his head!"
               "But he is so rich; he would be very kind; he is good looking, and of good family.
                  Many a girl would be glad enough to get him."
               "Let them take him, I beg."
               "I never saw a girl throw away her life and prospects as you do! You would not
                  marry Halford, a man of mind and brain; you won't marry Charley Thorne, because he
                  is a fool. In Heaven's name, what would you wish to have?"
               "I wish for nothing, Aunt Remsen, except to be left alone."
               "You'll not have offers of marriage every day! I never knew so lucky a girl, or
                  one who so recklessly rejected her chances."
               "Aunt Eliza, would you like to see me marry Charley Thorne? Answer honestly."
               "I know twenty girls who would be only too rejoiced to do it," she answered,
                  evasively.
               "I have not a feeling in common with him; he could no more share my thoughts than I could understand Hebrew."
               "Oh! if you are going to talk like Hortense, I have done. Having genius, and soul,
                  and inward yearnings for congeniality, and Heaven knows what other nonsense, may
                  be all very well for a young lady with a fortune; but when she has hardly a penny
                  of her own, I call such things downright wicked, and if they don't bring a
                  judgment on your head I shall wonder."
               Mrs. Remsen reproached Milly bitterly; but I suppose she would have been sorry to
                  see her sacrificed in this way. At the moment, all she could think of seemed to be
                  the madness of deliberately throwing away a half-million of money.
               "You could be married at once," she said; "and that would put an end to all the
                  stories about you. Charley would take you to Europe immediately. Why, he would be
                  a perfect slave to any whim of yours."
               "And the sin, Aunt Remsen—the wickedness of marrying a man whom I could not love
                  nor even respect, whose weakness I must indeed despise. You say nothing of
                  these."
               "And you, you think nothing of repaying my long years of affection with
                  ingratitude; of the wickedness of making one a skeleton with anxiety about your
                  future. You don't think of these things in this moment of delicacy and religious
                  scruples."
               This series of excitements, following in such rapid succession, was killing little
                  Milly. She wrung her hands, and burst into a torrent of despairing tears that
                  frightened Mrs. Remsen, who knew better than any one how terribly her nerves had
                  been tried.
               "I shall say no more," she continued, "though I don't know how we are to get on
                  this summer; I feel as poor as a church-mouse. What I can afford must be spent
                  upon Maud, and we must economize."
               "I want nothing, Aunt Remsen—nothing but rest."
               "As for keeping the governess, I think it a useless expense this summer," pursued
                  Mrs. Remsen. "What with some money I have lost, and all that I have spent upon
                  your winter, so certain was I of your doing well, that I feel quite penniless for
                  the present."
               "I will teach the children, do any thing for them, as I have told you. Let me go
                  down into the country; I shall be so glad to get away. I can take the children,
                  and that will be an economy. You will be able to go with Maud to a
                  watering-place."
               "I am in a nice state of mind for society," sighed Mrs. Remsen; "you have so
                  dispirited me. How can I tell that Maud will not behave in the same way—fly in the
                  face of Heaven just as her good luck is all accomplished and ready to accept?"
               Milly might have added that she hoped that Maud would not have all her hopes
                  blighted when they looked most blooming, her faith in human nature, her trust in
                  life, almost her belief in the goodness of God, shaken to its foundation by a blow
                  from the very hand which had promised to make existence brighter and more
                  beautiful. But she had grown shy of giving utterance to her feelings, even before
                  her aunt. So Milly remained silent.
               "Perhaps you think Maud's future of little consequence," said Mrs. Remsen.
               "Indeed, Aunt Remsen, I was thinking a great deal about it, and hoping that it
                  might be bright and pleasant."
               "There shall be no more nonsense," said her aunt, forcibly; "on this I am
                  determined. I have learned to my cost what romance and poetical feelings lead
                  to."
               Milly shivered at her aunt's harsh tone; Mrs. Remsen had imagination enough to
                  understand Milly somewhat; but, after all, when one is vexed and disappointed it
                  is very difficult to be generous, and one is prone to lose respect for romance and
                  poetry when they stand in the way of getting one's youthful charges successfully
                  settled in the world.
               The time that Mrs. Remsen had named for leaving town was the first week in May,
                  and it arrived at last, although to Milly it had seemed that the day would never
                  come. Matters had been more definitely arranged between aunt and niece, and the
                  actual dislike which seemed at one time imminent was gradually passing from their
                  minds. Milly had promised to be governess to the little girls, and Rob was to be
                  sent to boarding-school. No more holiday life for Milly; she felt she must be
                  useful, since she had so lamentably failed in the ornamental part, and wished to
                  make all the amends in her power.
               Maud was horribly disappointed and disagreeable when she was made aware of the
                  plans in contemplation for the summer, and she rebelled with an explosion of
                  wrath, as loud as she dared make it in her mother's presence, mingled with
                  premonitions of the avalanche of reproach which would fall on Milly's devoted head
                  at the first convenient opportunity.
               "Go into the country now, and to stay, and at that horrid poky place I have always
                  so hated!" cried the young lady. "And you promised me that I should go to Newport;
                  you know you did, mamma!"
               "But you wouldn't care to go there before August?"
               "I shall die of stupidity in the country. I know I shall," moaned Maud. "Not a
                  soul to speak to that one cares about—oh dear! oh dear!"
               Just then she was seized with a brilliant thought. Adelaide was good-natured to
                  her, when it did not interfere with her own comfort, and Mr. Ramsay was always so.
                  Maud felt confident that, if she bemoaned her fate in his hearing with sufficient
                  clamor to penetrate the abstraction in which he passed the time out of business
                  hours, he would bid Adelaide snatch her from the impending fate. So, when the
                  process of packing for the journey commenced, Miss Maud arrayed herself and
                  departed to her brother-in-law's mansion, looking like Niobe, just before the
                  process of petrifying that damp and unhappy female. She was so fortunate as to
                  find Mr. Ramsay at home, as she expected, for it was near the dinner hour; and
                  what was equally satisfactory, her sister Adelaide was in an unusually good humor,
                  as she had coaxed her husband into giving her a lovely brooch and ear-rings that
                  day.
               "I have come to dinner," announced Miss Maud; "and I am as miserable as I can
                  possibly be."
               Mr. Ramsay came out of his brown study, and nodded pleasantly, as he had only
                  heard the first part of her announcement, relapsing immediately into
                  abstraction.
               "Great bear!" thought Maud; "I'd like to pinch you into a little feeling!"
               Adelaide displayed her jewelry for Maud, and she was forced to admire it in spite
                  of the bitterness in her soul, for fear of the consequences; but she took the
                  earliest occasion to begin the recital of her wrongs, and Adelaide grew more
                  amiable than ever, after roundly abusing poor little Milly.
               "I'd rather die, Adelaide, than be buried in the country. I think mamma is
                  downright cruel, and, as for Milly, I quite begin to hate her."
               "She's horribly aggravating," returned Mrs. Ramsay; "it's all her fault, I'm sure,
                  and I wonder mamma has any patience with her."
               "If you were in my place you would go perfectly wild," pursued Maud. "Oh, I don't
                  know what I shall do!"
               She fretted and complained, occasionally glancing toward Mr. Ramsay; but his
                  thoughts were full of some Western railway stock that had risen astonishingly in
                  the market that morning, and he did not even remember that she was in the room. At
                  last Maud began to weep; she bubbled and trickled like a mountain brook, and
                  distressed Adelaide, because such noisy grief interfered with her comfort; but the
                  desired effect was at length attained. Mr. Ramsay heard, came out of his
                  meditations, and exclaimed,
               "Heyday, pussy, what in the world is the matter?"
               Maud only sobbed the louder, and Adelaide said,
               "She's in despair at having to go down to the country place; and mamma is so
                  discouraged by Milly's horrid conduct that she has no spirits left for any thing
                  else."
               "You don't want to go into the country, pussy?" said Mr. Ramsay, kindly.
               "Oh, it's horrid!" sobbed Maud; "it's enough to kill any one."
               "Well, well, don't cry so; you'll spoil your pretty eyes! Stay with us; Adelaide
                  can take you to Saratoga, and then you can go with her to Newport, too. Don't
                  cry!"
               Maud was in an ecstasy of delight; this was better than she had dared even to
                  hope. Adelaide, being softened by Maud's judicious admiration of herself and her
                  new jewels, and animated by a desire to punish Milly by the contrast, entered into
                  the scheme with sufficient satisfaction. Maud went home in delight, and informed
                  her mother of her good fortune, and Mrs. Remsen was almost as glad as her daughter
                  at the turn affairs had taken.
               "I shall go to Adelaide at once," said Maud. "I can do no good here, can I,
                  mamma?"
               "None in the least," Mrs. Remsen replied, truthfully enough. "You had better get
                  your trunks packed, and go to-morrow. I can arrange with Adelaide to get you any
                  thing else you may need."
               So Maud escaped the discomforts and disagreeables of the last days one spends in a
                  house under such circumstances. It would have been a shadow upon that gentle young
                  person's happiness if she could have known how much Milly was relieved by her
                  departure, and with what satisfaction she looked forward to the quiet of the
                  country, undisturbed by her cousin's uncongenial presence; but Maud, feeling sure
                  that Milly must be wretched over the contrast to her good luck and anticipated
                  summer of content, departed in the full tide of bliss.
               Mrs. Remsen, Milly, and the children went down into the country; but, before their
                  departure, a revelation was made to Milly, which somewhat softened the fierce
                  anger and sense of injury that had helped her to keep up a show of courage.
               Cæsar, the coffee-colored, was going, as he always did in the summer, to coin gold
                  at a watering-place, and lord it as head waiter over more humble and deeper-tinged
                  companions in labor. The evening before his departure he asked for an interview
                  with Milly. Cæsar's dark-hued conscience had awakened; he knew very well what had
                  happened to Milly, as servants always do know the troubles in the family, and
                  Cæsar took remorse to himself in the affair of the note which his young mistress
                  had given him, and which had lain for so many days forgotten in the recesses of
                  Julius Hannibal's treacherous pocket, that the two ebony idiots decided that it
                  was of no use whatever then to deliver it. Cæsar could not make up his mind to
                  leave the house without confessing his guilt, for he cherished a chivalrous
                  devotion for Milly; but he put off his revelation, like a wise creature, until the
                  moment when it could do no possible good. He told his story with the
                  grandiloquence peculiar to his race, beginning with,
               "I little 'spected Miss Milly, that annoyings could ever reach you from any
                  resource where I was connected, but I trusted to friendship, and friendship has
                  proved a Gurgorious knot, which I had to cut distinctively."
               Cæsar wrote for an Ethiopian paper, and was a poet much admired among the select
                  circles in colored society where he moved. In consequence of this turn of mind,
                  his conversation was often so flowery and ornate, to say nothing of its peculiarity, that it was difficult to
                  discover his precise meaning, a difficulty not quite unheard of, however, in the
                  case of other poets. But he soon made himself clear enough for Milly's
                  comprehension by producing the unfortunate note, wrapped in tissue-paper and tied
                  with a pink ribbon, as he had laid it carefully aside after its recovery; and he
                  bowed before Milly, as he presented it, with a contrite air which would have made
                  the fortune of a "negro minstrel," if it could only have been reproduced in its
                  perfection.
               Milly had no thought of reproving him—where would be the good of doing so now? She
                  took the billet, told Cæsar that it was not of the slightest importance, and
                  thanked him for his honesty, though it had come somewhat too late.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               OVERREACHING HIMSELF.
               SEVERAL days elapsed before John Worthington could see Faulkner, for business had
                  called him out of town. During this time Worthington did not go to Mrs. Marchmont.
                  He knew that his presence would only be a pain until he could tell her that the
                  matter was definitely arranged. He wrote her a kind letter, begging her to feel no
                  uneasiness, and she rested upon that assurance. At length he grew tired of the
                  waiting himself—at least, he could not bear the idea of her suffering this
                  suspense any longer. She received another note—he had gone to Washington in search
                  of the man.
               Dick Faulkner's schemes at this juncture had led him further than he contemplated,
                  and he was at the capital, hoping to gain private information as to the way
                  certain bills before Congress would turn, in order that he might strike some grand
                     coup in stocks, and relieve himself from his
                  present embarrassment—the first check which he had met since he commenced his bold
                  operations. Worthington was in a position to do him great harm in the opinions of
                  the honorable members and senators whom he wished to reach; and his arrival, and
                  the fact that Mrs. Marchmont had actually revealed the whole truth, was an
                  unexpected blow.
               There was a private meeting between the two men; and, before it ended, John
                  Worthington gave the coward a secret to guard on his own account, for he shook him
                  until he was black in the face; and probably, since the days of his boyhood, Dick
                  Faulkner had never received so thorough a chastisement. It grew out of his
                  venturing to sneer at Mrs. Marchmont when irritated by Worthington's cool
                  assumption of a right to claim the note.
               "You couldn't swear it was yours; you couldn't deny, if it came to a trial, that
                  the woman was a forger," he said.
               "There is no possibility that any such question should arise," Mr. Worthington
                  answered, with ominous composure. "There may be a trial, but it will be against
                  you. Mrs. Marchmont gave a promissory note to the man Hermans, with my indorsement
                  on the back—"
               "A forged indorsement!" broke in Dick.
               "When she went to take it up," pursued Worthington, more quietly than ever, "she
                  found that you had stolen it."
               "I paid the money."
               "Exactly; but you represented yourself as her agent—exhibited a letter which
                  Hermans will swear you said was written by her the day before, to give you the
                  authority for action. Miss Portman will swear that this letter was written months
                  previous, and referred to an entirely different business. The case is a very clear
                  one, Mr. Faulkner; I shall have the pleasure of conducting it myself."
               Dick Faulkner began to have the look of a feline animal driven into a corner.
               "Also, in connection with that case there will be brought up another," continued
                  John Worthington. "Since your arrival here, you and your agents have been guilty
                  of an attempt at bribery of certain members of Congress for the furtherance of a
                  bill you want carried through."
               "I never offered a penny to one of them."
               "I am aware of that; but promises to secure them a share in your gains, and an
                  offer to make your word good in advance, constitute bribery just the same."
               Faulkner attempted to bluster, but the effort was so signal a failure that he
                  recognized its absurdity, and said, sullenly,
               "Well, what do you want?"
               "To take up the note with my name on the back, which you obtained under false
                  pretenses, and give you my check for the amount."
               Faulkner pulled the bill out of his pocket, received the check in exchange, and
                  might have escaped further humiliation had he been able to restrain his
                  tongue.
               "You've got the whip-hand of me," said he, with a malicious grin. "You're about
                  the shrewdest man I ever met, John Worthington, I'll own that! But there are some
                  things you can't set right. You can't make my lady an honest woman; you can't
                  hinder the fact that every time you look at her you will remember she's a forger;
                  you can't prevent her knowing you think it, or help her forget that she came near
                  being my—"
               He never finished that sentence. Then it was that he found himself clutched in
                  Worthington's nervous arms, and, though a strong man himself, lifted bodily like a
                  child, and flung on the floor in the struggle. I am happy to add that John
                  Worthington also so far forgot his habitual control as to apply the toe of his
                  boot vigorously to the prostrate form. An account of a duel would have been more
                  dramatic, but not so pleasurable to narrate, nor so sore a punishment to the
                  dastardly wretch.
               The morning after this occurrence, Alice Marchmont sat waiting for her visitor
                  almost with such feelings as men of old must have waited for the coming of the
                  angels who sometimes visited them. I think the comparison is not too strong, nor
                  do I mean to be irreverent. It was the very thought in her mind. Could there
                  remain a hope that her repentance would prove effectual had the feeling been
                  less?
               He had saved her—this man whom she had been afraid to trust—saved her, and given
                  her back to life. She could see, too, that her sin was not so much against him as
                  against her own soul; but it was only now that she saw this. During those weeks of
                  blind anguish, her chief dread was in losing the respect and admiration of those
                  about her, and, worst, the idea that exposure would deprive her of his esteem and
                  friendship. It was horrible enough to be flung down from her place in the world—to
                  become the theme of gossip and execration; but to live without him was more
                  terrible.
               Now she was willing to accept her humiliation; she had not been brave enough to
                  confess her folly and obtain his aid; she had elected to commit the sin, and must
                  endure the expiation.
               She wondered, as she sat there, what life would be to her henceforth. She could
                  not take it up from the spot where this great trouble had made the break. In all
                  time to come, existence must be very different to her from any thing which had
                  gone before. But nothing was clear to her mind as yet; nothing beyond the
                  thankfulness, the penitence, the desire to be set right.
               So occupied was she with her reflections that John Worthington entered the room
                  before she was aware, and saw her face as it looked in her solitude—very pale
                  still, but with the restlessness and anxiety, the repression and fear quite gone
                  out of it—a purer, sweeter face than it had been in years. She did not rise; she
                  was feeble, as if after a long illness. She put out her hands in silence; he took
                  them in his own, and held them in that firm, gentle grasp which gave her a sense
                  of such protection.
               "It is all arranged," he said; "I must repeat what I wrote, so that we may be done
                  with the subject forever."
               "And you went after him—you saw him!"
               "Understand me," he said; "it is all over."
               "All over!" She whispered the words as a man might the sentence of his reprieve
                  coming when he was in sight of the scaffold.
               "Arranged without his even having the privilege of an evil thought, Alice; but I
                  told no untruths."
               "No, no; I am sure of that."
               "So it is over, and there is a whole new life before you."
               He sat down by her, and she looked at him with the trust and confidence which,
                  before these troublous times, had offered so beautiful a contrast to her
                  capricious moods with others.
               "And that is what I want to know about," she said. "I want to have a new life. I
                  think for a time I must go away. It will be better for me. I can't explain what I
                  mean. I sha'n't go just because I am ashamed to meet you and know what must be in
                  your thoughts; I would try to bear that—"
               She had spoken more and more slowly—could get no further.
               "Shall I show you one way to a new life?" he asked.
               "Yes; you will help me."
               She did not notice that his face had grown a little pale, and that his hand
                  trembled as it rested on her chair.
               "Will you be my wife, Alice?" he asked, softly.
               She looked at him for an instant, doubtful whether she could have heard
                  aright.
               "Will you be my wife?" he continued, "and let me shield you even from every sad
                  thought?"
               She never dreamed of the secret which had lain in his heart for years. She could
                  not imagine that the offer came from any other motive than his intense sympathy,
                  his great goodness. He was not content to have saved her; he was so anxious to
                  restore her to her own self-respect that he asked her to become his wife, hoping
                  thus to make her feel that she had not lost her claims to esteem. He would marry
                  her, and guard her happiness so carefully that never, by word or look, would he
                  betray what he suffered in remembering her past. But she could not accept the
                  sacrifice. It would be a sin blacker than her great crime. Yet she must not let
                  him perceive that she recognized it as a sacrifice, because then he would
                  overpower her by his arguments, and she was so weak that she might yield—all the
                  weaker that her heart yearned toward him as it had never done toward any other
                  man. She reached these conclusions with her usual rapidity, tired as she was, and,
                  when he attempted to continue, said, quickly,
               "Please don't say any more—not a word. I can not listen! Don't make me seem harsh
                  and ungrateful—I can't listen."
               The answer fell like a stroke of doom, and crushed the vague hope which had been
                  growing in his mind during these last days. His old supposition had been correct;
                  she cared for some one else. All he could do now was to spare her pain; hide his
                  trouble, bury the long-treasured secret more deeply in his soul, let her believe
                  that no sentiment stronger than sympathy had prompted his speech.
               "Since it pains you, Alice," he said, in an unfaltering voice, "I will never speak
                  of this again—never. You shall forget that I have mentioned it, or remember it
                  only to know how entirely you can trust my friendship."
               "I do know! I can't thank you. Oh, I am dumb—but I feel it—God bless you!"
               She was so much shaken and disturbed that he rose and went away at once. That
                  night he received a long letter from her, and two days after the gay world was
                  astonished by the news that she had sailed for Europe.
               
               So they parted; and close as each had been to reading the other's secret, no
                  perception of the truth struck either heart.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIII.
               BEARING HER BURDEN.
               MILLY and her aunt went away into the country, accompanied by the children—away to
                  a little place which was Milly's sole possession, and where they had been in the
                  habit of spending a few months of retirement almost every summer, in order to be
                  able to afford the expenses of the winter.
               Mrs. Remsen spoke vaguely of their "place" as a little nest, where she sought rest
                  and domestic felicity; and although these were not the reasons which took her
                  there, it was a spot in which one might have been well content, if in a mood to
                  enjoy the quiet loveliness of the surroundings. The house was not far from a
                  village that seemed always wrapped in a Rip Van Winkle sleep, with its small,
                  vine-covered dwellings, its pretty church and school, and all the appurtenances
                  that go to make up a well-regulated hamlet; not forgetting its shop, where the
                  farmers' wives from the vicinity brought their butter and eggs to sell, taking in
                  exchange all manner of bright-colored finery, to delight the eyes of their
                  daughters; and the quaint old inn, where the same set of seedy loungers gradually
                  grew more and more dilapidated as the years went by.
               The cottage was small; but it had a wide hall, a pretty parlor, with white
                  draperied windows, and a book and music room on one side, with shady bay-windows,
                  besides a great vine-covered porch. It had a smooth, sloping lawn in front, a
                  lovely pine wood at the back, and one might have played the misanthrope in such
                  quarters with tolerable resignation. The view from the porch was quietly lovely,
                  with a little river—a tributary of the Hudson—in the middle distance, cultivated
                  fields and bits of woodland on either side, and a range of blue-tinted hills
                  closing in the distance far away, beautiful and mysterious as distant hills must
                  always be.
               Mrs. Remsen pronounced herself fond of the country, but her idea of enjoying it
                  thoroughly was to have an immense house and constant flocks of visitors, so that
                  she never accepted the months at her hermitage save as a stern necessity. It had
                  always been pleasant enough here to Milly, though sometimes rather dull. In her
                  youthful heedlessness, she had not enjoyed to its full extent the peace which
                  Nature brings if we only seek her faithfully, and now she had lost the power to do
                  so.
               There they established themselves, and prepared to pass the summer; and what a
                  summer—what a dreadful summer to Milly in every way! She wondered how she lived
                  through it; but though the bloom wore out of her cheeks and the light out of her
                  eyes, her health would not quite fail. Her aunt had, in a great measure, ceased
                  her allusions to the past, but there was winter between their hearts, and each
                  blamed the other that it was so; and both were right, and both were wrong. Milly
                  kept to the strict letter of their agreement, but it was in the spirit which would
                  make one rush into martyrdom. She taught the children even, and she brought them
                  on well; but the duties that might have been made so pleasant were nearly
                  unendurable, and she almost hated herself and her charge sometimes. The children
                  were quick to understand this, and they complained of Milly's indifference; then
                  Aunt Eliza found fault in a frigid, conscientious way worse than her old
                  petulance, and Milly was impatient or sullen, and every thing was as bad as it
                  could be. I wish I could say that my poor Milly bore her woes in either a heroic
                  or an angelic manner; but she was only a very woman, suddenly come out of her
                  childhood, and so she could but be natural.
               The spring dragged heavily on into summer; the summer deepened to its prime, but
                  brought no change, no hope of peace to Milly, or relief to her aunt. Maud was
                  having a success at Newport with her sister. This was Mrs. Remsen's only
                  consolation; and she could not forbear reading bits from her letters to Milly, and
                  irritating her by hints of what she herself might have been enjoying, until the
                  poor girl was white and shivering with pain.
               Her aunt thought her wholly to blame now. She must have driven Halford away by her
                  caprices and bad temper. But, in truth, he was more in fault than Milly, as men
                  past their first youth always are when they want to marry a wife because she is
                  young and childish, and then get impatient with the faults growing out of the very
                  qualities they had desired, and forget that a girl who is capable of real, earnest
                  love is also capable of being gently led into a noble womanhood. They were all
                  wrong—just as we often are in this world; but Milly's trouble was hardest to bear,
                  because it was her first. As we grow older, we know that, however dark is the
                  night, it must surely pass at length, if it be only into a gray quiet like an
                  autumn afternoon.
               In first suffering we do not understand this. The first clouding of the sky, the
                  first obscuring of all beauty in life, is much more terrible than when later we
                  have grown somewhat accustomed to seeing our flowers fade, and our suns go down.
                  Ah! no matter what may come afterward—misery, ruin, even disgrace—there is nothing
                  so overwhelming as the first swoop of affliction upon the entirely undisciplined
                  heart.
               So they all struggled on after their different ways; Kenneth Halford looking back
                  into the past from his foreign wanderings, with a keen regret that deepened daily
                  as he found how difficult it was to take a new interest in life; Aunt Eliza
                  disgusted with young people generally; and Milly so rebellious that sorrow worked
                  no good in her nature.
               She chafed most because she could not with one wrench tear out the past from her
                  heart. She did not know that the pain from the sear of a healed wound is sometimes
                  more insupportable, with its dull aching, than the keenness of the first agony.
                  Twenty times each day she might say to herself that she scorned the memory of this
                  man who had wronged her—hated herself—the whole world; but then she raged inwardly
                  because she could not deny that she was intensely and entirely miserable. She was
                  in that state of mind when even sensible people do the most senseless things—sit
                  on the wet grass—stare at the moon at unholy hours—eat and drink dreadful things
                  at impossible seasons, or not eat at all; and when the physical system refuses
                  longer to bear this ill-treatment, added to the incessant hen-pecking of the soul,
                  and gives way and perishes, friends talk of their having died of a broken heart,
                  or some such malady of which rational human beings have no business whatever to
                  die.
               Poor Milly, with her changed face, her mournful eyes, and her dark, gloomy
                  thoughts! She had no faith left in mankind; she grew cynical, and discovered
                  falsehood in the most trivial action; could see no justice in heaven or on earth.
                  You who have left the freshness of your youth far behind you can perfectly
                  understand the different stages of suffering through which she passed. These were
                  the seasons when her crushed pride rose and helped her to loathe the recollection
                  of her brief dream; then days and days when she could summon neither pride nor
                  hatred—could only crouch down under the sharpness of her suffering, like a wounded
                  deer dying in its thicket. Then would follow periods almost of mental vacuity,
                  when she seemed only to vegetate; though all the time, through her apathy, she
                  could feel the dull ache of her trouble like a bodily pain that is deadened by
                  laudanum—the days were so long and dreary, the nights seemed endless. Either she
                  had not energy enough to stir except as her duties compelled her, or else she
                  rushed forth to walk mile after mile, until she actually sunk down from physical
                  prostration; but whether she was shut up in the house tortured by her own
                  reflections, or wearing her strength out by overfatigue, the pain never would
                  leave her heart.
               To some persons this may seem very silly, but it is dreadfully true,
                  notwithstanding. It is terrible for the young to suffer, and Milly's was real
                  suffering. It was no false sentiment, no romance from which she could recover, and
                  be then all the stronger and wiser. Hers had been the love that comes but once to
                  the heart, and which deforms and distorts the mind, or develops it to its fullest
                  beauty, according as one hears the happiness or trouble which it brings; and Milly
                  had not yet learned to bear hers wisely.
               A brief visit from Hortense was the only break in the monotony. She was on her
                  way, with a party of wise people, to visit the Mammoth Cave, and other marvels of
                  nature sufficiently grand to interest such lofty minds. She stopped at the cottage
                  for a few days, having arranged to rejoin her companions in a city farther west,
                  where they were to tarry for a time, in order that one of the professors might
                  illuminate the region by a course of his scientific lectures.
               Mrs. Remsen was divided between the pleasure of having some one to whom she could
                  talk freely, and annoyance at the extreme trouble such a guest would bring to the
                  small domestic staff; and Milly comforted herself by the remembrance that it might
                  have been worse if Adelaide Ramsay had chosen to come. Hortense was in the full
                  tide of a flood of botany and geology, and quite determined to turn these few days
                  to account, that she might astonish her intellectual companions when she should
                  rejoin them. If she had chanced to be in a poetical mood, she would have
                  expatiated upon the loveliness of nature, the glory of the hills, the poetry of
                  the flowers; but, in her present mania, she only saw in the hills and rocks
                  materials to be chipped with a little hammer she carried in her pocket, and she
                  made cruel havoc among all the blossoms within her reach to get at their hearts
                  and their anatomy, and called them divers learned and unpleasant sounding names,
                  which seemed adding insult to injury. She dragged Milly about with her on her
                  expeditions; and while Hortense pounded at the rocks, convinced that every hard
                  and particularly ugly stone contained some wonderful mineral, or depopulated the
                  gardens and fields of flowers and mosses, Milly sat perfectly unconscious of the
                  stream of eloquence and wisdom poured out in her hearing, gazing always at the
                  blue hills in the distance with a weary longing and unrest.
               Hortense, like many people with great minds, always declared that she never cared
                  about what she ate; but her little requirements in this way nearly drove the
                  servants crazy, and irritated Mrs. Remsen exceedingly; while Milly was obliged to
                  spend half her days sewing up rips and torn places in their visitors' gowns, for
                  she had no idea of making a guy of herself in stout ugly garments, even if she
                  were strong-minded and given to ologies.
               "I could pass my whole life here," Hortense said, again and again, with
                  enthusiasm. "Here one could study in quiet, and feel one's mind expand
                  undisturbed."
               "I am sure you quite grumbled when you were a girl and obliged to come here,"
                  retorted Mrs. Remsen one day, when she was not in a mood to listen with patience
                  to her daughter's raptures. Hortense did not choose to notice the remark.
               "But, alas!" she went on, "there is so much else that it is one's duty to do. I
                  take my hours of study usually from my time for repose; I must live in the bustle
                  of the world because I can do the most good there."
               Mrs. Remsen quietly left the room; her stock of patience grew daily more threadbare; and when
                  Hortense began wildly galloping her hobby it was better to retreat. Milly was
                  sitting in the open window; the morning lessons were over, and she had some
                  needle-work in her lap; but her hands were idle, her eyes fixed on the distant
                  hills.
               "Milly," said Hortense, "I see a great change in you."
               "I am in perfect health," returned Milly, impatiently. "Now don't begin to fancy
                  there is any thing the matter with me."
               "You mistake," explained Hortense; "I meant a change in your mind; I see an
                  altered soul look out of your eyes."
               "Oh, Hortense, I can't feel either poetical or metaphysical, I warn you."
               "You ought to turn all your trouble to a proper use—"
               "I have no trouble," interrupted Milly. "Two or three times you have talked to me
                  as if I were a broken-hearted Letitia Landon; please to understand that I am
                  nothing of the sort."
               "Milly, Milly, don't grow hard and commonplace!"
               "Oh, but I quite wish to," said Milly; "it is the only way to go comfortably
                  through the world."
               "Occupy your mind," cried Hortense; "study—think—enlarge your soul and your
                  intellect."
               "That is all very well for you who have not a care in the world. If you were to
                  teach those children, I fancy you would be quite tired enough each day without
                  attempting learned studies."
               "Don't mention your petty cares," said Mrs. Pierson with scorn. "Look at my life.
                  Do I ever have an hour to myself? I attend to my hospitals, my schools, and my
                  societies, but I also find time for intellectual improvement."
               "Well, I don't care about it," returned Milly, shortly.
               Hortense lifted her hands in horror.
               "I knew Maud was an idiot, and Adelaide not much better," she exclaimed; "but I
                  did think that, under all your girlish frivolity, there was a soul which would
                  sooner or later rouse itself."
               "I am sorry to disappoint you, Hortense; I dare say I am an idiot, too; but what
                  difference does it make?"
               "Difference!" sighed Hortense; "think! oh, think! Life is forever; we pass from
                  one cycle of existence to another; we grow higher, and nobler, and purer! Let us
                  begin here the work of wisdom that must go on through the endless cycles of
                  Eternity!"
               "That is the worst of it," said Milly, in a dreary voice; "forever!"
               "What do you mean, Milly?"
               "Forever, you know; you said it. It's hard enough to live this life, but to think
                  that there will never be an end—that we must live on and on. Oh, I would rather
                  have been a stone!"
               "Are you a heathen, Milly?" questioned Hortense, looking at her quite aghast.
               "I wish I was," said Milly; "they have a Juggernaut that kills one; ours rolls and
                  crushes us, and leaves us still alive."
               "It is wicked. Milly, to say such things. You might as well be an atheist as to
                  talk like that!"
               But Milly was in one of those moods when neither religious teachings nor good
                  example can keep us from indulging in useless, impious thought, and Hortense
                  possessed no eloquence which could bring her out of that state of mind.
               "I don't see that it matters much whether we are wicked or good," said Milly. "We
                  have nothing but trouble all the same."
               "But trouble is good for the soul," pursued Hortense, grandly. "It makes it grow
                  and widen. Used aright, it is a magic wand that opens for us the doors which lead
                  into the very heart of Nature's mysteries."
               Milly listened to Mrs. Pierson's mixed metaphors with intense irritation, not to
                  say disgust. It was easy enough for her to talk—this woman who had never known a
                  real trouble—whose queer, old, learned husband was her slave—whose whole life was
                  sunshiny and pleasant.
               "She's a greater fool than the other two," thought Milly, "though she does speak
                  five languages, reads Arabic, and knows Humboldt by heart. Her learning has only
                  made her more shallow."
               "Suffering!" pursued Hortense. "Why, Milly, it is grand to suffer."
               "I'm sure you know nothing about it," retorted Milly. "Keep to your books and your
                  sciences, Hortense—you are quite at home there; but when it comes to trouble, you
                  are no more competent to speak than I am to teach Sanscrit."
               Hortense was stupefied with amazement at the idea of there being any subject upon
                  which she could not speak like one inspired.
               "Milly," said she, compassionately, "you are growing cynical and ill-natured; you
                  used to be a perfect little sunbeam; I don't know you any more."
               Milly felt the old choking in her throat, and caught up her work and began sewing
                  industriously.
               "I suppose it is the precursor of old-maidism," she answered, trying to laugh, and
                  feeling sorry that she had snubbed Hortense, who was at all events kind, and
                  always good-natured.
               "Do you mean to be an old maid?" inquired her cousin, here taking another tack at
                  once.
               "Yes, very likely."
               "Why don't you become a Sister of Charity?" cried Hortense, with enthusiasm. "You
                  have no taste for books; you could never adopt one of the learned professions; but
                  you could give up your life to duty, and go about like a ministering angel among
                  poor humanity."
               "I don't think I care enough about humanity to wish to help it much," replied
                  Milly, stitching away industriously.
               "You are an enigma," said Hortense; "I will own it, you puzzle even me!"
               "If I puzzle you more than I do myself, I am astonished," thought Milly, as she
                  worked on.
               Hortense was silent for a few moments, pulling a number of flowers in pieces and
                  strewing their leaves upon the carpet. Like many persons troubled with a love for
                  hobbies of all sorts, she was not always tidy in the pursuit. Just now her mania
                  was quite distressing; the carpets never were clean, and one stumbled over bits of
                  rock and fossils in all sorts of places where they had no business. She looked at
                  Milly as if she had been some species of remarkable flower that she could neither
                  classify nor comprehend, and this state of mind was very unusual with Mrs.
                  Pierson, priding herself as she did upon her ability to read character.
               "You would be an interesting study, Milly," said she, presently, in a meditative
                  way. "I wish Mrs. Tonguay could be with you for a time. Mental peculiarities are
                  quite her forte."
               "Do you think me like a musty old botany book, that any one may peep into at
                  will?" said she: "or that I can be chipped at, and so made to reveal myself, as
                  you do the rocks, by the aid of any body's hammer?"
               "Don't be violent, Milly; always restrain yourself in discussion. Dear me, how odd
                  you have grown!"
               Milly threw down her work and passed out on the lawn, repeating Hortense's words
                  to herself. Odd, indeed—strangest of all, to herself—and the worse thing was, that
                  nothing would ever bring her old self back, nothing could ever set the crooked
                  life straight.
               "Nothing!" said Milly, again and again; "nothing!"
               She looked up at the clear summer sky, with its masses of fleecy white clouds
                  sailing away toward the zenith, afar off to the misty hills, and her very soul
                  sickened within her. The light wind stirred the maple boughs, and shook fragrance
                  from the hearts of the blossoming flowers; the sun shone golden and soft; the day
                  was balmy and beautiful; but there was no power in the brightness which could warm
                  Milly's heart, no spell in the calmness of the afternoon that could quiet her
                  wounds. Very soon the children came out and espied her, and made multifarious
                  requests, with which she complied, but there was no pleasure in it; she had as
                  happiness as of old in gratifying them, only the determination to do her duty, and
                  in the most uncompromising way.
               "Cousin Milly," said little Dora, suddenly, when the wrinkle in her little French
                  costume had been set smooth, "why don't you act as if you loved me any more?"
               "What a foolish question!" said Milly.
               "No it isn't, cousin! Last winter you used to play with us, and come into the
                  nursery to show us how beautiful you were in your ball-dresses, and we loved you
                  ever so; but now you never play with us, and you never tell us fairy stories. Why
                  don't you?"
               The words came at a moment when they touched Milly. She leaned her head on the
                  child's flaxen curls and wept piteously; tears which did her more good than any
                  she had shed for a long time, seeming to wash away a little of the bitterness from
                  her soul.
               "Don't cry, Cousin Milly," pleaded Dora, frightened at this unexpected response to
                  her childish expostulations. "I didn't mean any thing; please don't cry;
                  don't."
               "Let me cry, Dora dear; it does me good."
               This was incomprehensible to the little one, in whose mind tears were associated
                  with ill-learned lessons or offense to mamma, or some other enormity of like
                  nature; but, with the odd intelligence of her age able to sympathize with that
                  emotion which she could not comprehend, she just remained holding fast to Milly's
                  hand, and never uttering a word.
               The tempest passed; Milly wiped away the scalding drops, kissed Dora, and
                  said,
               "You mustn't tell any one how foolish I have been, Dora dear."
               "Indeed I won't never tell nobody," returned the child, becoming all negatives in
                  her earnest asseveration. "But oh, Milly," with her eyes like saucers, "have you
                  been bad?"
               "No one is any too good," returned Milly, evasively. "But I liked to cry, dear; it
                  has made me feel better."
               "I'm awfully glad of that; but it's very queer," said Dora, looking puzzled. "But
                  I'll not tell; and Milly, I won't bother you so much any more, now that I know you
                  are so sorry about something."
               The little one ran off to join her sister, and Milly walked about the lawn and
                  garden until she had sufficiently regained her composure to he presentable before
                  her aunt and cousin. But when she entered the house, she found Mrs. Remsen nodding
                  over a novel, and Hortense deep in one of Professor Drivler's printed lectures,
                  and neither noticed her.
               "I need not have feared they would see there was any thing the matter," thought
                  Milly. "Unless I chanced to die before their eyes, they would never discover there
                  was any thing wrong with me."
               Hortense's visit came to an end, and she proceeded on her journey in high spirits,
                  leaving the house very quiet after the rustle of her silken trains, and the
                  incessant rat-tat of her geological hammer had died out of it.
               Then came more letters from Maud and a few from Adelaide. They were enjoying
                  Newport to the fullest extent, and Maud described herself as creating a marked
                  sensation. Indeed Adelaide wrote that she found Maud quite the belle of the
                  season—of course, meaning the unmarried belle; for Mrs. Ramsay could not make up
                  her mind to believe that girls were ever so much admired as their wedded sisters.
                  Mrs. Remsen was willing to remain buried until winter, in order to give Maud a
                  brilliant season; but the seclusion so foreign to her tastes did not tend to make
                  her a more amiable companion panion,
                  and she could not forbear occasional little flings at Milly for being there,
                  buried alive, teaching the children, when she might have been displaying bridal
                  paraphernalia, to the envy of every feminine heart at Newport or elsewhere.
               Oh, those bright, golden days, how long they seemed to Milly! Worse a thousand
                  times than clouds and tempests would have been, she thought she could have found
                  something responsive in the howl of the blast or the fury of a tornado; but the
                  drowsy, indolent quiet of those long summer days nearly drove her wild.
               "And this must go on," she thought, "for weeks, months, years—as long as I shall
                  live! My youth has gone from me, my power of enjoyment has gone. There is nothing
                  left but the bare husks of life. I feel as if I were journeying over a straight
                  road, under a gray November sky; not a turn, not a hillock, not a free to rest
                  under; only an endless stretch of white road, and the dust getting into my eyes,
                  and I growing always more weary and more faint. And one can not die! Suffering
                  doesn't kill. I know I am looking different—older, and paler, and I feel always so
                  fired; but nothing really ails me; my health doesn't fail; I shall be obliged to
                  live on. I wonder I did not kill myself at first. It would have been wicked, I
                  suppose; but could the punishment have been any worse than that I endure here?
                  Never to have any end, never to be any different, if I live to be an old, old
                  woman! What will become of me at last? When Aunt Remsen dies, I shall be quite
                  alone in the world. I could teach then; there would be nobody's pride to save; the
                  girls would not mind if only I was never a trouble to them. It would be better
                  than being quiet, with nothing to do but feel this ache at my heart—day and
                  night—day and night." Such were often Milly's thoughts while the glad summer wore
                  on, and still there came no relief.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIV.
               MRS. LAWRENCE'S PROMISE.
               SEPTEMBER had come; the sky wore its golden haze; the hills grew softer and more
                  beautiful, and the quiet of the season somewhat soothed Milly's unrest.
               About this time Mrs. Remsen was seized with a violent rheumatic fever, from the
                  effects of a drenching which would have upset the stoutest hydropathist that ever
                  shivered under a bath of ice-water in December, and very ill she was. Never was
                  illness more fortunate, in one respect—I mean in the effect it had upon our faulty
                  Milly. She began with the intention of being a martyr; she took entire charge of
                  the sick-room; she watched day and night; and, before Aunt Eliza left her bed,
                  Milly was doing her duty from far different motives than those which had actuated
                  her in the outset.
               Sitting in that darkened chamber, Milly found ample time for retrospection, and
                  was forced to regard her conduct and her suffering in their true light. The
                  hardness and bitterness left her soul, and the discipline to which she was obliged
                  to submit did her a world of good. At first Milly had not much leisure to
                  reflect—her aunt was too ill, peevish and exacting also, as the most patient
                  people are under that dreadful malady, and Milly had to exert all her energies in
                  the task which devolved upon her. But when the sick woman ceased to endure
                  constant pain, could sleep a good deal by night and day, then, in her silent
                  watches, came Milly's time for thought, which she could neither drive away nor
                  turn a shade from its proper hue.
               She was able, at length, to see that she had poorly deserved the short-lived
                  happiness vouchsafed her; able to understand that her undisciplined nature had not
                  been capable of any real and permanent content. She could see, too, how suffering
                  might work good to mind and heart, instead of imbittering the whole nature, as she
                  had allowed it to imbitter hers; so that, if continued, her cynical speeches and
                  lack of faith would render her insupportable to all with whom she came in
                  contact.
               Mrs. Remsen could sit up, permitted the children to enter her room, and recovered
                  a portion of her former energy. Her old tenderness for Milly revived, she was so
                  like the dead sister who had been fondly loved. Of course Mrs. Remsen was often
                  peevish and unreasonable, and Milly had many relapses into her mental distempers;
                  but she had character enough to struggle on, now that she saw the light. Her very
                  sorrow grew different; she suffered, and her poor young heart ached wearily; but
                  she began to discover that, because one hope failed, she had no right to cry out
                  that the whole world was barren. Naturally, she rather went to the opposite
                  extreme for a while, and was overstrict with herself—it is so difficult to
                  preserve a happy medium in dealing with one's own peculiarities.
               She found leisure for a long walk each day; Mrs. Remsen saw how much she enjoyed
                  it, and would not permit her to forego the gratification, and the solitary rambles
                  helped her greatly. She observed and felt the beautiful as she had never before
                  done; each change in the soft skies, each new aspect of loveliness was caught by
                  her, and she looked out toward the glorious hills with an increasing serenity very
                  unlike the wicked impatience of the previous months.
               I am not transforming her into a heroine or an angel; she was sadly human still,
                  and full of faults; but, trying to do right, people are helped in the effort. It
                  was difficult to be composed under trifles when she was solacing her mind with
                  dreams of great sacrifices; pinpricks are hard to endure serenely. The children
                  would be careless about their lessons; Aunt Eliza would moan when her tea had too
                  much or too little sugar in it; the kitchen staff would be stupid and provoking;
                  and as many days were spoiled completely as ever an acolyte ruined plats while acquiring the sacred mysteries of the
                  culinary art. But Milly persevered; sometimes, just as she thought herself
                  advancing promisingly, back she slipped; she would hurt herself severely, and have
                  to lie on the thorns and weep a little; but she always picked herself up and
                  trudged gallantly on, gradually learning life's lessons—going slowly but surely
                  toward the light.
               One day, in particular, Mrs. Remsen was extremely cross—as you or I would have
                  been with a shoulder that creaked like a rusty hinge when we tried to use it, and
                  a trip-hammer beating furiously in the left temple. The servants had to be set in
                  order, the children wanted twenty things at once, and each of the twenty something
                  they had no business to require, and they all the more clamorous on that account.
                  But Milly bore it splendidly—saved herself from the least slip, and held fast to
                  her patience. When quiet was restored, Aunt Eliza's shoulder comfortable, and her
                  head induced to leave off its trip-hammer performance under Milly's skillful
                  manipulations, Mrs. Remsen lay looking at her in silence for a long time.
               "Milly," she said at length, "you are not like the same girl."
               Milly seized the thread of her aunt's reflections and smiled.
               "I hope not," she answered; "there was need of a change."
               "I never saw a better nurse. Oh, Milly, you have been your mother over again since
                  I was ill!"
               Milly did not burst into tears, or throw herself on her knees before her aunt with
                  a long-winded apostrophe of thankfulness. She continued her work, and tried to
                  keep her voice quiet, as she said,
               "Then you must love me once more for her sake."
               "I have always loved you, even when I was most angry," Mrs. Remsen replied. "I can
                  see where I was wrong, but I loved you as well as one of my own children all the
                  time; I want you to believe that."
               "I do believe it, aunt, and it makes me happy." Milly said. "I have been a very
                  foolish, ungrateful girl in many things; in others I have been unfortunate—"
               "Yes, Milly," her aunt interrupted, softly.; "I ought to have recollected
                  that."
               "I want you to try and forget my faults," Milly went on, "and I will try to forget
                  my little troubles; then we shall do very well."
               Mrs. Remsen could not help thinking what good fortune Milly deserved, and her
                  thoughts reverted to the hopes of the past.
               "Oh, Milly," she said; "if only things had not ended as they did!"
               "Don't, aunt, please! I don't want to talk or think of what has gone by. Let it be
                  a sealed book between us. It will be better every way."
               Mrs. Remsen was silent again for a while. She watched Milly's face, from which the
                  weariness and discontent had faded, leaving it changed and womanly. She felt, more
                  keenly than she often allowed herself to feel, that life held something for the
                  young beyond dress and gayety, something higher than the mere hope of wealth and
                  station. Then, too, she began to think that Milly might get over her trouble in
                  time, that she might find a new object to love, and all the happiness and good
                  fortune come which Mrs. Remsen wished her.
               "Milly," she said, "we will go away from here before long. My dividends are coming
                  up again, and I shall be able to draw a sum that will make us very comfortable,
                  and we'll have a pleasant winter."
               "I am very comfortable here, I give you my word."
               "But you can't go on living like this; I don't wish to turn you into a governess
                  or seamstress! It's not natural for a girl to stay shut like a hermit in a
                  eave."
               Milly laughed more like her old self than she had done in a long time.
               "But, aunty, this house is not a bit like a cave, and I like to sew. I have
                  learned to like teaching the children, too. I think I am bringing them on very
                  well—don't you?"
               "Indeed you are; much better than that stupid Miss Lane ever could or would. But
                  you are young; you must have pleasures suitable to your age—change, society."
               Milly shuddered to recall her brief career; it had been very delightful; but oh,
                  the black, dreadful end! She could not care longer for the world, because there
                  was no aim back of its charms; it would be sadly hollow and blank to her lacking
                  that. How could she sigh for crowds, when she could no longer go among them to
                  watch for one dear face? How could she join in the old dances, remembering the
                  season when a beloved arm supported her—sit and listen to the familiar operas and
                  plays, when there was no one treasured friend to whom she could turn for sympathy
                  and appreciation.
               "I want a quiet life, aunt," she said. "You gave me my butterfly season, and I
                  soiled my wings terribly, and flew in the very face of the wind. It would not be
                  just to Maud or the younger ones, who will soon take her place, for me to wear out
                  the last of my youth in amusement, and put you to an expense which ought to be
                  reserved for them."
               And Mrs. Remsen thought what a dear, wise girl she had grown; indeed, she could
                  not permit her, with her heightened beauty and her new mental attractions, to sink
                  into a household drudge for the sake of her other charges.
               "But, Milly," she began, "you may marry."
               "Aunty, don't talk about that; I shall never marry. I don't mean to be foolish or
                  romantic, but I know, I know that I couldn't love any man—again."
               She checked Mrs. Remsen by a sign when she would have expostulated, and went
                  on:
               
               "Aunt, I feel as you did after Uncle George died. Don't make me say any thing
                  more. I have buried my love; I could not build a new palace over its grave. I
                  don't wish to talk about these things, or think of them, further than is
                  unavoidable; but it is better for us to understand each other thoroughly."
               Mrs. Remsen did not speak, but in that moment she acknowledged the true force and
                  womanliness of Milly's nature.
               "You are not angry, aunt?"
               "No; but it pains me to think of your living solitary and sad, when you would know
                  so well how to use happiness."
               "I have it, aunt; at least, I am not unhappy—the rest will come in time."
               "Yes, yes; we will trust to time," Mrs. Remsen said.
               Milly smiled, comprehending what was in her thoughts, but not anxious to pursue
                  the subject.
               After this conversation, the understanding between the two was perfect; and, as
                  Mrs. Remsen's health improved, the days passed so pleasantly that the restless,
                  active woman quite enjoyed her period of convalescence. She was sometimes anxious
                  about Maud, but she hoped for the best, and trusted to Adelaide's letters that
                  every thing was going as well with the young lady as if she were there to watch;
                  and with each week Milly's companionship grew more dear, and Milly's example
                  produced its effect upon her habits and range of thought.
               It was October—beautiful, gorgeous October. They were expecting letters from Maud,
                  now at Mr. Ramsay's country-seat, and the morning passed without bringing them,
                  though the postmaster had faithfully promised to send his boy if any arrived, and
                  Milly had tempted the youth himself by offering pleasant inducements in the way of
                  sixpences.
               Mrs. Remsen felt confident there were letters at the office, and Milly was beset
                  by an odd restlessness, as if expecting news herself, though certain there was
                  none to come. So, when the early dinner-hour went by, and the afternoon wore on
                  without bringing the small boy, Milly set out for the village. She was still
                  haunted by her vague expectation when she reached the place. The old postmaster
                  put on his spectacles, admitted that he thought he had letters, entered into a
                  lengthy speculation as to the cause of "George Washington's" delay, and, when
                  Milly's patience was entirely exhausted, began slowly turning over the piles of
                  letters, and at last counted her down three with as much reluctance as if he had
                  been a philanthropist called upon to help some one in secret. Milly looked at the
                  envelopes—all for Mrs. Remsen: one in Maud's young-lady hand, the other from the
                  lawyer, and the third evidently a business letter likewise. Milly turned homeward
                  with an actual feeling of disappointment, and then laughed at herself for her
                  folly; she had not the slightest reason to expect a letter from any quarter. It
                  was only a return of her old restless ways. She walked on briskly, because she
                  knew her aunt would be anxious, and forgot her own causeless disappointment in the
                  pleasure which lighted up Mrs. Remsen's face as the letters were laid in her
                  lap.
               "An actual mail-bag," said Aunt Eliza, with true feminine delight. "Oh, this is
                  from Maud; now let us see what she says."
               She skimmed the epistle in her eagerness, then read portions aloud for Milly's
                  benefit. It was full of glowing accounts of picnics, garden-parties, petitions for
                  new costumes, appeals for money, hints of significant attentions, and a long
                  paragraph about Charley Thorne.
               "He is very devoted to me, mamma, and I can't think he ever cared a straw about
                  Milly—it was just one of your fancies. He sings ducts with me, and he reads
                  Tennyson aloud of a morning, while I work on Addie's chair-coverings. I'd rather
                  he read a jolly magazine story, of course, but it's very nice of him."
               "I hope you are not jealous, Milly," said Mrs. Remsen.
               "Not in the least, I assure you. He is the best-hearted young fellow in the world;
                  and if he likes Maud, and she him, it will be a good thing for both."
               "We shall see," said Mrs. Remsen, complacently. "At all events, every thing seems
                  to go on well with her. But oh what an extravagant pass she is, and Adelaide
                  encourages her in it. They have no idea of having old dresses made over into new.
                  You are a genius in that way, my dear."
               "A proof that I must be meant for narrow means; but Maud hates such things."
               "Here's Mr. Whiting's letter," said Mrs. Remsen; "it's only about those railway
                  bonds, I see."
               She took up a third letter, glanced at the superscription, and turned the epistle
                  over to look at the seal. "I don't know this writing," said she; "who can it be
                  from? It's postmarked New York; why, who can it be from?"
               Milly laughed outright at her aunt sitting there and perplexing herself as people
                  love to do over an unknown chirography.
               "Suppose you should open it," she suggested.
               Mrs. Remsen looked as if the thought had not occurred to her, but, after another
                  instant's contemplation, followed Milly's advice. She tore open the envelope, and
                  out fell an inclosure. Mrs. Remsen glanced at it, and exclaimed.
               "Why, Milly, it's a letter for you!"
               Milly took it, wondering a little after the fashion for which she had laughed at
                  her aunt, till it was Mrs. Remsen's turn to cry out,
               "For mercy's sake, open it, you silly child! you'll never find out the contents by
                  staring at the address," quite oblivious of her own perplexed staring while she
                  thought the epistle was intended for herself.
               Milly opened the letter and began to read, then glanced up in astonishment, almost
                  fright.
               "What is it, Milly?" exclaimed her aunt, still nervous enough, from her recent
                  illness, to be easily alarmed. "There's no bad news—nothing about the girls?"
               Milly shook her head, finished the page, and sat an instant, pale and startled,
                  regardless of her aunt's continued inquiries; then she buried her head on the arm
                  of the sofa and sobbed heartily.
               "Milly, Milly, what is it, child?" cried Mrs. Remsen, now absolutely frightened.
                  "Is it bad news?"
               "Oh, good news—good news; and I don't deserve it," sobbed Milly. "Only read this,
                  Aunt Remsen."
               Mrs. Remsen grasped the epistle and devoured the contents in surprise, mingled
                  with other feelings, as she read. Mrs. Lawrence had died suddenly, but at the last
                  she had not forgotten the careless promise she made to Milly. She had left her all
                  the property that was in her control; and this letter was from her lawyer, to
                  announce the fact to Milly that she was now mistress of some two hundred thousand
                  dollars, or its equivalent, in all sorts of safe investments.
               It would be difficult to describe the feelings of the pair in the first moments of
                  this good fortune, they were so bewildered; but soon they were mingling their
                  tears; and to Mrs. Remsen's credit be it said, that her emotions were as fall of
                  pure, unadulterated gratitude as Milly's own.
               "Poor Mrs. Lawrence!" the girl said, regretfully; "and I have scarcely thought of
                  her all the summer!"
               "My dear, she was so much older than you."
               "She did not forget; she said she should do this."
               "When—what do you mean?"
               Milly had to explain about the visit she had received from Mrs. Lawrence, in her
                  penitence, the previous spring, and Mrs. Rem on said,
               "Poor dear woman! I am glad I had already forgiven her, and was sorry I scolded
                  her."
               "She was not to blame."
               "It's all over, anyway. Dead, and left you all this money—poor Minerva! And that
                  silly Maud never to mention her death, though it seems she died at her country
                  place, and it's not more than ten miles from Mr. Ramsay's."
               She took up the letter again, and found a half-page which she had overlooked; and
                  there, edged in between a description of Adelaide's new croquet costume and the
                  account of a picnic, was the mention—
               "Oh, I forgot to tell you—Mrs. Lawrence is dead—erysipelas or something. Addie and
                  I did not go to the funeral for fear of infection; besides, that day we had a
                  grand croquet-match, and her house was so far off that Addie said she could not
                  count as a neighbor."
               Mrs. Remsen threw down the epistle in disgust. They went over the lawyer's letter
                  again for such brief particulars as it contained, and Milly could only remember
                  how kind the dead woman had been, and wonder at the hardness and unbelief of human
                  nature in which she had herself so long indulged. Mrs. Remsen did not jar upon her
                  thoughts by any worldly calculations; indeed, while waiting the next two days for
                  the further details promised by the man of business, they could only dwell on Mrs.
                  Lawrence's invariable goodness; and Aunt Eliza said, over and over,
               "Poor Minerva, I am so glad I forgave her! We were old school-friends, and I never
                  was really cross to her but that once."
               It would be preposterous to say that Milly felt any poignant sorrow, and it was
                  right and natural that, after that season of regret, she should turn to her
                  changed prospects, only not forgetting to feel thankful in this new
                  prosperity.
               "I have not deserved it, aunt," she said; "oh, I have not deserved it."
               "No one more," Mrs. Remsen answered; "and I am sure you will use it wisely."
               "I will try," Milly said, humbly; "and you must help me."
               That night, as she sat alone in her room thinking of all which had happened, Milly
                  could not combat the profound depression which stole over her. What could wealth
                  do now? It could not give back her lost youth; it could not restore the love gone
                  from her, or warm into a second blossoming the hopes which clung, sere and dead,
                  about her heart. Those were dark hours, but she was helped through them, and, when
                  morning came, could again remember that, if this change in her life might not
                  restore its brightness, at least it could be made a blessing to others.
               Mrs. Remsen began to hold long consultations with her; and if Milly had been her
                  own daughter she could not have found her more ready to appropriate this fortune
                  to the general good.
               "You see, aunt," she said, "it just furthers my plan of living with you after the
                  others are gone. When the little ones grow up and marry, you and I will cling
                  together, and grow old and comfortable."
               Aunt Eliza smiled at the prospect; indeed, she could afford to wear her most
                  benignant smile in these days; for the share which Milly appropriated to her use
                  out of this new income would make her independent of all pecuniary cares. Milly
                  was too generous to have a tinge of the mean pride in regard to money which is
                  possessed even by so many persons who give freely; she only remembered how much
                  she owed her aunt, and was anxious to show her gratitude.
               "I think," she said, "that I should like to enlarge this house, and always spend
                  the summers here. We could make the place lovely."
               "Oh, very easily, and at a moderate expense," replied Mrs. Remsen, who had a mania
                  for building and altering. "I think it an excellent idea. I am fond of the old
                  house."
               She commenced at once, in fancy, to throw out wings and put in bay-windows, and
                  was exceedingly provoked at an interruption by the children just as she was arranging an extensive
                  conservatory.
               "You never leave Milly a moment's peace," she said, as the small ones gathered
                  about their cousin, each with half a dozen petitions.
               "But Milly likes it," they pleaded; "don't you, Milly?"
               And Milly assured them that she did.
               She sent Maud a present to buy ball-dresses, which caused that young lady almost
                  to forget her envy of Milly's good fortune in the contemplation of the numerous
                  benefits likely to accrue to herself therefrom. Adelaide wrote that Milly must be
                  very happy to have an opportunity of showing her gratitude to them all, but added
                  that she believed in gratitude only when she saw some tangible proofs of its
                  existence. She hinted sweetly that she did not expect to see such evidences in
                  Milly's case, and, if they were displayed, should believe that they only rose from
                  a fear of people's considering her an utter monster if she acted otherwise.
               Then Hortense sent an epistle full of good-natured congratulation on the first
                  page, branching off into endless sentences of sesquipedalian words, in which she
                  proved that Milly knew nothing about the value or uses of money, and demonstrating
                  with equal force what she ought to do under the direction of those capable of
                  guiding her. Hortense's plan, as well as Milly could understand it, seemed to be
                  for her to found an establishment, and become the head of a sort of modified
                  nunnery, with a hospital attached. Milly laughed heartily over the characteristic
                  letters of her cousins, and Adelaide would have been disgusted to perceive that
                  her malevolence failed to wound, and Hortense shocked that Milly could laugh at
                  opinions shared by the whole intellectual coterie, Professor Drivier and Doctor
                  Brazen included. The next news was that pretty Constance Worthington had met her
                  fate, and was to be married immediately. She begged Milly to come to her, and of
                  course she departed. The Crittendons were at Mr. Worthington's country-seat, and
                  they proposed to Milly to go back with them to Europe. Mrs. Remsen decided to
                  remain in America until spring, then she would put Rob at West Point, and follow
                  Milly with her daughters. She felt convinced that, if she did not take Maud out of
                  Charley Thorne's reach, he would succumb before the winter was over, and she
                  wanted that restless young lady settled in life.
               So, in the late autumn, Milly sailed once more for the storied lands of the Old
                  World, and the new existence began.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               IN A HIGHLAND GLEN.
               THE winter passed quietly and pleasantly to Milly, in the Italian cities which
                  they sought; and if she did not find happiness, at least it was a season very
                  different from the darkness of the previous months.
               When spring came, her friends took her back to England to meet her aunt, who
                  arrived with the younger members of her brood. Maud had passed out of her hands;
                  as usual, Mrs. Remsen's scheme had proved a success, and she rested on her laurels
                  like a victorious general. Charley Thorne had yielded to destiny, and Maud was his
                  wife. Milly thought it probable they would get on well enough, and Charley go
                  comfortably on toward a corpulent middle age, submitting easily to Maud's rule,
                  caring less and less about Tennyson, and forgetting his inner nature in the
                  attractions of good dinners and such other sweetness of existence as might be
                  offered.
               When summer came, Mrs. Remsen and Milly established the little girls in a quiet
                  English village, under the care of their governess—a woman whom a friendship of
                  years had proved worthy of trust—and wandered away into the beautiful scenery of
                  the Highlands. The hotel where they stopped to rest for a fortnight was situated
                  near the edge of one of the loveliest of the Scottish lakes, and not far off was
                  the most picturesque little hamlet imaginable.
               It is too near the close of my story to rave about scenery, so I shall only tell
                  you that they settled down there and enjoyed the bright days to the full; and to
                  Milly it was like new life and strength to breathe the fresh air of the
                  mountains.
               She spent her days out-of-doors; and there was no glen so hidden that she did not
                  explore its recesses, no moor so sleep that she did not climb it to watch the
                  landscape spread out like a picture below. Very rapidly mind and body grew
                  invigorated and thoroughly healthy. She was worlds away from the fanciful girl who
                  had known that brief season of happiness, as far removed from the impatient
                  creature who had struggled with such blind restlessness under the thralldom of a
                  first great sorrow.
               One day she had rambled a long distance up among the hills, had passed so many
                  twists and windings between the rocks, and through such a variety of mossy glens,
                  that she was really unable to tell which way led to the hotel. She mounted still
                  higher, in the hope of attaining some point of view which would give her a sight
                  of the village, or at least some landmark whereby she could direct her course. She
                  came only upon a lofty water-fall with which she had not yet made acquaintance,
                  and it seemed to her more peculiarly lovely than those she had before visited. In
                  front of her rose a perpendicular mass of rock to a great height, completely
                  covered with green moss and delicate, feathery ferns, over which a stream of water
                  swept in a broad, thin sheet, like a fine embroidered lace veil flung over the
                  emerald tints, and fell into a moss-lined basin just at her feet. The thick moss
                  smothered the noise of the falling water, so that it foamed into the basin with a
                  bell-like murmur so musical that it seemed to Milly to be singing some exquisite
                  melody.
               She stood there some moments, looking and listening, then moved on toward a
                  projecting ledge, and found that she was not alone in the enchanting place. A lady
                  was seated there, her head turned away; she moved at the sound of a stone which
                  Milly's foot dislodged—looked up, and Milly saw that it was of all people in the
                  world the one she least wished to meet—Alice Marchmont.
               The girl felt her heart cease beating for an instant; it was like coming face to
                  face with an evil destiny that had taken human shape to mock her with the fearful
                  fruition of its work. She could neither move nor breathe for several instants;
                  could only stand looking full in the woman's countenance with a sensation of
                  absolute dread.
               At the first glance Alice's short sight prevented her recognizing Milly, in the
                  strength and beauty the face had gained out of her suffering and repentance—the
                  face she had known as so childishly pretty. Seeing her gaze returned with that
                  perplexed expression one wears when trying to recall a countenance, Milly felt
                  that she was unrecognized; if she could only get away before the creature had time
                  to remember or address her! But the very movement to obey her thoughts—so quick
                  and impulsive—brought to Mrs. Marchmont's mind the excitable girl of the old days,
                  and she knew her at once.
               "Miss Crofton!" she exclaimed. "Surely it is Miss Crofton—not some trick my eyes
                  are playing me!"
               When Milly heard Alice Marchmont's voice, her first impulse was to hasten on
                  without a word; but Alice came toward her holding out her land with as much
                  friendliness as if their last meeting had no place in her mind.
               "So it really is you," she said, laughing. "How you do stare! But no wonder; the
                  idea of our meeting in this out-of-the-way place! I am not quite certain yet that
                  it is not your double; do speak, and tell me you are not a ghost."
               The same ringing laugh that had so vexed Milly's heart in the days gone by, the
                  same low, indolent voice, which gave such a peculiar charm to every word. What a
                  torrent of recollections surged up and shook her very soul on hearing the
                  sound!
               Men under such unpleasant circumstances are slow to think and act, unless in a
                  case where a fellow-man is concerned, and there is a shadow of pretext for
                  knocking him down; but women's thoughts come and go like flashes of lightning.
                  This woman should not perceive that she had power to move her in any way—should
                  not be able to exult in the idea that Milly had never recovered from the effects
                  of the blow dealt by her hand. But Alice's intention was very different; she had
                  long since forgiven Milly's cruelty, and had sometimes feared that she might
                  unconsciously have had a share in bringing about the trouble between her and
                  Halford.
               "It is Mrs. Marchmont," Milly said, with delightful indifference, "No wonder you
                  are surprised to see me—I less so! The place is so lovely that I am not astonished
                  to see a fairy, or any other beautiful creature, appear."
               "Ah! you have found voice—you are not a spirit," returned Mrs. Marchmont; "and
                  what a pretty greeting you give me; please shake hands."
               But Milly was busy arranging her dress; it had been looped over a blue petticoat,
                  and some of the festoons had obligingly given way.
               "I would with pleasure," said she, laughing as gayly as Alice herself; "but you
                  see my hands are both occupied. Imagine that American greeting done and over."
               She did this so very well that any other woman might have been deceived; but Alice
                  saw that Milly still hated her.
               "The little unforgiving monster!" thought Mrs. Marchmont; "what did I ever do to
                  her? But how lovely she has grown! what in the world has changed her so? There's a
                  soul looking out of those eyes that has been newly wakened. I must really find out
                  what it all means; who would have dreamed it?"
               "You are too busy with your dress, or too indifferent to be surprised," said she;
                  "but I can't forego my woman's privilege. How came you here? indeed, where did you
                  come from? Do tell me."
               "Up the hill—from the village; and I have torn my prettiest petticoat," replied
                  Milly, laughing again.
               Mrs. Marchmont began to be vexed; but she enjoyed a bit of high comedy well
                  performed, and could not help laughing too.
               "You vexatious creature," cried she; "how came you in the village, then, since one
                  must question categorically?"
               "Oh dear, yes—I beg your pardon—think of my being so stupid as not to understand!
                  I really believe the air of these quiet places dulls one's wit."
               Alice had an internal conviction that Milly's, so far from being dulled, had been
                  decidedly sharpened by the air or some other unknown cause. She had been the
                  recipient of coolness and raillery quite long enough; perhaps she had better warn
                  this young woman that the dullness of the country had not yet deprived her of her
                  old, dangerous weapons.
               "So odd a place to meet you," said she; "of course it must be a bridal journey.
                  Only lovers or misanthropes would come to so quiet a place. Am I to congratulate
                  you?"
               "Only on the pleasure of meeting yourself," she said, not flinching under the
                  thrust which reached a wound that Alice, ignorant of her own share in Milly's
                  trouble, did not dream of touching.
               "It is I who am to be congratulated, my dear young lady," said Alice, in her most
                  languid way.
               
               "Or else pitied," said Milly.
               "How so, I beg?"
               "Since you say the place could only be sought by lovers or misanthropes," returned
                  Milly, following up her success.
               "Pas mal," said Alice, laughing again. "Oh,
                  well, every one knows that I am a misanthrope; but a charming young blossom like
                  yourself can not urge such a plea."
               "Oh, I came with my aunt," replied Milly; "so the being in love or misanthropic
                  will fall to her charge."
               "How comfortable and convenient to have an aunt," said Alice, with the slightest
                  perceptible sneer; "I wish I had one."
               "Yes," drawled Milly, with a whole volume of meaning in her distinct and
                  deliberate utterance; "I dare say you would often have found one a great
                  convenience."
               Alice Marchmont remembered on the instant Maud's story of the dinner-party; the
                  best of women in such an encounter will be wicked toward each other.
               "Yes," she said, meditatively; "but observation has shown me that they are not
                  always a sufficient shield for young women to hide behind."
               "Indeed?" answered Milly. "Oh, I know nothing about that; but I am quite willing
                  to take your experience for it. I have never had occasion to hide behind any
                  one."
               "No," said Mrs. Marchmont, in a tone of voice so nicely balanced between a
                  doubtful assent and an interrogatory that a man would have believed it the former;
                  but the blood tingled in Milly's veins, for she knew very well which was intended,
                  and felt the full force of the taunt.
               "I am so grateful for your warm confirmation of my words," said Milly,
                  sweetly.
               "And the gratitude of a dear girl like yourself is such a charming thing to have,"
                  said Alice, with equal sweetness.
               The foils had clashed and glanced off equally; it was scarcely worth while to
                  continue the encounter on that ground.
               "What lovely views there are from these hills. I must have been wandering miles,"
                  was Mrs. Marchmont's next remark, moving nearer to the edge of the cliff. Milly
                  assented, and for a few moments they did enthusiastic admiration of the scenery in
                  mutual accord.
               "It must be getting late," said Milly, suddenly, glancing at her watch. "Why, it
                  is after sunset!" she added, in dismay. "And I fancy we are a long way from the
                  village. Indeed I don't quite know where we are; I was climbing the hill hoping to
                  get a look out, when I came upon you."
               "I was in the same predicament," said Alice. "I tried several paths, but each one
                  seemed to lead me further astray than the one before it; I am very fortunate to
                  have met you."
               She knew that would vex Milly, and it did so.
               "Fortunate, provided I can help you out of your difficulty, but I am not certain
                  that I shall be able to do so."
               "Ciel!" cried Mrs. Marchmont. "Well, ma belle, we shall at least have the consolation of
                  being lost together."
               "You will make me unwilling to find the way home if you remind me of that
                  pleasure," said Milly.
               "Ah!" said the other, "but we shall go together, too."
               "Not if I can help it," thought Milly; "I'll put her in the right path, and leave
                  her; she makes me feel too wicked!" But she did not express her reflection in
                  words or voice. "I only hope we may be able to find the way," she said,
                  pleasantly. "I will go on to the extreme top of the cliff; very likely I can see
                  the village from there. Don't follow me, for if I slipped I should throw you
                  backward."
               Mrs. Marchmont stood quietly near the water-fall watching Milly as she ran up the
                  stony path with a rapid step, her stay in this place having made her quite a
                  mountaineer. She reached the top, and Alice saw her look eagerly about, then try
                  several paths, and finally sit down on a mossy rock to rest, thoroughly fatigued
                  by her unusual walk. Presently she descended, stepping slowly down over the rocks
                  with what to most people might have passed for caution in descending the rugged
                  way; but Alice, with her quick perceptions, interpreted the hesitation more
                  correctly; she knew that Milly could hardly endure being obliged to rejoin
                  her.
               "What a dreadful disposition she must have!" thought Alice. "One would have
                  supposed she might have forgotten her dislike of me in all these months."
               Just then she heard Milly speaking as she drew near the fall. "I can see no sign
                  of the village," she said; "it is very odd where we can be."
               "Perhaps the place is enchanted, and the genii are angry because we have come,"
                  returned Alice, trying to laugh, but feeling-greatly disturbed by Milly's words,
                  for she had just discovered that she was thoroughly exhausted.
               "The worst of it is," continued Milly, "there's a heavy cloud coming over that
                  mountain—mist or rain, or both; so we must hasten in some direction."
               Mrs. Marchmont rose to her feet at once.
               "You have no idea which path would lead us least astray?" she asked.
               "Not the slightest," replied Milly, with composure. "Whether we had better go down
                  the way I came up, or go to the top of the cliff and ascend on the other side—the
                  village must lie in one direction or the other."
               "How re-assuring!" responded her companion.
               "Yes; we can have the satisfaction of believing ourselves right until the last
                  moment."
               "Thank you, but I don't like the idea of last moments! Eh
                     bien; which path do you propose to take?"
               "I am as much at a loss as you can be. I have taken so many turns, and climbed so
                  many hills, that I can not tell the right hand from the left."
               Alice began to laugh again from sheer fatigue and nervousness.
               "We shall have to imitate the school-boy," said she, picking up a little flat
                  stone. "See—I toss this in the air; if the gray side comes uppermost, we go back
                  by the way you came; if the yellow, we try fate on the other side of the
                  cliff."
               "Very well; but I warn you the path seemed very steep as I looked down at it."
               Mrs. Marchmont shrugged her shoulders indifferently.
               "One—two; now for luck or fate!"
               She tossed the little stone in the air. As it fell, both leaned over it. The
                  yellow side was uppermost.
               "We are doomed to try the cliff," said she. "I confess to being very
                  superstitious. I wouldn't tempt destiny by going the other way for the world."
               She spoke half in jest, half in earnest. But Milly herself had the same little
                  superstitious feeling in favor of following the decision of their oracle, such as
                  it was, a feeling every body has had in moments of perplexity, though admitting
                  its folly.
               "So be it," she said. "We had better go at once: either it is growing dusk, or
                  that cloud is coming very fast."
               They clambered up the ascent, Milly somewhat burdened with a plaid which she had
                  brought on her arm to make a comfortable seat, and Alice so weary that even the
                  excitement of knowing they were lost could not make her forget her intense
                  fatigue. But of all persons in the world, each felt that her companion was the
                  last to whom she would admit either weariness or fear; so they climbed on,
                  laughing and jesting, and being as witty and clever for each other's benefit as if
                  they had been in a ballroom, with a crowd of men to listen to and appreciate their
                     bon mots. They were at the top of the cliff,
                  and stopped an instant to get breath and look out for some sign of the
                  village.
               Away in the west were broad streaks of dark red, half covered with smoky flecks;
                  but the mist and rain, coming up from the south, had rushed so rapidly between,
                  that it was like gazing out over a gray sea, and in the dim light the path at
                  their feet looked fearfully precipitous and uncertain. Alice Marchmont gave one
                  glance, and then started back a little.
               "Are you afraid?" asked Milly, with polite contempt in her voice.
               "Not in the least; my head was dizzy for a moment. It is over."
               "Come, then, I'll go first."
               "No, indeed; as the elder, that is my privilege."
               Be helped out of an unpleasantness or danger, as it might chance to be, by Mrs.
                  Marchmont? No; Milly felt that she could not, even if the consequence of leading
                  the way were a fall from the height and a broken back. She started down the
                  suspicion of a pathway without another word, and Alice followed, with a careless
                  laugh on her lips. Two woodsmen could not have shown less appearance of timidity,
                  and certainly would have displayed more caution than these women, animated by
                  feelings of cordial dislike on the one side, and repulsion on the other, caused by
                  a consciousness of that dislike.
               Down they hastened. The descent, which, under ordinary circumstances, would have
                  been rather difficult than dangerous, was now somewhat perilous; for the red light
                  died rapidly out of the sky, and the mist surged on toward them, some drops of
                  chilly rain already beginning to fall, as a precursor of the storm which was close
                  at hand. They had passed the steepest part of the way, and were apparently
                  approaching a number of glens similar to those on the other side of the hills, and
                  the sound of water-falls were again audible.
               "Can you see out at all?" Mrs. Marchmont asked.
               "Not in the least. I thought when we got here I should be able to form some idea
                  of our whereabouts."
               "But you can't?"
               "No more than if we were in the moon."
               Alice began to laugh, made a misstep, caught at a shrub for support; but the twigs
                  gave way in her hand, and she fell to the ground, unable to repress one sharp cry
                  of pain. Milly was some distance in advance, peering about among the shadows, but
                  she heard the exclamation, and called,
               "You did not fall? You're not hurt?"
               There was no answer. She hastened back to the spot, and found Mrs. Marchmont
                  nearly fainting, but trying to rise to her feet.
               "Oh, are you hurt?" Milly asked, her anxiety roused at once.
               "I think not; I can't tell till I'm up—very awkward of me—thank you," as Milly
                  aided her.
               But the instant she tried to stand the pain forced a groan from her, and she would
                  have fallen again if Milly had not held her firmly.
               "What is it? Where are you hurt?"
               "My foot—"
               "You have sprained your ankle?"
               "I don't think it is; the pain is in my foot. Let me sit down a moment; perhaps I
                  have only bruised it against a stone."
               Milly forgot her dislike to the woman—the wrongs she had received at her
                  hands—every thing except her suffering, and that she could see was excessive, by
                  the whiteness of Mrs. Marchmont's lips, and the nervous contraction of her hands.
                  Carefully as she could have touched a sister, Milly seated her on a convenient
                  bank and supported her in her arms.
               "I think the pain will pass in a moment," said Alice, trying to keep her voice
                  from trembling. "Don't let me tire you; I can sit up."
               
               "Lean against the tree, and let me loosen your boot-lacing," Milly said, for she
                  saw that the pain did not decrease.
               In spite of her hasty deprecation, Milly knelt and unlaced the dainty kid bottine.
               "Ah, that is easier; perhaps if I draw it partly off for a little it will get
                  better."
               Milly attempted to do so, but Alice fairly shrieked—then exclaimed, as Milly
                  stopped, in a fright,
               "I do beg your pardon; I didn't think I was such a baby. Let it alone—I can walk—I
                  must walk."
               She struggled to her feet, tried to take a step, and fell backward.
               "I can't do it," she said, the horrible pain sending a deathly faintness over her.
                  "I must have broken some bone in my foot."
               "Let me get your shoe and stocking off, and—"
               "No, no; it would do no good! See, now; you must not mind me; just leave me here,
                  and make your way down to the village."
               "Indeed I will do no such thing!"
               "You must reach it in time; you can send some one back for me."
               "I can not leave you alone, Mrs. Marchmont—indeed I will not; so we'll not discuss
                  it further."
               "Then I must walk, if it kills me."
               "You must do no such thing," returned Milly, firmly, restraining her as she tried
                  to rise.
               "It would be much wiser for you to go on and leave me," said Alice. "I should be
                  perfectly safe."
               "I'm not quite such a brute," exclaimed Milly.
               "Indeed you are only too kind," returned Alice, warmly. "But you see, it can do no
                  good to stay; I'm not afraid; besides, you would be sure to find help
                  somewhere."
               "I might find myself in the deep woods at the foot of the mountain as likely as
                  anywhere."
               "Honestly, would you rather stay?"
               "Honestly! I don't know which way to turn."
               "Well, certainly, there's no use filling the neighborhood with lost and distressed
                  females; we may as well stay together if you are so good as to wish it, and—"
               A severer twinge checked farther words for the moment.
               "I must find a more comfortable place for you," Milly said, "and get your boot
                  off. Wait a moment."
               She ran a little farther down the descent, and found herself in a sheltered glen;
                  in the dim light she could see a water-fall dashing across the rocks, not far off
                  a group of trees, under which last she spread her plaid, and then hurried back. In
                  spite of Mrs. Marchmont's expostulations, Milly half carried, half led her to the
                  place. Supported by Milly, she managed to get at last to the trees, and then sank
                  on the plaid almost unconscious. Milly held her in her arms until the faintness
                  had somewhat passed, too much frightened to remember any thing except that she was
                  a woman, and needed help.
               "What a miserable idiot I am!" cried Alice, recovering; "I dare say the hurt is
                  nothing."
               "I'm not so sure of that," Milly answered. "Let me try to find out what is
                  wrong."
               Milly drew off the boot and stocking as tenderly as possible, and examined the
                  dainty white foot; Alice had displaced one of the little bones in the instep.
                  Milly knew at once what was the matter, for young Rob, with the usual ill luck of
                  boys at vacation-time, had met with a similar accident the preceding summer. She
                  explained the nature of the hurt, saying,
               "If you will let me, I am quite sure I can push the bone into its place, and
                  bandage it as I saw the doctor do. There will be very little pain after."
               "Oh. I should be so glad! Can I walk then?"
               "Ah, that I can't promise. Rob was not allowed to attempt it for more than a
                  week!"
               "Fancy a week's sojourn here!" cried Alice.
               Milly did not waste more words; she tore their handkerchiefs in strips, took the
                  wounded foot in her hands, and easily pushed back the bone, the operation being
                  slight enough to any one gifted with common sense and a keen faculty of
                  observation. Then she bound it deftly with her impromptu bandages, wet them
                  thoroughly, and finally folded Mrs. Marchmont tenderly in the plaid.
               Alice had not uttered a wold during the operation, which was painful enough, as I
                  can aver from experience; but when it was over the relief was so great that she
                  breathed a long sigh of positive content.
               "Is that better?" asked Milly.
               "It is like coming out of purgatory! How good you are to me—and how skillfully you
                  did it!"
               "Luckily I was obliged to watch the doctor. Rob would not sit still unless I held
                  him fast in my arms."
               "I am sure any surgeon would have hurt me much more—men are so awkward."
               The pain was now sufficiently gone for them to consider their situation, and there
                  was certainly nothing for it but to stay where they were. Mrs. Marchmont announced
                  that she had a packet of biscuits in her pocket, and Milly had some fruit and a
                  drinking-cup in the little velvet sachel which she always took with her in her
                  walks to carry a book in. It was evident, as the rain had not continued, that the
                  most unpleasant thing which could happen would be to suffer with cold.
               "If you had not been unlucky enough to meet me," said Alice, "you would be safe at
                  home long before this."
               "No, indeed; I should only be lost somewhere else, and quite alone—at least I am
                  very glad we are together."
               "Do you really mean it?"
               "I do; I am in earnest now; I would not say it else."
               "Then I thank you heartily, and may be as glad as I wish to be that you met me,
                  since you are not sorry."
               "The storm has passed by," said Milly; "there will be no rain; perhaps the mist
                  will go before the moon rises."
               "If we were only men, we should carry plenty of matches for our odious pipes, and
                  could have a fire."
               "Are you cold?"
               "Not at all—I am so wrapped up; but I'm afraid you are. Do take part of the
                  plaid."
               "Not yet; I'm warm enough. We have chanced on a bed of heather, where the sun has
                  been lying all day, and my feet are as warm as possible."
               "How absurd it all seems," said Alice; and they both began to laugh, which did
                  them good.
               By this time they discovered that they were hungry, and Mrs. Marchmont's paper of
                  biscuits and Milly's forgotten fruit became treasures.
               "It is better than the choicest supper at the Trois Frères," Alice declared.
                  "By-the-way, when did you come abroad?"
               "Last autumn," Milly answered.
               "A friend wrote me that you were here, and that you are an heiress in these days.
                  I congratulate you."
               "You are very good."
               "People may moralize as much as they please; money is a nice thing to have! So
                  your friend Constance Worthington is married. I hope she is happy. Dear me—one
                  forgets so—your aunt was very ill just before you left America."
               "Yes—very ill."
               "So the voyage was partly on her account?"
               "No; she only came over this spring. I was with Mr. and Mrs. Crittendon until
                  then."
               "Nice people—very. You must have enjoyed these months greatly."
               "I have; we were very quiet all winter, but I liked that."
               "At your age?"
               "One sometimes feels in that mood after taking care of a sick person," Milly
                  answered, dryly.
               "Ah! yes. I should think that might be. But I know very little about illness—I
                  have been such a useless creature. I never was with any sick person except my
                  husband," she added, in a softer voice, "and he only lived a very short time."
               Alice said no more. Straightway Milly's thoughts rushed into the future. This
                  woman would yet marry Mr. Halford! Well, and what was either of them to her? At
                  present she had only to reflect that she was beside a human being who had need of
                  her assistance. On the morrow they would separate, and each go her way—Mrs.
                  Marchmont to wait for Halford, herself to take life as it came to her with what
                  patience she might. She was recalled from these quickly flashing thoughts by
                  Alice's voice repeating, meditatively,
               "No, I knew nothing about illness until my husband's death."
               "I am sorry if it was a great grief to you," Milly said, and never remembered how
                  strangely the words would sound until they were spoken.
               "It was not a grief to me in itself," Alice said, quietly "but it was a very
                  solemn season. It made me think and reflect as I had never done before."
               She said nothing else, and Milly did not choose to ask her what she meant. The
                  conversation was assuming a serious tone not agreeable to her; she had no desire
                  to learn any thing in regard to Alice's state of mind or feelings, and certainly
                  no intention of betraying her own.
               "The mist is passing away," she said, after a short pause; "the stars are
                  beginning to come out; we shall have moonlight presently."
               She rose and began to walk about the little glen in the gloom. Alice had not
                  noticed her words, but her moving roused her from the reverie into which she had
                  fallen.
               "I am sure you are cold," said she.
               "Indeed, no; I am impatient to see the moonlight. It will make the water-fall look
                  very lovely, I am sure."
               "How it sings!" said Alice; "I always envy running water; it seems to be so
                  happy."
               Presently the sky lightened; the tops of the cliffs and trees became tinged with
                  streaks of pale, uncertain radiance that gradually brightened and grew silvery,
                  till at last the moon sailed slowly up over the fleecy clouds. The rays streamed
                  broad and full on the sparkling cascade, and turned the little glen into a fairy
                  bower to which the lingering masses of mist made tinted hangings that were too
                  lovely to be described by any words.
               Mrs. Marchmont uttered an exclamation of extreme delight, and then was still,
                  entranced by the loveliness of the scene. She glanced toward Milly; the girl was
                  standing in front of the cascade, leaning carelessly against a tall tree, the
                  moonlight resting full upon her face and upturned eyes, transfiguring them to that
                  almost unearthly beauty which only moonlight can give. Alice bent forward,
                  watching her curiously. Was this the creature she had left a spoiled, capricious
                  child—this woman with the solemn eyes, and a strange, self-controlled expression
                  on the beautiful mouth—the whole face changed into a lofty type of loveliness,
                  which showed that not only had the soul developed into full power, but some
                  terrible and bravely conquered suffering had smitten youthful and childish follies
                  from her heart?
               Had the separation from Kenneth Halford done this? Great Heaven, this girl had
                  loved him, then—really loved! Alice seldom gave any one of her sex credit for the
                  ability to love; but when she did, she pitied and admired her beyond measure. A
                  great sympathy for Milly filled her soul, deepened by a sensation of absolute solute awe at the expression of her
                  face in the white glory of the moonbeams.
               "Milly!" she called, suddenly.
               "Are you suffering again?" asked Milly, as she came toward her, startled by the
                  tone.
               "No, no; I beg your pardon. This odd adventure makes me silly and fanciful. You
                  looked so like a lovely spirit, as you stood there, that I almost expected to see
                  you float away."
               "Ah, you have such a fund of pretty fancies and compliments," Milly answered,
                  coldly.
               "I did not mean to compliment; I was just speaking my thoughts—one doesn't often;
                  but surely in this place it is very pardonable to be surprised into it."
               "I suppose so."
               "Are you angry because I called you by your first name?"
               "I did not notice it."
               "It was odd I should have done it; but I used to hear you called so very
                  often."
               Milly felt a hot flush of anger pass over her—the allusion was to Kenneth Halford.
                  How dared this woman make even the most distant reference to his name!
               "Let me wet the bandage again," she said, in the most commonplace tone.
               "It is not necessary; my foot is perfectly easy, and I am as warm as possible. You
                  will freeze, I am sure, if you walk about. Come, wrap yourself in the plaid, and
                  let us watch the moonlight together."
               "I'm not cold, and so very wide awake that I could not keep myself quiet," Milly
                  replied.
               With these thoughts again roused in her mind, she could not go near Mrs.
                  Marchmont; her only chance of regaining composure was in getting back to ordinary
                  topics of conversation while she walked about.
               "Please do come," begged Alice, "else I shall think you still hate me too
                  much."
               "But since I am not cold—"
               "Ah, but I am sure you must be; I implore you to come! Well, if you won't, I'll
                  get up and throw your plaid away," exclaimed she, with a pretty willfulness.
               There was nothing for it but to make a scene which would render herself
                  ridiculous, and be downright cruelty under the circumstances, or to comply with
                  Mrs. Marchmont's wish. So Milly sat down beside her, and Alice wrapped the plaid
                  carefully about her, leaving her hand to rest caressingly on Milly's shoulder, and
                  the touch of those slender fingers sent a chill to Milly's very soul.
               "Ah, you are shivering even now!" exclaimed Alice. "You will catch cold and be
                  ill, and all by my fault. Oh, I bring bad luck to every one who comes near
                  me!"
               "I don't think you will bring any bad luck to me," replied Milly, steadily, "in
                  this instance."
               "I hope you don't believe I wish to in any instance," said she, catching the last
                  words. "I hope you don't," she repeated, when Milly did not speak.
               "I hope not, certainly," she answered, trying to laugh; "but since you say you are
                  so unfortunate to your friends, perhaps it is lucky for me that we are not likely
                  to meet, if ever we get out of this wood."
               "What an odd idea! Not meet? What can you mean?"
               Milly had said more than she intended.
               "I mean nothing—like most people. I should have said not soon, or often."
               "Oh, that would pain me to believe," cried Alice, impulsively. "I'm such an
                  absurdity; it seems to me as if we had been ever such a long time here together,
                  and had grown well acquainted."
               She was trying her fascinations, thought Milly, bitterly; but Alice Marchmont was
                  quite powerless to deceive her.
               "Are you laughing at me?" Alice asked.
               "Oh no. I accept your last words as I do your other pretty speeches; they are very
                  pleasant to hear."
               "But you don't believe? That is downright unkind. I did not think you could be so
                  hard-hearted! I wish I had not let you bind up my foot. I think I would rather
                  have been left quite alone in the wood to-night than be indebted to a person who
                  can think meanly of me."
               She spoke so warmly that Milly was really touched. She relented sufficiently to
                  believe that Mrs. Marchmont was sincere for the moment; but there was no reason
                  why she should be deceived by so ephemeral a feeling, even if the lady was.
               "There is no cause for gratitude," she said, cordially enough. "I shall think you
                  are feverish, and be frightened if you are so easily agitated."
               "Are you always calmness personified?" asked Mrs. Marchmont, smiling again. "Well,
                  I am impulsive, as you see, even after all the discipline life has brought me; and
                  there is one thing above all in which I think I shall never change—if I am to love
                  any one I do it without warning, and I think I must love you in spite of
                  yourself."
               "Even if I had hostile intentions, I should in that case be obliged to throw down
                  my arms. You are so entirely invincible, you know."
               "You are mocking, and I am sure you have some strong dislike for me. Why is it?
                  You do dislike me, don't you?"
               Milly was silent; the truth was too rude to tell, and she was not willing, even
                  for civility, to stoop to falsehood.
               "You seem quite to hate me," persisted Alice.
               "Not at this moment," replied Milly.
               "Come, that is better than nothing—a long step gained. I'll be wise, and not ask
                  more questions."
               "How did you happen to find this quiet village?" said Milly, wishing to change the
                  subject of conversation.
               "The village that I can not find, you mean? Oh, I was tired, and bored with
                  well-known places and people, and I chanced to hear some one rave about this lake
                  and the water-falls; so the next morning I set off in search of them."
               "You reached here to-day?"
               "Yes; but how did you know?"
               "I did not—at least, that it was you. A servant told mine of another lady who had
                  arrived, wondering I suppose, to see strangers so late in the season."
               "So we are positively living under the same roof?"
               "When we get back to it, if ever we do."
               "Oh, they'll hunt us up," said Alice, with her usual insouciance. "Your aunt is sure to be frightened, and send to look
                  you up, and my old servant will go quite mad."
               "Poor aunty! I declare it was wicked of me to forget her anxiety."
               "We are the heroines; it is for the others to be anxious. What time is it
                  now?"
               Milly looked at her watch; it was almost midnight.
               "I did not think it was so late," said Mrs. Marchmont.
               "Hark!" said Milly, starting up. "There are voices!"
               They listened—the cries were repeated, and Milly shouted as loudly as she could in
                  return. It was not long before the landlord and his party came down the cliff
                  path, and Alice ungratefully whispered to her companion,
               "I'm rather sorry they found us. I was very comfortable, and we should have got
                  acquainted if they had only left us to play babes in the wood till morning."
               As she spoke the words she looked up, and by the glare of the lanterns which shut
                  out the moonlight she saw John Worthington's face.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVI.
               MADE CLEAR.
               MILLY found her aunt in a state of great alarm, and almost inclined to be
                  hysterical over her restoration, until she forgot the intention in her wonderment
                  at learning who had been the girl's companion in this untoward adventure.
               "Alice Marchmont!" she exclaimed. "Why I never heard the like! They told me there
                  was another lady out, but they said it was a Mrs. Marsham. What on earth did you
                  say or do?"
               "We laughed," said Milly; "then she broke her foot; then I mended it; then we lay
                  down in my plaid and talked trash; then the people found us. But who do you think
                  headed the scouting-party?"
               "I don't know; I am past surprise."
               "Mr. Worthington. He told me he reached here just as the excitement about us was
                  at its height; and oh! he hurt his arm coming back, to complete the romance."
               "It is exactly like a romance," cried Mrs. Remsen.
               "Oh, very like," returned Milly, yawning. "But I shall go and see Mrs. Marchmont,
                  then get to bed, and finish the romance in the morning."
               It had all come about naturally enough, romantic as it appeared to Mrs. Remsen.
                  Alice Marchmont had been wandering about the Continent since her hasty departure
                  from America, and had lately come over to England. She was seized with a desire to
                  visit the Highlands once more, and, as Miss Portman detested mountain scenery, had
                  left her at peace near London, and wandered off with no guardianship but that of
                  her maid and man.
               For several months past, John Worthington had received no letters from her; it had
                  grown difficult for her to write in the old, calm, friendly way. He became too
                  anxious to endure longer her silence; he set sail for Albion. He found Miss
                  Portman, learned the direction her relative had taken, and started in pursuit. He
                  followed her from one place to another, and reached the hotel only a few hours
                  after her arrival.
               The next day Mrs. Marchmont was unable to leave her bed. She had caught a severe
                  cold; and this, added to the sprain, made her really ill, though it seemed to
                  Milly that she was suffering more from mental agitation than physical pain.
               John Worthington heard of her state from the physician, and did not attempt to see
                  her, but he lay in wait for Milly, and fairly startled her by his manner and eager
                  questions.
               "Beg her to admit me as soon as she is able," he urged.
               Milly went back to Mrs. Marchmont and repeated the message; but there was no
                  reply. Alice turned her head on her pillow, so that her face was hidden, and did
                  not speak for a long time. Milly might have thought that she slept save for the
                  spasmodic quivering of her hands at intervals, and the choked sobs which
                  occasionally shook her frame, but the girl was too wise to worry her charge by a
                  single question. Alice grew so much worse after the physician paid his afternoon
                  visit that she needed constant care; and finding her maid more helpless than a
                  frightened partridge, Milly could not leave the room.
               It was strange enough to sit by that bed, watching the woman whom she believed had
                  willfully and wickedly worked her so much harm; to recall her own dislike, and
                  their last meeting; but this was no time to indulge in unkind feelings, nor was
                  there in her thoughts any Pharisaical idea of heaping coals of fire on her enemy's
                  head.
               As night came on, Alice's fever increased so much that she was slightly delirious.
                  However, the doctor had prepared Milly for this; so she was not alarmed.
               Between sleeping and waking, Alice talked disconnectedly of people and things
                     concerning ing which Milly was
                  ignorant—of trivial and long-forgotten matters, as well as those nearer. Sometimes
                  she seemed frightened, oppressed by danger—once she called out Worthington's name,
                  and uttered appealing words. Then she roused herself with an effort, and said,
               "How good you are—how kind and tender! Wasn't I talking great nonsense?"
               But the struggle to keep awake and sensible was too great for her wearied nerves,
                  and she dozed again, complaining that she was so tired—so tired! She journeyed
                  over stony roads; she was out of breath climbing steep hills; she was, through
                  all, full of grief at her inability to explain something, and begged for Milly's
                  little warm hand to hold in hers, because without it she was so lonely.
               At length she fell sound asleep, and Milly sat regarding the beautiful face,
                  afraid to move lest she should disturb her, and thinking what a strange chance it
                  was that had brought them together under such circumstances. Milly was no wiser
                  than the rest of us, and said chance, when, if she had stopped to reflect, she
                  knew there was no such thing—no space for it in the grand plan of human
                  existence.
               The next morning Mrs. Marchmont was better, but, by the physician's orders, she
                  remained in bed; indeed, after one rebellious attempt to leave it, she resigned
                  herself to the necessity of obedience without further complaint.
               The day wore on, and Milly scarcely left her. Toward evening she went down stairs
                  for a few moments, to give Mr. Worthington more explicit tidings than she had been
                  able to send, and he handed her a letter for Mrs. Marchmont.
               "It is shameful to keep you a prisoner here," Alice said, as she returned to the
                  chamber; "but I do so hate staying alone!"
               "I could not leave you to your servant; I am glad to stay," Milly answered.
               "Have you seen Mr. Worthington?" Alice asked, after a pause.
               "Yes; his arm is better. I could relieve his anxiety about you, too."
               "He was anxious—my good old John!"
               "I have something to give you when you are well enough to read it," Milly
                  added.
               Alice stretched out her hand, and Milly put Worthington's letter into it and
                  busied herself at the other side of the room, while Mrs. Marchmont read the
                  epistle. For a long time she lay quiet. It was growing dusk now; Milly could not
                  see her face, but she thought that Alice was weeping. At last Milly heard her call
                  her name in a steady voice.
               "What is it?" she asked, going toward the bed. "Shall I help you to move?"
               "No," Alice answered. "Sit down by me—I want to talk to you."
               "Shall I ring for a lamp?"
               "Not yet, please; I like the twilight. You're sure you don't mind staying with
                  me?"
               "I like to stay; do believe it."
               "Dear Milly—I may call you Milly?"
               "If it pleases you," Milly said, softened in spite of herself, and wondering if
                  she could possibly have misjudged this woman throughout—wondered, too, if she had
                  as much exaggerated the wrong done her as she had Mrs. Marchmont's share in
                  it.
               "Do you remember our last meeting in America, Milly?" Alice asked, suddenly.
                  "Weren't you a little hard on me then?"
               "Very hard; I have many times since been sorry; but I was so hard and wicked in
                  those days."
               "My poor Milly," returned Alice, tenderly; "were you suffering too?"
               This was an admission Milly could not bring herself to utter; she remained silent.
                  Presently Alice spoke again.
               "I am thinking about your goodness to me. I haven't had much tenderness shown me
                  in my life, Milly. Oh! those days I was speaking of—how I suffered; my pride has
                  become more tamed than yours—I don't mind owning it. Do you know who was very good
                  to me then, though he had no idea what caused my trouble? Shall I tell you who it
                  was?"
               "Of course, if you like," Milly answered, slowly.
               "It was Kenneth Halford."
               Alice felt the hand which she had taken grow cold and begin to quiver, but she
                  held it fast.
               "Don't draw away, Milly; be quiet, child! I want to talk to you about him."
               "And I don't care to hear," Milly replied, steadily.
               "Because you don't believe with me that he was kind and true?"
               "Partly that," said Milly, her voice growing a little hard. "But perhaps you knew
                  him better than I did."
               "Oh, Milly! And you once promised to be his wife?"
               Milly snatched away her hand with an impulse to rise and leave the room, but Alice
                  clung to her.
               "You must not go, Milly! You will forgive me if my question sounded cruel; indeed
                  I did not mean to be."
               "Then we will talk of something else," Milly said, decidedly.
               "We must speak of this; I implore you to let me!" Alice cried. "It is not
                  curiosity, oh, believe that; but I must know what separated you and Kenneth
                  Halford."
               "I can imagine no reason why—"
               "Hush, Milly! It is for my soul's peace! I had sometimes feared that I— Oh! now,
                  what John Worthington writes—"
               "Mr. Worthington can know nothing about the matter," interrupted Milly. "If you
                  insist upon an answer, it is easily given."
               "Tell me, Milly; do tell me!"
               "His arrogance and my girlish caprices, his misunderstanding of my character and
                  my lack of faith in him. Reasons enough for us to separate, since they proved
                  there could be no real love between us."
               "No, Milly, no; I am sure he loved you."
               "Don't say another word, Mrs. Marchmont," said Milly, sternly. "If we are to speak
                  or meet again, this subject must be at an end between us!"
               "Then you still dislike me so much that you will not talk frankly. Perhaps I might
                  be able to explain away your harsh judgment of me;" and she drew Milly to her,
                  placed her hand on the unwilling head, turned the face toward her own, and looked
                  pleadingly in the blue eyes. "How could you answer me like that?" she asked.
               "No other subject could make me do so," said Milly, somewhat softened.
               "Because—because you love him?" whispered Alice.
               "Is it probable?" returned Milly, with the bitter laugh which had of late been
                  unfamiliar to her lips. "Do you think I belong to the order of women who can love
                  on after falsehood and deceit? I think there is not so much of the spaniel in my
                  nature!"
               "Kenneth Halford never intentionally deceived a human being; I know him to be
                  incapable of it," said Alice, warmly.
               Then came back to Milly the thought which had occurred to her that night in the
                  glen—Alice loved him, and would marry him! Now she must not shrink from his name
                  if it should wring her heart to listen.
               "I know what I say," pursued Alice; "you may trust me, Milly; I am sure of
                  it."
               "Indeed, Mrs. Marchmont, its truth or falsity can have no interest for me," Milly
                  answered, calmly. "Mr. Halford has passed completely out of my life and
                  thoughts."
               "Oh, Milly! When Kenneth Halford loved you so dearly—you believe that he loved
                  you?" Alice asked.
               "No," said Milly, coldly; "I am sure that he did not. He was a man tired of the
                  world, and considering me a child, he fancied me for a time; but when he found
                  that I could think and feel, even if I could not reason, and that I was horribly
                  ill-tempered and exacting, he was glad to let me go."
               "Did he say all this?"
               "He was not likely to say it, Mrs. Marchmont, but I was quick to understand. Young
                  as I was, you can not suppose that I was an utter idiot, without perception or
                  imagination."
               "On the contrary, I fancy both were only too excitable," replied Mrs. Marchmont.
                  "So you sent Mr. Halford away?"
               "Out of my life at least; yes."
               "I only heard the incomprehensible story your little cousin told me the day I
                  tried to see you," said Alice; "but I knew you must have broken the engagement; he
                  was not a man to do that, although you did torment him."
               "Perhaps he complained to you," said Milly, her eyes flashing.
               "No, Milly," said Alice, gently, "you could not think so. I found it out for
                  myself, but not long before he went away, and I have had no news of him
                  since."
               Milly found herself wondering at this; perhaps Alice loved him without return.
                  Milly softened into a kinder mood.
               "Nor have I," said she; "so we have reached the conclusion of the episode; and now
                  we can talk of something else."
               "Not quite yet, dear Milly. I must understand why you disliked me so much. Tell me
                  why you broke your engagement, Milly."
               This question brought back too plainly the night when she had parted with
                  Halford—the kiss she had seen him press on Alice's hand—the broken words she had
                  heard him speak.
               "I think we had better end here," said she, slowly.
               "What made you start, dearest Milly? You say you don't love him?"
               "I was thinking of you, rather than of him," Milly said, forcing herself to speak
                  calmly. "I was thinking how odd that we two should be here together, and that you
                  should ask me this question."
               "Now tell me what you mean, Milly."
               "At all events, I did not mean to say that."
               "But you have said it; you must explain. Child, I have reason to think that I had
                  a share in your trouble. You vexed me often, and I fancied that you liked Halford,
                  and wanted to tease you. Can you forgive such meanness?"
               "Easily—now."
               "After I was certain of your engagement, I did not want to do any harm; but I
                  thought it only a kindness to you both to teach you to be less impulsive and
                  exacting. It was very wicked of me. I did not know you."
               "But this—"
               "Wait, Milly! John Worthington's letter has shown me the truth. He tells me that
                  Halford, in one of his letters, told him that you were annoyed by our friendship.
                  Worthington wrote me this now, that I might try to set right any wrong I had done.
                  Oh, let me try, Milly! If you will show me your whole heart, I shall believe that
                  you have ceased to think harshly of me; and I, too, need a little tenderness,
                  Milly, oh, so much! What did I do?"
               "There is no need to go back over the past," Milly said; "it is dead and gone—let
                  it rest! I don't dislike you now."
               "You must tell me what share I had in your trouble."
               "I was jealous, if you will know," cried Milly; "he tormented me, I hated you
                  bitterly, but I blamed him none the less."
               "But he loved you, Milly, child! He loved you."
               Milly's penitent regret died out under fresh anger at these words.
               "Hush!" she said, harshly. "You say you wish me to believe you; don't make it
                  quite impossible. He loved you, Alice Marchmont, and you knew that he did."
               Her soul was full of bitterness. The old belief lief in Alice's falsity came back so strongly that
                  she longed to get away. She rose to leave the room, but Alice clung to her,
                  saying, vehemently,
               "You are wrong, child; he was good and true; he did not love me."
               "Oh, madam!" cried Milly, indignantly, "what can you gain by trying to cheat me
                  now? That night at the ball—that last night, when I saw him kiss your hand, I
                  heard him say—" She broke off with a shudder, and turned proudly aside, but Alice
                  held her hands fast.
               "Try to believe me, Milly," she pleaded; "let me tell you how it was."
               "You were free to love him," went on Milly. "The treachery was on his
                  side—treacherous to both, since he was my betrothed husband when he spoke those
                  words of love to you."
               "He never did—there is your error. Give me a moment, child, and I can explain all
                  this. I understand now—I remember that night—"
               "Then we need talk no more."
               "It is for that very reason you must listen; you were mistaken. Milly, don't
                  refuse to hear what may bring back peace to you."
               Milly made a violent effort, and conquered her passion. Alice held her hands,
                  looking up into her face, her lovely eyes misty with tears, and Milly's heart
                  believed, in spite of pride.
               "Go on," she said. "I will hear you."
               "Kenneth Halford and I were friends; we had been nothing else since my girlhood.
                  He knew all my life's story, more of my early wretchedness than any other person,
                  and it made a strong tie between us. You are listening, Milly, and believing?"
               "Yes, yes—go on," said Milly, with her face averted.
               "I liked you," pursued Alice; "you were so very pretty—like a flower or a picture.
                  I did not know you really cared for him. At last it was rumored that you were
                  engaged. I thought he would have told me if it were true. You grew dreadfully rude
                  to me, and I vexed you in return; but I had not the most distant idea of
                  destroying your future peace."
               "Go on," said Milly, softly.
               "You were capricious with Mr. Halford. You made him think that he had been
                  mistaken in you, that you were jealous and tyrannical, and that your love could
                  never bring him the rest and peace he craved, perhaps too selfishly. Do you see
                  this?"
               "I have no wish to exculpate myself. I did wrong; but at least I was true! I loved
                  him, and he—"
               "Wait, Milly, I am coming to that—that last night. You did behave badly; he was
                  hurt, and angry; and I was in such a reckless mood—if you could know what I was
                  living through—Milly, I was like the man who had a sword suspended over his head
                  by a hair, and knew that the blow might fall at any moment!"
               Milly drew both the shaking hands into hers with a sudden pity, and held them
                  fast.
               "We were standing in that little room; he had told me of his engagement to you,
                  and his fears that he had been mistaken in your character. I answered that I
                  thought you a child; but since it was youth and innocence that he coveted, he must
                  be content. I told him he was wrong not to show you more of his true self, and
                  teach you to come up where he stood, if he really loved you. 'I do love her,' he
                  said; 'she is my last hope of happiness;' and, Milly, I am sure he meant it."
               Milly listened breathlessly now.
               "Then he began talking all sorts of nonsense and bitter misanthropy. He said at
                  last that he was a greater fool than he had thought; that he had never believed he
                  could be so weak as to love as he did; then broke off, laughing, ashamed, I
                  suppose, that I should see how much he suffered, said something about my being a
                  sweet comforter, and, just out of a man's foolish gallantry, kissed my hand, and
                  hurried away. A moment after, I saw you in the room. I can see how it all appeared
                  to you, Milly; but now, surely, you believe me—say that you do."
               "Yes," answered Milly; "I can not doubt you."
               "Then you forgive me, too, dear, my share in your suffering?"
               "Wait, Alice, till I can think. It is I, you know, who need forgiveness."
               "And are you satisfied now—you are at rest; you exonerate Kenneth Halford from any
                  charge of deceit?"
               "Entirely, dear friend; I see it all clearly now."
               "And you are glad again—you hope?"
               There was no responsive pressure to the hand which held Milly's. Alice looked in
                  her face in surprise.
               "What is it?" she urged; "what is it you are thinking of now?"
               "I thank Heaven that I have not loved a man unworthy," Milly answered, drying a
                  few quiet tears. "I am full of remorse for the bitterness I cherished in my heart
                  during those black days, grateful to God that I have since tried to be less
                  wicked; for if this news had come to me in their midst, I should have been
                  overpowered by shame at my sin against the Father in losing hope and faith."
               "And that is all, Milly?"
               "That is all! Glad to know you thoroughly; for I love you now, dear Mrs.
                  Marchmont, and always shall."
               "And I love you, too, and want you to be happy."
               "I shall grow so, if I try to fulfill my duties. You know there is no other real
                  happiness."
               "But there is another happiness, dear child; and it is not too late to find
                  it."
               "Hush! Alice."
               "Does not the confirmation of his truth bring back your old love, your old hopes,
                  Milly?"
               "No, Alice; I feel that the past is irrevocable."
               "Not to you—not to you, with nothing to blot out but the remembrance of a lover's
                  quarrel."
               "Oh, Alice! Kenneth Halford and I are separated forever; and it is better so,"
                  Milly said, her voice breaking a little. "He never loved me as I really was—he
                  loved his own ideal. He was wrong to patronize and look down upon me, and—and I
                  was outraged by perceiving it. It was not wholly the foolish jealousy of a girl. I
                  had always the feeling of a woman who is slighted and underrated."
               "But every thing would be so different now."
               "Not in the least, believe me. He wanted a child's love—to be looked up to and
                  worshiped quite blindly, and without question. I am not that child. The man who
                  loves me will and must respect me, too, and feel that there is no depth in his
                  soul I could not reach, no aspiration that I am unfit to share."
               "How firm and stern you are! I thought you were only influenced by your belief in
                  his falsehood."
               "Now that doubt is quite past, the other causes which must sooner or later have
                  separated us do not lose their importance."
               "But when I tell you that he did so love you—"
               "Don't mock me with the word, dear friend; you and I know what love really is.
                  There are many girls content to remain children all their lives, to take only a
                  vicarious interest in the things which occupy their husband's hearts and minds;
                  you do not think me such a one?"
               "No, Milly, you are not, indeed."
               "And since it was such a wife Kenneth Halford wanted, he could never really love
                  me. By this time he will have forgotten his dream. I had not passed deep enough
                  into his life to be long regretted."
               "I can not believe that, Milly."
               "Well, if he regrets me, it is as one misses a favorite flower, a bird, any trifle
                  with which one amused the leisure hours of his life."
               "If he could see you as you really are."
               "You forget that it would be the strongest reason of all for not loving me. I am
                  not a child, and it is a child he longs for, not a woman. Would you have me call
                  him back, if it were possible, to be disappointed anew? No, I am sure you would
                  not. My life is tranquil; leave it me."
               Alice urged her no further; she only sighed,
               "It is so dreary to be quite alone; life is sometimes so heavy."
               "Perhaps not in time, dear Alice; I believe not."
               "Ah! you can hope it. I am older than you. I have had a trouble more sharp; but it
                  seems to me that life is very dark, without one strong and tender friend. Ah me!
                  But go you to bed; I needn't keep you up listening to my wailings."
               They talked for a while longer. Alice persuaded her to relate every circumstance
                  connected with the broken engagement; then she sent her away, insisting that she
                  could sleep if left alone.
               She spent the night almost as wakefully as she had done so many others, but at
                  least it held one means of relief. She wrote a long letter to Kenneth Halford,
                  and, when it was finished, she murmured to herself,
               "At all events, I can do so much; thank God for that!"
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVII.
               INTO THE LIGHT.
               THE next day Milly found Mrs. Marchmont suffering less physical pain, but she knew
                  the instant she looked in her face that no sleep had visited the hollow, mournful
                  eyes during the whole night.
               Alice talked, and tried to be herself, keeping so resolutely away from any serious
                  subject that it was not until nearly night that Milly could induce her to listen
                  to Mr. Worthington's urgent requests for admission.
               "I must see him," Alice said; "I have just been trying to put it off. I am such a
                  coward."
               Several times she had uttered vague hints of the sort, but Milly could demand no
                  explanations.
               "He is very anxious about you," she said. "I think he suffers a good deal, too,
                  with his arm."
               "Oh yes, he was hurt; I forgot it—selfish wretch! Go and tell him to come up,
                  Milly. To-morrow I'll see your aunt, too. I am ashamed to have behaved so
                  ill."
               Milly assisted her to rise and dress, established her in an easy-chair, and went
                  in search of Mr. Worthington, beginning to perceive that there was a deeper
                  feeling hidden in both hearts than the old friendship which she had believed the
                  tie that bound them.
               He came into the room, and Alice's last effort at self-control gave way; she could
                  only bury her face in her hands and weep silently. He sat down, soothed her back
                  to quiet by his gentle words, and at last she could look up and talk connectedly,
                  and try to thank him for his goodness.
               "But you have not told me why you ceased writing," he said, after they had talked
                  for a long time.
               The color flickered across her cheeks as she answered, with an attempt at her old
                  playfulness.
               "You can't expect me to have grown quite free from caprices in little more than a
                  year."
               "Was it because I wrote something that I ought not?" he asked. "Were you afraid I
                  would trouble you with my foolish wishes? You should have remembered that I had
                  promised never to do so again."
               "No, no; not that!" she replied, faltering. "I knew that was not likely to happen;
                  it was the impulse of a moment; even an angel's pity could not—"
               
               "Alice, Alice!" he interrupted, "you know what made me speak—you must know."
               "Yes," she said, "and I did full justice to your goodness! You pitied me so; but I
                  couldn't let your pity make you forget. I couldn't be any man's wife, least of all
                  yours."
               "I never thought to tell you my story," he said, "but I must; then, if you bid me,
                  I will go away. Alice, I have loved you all these years! I never spoke, for fear
                  it should break up our pleasant friendship; but I loved you as passionately, as
                  devotedly as ever woman was loved."
               "You loved me!" she said, almost in a frightened voice. "You loved me!"
               "Always—with the full strength of my heart. When that trouble came, I loved you
                  more fondly than ever I thought; every day since you have grown closer and closer
                  to my soul. Perhaps I oughtn't to say this. I don't mean to trouble you."
               "Oh, John Worthington, John Worthington, it isn't that! But how could you love me?
                  how could you care for me?"
               "I suppose nobody ever was able to answer that question, Alice; but I do love
                  you—the one love of my life. I love you so truly that even if you can never care
                  for me I will not trouble you by my pain."
               "You have been an angel to me!" she said, brokenly. "No one was ever like you. All
                  these years you have been my ideal of every thing that was noble and good."
               "Alice! Alice! do you know what you are saying? Do you know what hope you are
                  giving me?"
               "Ought I?" she asked, simply as a child. "Do you tell me what is right, John
                  Worthington."
               "Try to love me, Alice; to understand how boundless my affection is for you—how
                  lonely the rest of my life must be if we separate again. Could you try,
                  Alice?"
               She hid her face in her hands, but he heard her voice, low and firm now,
               "I think I must have loved you all the while; but this last year taught me
                  plainly. I missed you so! oh, I missed you so!"
               John Worthington folded her in his arms, with the thankful content of a man who
                  has found the realization of a life's fondest wish, and she wept her tears of
                  gratitude upon his shoulder.
               For a time neither of them could talk much, but it was easier at length; and then
                  there was so much to say, that Milly, waiting in her chamber, grew a little
                  impatient of the long interview. All the evening they sat together, and Alice
                  thought that she must have passed into another world. Every thing was settled for
                  her; she had no need to make decisions, to weary herself with fears or doubts. She
                  put her trust in his assurances, and was at rest.
               Mrs. Remsen and Milly were to be induced to accompany them to Edinburgh. Miss
                  Portman would join them there.
               "Then I shall have you fast," he said; "my wife, my own wife!"
               "Not so soon; I am not fit. Wait till you are sure I mean to be worthy—oh,
                  John!"
               But the strong arm was drawing her closer again.
               "I want my happiness," he pleaded; "I can't afford to wait any longer; this
                  dreadful year of loneliness is enough. Alice, my darling, for you and me the past
                  is dead; between you and the merciful Father it will be a bond to bring you closer
                  to Him."
               He would have it so, and she had nothing more to urge. It was so sweet to rest
                  upon his decision, and know that it must be right.
               In less than four weeks the news of the marriage reached America; and though
                  people in general thought it sufficiently extraordinary, they were obliged to
                  admit the suitability of the match.
               After the departure of the newly-wedded pair, Mrs. Remsen and Milly lingered in
                  the neighborhood of that most picturesque of cities, sending for Miss Gorham and
                  the children to join them.
               September came, and on one of its loveliest evenings Kenneth Halford opened the
                  gate of the pretty cottage where Milly and her aunt had made their home for a
                  time. He had been a very unhappy man during his wanderings, finding that his love
                  for Milly was a deeper-seated sentiment than he had himself recognized. He learned
                  to think of her, not as the spoiled child whom he had wished to direct, and by
                  whom he was to be blindly worshiped, but as the true woman into which he saw his
                  love might have developed her. Then Alice Marchmont's letter reached him, and he
                  hastened away to try if life might not yet win peace and rest.
               Milly had been out among the woods and fields. Toward sunset she reached the grove
                  which crowned the hill back of the house, and sat down on a rustic bench to watch
                  the crimson and white clouds sweep up the west. 
                     Siting
                     Sitting
                   there in the gathering brightness, Milly's thoughts went back to the old
                  days, and the dream which had beautified her youth—thinking sadly, as she seldom
                  now allowed herself to do, of all that might have been, of the fulfillment of hope
                  which might have reached her had she been more patient, more ready to leave her
                  destiny in higher hands.
               Milly had learned to be content, satisfied to pluck the little flowers which grow
                  up in our daily paths, but which most of us crush unconsciously under our feet,
                  while staring away into the future and the unattainable. Milly knew that, with no
                  great love to brighten existence, her life, regarded by itself, must appear a
                  little faded, a little solitary; but she was trying not to live for herself, not
                  to dignify selfishness by some poetical name; therefore she was able to endure the
                  lack of warmth and coloring, and look bravely forward along the appointed
                  path.
               And while she thought, and sternly told herself that she had a great deal to be
                  thankful for, some one came quickly up the hill from the cottage. She raised her
                  eyes at the sound of footsteps, and there Kenneth Halford stood before her, his
                  hands stretched out in eager welcome, his voice calling,
               "Milly! Milly!"
               She could not rise or speak; the meeting was so unexpected that his presence
                  seemed scarcely real.
               "Won't you speak to me, Milly? Won't you at least say that you are glad to see
                  me?"
               He caught her hands, and held them fast while he poured out the story of his
                  contrition and suffering.
               "I have come to ask your pardon, Milly; will you grant it? As soon as we were
                  parted I saw how blind and mad I had been! I did think you a child, Milly; but I
                  loved you with all my heart. I could see when too late how my man's arrogance had
                  made me hard and cruel. I knew that it was I who had been wrong; I longed so for
                  your forgiveness; shall I have it, Milly?"
               "If you felt like that, think what my feelings were," Milly answered, when she
                  could reply. "I have learned how falsely I suspected you, how wicked I was. Oh,
                  you can never forgive that!"
               "Mrs. Marchmont wrote me the whole story, Milly; I don't wonder you doubted me.
                  You are not to blame; it was all my fault—my selfishness that caused the whole
                  trouble. Can you forgive me?"
               "As entirely as you have forgiven me."
               "Can you trust me with your heart again?" he urged. "Can you love me once more,
                  Milly?"
               She turned her face away, but her voice was steady, almost solemn, as she
                  answered.
               "I never ceased to love you, Kenneth—not for a day or an hour."
               It was the old, old story, which is always beautiful, always new—the story of love
                  and reconciliation—the true love which knows upon what it is built, and has
                  learned to treasure its blessings aright.
               "To think that I have wasted so many months of our lives," Halford said, after
                  they had talked deep into he twilight. "We might have been happy all this dismal
                  season, which seems a century to look back on."
               Milly shook her head and smiled.
               "No, Kenneth, we should not have been happy; the trouble must have come. We began
                  wrong; I was too ignorant, too undisciplined, for peace to have been
                  possible."
               But he could only see his own error, and lament his own blindness and folly.
               "I think I am humbled now, Milly. I know that all that is purest and best in my
                  life must come from you—that all my great joys must depend upon you, every care be
                  lightened by your sympathy. I know that I am honored by your love; the sole reason
                  I can believe there is any good left in me is because you are able to care for
                  me."
               "Oh, Kenneth!"
               Milly's voice was so sweet as she uttered the name which he had not heard since he
                  left her, to wander among careless strangers; Milly's eyes so beautiful, as she
                  raised them to his face with her whole soul shining from their depths, that he
                  could only fold her to his heart again, and let the common world drift out of
                  sight, leaving them alone in their glorified Eden—just them alone.
               They were married at once. There is nothing more to tell.
               Two winters afterward, Mrs. Remsen gave a grand party in honor of their return
                  home. Adelaide Ramsay was there, looking like a peripatetic jewelry shop;
                  Hortense, talking right and left to whoever would listen, about some wonderful
                  theory in regard to a man's having three separate souls; and Charley Thorne,
                  seeming contented enough with Maud by his side.
               John Worthington and his wife were there, too, and it seemed to Alice that, as she
                  leaned on her husband's arm, and gazed at Milly's radiant face, the last troubled
                  memory swept away forever into the oblivion of the past.
               Dick Faulkner had already disappeared from the haunts which once knew him, had
                  almost faded out of the recollections of those who called themselves his friends.
                  In the financial ruin which overtook him, he would have fared still worse, had not
                  his wife received from the woman he had so cruelly tormented, a check, signed,
                  like the note for which Alice Marchmont periled her soul, with John Worthington's
                  name.
            
            THE END.

                  Vincent's Land of the White Elephant.
                  The Land of the White Elephant: Sights and Scenes in Southeastern Asia. A
                     Personal Narrative of Travel and Adventure in Farther India, embracing the
                     Countries of Burma, Siam, Cambodia, and Cochin-China (1871-2). By FRANK
                     VINCENT, Jr. Magnificently illustrated with Map, Plans, and numerous Woodcats.
                     Crown 8vo, Cloth, $3 50.
                  "This new work of Oriental travel and adventure presents fresh, accurate, and
                     original information about Farther India and its people. It is not padded with
                     historical, political, ethnographical, or geographical matter obtained at
                     second-hand from books, but is a record of the author's own travels and
                     observations. The chapters which treat of Burma and Cambodia, including full
                     descriptions of their kings and courts, and of Cochin-China, carry the reader
                     through entirely untrodden fields; while the chapters relating to Siam, besides
                     a complete account of Bangkok, the king, and palace, contain a very interesting
                     narrative of a long journey made through the heart of the kingdom, and a
                     carefully written, popular description, now for the first time published, of
                     the magnificent ruins of Angkor, on its eastern frontier. The work is
                     splendidly illustrated with engravings, maps, and plans, and is in all respects
                     one of the most interesting and valuable books of Eastern travel ever given to
                     the public."
                  Farther India is still more or less a sealed book to most of us, and one could
                     not desire a more pleasant tutor in fresh geographical lore than our author. He
                     won our heart at once by plunging in medias
                        res, instead of devoting a chapter to the outward voyage; and he
                     tells us sensibly and intelligently, in a natural and unaffected style, what he
                     saw and heard.—John Bull. London.
                  "The Land of the White Elephant," by Mr. Vincent, is another instance of the
                     superiority of your countrymen over ours in the writing of books of travel, as
                     a general rule. For directness, for saying what he has to say straight off, and
                     beginning at the really interesting and important portion of his travels at
                     once, instead of reiterating old descriptions which every one has read a score
                     of times, Mr. Frank Vincent is almost unique and his book a model. It is
                     rendered additionally interesting by the extraordinary changes which are taking
                     place in Siam, that remote and wonderful land now making strides toward the
                     adoption of Western civilization more energetic than those of the "Land of the
                     Rising Sun" itself.—London correspondence of the N. Y.
                     Herald.
                  The work presents us with a personal narrative of travel and adventure in
                     Farther India, embracing the countries of Burma, Siam, Cambodia, and
                     Cochin-China. Mr. Vincent is an American gentleman, and his travels took place
                     in the years 1871-2, so that his volume has the great advantage of reflecting
                     the actual existing state of these lands.—Daily News,
                     London.
                  This is in many respects a model book of travel. For once a traveler eschews
                     any thing like bookmaking, and, although Mr. Vincent visited India and China,
                     Ceylon and Japan, he limits his narrative to lands that are far less familiar
                     to us. The route he describes in his volume led him up the Irrawaddy to
                     independent Burma; thence, returning to Rangoon, he made the circuit of the
                     Malay Peninsula, and, after a visit to the kingdom of Siam, made his way
                     through Cambodia to the French settlements in Cochin-China. The volume is
                     profusely and excellently illustrated, and convenient maps add to its value.
                     Mr. Vincent gives a plain but pleasant account of all that struck him as best
                     worth noting. * * * In many ways the journey was extremely interesting, and,
                     what is more to our present purpose, it was a journey extremely interesting to
                     read about. * * * The whole of his book is worth reading, as giving the latest
                     observations of an intelligent traveler over countries that are rapidly
                     changing their characteristics.—Pall Mall Gazette, London.
                  We are inclined to assign to this book a place of foremost interest among the
                     travel books of the year. The architectural and sculptural plates alone add
                     immensely to its value.—Examiner, London.
                  A not unwelcome addition to our knowledge of the Indo-Chinese peninsulas. It is
                     written in a clear and unaffected style. It is descriptive of forests, lakes,
                     rivers, capitals, and ruins. It shows the author to be possessed of some of the
                     qualities indispensable to successful exploration—energy, endurance of heat,
                     fatigue, and petty annoyances, good humor, quickness of observation, and
                     intelligence. Its value is enhanced by two or three maps throwing light on some
                     disputed points of geography, as well as by many excellent engravings which
                     place before us the pagodas with their wonderful tracery and the reigning
                     monarchs in their robes of State.—Saturday Review, London.
               
               
                  
                  Evangelical Alliance Conference, 1873.
                  History, Essays, Orations, and Other Documents of the Sixth General Conference
                     of the Evangelical Alliance, held in New York, October 2-12, 1873. Edited by
                     Rev. PHILIP SCHAFF, D.D,. and Rev. S. IRENÆUS PRIME, D.D. With Portraits of
                     Rev. Messrs. Pronier, Carrasco, and Cook, recently deceased. 8vo, Cloth, nearly
                     800 pages, $6 00.
                  About one hundred men, from various parts of the world, eminent for learning,
                     ability, and worth, holding high rank in theology, philosophy, science, and
                     literature, men of genius, power, and fame, were carefully selected, and
                     invited to prepare themselves, by months and years of study, for the discussion
                     of themes of immediate and vital importance. They were chosen, as the men of
                     thought and purpose best fitted to produce Treatises which should exhibit, in
                     the most thorough and exhaustive form, the TRUTH, as sustained by the Holy
                     Scripture and the most advanced and enlightened human reason. The results of
                     this concentrated thought and labor are embodied in this volume.
                  Rarely has a volume issued from the press which contained a more varied and
                     extensive array of talent and experience.
                  The vital topics of Evangelical Theology, the delicate relations of Science and
                     Religion, the difficult subjects of practical Benevolence, Philanthropy, and
                     Reform are here discussed by clear, sound, and experienced minds. Pulpit
                     orators, of renown and recognized position, have contributed to this volume
                     their best productions.
                  It is, in short, a library of Christian thought and learning—the latest
                     expression of master-minds upon the important topics that are now moving the
                     Christian world—and should be read by all who would be educated in the thought
                     of the age.

                  He has written a pleasant volume of personal gossip, detailing in a frank,

                  Mr. Field, in jotting down these recollections, has not endeavored to write
                     history, or even biography, but just gossip. It is gossip, nevertheless, so
                     bright and entertaining, and affording so vivid a view of the informal domestic
                     or social life of the persons concerned, that it is more interesting than
                     elaborate biography could have been.—Boston Journal.
                  
                  Mr. Field's anecdotes are bright and clear; are told with a facile pen and an

                  Bulwer's The Parisians.
                  The Parisians. A Novel. By EDWARD BULWER, Lord Lytton, Author of "The Coming
                     Race," "Kenelm Chillingly," "A Strange Story," "The Caxtons," "My Novel,"
                     &c., &c. With Illustrations by SYDNEY HALL. 12mo, Cloth, $1 50; 8vo,
                     Paper, $1 00.
                  * * * Lord Lytton was as much a dramatist as a novelist, and his plots were
                     always carefully woven. Down to the very last chapter of "The Parisians" our
                     interest is skillfully kept not alive but glowing. * * * In a word, "The
                     Parisians" is its author's ripest work. Lytton's aftermath is in many ways a
                     richer crop than his spring yielded. Graces of style, acquired by long labor,
                     have grown into a second nature. * * * We have the last novel of a novelist
                     who, conscious of the lapse of time, is consciously writing for posterity. Many
                     will read it often: none need regret to have carefully read it
                        once.—Athenæum, London.
                  It is one of the most characteristic and remarkable of its author's works. The
                     book is characteristic in the fact that we find in it some of the more obvious
                     points that distinguish Bulwer purely as a novelist. There is the carefully
                     conceived and elaborately involved, but always artistically arranged and
                     developed plot. in which this writer surpassed all his contemporaries. There
                     are characters, like Graham Vane and Victor de Mauleon, which so bear the stamp
                     of his mind that one could hardly be misled into doubting their parentage.
                     There are ripened fruits of that spirit of observation that long since passed
                     out of its crude stage. Nearly the whole panorama of French life which it
                     furnishes may be said to be of this stamp. The Marquis de Rochebriant, Frederic
                     Lemercier, Raoul and Enguerrand de Vandemar, Louvier, Savarin, Gustave Rameau,
                     are all strong types of character, and together put France in her recent era
                     more perfectly before the reader than she has ever been presented by any writer
                     with whom we are familiar, in any form. * * * The book is a credit both to the
                     heart and the head of Bulwer in the declining years of his life, and is an
                     admirable legacy of the ripest stage of his mind. The two posthumous
                     productions of his pen, "Kenelm Chillingly" and "The Parisians," are scarcely
                     inferior in interest as novels to any thing he wrote, and in acuteness of
                     observation, wisdom and purity of reflection, and almost perfect polish of
                     literary style, they surpass all his previous works. The close of his career is
                     crowned with its noblest offering. * * * It pictures Paris before its fall. We
                     see in it Louis Napoleon upon the throne. We find in it the secret of the
                     strength that made this the splendid and dazzling point of power that it
                     presented to the world for years before it toppled and fell; and we see, also,
                     the causes, both in social life and in public profligacy, that were surely
                     undermining this apparently impregnable prosperity. These were never so
                     graphically analyzed and laid bare. * * * Few things in literature are finer
                     than the description of the social condition of France which made her so easy a

                  That "The Parisians," though incomplete, is the greatest production of Lord
                     Lytton's pen, will, we think, be the general verdict. It has greater breadth of
                     plan, a larger scope, and is informed with a higher and more matured
                     philosophical spirit than any of his other works. * * * Every one who takes up
                     the book is lured on from page to page by a fascination which never relaxes its
                     hold upon the mind. We follow, with increasing interest, the fortunes of the
                     various characters of the story, because we insensibly become interested in
                        them, as we do in living characters. At every step we feel the
                     charm of the author's style, of his incisive wit, of his keen, clear
                     observation. The volume abounds in brilliant sayings, as well as profound ones.
                     The author never allows himself or any of his characters to inflict dullness on
                     the reader, and whether speaking in his own person or through another, avoids
                     the fatal error of prosing. There are chapters and books in "The Parisians" on
                     which the reader dwells with special pleasure, and to which every one will turn
                     back with delight for a reperusal; but there is none which he will feel
                     inclined to skip in the hurry to get on with the story.—Boston
                        Journal.
                  
                  The author has set before himself the task of painting French society in Paris
                     in the last days of the Second Empire, and he has accomplished this task,
                     foreigner as he was, with a skill which a born Frenchman might well envy. As an
                     historical fiction "The Parisians" stands higher than "Rienzi" or the "Last
                     Days of Pompeii." It is a satire in the sense that it remorselessly depicts the
                     follies and crimes of the imperialist regime, and is a far abler satire than
                     the "Now Timon." It is more brilliant in its epigrammatic wit than "Pelham,"
                     and smoother in the flow of its narrative than "Kenelm Chillingly." * * * It
                     will always be treated by students of literature with the respect due to a
                     brilliant and exceptionably able novel.—N. Y. World.
                  
                  On every page of "The Parisians" we find evidences of the painstaking, thorough
                     preparation for his task which distinguishes all the works of Lord Lytton. * *
                     * "The Parisians" is a rare and noteworthy instance of the successful artistic
                     use of contemporary history for the purposes of fiction. * * * His aim was to
                     portray, through the living medium of fiction, the social and political
                     condition of France at the close of the second empire, and we hazard the
                     statement that no future historian will give a more faithful or more graphic
                     picture of the France and the Paris of '69 and '70 than is to be found in the
                     pages of this novel. * * * The reader who takes it up will not willingly lay it
                     down until the last page is reached, and he will rise from its perusal with the
                     conviction that it is a work worthy of a place by the side of "The Caxtons" and
                     "My Novel."—N. Y. Evening Post.

                  "Traveling, not in the footsteps of Sir Samuel Baker, but in a westerly
                     direction, Dr. Schweinfurth reached the neighborhood of Baker's Lake, and,
                     passing through the country of the Niam-Niam, he remained for some months in
                     the hitherto unknown kingdom of Monbuttoo. In a geographical sense, his book
                     will contribute in an important degree to the solution of the Nile problem; and
                     ethnologically it will tend to set at rest the disputed question as to the
                     existence of a dwarf race in Central Africa. Dr. Schweinfurth is an
                     accomplished draughtsman, and his work is elaborately illustrated from his own

                     who have longed to know something more of a country so intimately connected
                     with the history of the Israelites. Pleasantly written and well illustrated,
                     the narrative sustains its interest throughout, and gives a vivid picture of
                     the present condition of the country.—Athenæum, London.
                  The volume has all the interest of a drama, and will be a rich feast to the
                     reader who comes to its perusal with the eagerness all Christians feel in those
                     countries which were the scene of all the events and most of the prophecies
                     recorded in Holy Writ. It is written, too, in the choice language Canon
                     Tristram knows so well how to use. Altogether this book is one delightful to
                     read, and full of information.—The Presbyterian.

                  Among our Sailors.
                  By J. GREY JEWELL, M.D., late United States Consul, Singapore. With an Appendix
                     containing Extracts from the Laws and Consular Regulations Governing the United
                     States Merchant Service. 12mo, Cloth, $1 50.
                  Mr. Jewell was for some years United States Consul at Singapore, and in that
                     station he had an opportunity to note the abuses of the American merchant
                     marine. His book is mainly to call attention to the injustice with which
                     officers and men are treated, in the hope that legislation and philanthropic
                     effort will correct the abuses of which he complains. As a whole it is an
                     excellent work, and will unquestionably do good in the way intended.—N.
                        Y. World.
                  
                  An exceedingly intelligent, instructive, and entertaining work. Every page in
                     the volume is freighted with telling revelations of the sea. No space is wasted
                     with idle rhetoric. Similar narratives have been published in fragmentary style
                     in the current news of the day for many years, but no other effort within our
                     recollection has been made to bring the facts together in a form calculated to
                     constitute a thrilling and powerful appeal, such as we have before us now.
                     "Among our Sailors" is a deserving book, and it will be more talked about among
                     the classes to which it addresses itself than any work that has reached them in
                     many years.—Brooklyn Eagle.
                  
                  It is very seldom that we meet with a book which is more useful, and withal
                     more interesting, than this. The condition of our sailors, the hardships, often
                     amounting to cruelties and oppressions, which they undergo, the relations
                     subsisting between ordinary seamen and a ship's officers, form an important
                     chapter in the life of one of the most valuable sections of the people. The
                     peculiar circumstances that surround the life of a sailor, his ignorance of the
                     means of obtaining redress, and the short time that he usually remains on
                     shore, deprive him of the opportunity, afforded to most other persons, of
                     submitting his grievances openly to the world. Dr. Jewell has, therefore, done
                     a good work in taking up a cause which, for these and other reasons, has too
                     long been left unnoticed. It is a work which, so far as we are aware, has never
                     before been attempted in this country; but it has fallen, at last, into
                     efficient hands, and the result is a book that should be read by every one who
                     has the interests of the American mercantile marine at heart. A long practical
                     experience has given Dr. Jewell ample qualification for the duty he has
                     undertaken: and while, by a clear explanation of the laws, some of which he has
                     either in whole or in part added, he has furnished a valuable manual for the
                     sea-faring community, he has also, by the vivid narrative of facts and the
                     accumulation of much minute detail, supplied a most interesting book to the
                     general reader.—N. Y. Times.

                     WADDY. 8vo, Paper, 40 cents.
                  "This capital sea-story grew out of the popular agitation aroused in England by
                     Mr. Plimsoll's startling exposé of the abuse
                     of sending unseaworthy and over-loaded ships to sea, so heavily insured that
                     their loss would be profitable to the owners and shippers. The adventures which
                     make up the narrative of 'ship Ahoy!' have their parallels in actual
                     experience, but with them is interwoven a romantic love-story which awakens the
                     reader's sympathy and maintains his interest to the close. 'Ship Ahoy!' forms
                     an excellent pendant to Dr. Jewell's work, 'Among our Sailors,' recently
                     published, in which public attention is called to many flagrant abuses to which
                     American sailors are subjected."

                     Cloth, $1 50.
                  The title of this volume is explained by the familiar story of Sydney Smith,
                     who described his living in Yorkshire as being so out of the way that it was
                     actually "twelve miles from a lemon," and consequently a like distance from all
                     the other elements of punch and civilization. Miss Dodge apparently lives at
                     much the same distance from Boston, and regarding Boston and lemons as synonyms
                     of civilization, she has written a volume of sprightly little essays and
                     sketches relating for the most part to the humors and infelicities of suburban
                     life. In many respects it is the most entertaining of her numerous books. It is
                     simply a volume of brilliant, witty, and audacious gossip, touching upon
                     countless topics, and perpetually moving the reader to pleased or sardonic
                        mirth.—World, N. Y.
                  It is written in the curt, crisp, self-assertive, and somewhat aggressive style
                     in which the author is fond of propounding her theories and
                        fancies.—Herald, N. Y.
                  The book is not only readable, but it will be read; its clever treatment of the
                     petty trivialities of everyday life, and its outbreak from these into the
                     broader atmosphere of right and wrong, alike commend it to the everyday
                        reader.—Evening Mail, N. Y.
                  This is a light, airy, and pleasant book, containing some hard hits at the
                     follies, mistakes, pretensions, and extravagances of the
                        times.—Episcopalian, Phila.
                  Gail Hamilton is one of those writers who are never dull. Her manner may be
                     considered jerky and fantastic, but there is always point in her sallies, and a
                     vast amount of good mother wit.—Inter-Ocean, Chicago.

                  A Princess of Thule. A Novel. By WILLIAM BLACK, Author of "Love or Marriage?'
                     "Kilmeny," "The Strange Adventures of a Phaeton," &c., &c. 8vo, Paper,
                     75 cents.
                  We have at least one nearly perfect novel. * * * His beautiful, his almost
                     perfect story. * * * There is a mingling of humor of the raciest, with pathos
                     most true, simple, and dignified.—Spectator, London.
                  This is not the first time that our author has shown himself capable of
                     describing a fascinating woman; and the excellent descriptions of natural
                     beauty, the thorough mastery of local peculiarities, the truth and accuracy
                     with which the local dialect and modes of thought are reproduced. * * * Those
                     who like novels of character will be amply gratified. Complete individuality
                     distinguishes all concerned.—Athenæum, London.
                  It is not of many novels it can be said they are good from the title to the
                     end, but this may be fairly remarked of Mr. Black's last work, to which he has
                     given so happily descriptive a title. Mr. Black never relies for effect upon
                     violent means. He contrives by delicate, subtle, but sure touches to win the
                     interest of his readers, and to retain it till the last volume is laid down
                     with reluctance. The characters of Sheila and her father, Mackenzie, ought to
                     have an enduring and recognized existence in fiction. * * * The "Princess of
                     Thule" is altogether a remarkable novel; it will add to the reputation which
                     Mr. Black has already made by his sincere and undeviating loyalty to the best
                     principles of the art in which he excels.—Globe, London.
                  If Mr. Black had written no other novel than this, he would have made himself a
                     high place in the republic of literature. It is witty, humorous, pathetic, and
                     throughout artistic.—Scotsman.
                  
                  It is quite refreshing to take up such a work of fiction. It is no exaggeration
                     to say that the story exercises a sort of fascination over the reader from the
                     first chapter to the last, and this by no fantastic spell, but by the charm of
                     the purest, truest, and most healthy sentiment.—Daily Telegraph,
                     London.
                  We do not remember to have read any where of a more wholly fascinating heroine
                     than Sheila.—Court Circular, London.
                  A novel which is both romantic and natural, which has much feeling without any
                     touch of mawkishness, which goes deep into character without any suggestion of
                     painful analysis—this is a rare gem to find among the débris of current literature, and this, or nearly this, Mr. Black
                     has given us in the "Princess of Thule." * * * His success, which is
                     undoubtedly great, is due to a careful study and competent knowledge of
                     character, to a style which is free from blemish, and to a power of graphic
                     description which is but very seldom met with.—Saturday Review,
                     London.
                  It is full of fine character-rendering, with the all-brightening thread of
                     humor glimmering out now and then. * * * A work of singular power and
                        delicacy.—British Quarterly Review.
                  
               
               
                  Christlieb on the Methods of Counteracting Infidelity.
                  The Best Methods of Counteracting Modern Infidelity. A Paper read before the
                     General Conference of the Evangelical Alliance, New York, October 6, 1873. By
                     THEODOR CHRISTLIEB, Ph.D., D.D., Professor of Theology and University Preacher
                     at Bonn, Prussia. 12mo, Flexible Cloth, 75 cents.
                  The public will not soon forget the powerful impression made during the recent
                     sessions of the Evangelical Alliance, by Dr. Christlieb, whose paper on "The
                     Best Methods of Counteracting Modern Infidelity" was read before the
                        Alliance.—Christian Union.
                  
                  This paper of Dr. Christlieb's is regarded as the ablest and best presented
                     before the Evangelical Alliance, and it has elevated him at once to the front
                     rank of Evangelical divines of the present age.—Lutheran
                        Observer.
                  
               
               
                  Diamond Cut Diamond.
                  A Story of Tuscan Life. By T. ADOLPHUS TROLLOPE, Author of "Lindisfarn Chase,"
                     "A Siren," "Durnton Abbey," &c. 12mo, Cloth, $1 25.
                  Many novels have been written of the people of this country, and "Diamond Cut
                     Diamond" is among the best of them. * * * The plot is symmetrical, and the
                     story is smoothly and pleasantly told.—N. Y. World.
                  
                  It reveals an interesting picture of social life in Italy, and is very cleverly
                        written.—Lutheran Observer.
                  
                  This is a tragic story of priestly interference in the private affairs of
                     domestic life—a thoughtful and well-written story. Mr. Trollope is a fine
                        writer.—Presbyterian.
                  
                  It is picturesque and extremely natural.—Universalist.
                  
                  The style is clear, and the descriptions entertaining.—The Christian
                        Advocate, Pittsburgh.
                  This well-told story.—The Episcopalian.
                  
                  We unhesitatingly place it among the highest of its class. Its plan is not a
                     complicated one. Its characters are few enough almost to be counted upon the
                     fingers of one hand. But for symmetry, attentiveness to detail, careful finish,
                     and general effect, we bestow upon it our warmest praise. * * * There is to our
                     eye something exquisite in the fullness of contour, sharpness of outline, and
                     richness of color with which it has been wrought by the writer. * * * It is, in
                     a true sense, a work of art.—The Congregationalist.
                  
                  The plot is happily conceived, and is worked out with great ability.—New
                        Bedford Standard.
