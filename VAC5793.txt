               CHAPTER I.
               THE CAVALCADE.
               IT was on a bright, beautiful morning, near the close of summer, in the year of
                  our Lord 1780, that a small cavalcade was seen ascending one of the romantic hills
                  that tower aloft and overlook the glassy Hudson, some forty miles above the city
                  of New York. This cavalcade was composed of eight grown persons and an infant, and
                  was moving slowly forward in double file. At the head of the procession rode a
                  rather fine-looking American officer, dressed with great care and precision, and
                  bedecked with all the trappings belonging to the high rank of a major-general. He
                  was about forty years of age, rather embonpoint
                  in figure, had a ruddy complexion, and, as was customary at that period, wore his
                  hair brushed back from his forehead and temples, clubbed, and neatly tied with a
                  dark ribbon behind. Every thing about this man bespoke a natural desire for pomp
                  and ostentatious display; and this vanity was clearly expressed in his
                  countenance, which is, after all, about as good an index of the heart as we can
                  find. His front face was oval, almost round, with prominent cheek-bones; a
                  handsome nose, inclined to the Roman; dark expressive eyes, full of intelligence
                  and fire; a massive, but retreating forehead, whose prominences along the line of
                  the brows denoted keen and active perceptive faculties; and a mouth and chin both
                  well formed, but around which lurked an expression both voluptuous and sinister.
                  That he was a man of the strongest and most violent passions, the discerning
                  physiognomist needed but a single glance to discover; and he could see, at the
                  same time, that he was a man of more daring than principle, although the outward
                  man too often showed the smooth-faced hypocrite. That he was vain, proud,
                  arrogant, voluptuous, grasping, tyrannical, revengeful, cunning, secretive,
                  seductive, prodigal, courageous even to rashness—in short, that he was a perfect
                  dare-devil, and a most selfish voluptuary, would have been discovered, almost
                  immediately by the close observer; while one relax in scrutiny, who judged men by
                  their speech and actions, rather than looks, might have known him for years as a
                  very clever, winning, agreeable gentleman, with no worse fault than being,
                  perhaps, at times a little too extravagant, headstrong, rash, and, we will even
                  add, benevolent, for his own good.
               This officer rode a coal-black steed, most gorgeously caparisoned, considering
                  that he belonged to the American service, and that our country was then struggling
                  with poverty against the richest and most powerful nation on the globe. Not that
                  we would contend against his right to equip
                  himself and steed in as costly a manner as his rank would allow; but when we take
                  into consideration that perhaps one-half of the very soldiers he had commanded
                  were now in a state little better than absolute starvation—that Congress was in a
                  great perplexity concerning the means of raising funds to continue the war, so
                  gloriously begun, to a successful issue—we can at least condemn this ostentation as being in decidedly bad
                  taste for one who pretended to have the good of his country solely at heart. The
                  housing of the General's steed was embroidered with gold; his saddle, bridle, and
                  martingale were mounted with gold; as were also his holster pistols, and the
                  handle of his sword; the latter having the additional foolish extravagance of
                  being studded with diamonds.
               By the side of the General, on a palfrey gorgeously caparisoned, rode a young and
                  beautiful female. To judge by her animated countenance and sparkling eyes, seen in
                  such pleasing contrast with those of her companion, as she turned her head from
                  side to side, with the eagerness and buoyancy of youth, to admire the majestic
                  scenery on every hand—shaking, by the motion, the long-flowing curls that fairly
                  wantoned in the breeze under her dark riding-cap, and played at hide-and-seek with
                  the ostrich plume that swept gracefully over it and down one side of her fair
                  face—to judge by her looks, we say, as thus seen, one would hardly think that more
                  than sixteen summers had rolled over her head. But she was older by several years,
                  and had seen more of life than one would have thought possible from her girlish
                  appearance, being already a wife and a mother.
               Next behind the two personages thus described, rode the two aids-de-camp of the
                  General, also finely equipped, and wearing the uniforms assigned to the rank of
                  major; and next behind these officers rode two black females, one of whom carried
                  an infant in her arms; while the rear-guard was composed of two black male
                  servants in livery.
               Having brought the whole party to your notice, reader, it may be as well to say
                  here of whom it was composed. The one first described was Major-General Benedict
                  Arnold; the lady by his side was his wife; the aids-decamp were Majors Varick and
                  Franks; the blacks were the household servants of the General, and the infant was
                  his own child by his present wife.
               At the moment introduced, the head of the cavalcade was just gaining the summit of
                  a high hill, which commanded one of the finest landscapes to be found in any part
                  of the world; and as it came suddenly upon the vision of the lady, she exclaimed
                  with enthusiasm, while a warm color came into her face, and her bright eyes fairly
                  danced with delight,
               "Beautiful! O, gloriously beautiful! is it not, dear Benedict?"
               "A very fine scene," answered the General, in a business-like tone, that rather
                  damped the girlish ardor of his young partner—for coldness and indifference check
                  enthusiasm, as water quenches fire.
               Mrs. Arnold gave her husband a reproachful look, pouted her pretty lips, and then
                  reining up her palfrey, turned her gaze again upon the scene, and became wholly
                  absorbed in contemplating the view before her.
               Had we the graphic pen of a Scott, or a Cooper, we should attempt to sketch the
                  scene in question, with some idea of giving the reader an outline of its beauties,
                  though with the certainty of coming so far short of the reality, as to make it but
                  a crude drawing; but with our own humble powers of description, it seems little
                  short of rashness to venture upon so grand an undertaking; and yet we can not in
                  justice let it pass unnoticed.
               Imagine, then, reader, that you are standing upon an eminence, which, if not as
                  high as some of the neighbouring hills, is at least sufficiently elevated to
                  command a view of all the others, and of all that lies immediately below you. You
                  stand with your face toward the east, and behold the bright sun of an unclouded
                  sky, some half an hour above the horizon, pouring a flood of mellow light upon
                  each object, and giving the animation of life to each inanimate thing you behold.
                  You cast your eye downward, and perceive a broad sheet of water, environed with
                  wild, romantic hills, that are in turn covered with trees, whose luxuriant
                  foliage, of various hues, relieves the view of all monotony, and gives to it such
                  a quiet, soothing, mysterious charm, that it seems you might gaze forever and not
                  grow wearied. This sheet of water, which lies before you, is from two to three
                  miles in breadth, and some six in length; and yet, from your high stand, and the
                  deceptive formation of the hills, you are almost led to believe that, with a
                  little extra exertion, you could cast a stone from one shore to the other. On the
                  side next to you, the sunlight rests bright and glorious, and the tiny wavelets,
                  formed by the soft breath of morning, sparkle as they roll, like so many jewels;
                  while the opposite side still lies in somber shadow, with the lofty hills, which
                  rise above it, as deeply, and with all the minuteness of nature herself, mirrored
                  in its dark, glassy bosom.
               This sheet of water forms that beautiful portion of the Hudson river, known as
                  Haverstraw Bay; and, as you gaze upon it, it seems like a pond, or lake, owing to
                  the peculiar formation of the encircling chains of hills, which cut off all
                  further view of the stream both to the north and south, where it narrows to its
                  ordinary width, and where, as it appears to you from your position, the
                  approaching hills unite and form one chain, instead of being two, divided by
                  water.
               At the northern extremity of this bay, you behold two fortifications, one on
                  either side of the river. The one farthest from you is called Verplank's Point,
                  and the one nearest to you, Stony Point. Between these two fortresses, which are
                  garrisoned by Americans, plies a boat, to convey passengers across; and this is
                  called King's Ferry. Just below you, looking toward Stony Point, and fairly
                  imbedded in the Dunderberg hills, is a small village, of the same name as the bay;
                  and just beyond this is Haverstraw Creek, which, finding its head-waters in the
                  mountains behind you, flows down through a fertile valley, and loses itself in the
                  Hudson. Still farther on, some two or three miles distant, you behold a solitary
                  mansion, with out-buildings, and grounds laid out in the good old English style,
                  and which are now in a high state of cultivation. From where you stand, a traveled
                  road passes directly through Haverstraw village, and continues along up the bank
                  of the river, over an undulating and mountainous country, running within a few
                  rods of this mansion, and conducting you direct to the ferry. Most of the country
                  is heavily wooded, but here and there an open spot bespeaks cultivation.
               The scene is grand and beautiful; and as you gaze upon it, lost in rapture, the
                  morning carols of the feathered songsters, the lowing of cattle, the chattering of
                  squirrels, the chirping and humming of insects and bees, make a lulling melody in
                  your ear, which you would not exchange for the artificial music of the greatest
                  masters.
               For several minutes Mrs. Arnold seemed entranced with the view before her; but the
                  General, who had halted by her side, grew more and more impatient every moment,
                  and at length said:
               "Come, my dear, when you can spare time, we will set forward, for Smith expects us
                  to breakfast; it is already getting late, and we have at least two good miles and
                  a half to ride. Yonder you see his mansion, a little off of this road."
               Mrs. Arnold turned upon the General a flashing eye, gave her head a haughty toss,
                  and tightening her grasp upon the bridle-rein, bestowed a severe cut with her
                  riding-whip upon the flanks of her palfrey, and, without deigning a reply, rode
                  away down the hill, at a pace that not only endangered her safety, but troubled
                  the General not a little to keep by her side.
               As the small cavalcade entered the little village of Haverstraw, the citizens all
                  came to the windows and doors to look at it; and many waved their handkerchiefs,
                  and made other demonstrations of joyful respect; while a few soldiers, that
                  chanced to be present, headed by a sergeant, drew up in military style, and
                  presented arms—during which the shrill notes of a fife, and the roll of a
                  kettle-drum, were heard in honor of the occasion.
               To all these tokens of respect, General Arnold scarcely deigned a nod, but rode
                  along with as much uncivil hauteur as if he were
                  a grand bashaw, receiving the homage of his slaves. But his arrogant bearing did
                  not add any thing to his greatness in the eyes of the simple-minded citizens of
                  Haverstraw, many of whom turned away in disgust, and made a very unfavorable
                  comparison between him and other American generals who had at different times
                  passed through the village. And one old woman even went so far as to let her
                  indignation be known to the General himself; for he had hardly passed her door,
                  when she called to a young man who stood near, in a loud, shrill voice:
               "Tommy, who is that ere man, that's got so much fillagree-work about him and his
                  hoss?"
               
               "Hush! mother," replied the one addressed, in a low voice, "that's General Arnold,
                  who's lately been appointed to the command at West Point."
               "O, that's General Arnold, hey?" almost screamed the old woman, determined he
                  should hear her; "that's the man as was court-martialed awhile ago! I've heard he
                  was a brave man, but I know he haint got much manners."
               Arnold heard every word of this, and he bit his nether lip till the blood sprang
                  through, and a dark frown, like a thunder-cloud, gathered upon his brow. But he
                  took no other notice of it, and did not turn his head toward the speaker, as did
                  none of the others, save the blacks, who looked at the old woman, and showed the
                  whites of their eyes, amazed that any one should dare speak so irreverently of
                  their master.
               A sharp ride of about twenty minutes brought the cavalcade to a gateway opening
                  into an avenue leading up to the mansion before spoken of, which stood on an
                  eminence, and commanded a view of the whole bay. As the party turned into the
                  inclosure, and rode up toward the mansion, they were met on the way by the host—a
                  tall, well-formed, good-natured looking gentleman, of thirty-five or
                  forty-years—who bowed very obsequiously to the General and his lady, and said
                  something about being too highly flattered in being honored with such
                  distinguished visitors.
               "We will let that pass," smiled Arnold, condescendingly, all traces of anger and
                  haughtiness having vanished from his countenance. "We will let that pass, Mr.
                  Smith, and beg you will present us to your good lady, with whom Mrs. Arnold is
                  anxious to become acquainted; and in doing so, we will consider honors divided,
                  and the obligation on our side."
               "What flatterers you great generals are, when the whim seizes you," returned the
                  overjoyed host. "No wonder you are always successful among the fair, as well as in
                  the field;" and he nodded familiarly to the General's wife, who bestowed upon him
                  a passing smile; but the moment his gaze was withdrawn, allowed her pretty pouting
                  lips to curl into an expression very like contempt.
               "I suppose we have inconvenienced you some," pursued the General, in a tone so
                  changed from his usual overbearing manner, even when addressing his equals, that
                  his aids and servants looked at him in surprise, and even his wife turned her
                  pretty face toward him, as if to be certain she had heard aright. "I suppose we
                  have inconvenienced you some, friend Smith, by keeping breakfast waiting but the
                  fact is, we did not leave Tappan so early by an hour as I intended; and then Mrs.
                  Arnold here, who has never before seen any of our highland scenery, must of course
                  stop to admire it, and thus are we belated."
               "Why, bless my soul, General Arnold, you must have your breakfast very early, if
                  you call this late—for see! the sun is hardly an hour high."
               "Yes, we soldiers begin our duties early. But here we are, at the very steps at
                  last, and I assure you I have a good appetite."
               "Allow me, General, to assist you."
               "No, Mr. Smith, my aids will do all that is necessary. If you will take charge of
                  Mrs. Arnold"—
               "Why, bless me, yes," interrupted the delighted host; but before he could reach
                  the side of the fair lady, she had dismounted; and throwing him her bridle-rein,
                  she darted up the steps, and stood on the portico alone, where she amused herself
                  by whipping the leaves of the vines that clambered up a trellis, till the whole
                  party was ready to enter.
               "Still lame, I see, General," said Smith, as he walked up the steps behind Arnold,
                  having given the horses in charge of his own and the General's servants.
               "Yes, it was an ugly wound I got at Behmus' Heights, and it is slow to heal. Were
                  it not for this, I could not content myself with a life so inactive as holding the
                  command of such a place as West Point."
               "No, General, we all know your penchant for
                  daring feats; and the very wound that drags you down to inactivity, speaks volumes
                  in your praise. O, it was bravely done, and the whole country rings with
                  applause."
               "Yes, it is a rather ungrateful country, after all, Mr. Smith," Arnold returned,
                  with a sneering curl of the lip. "By which I mean," he added, quickly, perceiving
                  that Smith looked up in surprise, "that many of the leading men of the country,
                  even in Congress, are actuated by the most selfish motives; and to promote the
                  interest of a friend, or revenge themselves for some trivial affront, descend to
                  the meanness of seeking to undermine the reputation of one who has won every
                  laurel he wears at the mouth of the cannon, amid the roar and carnage of
                  battle."
               "You allude to yourself, General?"
               "I do, and to the cowardly attempt to degrade me by court-martial. O! would I had
                  the scoundrels at my feet, that I might spurn them from me with a kick! But, by
                  heavens! the day shall come"—
               The General paused here, for he was about to make an impolitic speech; but Smith
                  finished the sentence, by adding:
               "When your enemies shall be made to regret their unwise doings."
               "Exactly, Mr. Smith," rejoined Arnold, in an altered tone, again smiling blandly;
                  "you have anticipated my words. But come, I am sure we are delaying breakfast, and
                  these things are certainly best discussed on a full stomach."
               Smith instantly hurried forward, threw open the door, and offering his arm to Mrs.
                  Arnold, led the way to the drawing-room, where Mrs. Smith was formally presented
                  to the General, his lady, and aids. Breakfast being almost immediately announced,
                  the guests sat down, without making their toilet, other than performing the
                  ablutions necessary after a morning's ride. During the meal, the conversation, as
                  was natural at the exciting period, turned upon the war; and many were the
                  speculations to which this subject gave rise.
               "Do you think it possible for us to conquer in the end, General?" queried
                  Smith.
               "Well, it is a hard question to answer," replied Arnold. "The country is in a very
                  impoverished state, money it is almost impossible to raise, relief-notes are worse
                  than nothing, and the soldiery is in a state of starvation. Of course, I hope the
                  best; and heaven is witness how much I love my country, and how my hearts bleeds
                  for her—but I have my fears. Were it not for the arrival of our French allies,
                  under Chevalier de Ternay, and Count de Rochambeau, I, for one, should almost be
                  ready to despair; and even as it is, they are of no assistance to us at present,
                  being wholly inactive at Rhode Island."
               "But the blockade cannot last forever," returned Smith, "and once a junction is
                  effected between Washington's army and his allies, the British will have some
                  trouble to maintain even the foothold they now have, to say nothing about their
                  getting possession of more territory."
               "That is true," rejoined Arnold; "but then I fear there will be greater delay in
                  effecting this so much desired union, than you anticipate. But we will hope for
                  the best, and trust that the overruling Power will sustain us in our battles for
                  the right, and bring us triumphantly through our trials."
               "I heartily wish the war over," said Mrs. Arnold, joining in the conversation;
                  "and hope, ere another year rolls around, it will be decided, one way or the
                  other."
               "But you certainly have a preference as to which side conquers?" spoke up Mr.
                  Smith, earnestly.
               "Well, really now," answered Mrs. Arnold, with one of her sweetest smiles,
                  displaying two rows of pearly teeth, "I can not say I have much choice. On some
                  accounts I should like the Americans to gain the victory; and then again there are
                  reasons why I should like the British arms to be triumphant. My father, and most
                  of my relatives, think it would be no more than right for the mother country to
                  regain her own; and besides, some of my warmest friends are among the English
                  officers, with whom I became acquainted while the British army held possession of
                  Philadelphia, which is, as you are probably aware, my native place, and the
                  present residence of my father."
               "Truly, I hardly expected to hear the wife of so distinguished an American general
                  express such Tory sentiments," rejoined Mrs. Smith, with a gay laugh.
               "Well, Mrs. Smith," said the General, with a meaning smile, "you must make
                  allowance for my better-half, on the score of her susceptibility to flattery. No
                  one knows better how to use this latter weapon, among the fair sex, than a red-coat; and for the term
                     friends, which Mrs. Arnold has used in connection with British
                  officers, please substitute admirers, and you have an easy solution
                  of the enigma."
               "Aha! I understand it all now," rejoined the hostess, with an arch look and
                  ringing laugh. "Bless me!" she continued, "there must be something in it—for see
                  how she blushes! 'Pon my word, General, if I were in your place, I should grow
                  jealous at once; for who knows but she may even now be corresponding with a former
                  suitor!"
               "Good faith, you have guessed my secret, and I may as well own up and be done with
                  it," replied Mrs. Arnold, gayly.
               "Then you really do correspond?" queried Mrs. Smith, mischievously.
               "Most assuredly."
               "Frankly answered, upon my word. Why General, if I were in your place, I should
                  feel very uncomfortable, I assure you. Does not the green-eyed monster have any
                  hold upon you?"
               "None whatever, thanks to my unrivaled attractions," replied Arnold, laughing.
               "He flatters himself," rejoined his wife—"but we shall see."
               In this manner the meal passed off very cheerfully; and soon after it was
                  finished, the General declared he must be on his way, as he desired to reach
                  head-quarters before night; and as he designed going up the river in a barge, the
                  progress homeward would necessarily be slow. Accordingly the horses were ordered
                  out, and the party was soon mounted. As Smith had volunteered to accompany them to
                  King's Ferry, the General and his lady took leave of Mrs. Smith, first exacting a
                  promise that she would visit them as often as convenient in their new home. They
                  then set off, in the same order they had ridden hither; Smith, as a mark of honor,
                  being assigned his place at the right hand of the General—a distinction that made
                  him feel not a little vain, for he was a man on whom flattery of this kind had a
                  very inflating effect.
               As they approached Stony Point, the officer in command fired a military salute;
                  and the echoing and re-echoing of the cannon among the hills produced a grand
                  effect. The General's barge was in waiting, manned by four oarsmen. It was a
                  beautiful vessel, and richly carpeted from stern to bow, with stuffed seats for
                  the General and his family, and a silk canopy to protect them from the searching
                  rays of the summer sun, above which the stars and stripes lazily floated on the
                  breeze that swept up the bay or came down from the hills loaded with the perfume
                  of a thousand flowers. Here the General and his suite dismounted, and the horses
                  were given in charge of the male servants, with orders to cross the ferry and
                  conduct them to headquarters on the opposite or eastern side of the river. Then,
                  seeing his lady, aids, and servants into the barge, the General drew Smith aside,
                  and, in a low tone, said:
               "I suppose, from your position here, you have frequent opportunities of getting
                  information from the British of considerable importance?"
               "It sometimes happens that I am so fortunate," replied the other.
               "Well, if you will be kind enough to convey me whatever intelligence you have, and
                  to none other, you will put me under an obligation which I shall take the earliest
                  means of discharging."
               "I will do so, General; and if I can render you the least service in this way, the
                  satisfaction which a knowledge of this will give me, will be ample
                  remuneration."
               "Thank you, friend Smith, thank you!" returned Arnold, with a great show of
                  cordiality. "Well, come up and see me as soon and as often as you can—Joshua Smith
                  will always be a welcome guest at the headquarters of General Arnold. The boat
                  waits, and I must go. Adieu! and remember what I have said." Then shaking Smith's
                  hand with a greater show of warmth than the occasion seemed to demand, so much so
                  that Smith himself was rather surprised, General Arnold turned away to the barge;
                  but apparently recalling something of consequence, that had slipped his mind, he
                  again returned to the other, and added: "By the by, Mr. Smith, suppose I should
                  desire your assistance, ere long, in an affair of some considerable importance,
                  requiring great secrecy and discretion?"
               "General Arnold may command me at any and all times, and I shall be proud to serve
                  him."
               "Enough! adieu!" and the General entered his barge, which was immediately pushed
                  out into the stream, where, with the assistance of a small sail rigged up in the
                  bow, it began to glide, with a pleasing ripple, over the glassy bosom of the
                  romantic Hudson.
               When about midway between Verplank's and Stony Point, there was a bright flash on
                  either side of the river, and the roar of cannon again reverberated afar, and
                  awoke the sleeping echoes of the hills; and at the same moment a band of music
                  struck up a spirited march, which, considering it was done in honor of her
                  husband, came across the water to the ears of the young wife with a peculiar
                  melody. Thus, amid the roar of cannon, the inspiring strains of martial music,
                  with colors flying, and all the accessories of military greatness, General Arnold
                  passed on his way to the command of that important post—the key to the liberties
                  of this glorious country—which in heart, if not in deed, he had already bartered
                  for British gold, British rank, and a life of damning infamy.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               GENERAL FEATURES OF 1780.
               AT the precise period our story opens, Sir Henry Clinton held possession of New
                  York city, which was then the head-quarters of the British army in this country.
                  The American army—of which General. Washington was Commander-in-chief—was encamped
                  on the west bank of the Hudson, at a place called Tappan, about twenty miles above
                  New York; the left wing resting on the river, near Dobb's Ferry, under Lord
                  Stirling; the right wing, extending back into the country, under General Greene:
                  and the van, composed of five or six battalions of light infantry, thrown
                  some-what forward, and under the command of the Marquis de Lafayette.
               Between the outposts of the two armies, on the east side of the Hudson, was a
                  considerable range of country, known as the Neutral Ground. This, on the breaking
                  out of the war, was rather thickly settled with farmers of the better class, who
                  found New York a very convenient market for their grain, fruit, and vegetables;
                  but, after the war began, and the British got possession of the city, the
                  depredations committed upon them by two organized classes of banditti, denominated
                  the "Cow Boys," and "Skinners," forced most of them to forsake their homes, and
                  become wanderers, until the establishment of peace.
               These thieving, plundering, house-breaking, house-burning, and murdering bands,
                  were diametrically opposed to each other, and met in many a bloody skirmish; but
                  they not unfrequently leagued together, robbed alike both Whigs and Tories, and
                  then divided the spoils. The Cow Boys belonged to the British, and received their
                  appellation from their business, which was to scour the country, and whenever they
                  could find a Whig farmer, known to be such, to seize upon his cattle, and drive
                  them within the British lines, where they were killed and fed out to the army, the
                  drivers receiving ample remuneration for their services. As might be expected, the
                  establishment of such a system of plunder, by those high in authority, led to the
                  most deplorable results; for men, sanctioned to steal, soon give their worst
                  passions full away, and hesitate not to commit the most diabolical crimes to
                  gratify a single whim. And when, therefore, instead of confining themselves to the
                  mere taking of cattle by the "right of might," we find them breaking open houses,
                  plundering them of every thing of value, and then often wantonly and maliciously
                  setting them on fire, and murdering the inmates in cold blood, we must only regard
                  their original license as a little extended, and hold those high in power morally
                  responsible for all their damning acts.
               Ostensibly to put down or counteract these depredators, the second band of
                  cut-throats was organized, who went by the appellation of "Skinners"—though why so
                  called, we are unable to say, unless from the fact that they literally
                     skinned the country of every thing left by the first party. The
                  Cow Boys warred upon the Whigs, the Skinners upon the Tories; and between the two,
                  as we have said, they devastated the whole country, and either killed the owners
                  of the soil, or forced them to for sake
                  their once happy homes, and undergo the most terrible privations. A few of the
                  inhabitants, who were led to think a flight would bring no change for the
                  better—and who, perhaps, had hopes of being unmolested, notwithstanding the
                  fearful evidences to the contrary, which they almost daily had in the fate of some
                  harmless and inoffensive neighbor—remained upon the Neutral Ground throughout the
                  war; but they lived a life of constant terror, concealing themselves at night
                  under fences, in hay-ricks, in barns, in tree-tops, in hollow trees, and in every
                  out-of-the-way place of imaginable security, ready to offer up a prayer of
                  thanksgiving in the morning, if so fortunate as to find themselves unharmed, and
                  their dwellings untouched by the hands of the ruthless destroyers.
               At this period, the constitution of the state of New York required that every
                  person, living within its jurisdiction, should take the oath of allegiance;
                  otherwise they would be considered Loyalists, or Tories, and their property, if
                  they had any, would be confiscated. To prevent the latter grievance, many perjured
                  themselves, and outwardly appeared as Whigs, while they secretly favored the war
                  of King George, and gloried in every success of the British arms; but these
                  pseudo-republicans were generally known, or were, at least, so strongly suspected,
                  that the Skinners boldly ventured to attack and despoil them, in which worthy
                  undertaking they were sometimes assisted by the Cow Boys, who pretended to regard
                  them as staunch rebels or Whigs, and as such their legal victims; so that between
                  the two parties, their duplicity proved of little or no avail in securing them the
                  protection they desired; and thus many of them were forced by circumstances to
                  come out in their true colors, and seek a safe asylum within the British
                  lines.
               As it was very important there should be no communication between the two armies,
                  it was made a lawful proceeding for scouting parties to arrest all strangers found
                  traveling across the neutral territory, and take them before their respective
                  commanders, where, unless they could give a satisfactory account of themselves,
                  they were held in custody as spies, or suspected persons, and every thing of value
                  in their possession handed over to their captors, as a reward for the vigilance
                  and fidelity of the latter. Thus, the exigencies of the times established a
                  regular system of espionage and lawful highway robbery—for we can scarcely give it
                  a milder or less criminal term, although fully aware its heinousness was greatly
                  mitigated by the peculiar circumstances controlling those who sanctioned it.
               Such as we have described was the deplorable state of affairs in that section of
                  country known as Westchester county, lying north of New York, and extending up the
                  Hudson a distance of some thirty miles, and which will form no small portion of
                  the theater of events we are about to lay before the reader; but as we shall be
                  obliged, in the course of our narrative, to go over the ground more thoroughly,
                  and bring up some of these horrible scenes in thrilling detail, we shall return
                  from this justifiable digression, to touch upon matters of greater present
                  importance.
               The two hostile armies, at the precise period we have chosen to open our story,
                  were both in a measure inactive; but were watching each other with the guarded
                  keenness of two well-matched combatants, who feel and know that a single wrong
                  movement will give the other a victory fatal to all hopes of recovery, and deem it
                  safer to stand for a time on the defensive, than to risk a defeat by becoming the
                  assailant. Both had spies secretly and assiduously at work, to gain intelligence
                  of the real designs of the other; yet each commander of the respective armies,
                  knowing this, was so very cautious, so unusually reserved in his communications,
                  even to those who frequently had his confidence, that the little information
                  obtained through espionage, generally amounted to nothing more important than mere
                  conjecture.
               The position of General Washington and Sir Henry Clinton, at this juncture, may
                  not inappropriately be likened to two great chess-players, each zealously watching
                  the other, and each equally prepared to win the game in the event of his opponent
                  making a single wrong move.
               In the month of July, a short time preceding the opening of our story,
                  intelligence was received by both armies at the same time, that Chevalier de
                  Ternay had arrived at Newport with a French fleet and an army, under the command
                  of Count de Rochambeau, as allies of the Americans. This news in the American
                  army, and throughout the country generally, produced the greatest joy, and raised
                  the drooping spirits of the half-starved, badly-clothed, and unpaid soldiers, as
                  well as those of the citizens and Congress, to the highest degree, and of course
                  produced exactly the opposite effect on the British and Tories. General Clinton at
                  once foresaw that, in the event of a junction being formed between Washington's
                  army and his allies, in all probability the combined forces would besiege New
                  York, and the British amy be forced to surrender or evacuate the town; and to
                  prevent this junction, he determined himself to proceed at once to Newport, and
                  attack the French.
               This design of Clinton was quickly made known to Washington by his spies, and the
                  latter at once put his army in motion, and crossed Dobb's Ferry, with the
                  intention of sitting down before New York, and, if he found it sufficiently
                  weakened by the force withdrawn, to attack it forthwith. Whether Clinton feared
                  Washington would be successful in his absence, or whether another and better plan
                  suggested itself, certain it is that he suddenly changed his mind, and debarked
                  his troops; and Washington, hearing of this recrossed the river, and returned with
                  his army to Tappan, where we find him at the opening of our story.
               But as if fortune were determined to alternate between the two parties, ere fairly
                  deciding the contest for either, there occurred about this period two events,
                  which spread a temporary gloom over the Americans, and rejoiced the British in the
                  same ratio. The first was the intelligence of the overwhelming defeat of General
                  Gates in South Carolina, and the second the arrival of an English fleet at New
                  York, under command of Sir George Rodney. These two events gave a new turn to
                  affairs; and Clinton was in daily expectation of hearing that Washington had given
                  up all hopes of forming a present junction with the French, and was preparing to
                  go south to attempt to remedy the disaster. And he was daily too, looking forward
                  to another event, the consummation of which would be of greater importance than
                  all the rest; and which will be developed in the course of this true history.
               Meantime we will return from the general features of the period, and resume the
                  detail of our story.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               TREASON IN EMBRYO.
               ON the corner of Broadway, at its junction with a beautiful park, commonly known
                  as the Battery, there stood, at the time of which we write, a handsome brick
                  mansion, of large dimensions, with marble steps, and iron balcony and balustrades,
                  before the front entrance of which two sentinels were ever pacing, night and day.
                  In the first story of this mansion, in the front apartment, which, being on the
                  southern side of the dwelling, overlooked both Broadway and the Battery, a British
                  officer, in the full dress of a major-general, was walking up and down the white
                  sanded floor—for, at the period we speak of, a carpet was more of a luxury than it
                  is now-a-days, and was used very sparingly even among the wealthy. The room
                  contained but little furniture, but that little was of the richest quality then
                  manufactured. Some half a dozen massive mahogany chairs, with high backs, and
                  quaintly carved, were ranged round the walls, together with two or three lounges.
                  In the center of the apartment stood a large, heavy, mahogany table, on which lay
                  a few books, one or two English newspapers, a quire or two of white paper, some
                  manuscript, three or four letters, and pens and ink. Drawn up to this table were
                  three arm-chairs, unoccupied, from one of which the officer now pacing the room
                  had just arisen. Between the windows in front was a small double mirror, with a
                  glass frame, ornamented with flowers of gold-leaf; and around the white walls hung
                  several pictures in black frames. Add to all these a couple of vases, filled with
                  flowers, which stood on the high mantel, and the crimson curtains that hung at the
                  windows, and you have a list of all the
                  articles that the room contained.
               The officer referred to was a man of low stature, but very fat and corpulent, with
                  a broad, full, heavy face, a very prominent nose, and large gray eyes. The general
                  expression of his features combined intelligence with benevolence, and a rather
                  studied reserve. He was dressed with great care. His cravat, the frill of his
                  shirt-bosom, and the ruffles around his wrists, depending over his hands, and even
                  the hands themselves, were all of snowy whiteness; and every thing, however
                  trivial, was in its place. All this evidenced a man very orderly, punctilious, and
                  formal, and such were his prevailing characteristics.
               It was not far from the middle of the day, and the windows all being open, a soft,
                  delightful breeze, which swept up from the bay across the Battery, stole into the
                  room, rustled the curtains, played with the loose papers on the table, and passed
                  out again cityward. The General seemed thoughtful, but not excited; for he paced
                  the room with a slow even tread, his eyes bent on the floor, and his hands crossed
                  behind him. Occasionally he would halt before the windows looking southward, and
                  gaze out upon the bay—where several large ships of the line were riding at anchor,
                  with a few sloops and smaller craft sailing lazily about in various directions—and
                  then in the same thoughtful manner, resume his walk.
               Some twenty minutes or half an hour were passed in this manner, when a quick tread
                  was heard on the marble steps of the mansion, and the next moment an officer, in
                  full uniform; stood in the open doorway, and made the military salute due to his
                  superior.
               As the new-comer, as well as the one just described is destined to figure rather
                  conspicuously in our drama of life, we shall pause here to give a brief
                  description of his personal appearance. In stature he was rather tall, but
                  exceedingly well formed, with a very graceful and dignified bearing. His age was
                  between twenty-five and thirty—much nearer the latter than the former—though, to
                  judge by his fair, open, almost beardless countenance, one would not be disposed
                  to regard him much beyond his teens. He was what might be termed a handsome man,
                  in every particular; and if the face may be taken as an index of the heart, then
                  was his heart one of the purest and noblest that ever beat in the breast of a
                  human being. His features were fine, regular, and intelligent to a degree that
                  would not fail to arrest the attention of the most casual observer. He wore no wig
                  nor cue, but short curly hair, which was brushed back from his temples and
                  forehead. The latter was high, broad, and noble, and, united with his dark,
                  lustrous eyes, and the rest of his comely countenance, gave him that dignified
                  look of lofty intelligence for which he was so remarkable. If there were any
                  defect in the beauty of his countenance, it was in the great breadth between the
                  eyes; but as this perhaps would not be thought a blemish, scientifically
                  considered, his face in contour, feature, and expression, might be set down as
                  being as perfect as any to be found in the sex masculine. We say sex masculine;
                  for beautiful woman more nearly approaches our ideal of perfection; but, at the
                  same time, whatever in man resembles her beyond that proper limit which we assign
                  him as manly, we condemn as too effeminate, and consequently discard as a blemish,
                  if not a deformity. Let it be understood, then, that we wish to say, that the
                  personage we have just been describing occupied that medium stand between the two
                  sexes which gave him all the dignity and manliness of the one, with the delicate
                  refinement and sweet urbanity of the other.
               "Well, Major, I am glad you have arrived," said the General, addressing the
                  new-comer in a less formal manner than was his wont when speaking to an inferior;
                  "for the courier has been here in your absence, and left another mercantile
                  missive for you, and you know I am deeply interested in this correspondence just
                  now."
               "But why did not your excellency open it, and satisfy yourself at once concerning
                  its intelligence?" queried the other, advancing to the table, and taking up a
                  letter bearing the superscription of "Mr. John Anderson, Merchant,
                  New York, the seal of which he instantly broke.
               "Because," said the General, in reply, "I know of no plea that can justify a
                  friend in opening the confidential letter of a friend, without that friend's
                  permission."
               "Pardon me," returned the other, looking round to his superior, while he tore open
                  the epistle, and struck it across the back of his left hand, to straighten the
                  wrinkles: "Pardon me, if I say, I think your excellency is a trifle to much a
                  stickler for the most delicate points of etiquette—points so delicate, indeed,
                  that the breach is in the observance, rather than otherwise, as the present
                  instance witnesseth. If I did not give your excellency permission to open these
                  letters, it was because it never occurred to me that your excellency would see any
                  of them before myself; but lest the same thing should again occur, I now formally
                  declare to your excellency, that Sir Henry Clinton is duly authorized by Major
                  Andre, to open at any and all times, all letters which may accidentally or
                  designedly fall into his possession, bearing the superscription of Mr. John
                  Anderson, Merchant;" and the speaker closed with a pleasant laugh.
               "Good faith! you are as formal as a prime-minister," smiled the other. "I thank
                  you, however, for the permission granted, and would fain know the contents of the
                  one in hand as soon as possible."
               "Well, here it is," 
                     rejoind
                     rejoined
                   Andre; and he read aloud as follows:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "DEAR SIR,—In recurring to the business on which I last addressed you,
                              I must beg leave to repeat what I then said, that the junior member of
                              the firm is decidedly opposed to the partner proposed by the senior;
                              and there is no doubt in my mind, if the senior pushes the matter, and
                              I think he will, that a rupture will ensue, and a dissolution
                                 follow: in which case he begs me to say, he will come to New
                              York, and enter into speculation there quite largely—provided, in all
                              cases, an offer is made that suits him—otherwise he will remain where
                              he is. In coming to New York, in these troublous times, you must, sir,
                              be aware, a merchant runs a great risk, and inducements must be
                                 held out accordingly. Mr. M——is a man of
                                 capital, which is true to my knowledge; and he
                                 can command a certain market, that will be sure to make the
                                 fortunes of all those concerned with him; and I leave it to
                              you to say, whether you will form a new copartnership under these
                              favorable auspices or not.
                           "Answer as soon as convenient; and in the meantime, in behalf of Mr.
                              M——, believe me, dear sir,
                           
                              "Your most obedient and humble servant,
                              "GUSTAVUS.
                              
                                 "Mr. John Anderson, Merchant."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "Well, what think you now, Adjutant?" inquired Sir Henry Clinton, when the other
                  had finished the epistle.
               "I am more than ever convinced, your excellency, that our previous surmises are
                  correct."
               "You feel confident, then, that General Arnold, and Gustavus, are one and the same
                  person."
               "I do."
               "Well, I agree with you; but, entre nous, what a
                  consummate rascal he must be, to seek this mode of betraying his country into our
                  hands."
               "Your excellency must not overlook, that he is thus returning to the allegiance of
                  his king," suggested Andre, with a peculiar smile.
               "A fig for his allegiance, since it is prompted by no honorable motives, but
                  solely with a view to bettering his own condition."
               "No doubt we all too much act from selfish motives," returned the other.
               "There is a good deal of truth in that; and there is an old adage, that we should
                  not look a gift-horse in the mouth." But with motives we have nothing to do in the
                  present instance. The result to us is all-important, and if the scheme succeed,
                  farewell to Mr. Washington's dreams of glory, as well as those of his coadjutors;
                  for King George the Third will surely reign again in rebel America, and as surely
                  will a few of the leaders of this rebellion pay the penalty of their temerity on
                  an English scaffold. How cleverly the man has worded his letter, as in fact he has
                  all of them; for no one, however suspicious, would think there was so treacherous
                  a plot contained in so apparently an open mercantile correspondence. Let me see
                  the letter. Ah! here he says, 'The junior member of the firm is decidedly
                     opposed to the partner proposed by the
                  
                  senior.' Now, how do you translate that, Andre?"
               "Simply, that it refers to the French alliance. Washington is, of course, the
                  senior, and Arnold himself the junior, and the partner proposed is the Count
                  Rochambeau."
               "I think the same. And he goes on to say, that if the senior pushes the matter,
                  there will be a rupture, and of course a dissolution of copartnership, when he
                  will be willing to come to New York, and enter largely into speculation, provided
                  proper inducements are held out to him; which means, I suppose, that as an
                  equivalent for yielding up his honor and betraying his country, we must give him a
                  colonel or general's commission, with a few thousand pounds of ready money. Well,
                  well, we must buy him, at any price, provided we can be made sure of his scheme
                  succeeding. In order to do this, there must be a personal interview; and who so
                  capable of negociating the matter as yourself, Major? for you know all the facts
                  of the case, from being the sole correspondent on our side."
               "I am ready and willing to engage in any undertaking which your excellency may
                  deem advantageous to the cause I serve," replied Andre.
               "Of course I do not wish you to run any risk in the affair; but, on the contrary,
                  to remember you have my especial command to avoid all hazard; for sooner than evil
                  should befall you, Adjutant, I would lose the opportunity of putting a coup de grace to this war through the channel afforded
                  me by treachery."
               "Your excellency is very, very kind," returned the other, in a voice tremulous
                  with emotion; "and though I never expect to be able to cancel the debt of
                  gratitude I owe you, for the many favors done me, yet I trust that time will give
                  me an opportunity of expressing, in other manner than by words, the true feelings
                  of my heart."
               "Tut! tut!" rejoined Sir Henry Clinton; 'you overrate the little I have done for
                  you and overlook the fact, that I, as well as all others, have been in a greater
                  or less degree governed by selfish motives. But to the point. It is necessary that
                  some one should meet Arnold, alone, and arrange every thing to the satisfaction of
                  both parties: for this can not be effected in a correspondence where neither party
                  dare speak out, for fear the letters may be intercepted, and the whole plot be
                  ruined by an untimely exposure to the enemy. Arnold has recently been given the
                  command at West Point; and if, through his treachery, we can get possession of
                  this strong-hold, glorious victory is surely ours, and the war will be brought to
                  a close in less than six months. I know the place well, and also its importance;
                  for in the campaign of 1777, I had occasion to examine it. It is situated in a
                  narrow pass of the Hudson, among the highlands, and so fortified by nature and art
                  that, occupied by a full and determined garrison, our whole army would be unable
                  to carry it. Now, what I want is this: Washington is evidently determined on a
                  junction with the French troops; and if he effect it, he will either attack New
                  York at once, or march his army south; in either case West Point will be the grand
                  depot for his military stores: and if matters can be so arranged, that just at the
                  moment when the deposit is made, this fortress can fall into our hands, the
                  death-blow to his hopes will be given; for, in the impoverished state of the
                  country, it would, of course, be impossible to recover from the misfortune; and
                  disheartened and disgusted, the rebels would prefer the service of King George,
                  with good pay and plenty to eat, to fighting for democratic liberty on an empty
                  stomach, with no hope of an ultimate reward. Aside from this, our possession of
                  West Point would enable us to command the river, hold free communication with our
                  friends in Canada, and intercept all dispatches between the eastern and southern
                  states, which must necessarily cross the Hudson."
               "I understand, General, the great importance there is for having a personal
                  interview with Arnold, if, as we suspect, he is our mercantile correspondent,"
                  replied Andre; "and of that I think there should be no doubt, although we cannot
                  be positive till we know more. Shall I write an answer to this letter?"
               "Yes, and so word it, that he shall understand his rank and name must be
                  immediately made known, and that a meeting between the parties must be brought
                  about as soon as possible. You can say you are anxious to effect a copartnership
                  of the kind proposed, and that you have ample capital at your command to make it
                  an object for him to connect himself with your house. Say also, that under the
                  expectation of an arrangement of the kind being effected, you are about making
                  extensive preparations to carry on business on a large scale; and that, in a few
                  days, if his answer still be favorable, you will proceed to ship a heavy
                     amount of goods for the market proposed. He of course will understand by
                  this, that our troops will be put in readiness for instant embarkation; and we can
                  give out that we are about setting out on an expedition to the Chesapeake; and the
                  recent arrival of Sir George Rodney's fleet, and the news of Gates' defeat, will
                  assist us materially in giving the air of truth to this false report. Of course,
                  Washington will hear of our intention through his spies, and will be the more
                  eager to form a junction with his allies, in order that the combined forces may
                  attack the city the moment it is weakened by the withdrawal of a large detachment
                  of our troops. Now, the result is easily foreseen. Washington, at the head of his
                  main army, as I have every reason to believe, will move upon King's Bridge and
                  Morrisania—a detachment will menace Staten Island—while the French allies will
                  approach the city by way of Long Island. Thus they will aim to distract us by
                  three separate attacks; but in the meantime we will seize West Point, with all its
                  supplies, throw their plans into confusion, and perhaps, by concentrating our
                  whole force upon the French (for Washington will be obliged to fall back), be able
                  to block up their retreat, and take them prisoners, and thus close the campaign of
                  1780 more gloriously than any since the commencement of the war."
               "This is a consummation devoutly to be wished," returned Andre, with enthusiasm,
                  "and I already feel proud at the thought, that I shall be an humble instrument in
                  bringing it about."
               "Ay, and if it succeed, it shall be the best year's work you ever performed,"
                  pursued Sir Henry; "for as certain as that we both live to see it, so certain
                  shall you have a promotion, that shall make the proudest proud to call you
                  friend."
               "Ah! Sir Henry, from my soul I thank you; for since the unfortunate termination of
                  all my hopes of domestic felicity! I have become—I do not deny it—almost wildly
                  ambitious to distinguish myself in the service of my king and country. To me there
                  ever seemed something grand and glorious in one obscurely born raising himself to
                  an enviable station; and if I, through your invaluable friendship and
                  disinterested partiality, succeed in doing this, your excellency can readily
                  imagine in what estimation, as my patron and benefactor, you will be held by
                  me."
               "Well, well, we shall see, we shall see. By-the-by, did you receive your usual
                  missive from Mrs. Arnold? Ah! you sly one, I see by that blush you did. But no
                  matter—it is none of my concern—only I must say, that as a girl, she was one of
                  the most fascinating I ever beheld. How she could fancy such a personage as
                  Arnold, with such disparity in their ages, passes my understanding; though well I
                  know there is no accounting for woman's caprices. Well, I will leave you to
                  yourself a few minutes, and let you indite an answer to Gustavus, which must be
                  sent off by a messenger who leaves at two o'clock;" and Sir Henry Clinton walked
                  slowly out of the apartment into the hall, passed the sentinel that paced to and
                  fro before his door, and ascended a flight of stairs leading to the upper parts of
                  the mansion.
               The moment he found himself alone, Andre opened a neatly-folded, sweet-scented
                  billet-doux, bearing the delicate tracery of a female hand, and perused it
                  hastily. When he had finished, he laid it upon the table, and from a concealment
                  nearest his heart, drew forth a small miniature, done on ivory, upon which he
                  gazed for several moments, in an abstracted mood. Then heaving a long, deep,
                  mournful sigh, and with one hand brushing the dew from his eyes, he exclaimed, in
                  a low, tremulous tone:
               "Oh! Honora—sainted Honora! thou madly-loved, wildly-worshiped, but
                  wantonly-sacrificed being! how fades all other beauty and loveliness when brought
                  to compare with thee! They consigned thee
                  to another; but death took pity on thee, and annulled the perjured contract. Sweet
                  saint in heaven! pray intercede for him who loves thee still, with a devotion that
                  can never change. A short time, at the longest, and death will reunite us, to part
                  no more forever!"
               He pressed his lips with affectionate reverence to the painted ivory as he spoke,
                  and carefully returned it to the place whence taken. Then seating himself at the
                  table, he laid Arnold's letter open before him, and taking up a pen, prepared to
                  write an answer.
               Alas! in the morning of life, in the meridian of his glory, poor Major Andre
                  little dreamed to what a horrible doom this dealing with a traitor was destined to
                  consign him.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               THE MYSTERIOUS BEAUTY.
               AT the time of which we write, New York was scarcely more than a village, compared
                  to its present size and dense population. All that portion of the town now laid
                  off so regularly, with its wide clean streets intersecting each other at right
                  angles, on which front the splendid mansions of the wealthy, was then devoted to
                  agriculture, with here and there a farm-house, the tenants of which looked upon
                  themselves as living in the country, a goodly distance out of town. Pearl-street
                  (then called Queen), where it intersects Broadway in front of the Hospital, was
                  the extreme northern, as Catharine-street was the extreme eastern, limit of the
                  city; and but few of the more wealthy cared to live so much in the suburbs as even
                  this, unless it were during the warm months of summer. The mansions of the latter,
                  at this period, were generally on Broadway, near the Battery, on Wall and Broad
                  streets, and on Queen-street; and even this part of the town, now so crowded with
                  five and six story edifices, devoted to commerce on a grand scale, with scarcely
                  ground enough unoccupied to give one a sight of the sun at noonday, was then
                  generally laid off with extensive gardens, and not unfrequently with private
                  parks, as large as the largest of the present public squares.
               On the street last mentioned, namely, Queen, not far from where it now crosses
                  Fulton, stood a double two-story brick dwelling, with colonade, balcony, marble
                  steps, and an exterior finish not usually seen at that period. A large silver
                  plate, on one of the folding-doors that gave you entrance, bore the single but
                  aristocratic inscription of "Percy." The doors also opened by means of a silver
                  knob, and a heavy silver-mounted knocker stood ready to summon a servant to undo
                  the inner fastenings. You entered a wide old-fashioned hall, whose high, frescoed
                  ceiling, painted floor, massive antique furniture, wainscoted walls, of a somber
                  hue, hung round with generations of portraits, and with rich old paintings by the
                  great masters, gave it an air of gloomy, stately grandeur, and bespoke the owner a
                  man of wealth, who prided himself on his lineage. At the right of this hall was a
                  double drawing-room, divided by folding-doors, and furnished in a light fanciful
                  style of magnificence, which strangely contrasted with the apartment just
                  described. A large pier-glass occupied the space between the front windows,
                  reaching nearly from the ceiling to the ground. The windows themselves were shaded
                  by damask curtains, and a rich, soft carpet, whereon the half-buried foot gave
                  back no sound, covered the floor. This of itself was sufficient at that day to
                  bespeak opulence and every thing corresponded with this unusual display of taste
                  and affluence.
               The rear of the mansion opened into a beautiful shrubbery, with green and flowery
                  walks, beyond which was a garden, extending down to the East river, a distance
                  from the dwelling of some two or three hundred yards. Here were a long hot-house
                  and arbors at every turn, and the whole was fenced in by a high wall of
                  masonry.
               A broad winding staircase led to the upper parts of the mansion, which was divided
                  into various compartments, from which we shall only select one for description.
                  This was an elegant little boudoir, the windows of which overlooked the river and
                  the grounds already mentioned. The room was not carpeted, and in fact this luxury
                  here would have been superfluous; for nothing could add to the chasteness ness and
                  beauty of the snowy white and highly polished floor. Neither did the apartment
                  contain much furniture; but what little there was in it, was of the most costly
                  material and neatest workmanship. A beautiful toilet-table of carved rosewood
                  stood between the windows, surmounted by a mirror in a rose wood frame. On this
                  table was the usual number of scent-bottles, brushes, and combs, and before it
                  stood a rosewood chair, of delicate workmanship, having turned legs and rounds,
                  and a split cane seat. Two other chairs, of the same material and make, stood in
                  the room, one of them in front of an open window, and the other facing a small
                  escritoire, also of rosewood, with a bookcase surmounting it. The lid of the
                  escritoire was down, and displayed paper, pens, and ink, with several letters
                  neatly folded and arranged in its pigeon-holes with precise order. The
                  folding-doors of the book-case were also open, and three rows of books, consisting
                  of poetry, history, biography, and romance, bound in morocco, with the lettering
                  in gold, in the costliest style of art, were exposed to view. Besides the articles
                  mentioned, a large round mahogany table occupied the center of the apartment, on
                  which lay several pieces of music and a guitar. Several pictures adorned the snowy
                  walls; and on the marble mantel, over a large fireplace, which was hidden by a
                  painted fire-board, were a couple of vases, filled with freshly culled flowers,
                  whose sweet odors reperfumed the balmy air that stole in from over the garden. The
                  room had a softened light, for it was shaded by vines clambering over the trellis
                  of the windows, and by snowy linen curtains, that swept gracefully down from the
                  upper casement, and, being parted below, were suspended on glass knobs to the
                  right and left.
               But the most beautiful and attractive object in the apartment yet remains to be
                  described. On a delicately carved mahogany lounge, covered with damask, which
                  extended along the wall farthest from the windows, a beautiful female, robed in
                  the purest white, was gracefully reclining. We say a beautiful female; but the
                  term is all too impotent to convey any idea of a seraphic comeliness seldom seen,
                  and never excelled. Her skin was as fair as a lily, and so clear and transparent
                  that one could fancy a soft halo was exhaled there-from, which surrounded it like
                  a glory. Her face was of Grecian formation, and would have made a model for an
                  artist seeking to paint a divinity, so perfect was every feature, and so ethereal
                  the whole. Yet with all this comeliness of formation, there was not, as is too
                  frequently the case, only the mere animal to admire; but combined with it was an
                  expression of intellect, of soul, of the very highest order. You could not gaze
                  upon that countenance, and fancy it a superior work of art; for in every lineament
                  was there an evidence of its having been wrought by the hand of a Deity. Her lips
                  were like ruby, her teeth like pearl, her eyes black and sparkling, and her raven
                  hair, in glossy ringlets, clustered around a neck of alabaster. Her form was like
                  a Hebe, graceful and airy; and when we add that she was just in the bloom of
                  eighteen summers, we fancy the picture of terrestrial beauty is nearly
                  complete.
               We have said she was reclining upon the lounge. One snowy arm, on which her head
                  rested, was half buried in her raven ringlets, that swept wantonly over it in
                  beautiful profusion. Her other hand held an open book before her, and her black
                  sparkling eyes were fixed intently upon the printed page. As if aware her beauty
                  needed no extraneous appendages, she wore no ornament, with the exception of a
                  diamond ring that glittered on the third finger of her left hand. Her drapery, of
                  snowy linen, was perfect in its arrangement, though apparently unstudied, with one
                  tiny foot just visible, covered with a white satin slipper.
               Such was Rosalie Du Pont, the belle of New York, the admired, the courted, the
                  envied beauty of the day, and, we will add, the heroine of our story, who is
                  destined to figure conspicuously in the following pages. Who, or what she was, the
                  reader must for the present be kept in ignorance. Even those who fancied they knew
                  her best, knew her only as the sprightly, gay, eccentric, witty, accomplished and
                  beautiful Rosalie Du Pont, niece of Graham Percy, a staunch Loyalist, devoted
                  heart and soul to the cause of King George.
               
                  But they knew her not.
               
               The time we have chosen to introduce
                  Rosalie, was some three hours subsequent to the conversation between Major General
                  Sir Henry Clinton, and Adjutant General Major Andre, as recorded in the foregoing
                  chapter. For a few moments, she remained in the position described, wholly
                  absorbed with her book; and then suddenly looking up, she turned her head aside in
                  a listening attitude. At the same instant, there came a light tap on the door; and
                  stretching out her hand, without rising, Rosalie turned the knob and threw it
                  open. This proceeding disclosed a straight, slim, and rather tall mulatto boy,
                  apparently about fifteen years of age, standing quietly in the doorway, as
                  motionless, and with the same immobility of countenance, as a wax figure or
                  statue. On being signed to enter by Rosalie, he slowly walked into the apartment,
                  softly closed the door behind him, and then turned to his mistress, as if for
                  further orders. His features were good, and seemed not to lack intelligence,
                  though there was something about them would strike a stranger as being very
                  peculiar. He wore a tight-fitting round-about, buttoned close to the throat, with
                  a white linen collar, of perhaps an inch in width, turned over it at the neck. His
                  suit was entirely black, with bright metal buttons, and fitted his handsome figure
                  with great exactness. Small slender feet were incased in morocco boots of high
                  polish, and one hand held a cap, surrounded by a gold band, not unlike those worn
                  by military officers of the present day. His hair was black, short, and curly, and
                  his eye still blacker, and capable of a very intense and fiery expression, though
                  in general it appeared soft and mild as now.
               "Well?" said Rosalie in a whisper.
               The youth instantly party unbuttoned his waistcoat, thrust one hand into his
                  bosom, and drew forth a letter, which he held up before him with a gleam of
                  triumph.
               On beholding the missive, Rosalie sprang to her feet, eagerly caught it from the
                  hand of the other, and breaking the seal, hurried to the window and devoured its
                  contents. Then turning to the boy, she inquired, but still in a whisper;
               "Did you find this where you did the last one?"
               The boy nodded in the affirmative.
               "Did you place the one I gave you as I directed?"
               The boy nodded again.
               "Did you meet with any adventures worth relating?"
               The boy advanced to the table, picked up a pen, and wrote, in a light, genteel,
                  legible hand:
               "I saw Dame Hagold's house burned by the Skinners."
               "Indeed!" exclaimed Rosalie, with a start. "So the old fortune-teller is burned
                  out, eh? What became of her, do you know?"
               Again the boy wrote:
               "She escaped, and took refuge within the British lines."
               "But where were the Cow Boys, when the burning took place?"
               The mute—for such he was—answered in the same manner as before:
               "Within sight."
               "And did they not try to prevent it?"
               "No."
               "And why, do you think?"
               "Because they were leagued with the Skinners to get her money."
               "Did they get any?"
               "I overheard Dame Hagold saying she had lost two hundred dollars."
               "And where were you all this time?"
               "Concealed in a thicket near."
               "Were you not frightened?"
               "I did not think myself in safety."
               "In returning to town, were you stopped by the sentinels of the out-posts?"
               "Twice, but showed my passport, which proved satisfactory in both cases."
               "What time did you get within the lines?"
               "About daylight."
               "How long have you been returned?"
               "Three hours or more."
               "What have you been doing?"
               "Sauntering about the town."
               "Any news?"
               "Yes; there is a rumor Sir Henry intends erelong to embark for the
                  Chesapeake."
               "Do you think it true?"
               "No."
               "Why not?"
               "Because, if true, it would be kept more secret, at least for the present."
               "What then do you think the meaning of it?"
               "That it is some design to mislead the American commander."
               "For what purpose?"
               "I can not say."
               "Did you gather any news of Washington's designs?"
               "Yes; he will set off soon on a visit to Count Rochambeau at Hartford."
               "Did you communicate this intelligence to Sir Henry Clinton?"
               "Yes."
               "What said he?"
               "He thanked me, and you through me, for our zeal in the royal cause; but cautioned
                  me against needless exposure, lest I should be taken by the rebels and hung as a
                  spy."
               "A very proper precaution for him," returned Rosalie, with a meaning
                  smile.
               The mute smiled also, but made no reply, and the other proceeded:
               "But is there not danger in this business, Munee? Suppose, for instance, you
                  should be taken by the Skinners, and passports from the commanders of the hostile
                  armies be found on you, what would be the consequence?"
               The mute passed his hand quickly around his neck, and then holding it above his
                  head, and letting the latter drop forward toward his bosom, made a gurgling sound,
                  the whole intimating that he would be hung as a spy.
               Rosalie shuddered and turned pale.
               "Poor Munee," she said, "this must not be for me, for I could never forgive
                  myself. No, no; you must not venture so again. Sooner than that I will go
                  myself."
               The mute started, with a look of alarm, and catching up the pen, wrote
                  nervously:
               "Impossible! you would surely he discovered. Munee would die for the
                  beautiful Rosalie without a murmur."
               "I know you would, Munee, I know you would," returned the other warmly, a tear
                  trembling in her eye; "and for this reason I should feel your loss only the more
                  keenly. No, I am resolved—seek not to change my purpose; your habiliments will
                  exactly fit me, and you and I must change places, as we have more than once done
                  before."
               "But I could not personate you during so long an absence as this mad whim would
                  require, without being detected," wrote, the mute.
               "I will arrange every thing for this purpose. It is well known that I am a girl of
                  strange caprices—gay, wild, and wayward—so that what I do out of the ordinary way,
                  will cause less surprise than would the same freak performed by any other lady of
                  my acquaintance. Now, in a few days, my uncle will sail for a southern port, as
                  bearer of dispatches from Sir Henry Clinton, and my aunt will go to spend a few
                  weeks with a friend on Long Island, leaving the house and most of the servants in
                  my charge. Well, during her absence, if I feel disposed, I can manage my plot in
                  this way. I will give out that I am going to keep my room for a week, during which
                  time I will see no one, and speak to no one—that my meals, and so forth, must be
                  brought to the door of my boudoir, and there left, without any questions—that if I
                  want any thing, I will write on a piece of paper and leave it outside; and that
                  all visitors inquiring for me, must be told that I am in one of my whims, and will
                  not see them—the rest I am sure you can perform, with no other inconvenience than
                  being a close prisoner till my return. But enough for the present—for the
                  remainder can be told when the moment for the execution of my scheme arrives,
                  which possibly may never come. By-the-by, Munee, are you much fatigued?"
               "Not if my mistress requires my services," wrote the other.
               "Will you ascertain then, if Dame Hagold has returned to her old quarters in the
                  city?"
               The mute bowed, and passed out; and as the door closed behind the messenger,
                  Rosalie continued: "Poor dumb Munee, what an invaluable treasure as a servant! Ah!
                  who, even among her associates, suspects her of being other than she seems? It was
                  a capital whim, that led me to dress her as a youth at first; for now she can
                  serve me as no waiting-maid could; and such is the affection she bears me, that I
                  can safely trust my life in her hands. Ay, for that matter, I am even now in her power, if she be evil disposed;
                  but still I have no fear;" and taking up the letter Munee had brought her, Rosalie
                  was soon lost in its reperusal.
               At this moment there came a light tap on the door; and on being bidden to enter, a
                  servant approached Rosalie bearing a neatly-written card on a silver waiter.
               "Ha! Major Andre?" said our heroine, as her eye fell upon the inscription. "Say to
                  him I will be with him presently. Surely," she continued to herself, as the
                  servant quitted the room, "surely, I can not have made a conquest of the proud,
                  handsome, accomplished, and gallant Major, during our brief acquaintance! and if
                  not, what brings him here today?" and her features slightly paled. "But, then,"
                  she added, forcing a look of unconcern she did not feel, "why not here as well as
                  elsewhere? and why not to-day as well as at any other period? Pshaw! why does my
                  heart beat quicker? is it so wonderful that he, more than another, should call to
                  while away an idle hour with one whose beauty is over-praised, whose talents are
                  overrated, and whose eccentricity has made her a topic of conversation in every
                  circle? No, I will think not. But this letter must be destroyed. Yet why so? It
                  contains nothing improper; and who would know the author? No, no, it shall be
                  preserved;" and touching a secret spring in her rosewood escritoire, she disclosed
                  a small aperture, into which she thrust the epistle; and then making a hasty
                  toilet, descended to the drawing-room, where she found the young Adjutant-General
                  awaiting her presence, who, on her queen-like entrance, arose, with a courtly
                  grace, and made the salutation of the day.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               THE INTERVIEW.
               "PARDON my intrusion!" said Andre, with a bland smile; "for I fear this
                  unseasonable hour makes my presence unwelcome."
               "How slily you gallant officers of King George fish for compliments!" returned
                  Rosalie, laughing, "for well you know your presence is never unwelcome to the
                  fair."
               "And if we slily fish for compliments, as you say," rejoined the Adjutant, gayly,
                  "we seldom bait our hook in vain; for the wittiest of your sex, I perceive, can
                  flatter as well as others."
               "O, if you deem what I said flattery, I grant you so," responded Rosalie; "for I
                  thought that so plain a truth would pass for staple fact, and nothing more be
                  thought of it."
               "Nay, stop, prithee, or you will make me vain by sly reiteration."
               "Good faith! I see not well how that can be."
               "How so?"
               "Because one can not make what is already made."
               "Ha! now the cutting sarcasm comes," returned the Major, laughing and
                  coloring.
               "Only a truth, as plain as the other," said Rosalie, archly.
               "You think me vain, then?"
               "Assuredly."
               "In what way?"
               "In being the handsomest and best-dressed officer in the Royal Army!"
               "You mistake me, Miss Du Pont."
               "I must beg to contradict you. No gentleman, so precise in toilet as yourself, can
                  with impunity boast his freedom from vanity to me."
               "But this precision is a duty every gentleman owes to society."
               "Call it what you will, 'tis vanity that prompts it."
               "I trust you do not think me over-nice in dress."
               "Nay, nor under-nice; for then the term I just applied to you would not be a
                  correct one. You are exactly what you should be, to be a well-dressed man. The
                  frill of your shirt-bosom, the ruffles around your hands, have neither a plait too
                  much nor too little. The tie of your cravat is precisely à
                     la-mode, and your sword knot has no fault to answer for. Your coat
                  fits you as it would a tailor's block, and your boots and buttons are brighter
                  than your eyes."
               "But not so bright as yours, Miss Du Pont," returned Andre, rallying.
               "Aha! you think to buy me off with flattery tery, eh? but you shall not do it. Let
                  me see! the next thing is your hair. Ah, how nice it is combed, and brushed, and
                  curled, and oiled, and scented, and"——
               "Come, come, Miss Du Pont," interrupted Andre, "if you go on this way, you will
                  force me to believe what I have heard of you."
               "Of me? is it possible that any one dares to talk of me in my absence? And what
                  have you heard?"
               "That you——But I think I'll not tell you, just to punish you for making a jest of
                  me."
               "Jest of you, indeed!" exclaimed Rosalie, arching her brows. "I assure you, I was
                  never more in sober earnest in my life. But as you refuse to tell me, why, I must
                  go on with my personal critique."
               "Nay, now, if you will desist, I will tell you what I heard—is it a bargain?"
               "Yes."
               "Well, then, report says you are the most beautiful and eccentric creature in the
                  city."
               "Is that all? Why, I have heard that repeated so often, that the matter has become
                  stale. Really, I thought that Adjutant-General Major Andre would be the last one
                  to retail musty gossip."
               "Nay, I did not deem it such, Miss Du Pont," replied the Adjutant, coloring, and
                  compressing his lips, a little vexed in spite of himself. "Do you know now," he
                  pursued, rather maliciously, "that I should regard Miss Rosalie as one of the most
                  interesting beings in the world, were it not that she mixes so much bitter with
                  the sweet."
               "Ah, sir, that is so it shall not pall the taste," returned Rosalie,
                  good-humoredly. "And another thing: were I to show only my fascinations to the
                  accomplished Major Andre, he might fall in love with me, and forget the
                  absent."
               "The former, perhaps, but not the latter."
               'Nay, you could not truly hold to both, 'ye can not serve God and Mammon,'" was
                  the quick rejoinder. "And besides, I would have no lover sighing for another."
               "And I could never forget the absent," said Andre, mournfully.
               "Then I see we can not be lovers: and so, a truce to this badinage, and let us endeavor to be friends."
               "With all my heart, Miss Rosalie; and Heaven forbid we ever be enemies. And since
                  we have come to an understanding, I may venture to make known my business
                  here."
               Rosalie gave him a quick, searching look, and a close observer could have seen the
                  blood retreating from her face, till even her cheeks became ghastly pale. Fearing
                  he might notice it, she turned her head aside, and in an assumed, careless tone,
                  said:
               "Well, I am all attention."
               "In the first place," resumed Andre, "Sir Henry Clinton bids me thank you warmly,
                  for your untiring efforts to render yourself useful to the royal cause, and says
                  if there is any thing he can do to serve you in return, you must command him."
               Rosalie looked hard at Andre as he said this, and seeing by his open countenance
                  there was no duplicity in his speech, she breathed more freely, and answered:
               "I am much obliged to his excellency, for his distinguished consideration, and
                  should I require a service at his hands, assure him I shall make bold to ask
                  it."
               "And by this token it shall be granted," rejoined Andre, extending to Rosalie a
                  diamond ring of very peculiar workmanship. "His excellency also bade me give you
                  this, and request you to wear it for his sake; and whoever returns it to him and
                  seeks a favor, within his power to render, that person shall not ask in vain."
               "I will wear it for the giver's sake, and remember its talismanic power," replied
                  Rosalie, placing it on her beautiful, tapering finger, as a companion to the only
                  one she wore. "You see this," she continued, pointing to the other: "that also is
                  the gift of a very dear friend, else would it not be there; for jewelry, as mere
                  ornament, I despise."
               "And well you may," said Andre, gallantly; "for nature has done so much for you,
                  that seeking to enhance your beauty by things of art, is like holding a candle to
                  the sun, or attempting to paint the rainbow."
               "Well, I see you can flatter, too," replied Rosalie: and then added, gravely: "But flattery, sir, I despise, as much as I
                  do gewgaws."
               "I beg your pardon, Miss Du Pont, but I can not help saying you are a very
                  singular being."
               "Yes, singular, because I despise ornament and flattery, and prefer sense to
                  nonsense. I am aware, sir, I form a rare exception to most of my sex; but would to
                  Heaven I could not say so! When I say my sex, I mean those of my own age and
                  position. But on you gentlemen much of the blame must rest, after all; for from
                  the time a girl is old enough to be thrown into society, you make it a point to
                  fill her ear with flattery and nonsense; and though she may be averse to these at
                  first, yet time makes the poison both palatable and apparently harmless; and she
                  grows to like it, and even to require it, to keep her mental system from being
                  prostrated by ennui: whereas, did you take a
                  different course at the start, and treat her like a rational being, talk to her as
                  if she had common understanding, and seek to elevate her by your superior
                  knowledge, to let her know and feel that she is, in its true sense, a
                     woman, sent here as a helpmate to man, to rear and educate his
                  children, and occupy no inferior position in the great drama of life, you would
                  entirely renovate this feminine imbecility, and find in the gentler sex companions
                  fit to be partners in all your undertakings, to rejoice in your prosperity, to
                  stand unshrinkingly by your side in the hour of adversity, when even a broken reed
                  to lean on would be an invaluable treasure."
               "This is a great truth you have spoken," returned Andre, gazing upon the other
                  with a look of sincere admiration: "a great truth, Miss Du Pont; and it raises
                  you, in my esteem, as far above the butterfly legion of your sex, as they stand in
                  the divine right above the lowest order of animated beings. If I flatter you now,
                  pardon me, for it is the flattery, only of earnest truth, spoken with no false
                  purpose, but warm from the heart. But notwithstanding I regard your censure of our
                  sex just, in a great measure, yet I must take exceptions; for with most young
                  ladies, we are forced to talk trifling nonsense, or be deprived of their valuable
                  society; as higher thoughts and more dignified discourse are looked upon by them
                  as vulgar, and are certainly unsuited to their understandings and tastes. It is
                  their bringing up; and we must go back to childhood, and their parents, for the
                  true cause of this deplorable evil, and apply there for the remedy, after
                  all."
               "I grant you this is true, so far as it goes," replied Rosalie; "but you must take
                  into consideration the customs of society, and not blame the mother too much, who,
                  wishing to see her daughters shine in the fashionable world, takes especial care
                  that they shall have just such knowledge as the fashionable world requires; and
                  you well know the general parlance of the drawing-room excludes all discussions of
                  a literary and scientific nature. The evil, I may say, is with all parties; and
                  the sooner it is eradicated, the sooner will mankind reach the goal of
                  intellectual happiness."
               "Pray, Miss Du Pont," returned Andre, "may I ask where you received your
                  education, and what position your parents occupied, or do occupy?—for I know not
                  whether they are living or dead: and, in fact, only know so much of your history
                  as report gives out, which is limited to the fact that you are the niece of Graham
                  Percy."
               "And to those who seek to know more I have but one answer—that I am a myth, an
                  enigma, and so for the present wish to remain."
               "I crave your pardon, then, for my inquisitiveness, and assure you, that whether
                  nobly born or not, your talents alone are sufficient to entitle you to rank with
                  the proudest of the realm."
               "Again, sir, I must chide you for overstepping the limits prescribed. I perceive
                  you are determined to flatter me, whether I like it or not."
               "Forgive me this time, Miss Du Pont, and I will promise not to offend again."
               "Be it so."
               "Would it be an impertinent question to ask if you write? for persons of your turn
                  of mind are very apt to commit their thoughts to paper."
               "I have written some little, to while away a leisure hour."
               "Would it be asking too great a favor to request you to show me some of your
                  compositions?"
               "Why, for the most part, they are in a crude state; and really, sir, I must
                  confess myself too modest to venture placing them before a person of such critical
                  judgment, and well-known literary attainments, as Major Andre. Rather let me
                  request that you will favor me with some of your last poetical effusions—some, for
                  instance, that have not been published."
               "I would with pleasure, Miss Du Pont, only it so happens that I have nothing on
                  hand at present. The last article I wrote is a satirical poem, founded on an
                  amusing occurrence in one of the skirmishes of old General Wayne, and that I gave
                  to the editor of the Royal Gazette this morning."
               "It is not published, then?"
               "No, he said it would appear soon, however."
               "What is it called?"
               "The Cow Chase."
               "A curious title."
               "Ay, and for that matter, a curious subject poorly handled."
               "I should like to see it."
               "You will, soon enough, no doubt."
               "You write poetry altogether, do you not, Major?"
               "Why, poetry is my delight; but I am forced to write a good deal of prose, in the
                  way of correspondence, etc."
               "You have some female correspondents, I presume?"
               "A few—only a few."
               "Do you write prose to them?"
               "Poetical prose," laughed Andre. "It would not do, you know, to be very prosy with
                  a sentimental lady. The periods must be well rounded, and every sentence must
                  contain some metaphorical nonsense; else one is called stupid, and dismissed,
                  without so much as a chance to sue for pardon. But truly, Miss Du Pont, I am
                  forgetting the real business on which I called, after all; and as I have an
                  engagement with Sir Henry at four o'clock precisely, you must pardon me for
                  checking the conversation at so interesting a moment. On Tuesday next, there is to
                  be a grand military ball at the mansion of Sir Henry Clinton, and I have called to
                  know if I can have the pleasure of your company thither."
               "I will not promise positively," replied Rosalie; "but if I go at all, I will do
                  myself the honor to accompany you."
               "Thank you;" and Andre rose to take his leave.
               "By-the-by, Major Andre," said Rosalie, also rising, "you have not told me what
                  news there is in town?"
               "Why I believe there is none of any importance. The rebels, we hear, are very
                  anxious to effect a junction with their French allies—but whether they will or not
                  is very uncertain."
               "And if they do?"
               "I suppose they will proceed to attack the city."
               "Oh! merciful heaven! another siege! the very thought of it terrifies me," cried
                  Rosalie, in well-feigned alarm. "I have been through one; and heaven knows, I
                  never wish to be connected with another."
               "Nay, have no fears, then; no harm will be done here, depend upon it."
               "How know you that? Ah! you merely say so to reassure me; for of course, you can
                  not tell what will happen in such a case, any more than myself."
               "True, it is impossible for any one to say what will, or what will not happen; but
                  I have more knowledge of what will be the result, if the Americans attempt to take
                  New York, than you can possibly have."
               "And what will be the result?"
               "A signal defeat."
               "You speak confidently."
               "I speak what I know. An event is about to happen, Miss Du Pont, that will—But I
                  forget myself. I trust I shall have the pleasure of your company to the ball."
               "I will endeavor, sir, to do myself the honor. But one word more, on this subject.
                  Should the Americans and their allies attack New York, during the absence of Sir
                  Henry and his army, it seems to me they must find an easy victory."
               
               "And who says Sir Henry is going to be absent with his army?"
               "Why, it is everywhere reported that he is about embarking his troops on an
                  expedition to the Chesapeake."
               "Then report must make obeisance to you on starting, Miss Du Pont; for it is not
                  more than three hours since his excellency and your humble servant held the matter
                  under discussion, and I was not aware it had become generally known, even among
                  the officers, as yet."
               "It is true then?" said Rosalie, watching the countenance of Andre closely. "It is
                  true then, Sir Henry sails shortly for the Chesapeake?"
               "It is true, he designs setting out on an expedition of considerable importance
                  ere long."
               "To the Chesapeake?"
               "Why not?"
               "Nothing; only my mute, who picked up the intelligence and brought it to me,
                  seemed to think it was only true in part—that the expedition in reality is
                  intended for another destination."
               "Indeed! and did he learn what other?"
               "No; for beyond the report given out, all is more conjecture. But you know, Major,
                  whether it is true or not."
               "And grant I do?"
               "Perhaps you will favor me by saying whether it is, or is not, to be as
                  reported."
               "And why, if I may ask, are you so anxious to know?"
               "Why, my fears make me anxious; for if the force here is weakened, New York will
                  certainly fall into the hands of the hated rebels."
               "Then rest easy, Miss Du Pont; for the force here will assuredly not be
                     weakened—at least for the present."
               "Ah, thanks! you take a weight from my heart. Well, if I can conveniently, Major
                  Andre, it will afford me great pleasure to accompany you to Sir Henry's
                  entertainment."
               "I shall make dependence on you—now remember! Adieu."
               "Au revoir!" responded Rosalie; and the gallant
                  Major Andre took his departure.
               "So" said Rosalie, as the door closed behind him. "So, then, this expedition is
                  not designed for the Chesapeake. Aha! there is some plotting here—a deep
                  stratagem. What can it mean? Can it be Sir Henry meditates an attack on the
                  Americans, or on the French? There is something in the wind that bodes no good to
                  the right cause, and I must have this mystery unraveled. Now, then,
                  to answer my letter;" and Rosalie Du Pont glided gracefully out of the splendid
                  drawing-room, and went bounding up the broad steps to her own charming little
                  boudoir.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               THE ASTROLOGER.
               ABOUT ten o'clock on the night succeeding the events recorded in the last few
                  chapters, a solitary individual, in a citizen's dress, was hastening down a
                  narrow, crooked street, which then ran from Broadway to Queen. The night was hot
                  and sultry, and a heavy, black thunder-cloud, that stretched its huge front along
                  he western horizon, from which the lurid lightning issued with a gloomy glare,
                  betokened the approach of a shower. The street threaded by the wayfarer, as we
                  have said, was very narrow, and, unlike the streets of the present day, it had no
                  sidewalks, but was paved with small, round stones all the way across, and had but
                  one gutter, which was in the center—the sides, instead of the middle, being the
                  highest. The street was dark and gloomy, and was lighted only by the occasional
                  flashes of the approaching storm. The buildings on either side were low wooden
                  structures, with steep, pointed roofs, and overhanging gables presenting to the
                  street, and though very picturesque to look at from without, were not exactly the
                  kind to tempt a stranger to an interior exploration.
               Before one of these, however, our nocturnal wayfarer paused; and observing it for
                  a short time, by the almost constant flashes of lightning, he approached a little
                  gate that opened into a narrow passage between two buildings, and lifting a
                  lion's-head knocker, gave three loud raps. Immediately the voice of a negro
                  responded from the opposite side:
               "Who dar?"
               "A stranger, who desires to consult the great Carlo Carlini," was the answer.
               The negro opened a wicket door in the gate, of some ten inches square, and
                  reconnoitered the stranger; and then saying he would just run and inform his
                  master, disappeared. In a few minutes he returned, unlocked the gate, and bade the
                  visitor enter. Shutting and locking the gate behind the latter, the negro passed
                  him, and led the way to a side-door, which he opened, and ushered the other into a
                  long, dark hall, with low ceiling, and with no other furniture than a
                  rough-looking table, on which stood an iron lamp, whose sickly flame dispelled
                  just enough of the darkness to make the dismalness of the place visible. From this
                  hall, just to the right of the entrance, a rickety flight of stairs led to the
                  second story; and up these the negro continued, first securing the door behind
                  him. On reaching the next story, the guide took the stranger by the hand, and led
                  him along under a steep roof, in total darkness, till he came to another flight of
                  stairs, which descended about half way to the lower story. On reaching the bottom
                  of these, the black guide continued to lead the way, through a narrow, crooked
                  passage, till the stranger, becoming alarmed, seized him by the throat, and
                  threatened to blow his brains out on the spot, if he did not instantly promise to
                  reconduct him to the street.
               "Ye-ye-yes, massa stranger, sartingly I will, of you don't want to go no furder,"
                  cried the astonished negro; "bu-bu-but you most dar now, and I t'o't mebby you'd
                  like to see massa Carlini."
               "So I should, you rascal; but you are not conducting me to him."
               "Ye-ye-yes, massa, I is, sartin—on'y jest a little bit furder, and you see for
                  you'seff."
               "Go on, then—but remember there is a pistol at your head, primed and cocked; and
                  if you attempt the least treachery, you shall be the first
                  victim."
               "No-no-now, massa stranger, jest don't, please, hold dat instrument so proxumatic
                  to die chile's head; case it might go off consedentally, you know, and den poor
                  Tom hab no brains in his interregnum."
               "Silence!" cried the other, sternly, "and go on!"
               After continuing through the narrow, crooked passage some time longer, the negro
                  came to another door, on which he made three distinct raps with his knuckles.
                  Instantly, as if by magic, it flew open, and disclosed a light so brilliant, that
                  the stranger started back, and covered his eyes with his hands. When, after a
                  little, he withdrew them, he found himself standing alone, in a small room, or
                  vestibule, the walls of which were black, covered with illuminated hieroglyphics.
                  By what sorcery he had been thus suddenly transferred from where he stood a moment
                  or two since, exceeded all speculation. The brilliant light and black guide had
                  both vanished, and the stranger almost doubted that what he how beheld was real.
                  The apartment was about four feet square; and the only apparent outlet was a door
                  immediately before him. A soft light filled the room; but whence it came, he could
                  not tell, unless through the hieroglyphics, which appeared to be ground glass.
                  Half bewildered, he stood and gazed around him for a few moments, and then
                  approaching the door, made an effort to open it, but it was fast. At the same
                  instant, a clear, distinct, ringing voice, said:
               "Who enters the Chamber of Fate, must knock."
               Acting on this suggestion, the stranger applied his knuckles to one of the panels
                  of the door; and like the other, it flew open, as if by magic, and disclosed a
                  black screen, with a single illuminated light figure in the center, holding in one
                  hand a pen, and in the other a scroll, with this inscription over its head.
               
                  "Fate writes the destinies of individuals, of nations, of
                  worlds."
               The wondering stranger had barely read the words, when the screen parted in the
                  center, and disappeared, and a large apartment was before him, the walls of which
                  were hung with black drapery, and the ceiling of which represented the heavens, as
                  seen in a bright, starry night. But the most remarkable object in the room was the
                  occupant, and on him the stranger gazed with a feeling akin to awe. He was a
                  personage apparently between forty and
                  fifty years of age, with a countenance strongly marked by deep lines, and so
                  deadly pale as to appear almost frightful. To this unearthly pallor, his long,
                  raven hair, falling in wild profusion around his neck and over his shoulders, and
                  his small, black, fiery eyes, formed a most striking contrast. He was dressed in a
                  close-fitting suit of black velvet, which set off his fine figure to the best
                  advantage, and not a single ornament was on his person. He was seated on a black
                  stool, before a black table, on which lay manuscript, soiled white paper, pens,
                  and ink. On the opposite side of the table was another black stool, and above the
                  table hung a ponderous globe lamp, of ground glass, which filled the apartment
                  with a soft, even light. Pointing to the vacant seat, the astrologer—for such he
                  professed to be—said:
               "Put up thy weapon, young man; no harm will befall thee here."
               The stranger, who still held the pistol in his hand, uncocked and concealed it
                  beneath his vestments, and advanced to the stool, which brought him face to face
                  with the astrologer. He was a handsome, well-formed man, something under thirty
                  years of age, with an open, frank, and highly intelligent countenance. The
                  excitement of the last few minutes had made him very pale; but as he took the seat
                  indicated by the other, he said, with assumed nonchalance:
               
               "I will return my weapon, as I see there is no use for it here; but wandering
                  about an old building, with no very prepossessing guide, and that, too, in a
                  darkness impenetrable to the eye, is a very different thing. By-the-by, Signor
                  Carlini—I suppose I am right in the name?"
               "My name, sir, is Carlo Carlini," replied the other, almost sternly.
               "Well, Carlo Carlini, I must say you have a very admirable arrangement for
                  impressing the vulgar with a due sense of your greatness in the occult
                  sciences."
               "Didst come here, sir, to tell me this?"
               "O, no—because I knew nothing of it till I came. Or, rather, I should say, I had
                  heard there was something of the kind, but did not believe it could be done half
                  so skillfully and impressively. Why, it beats the jugglery of the mother
                  country."
               "Young man, beware!" cried the astrologer, angrily, his black, snaky eyes
                  flashing, and the purple veins of his forehead and temples beginning to stand out
                  like whipcords. "Beware how thou dost ridicule mysteries beyond thy ken!"
               "'Pon my faith, one would think you were threatening me, by your stern speech and
                  sterner look," returned the stranger, with forced assurance, for he did not in
                  reality feel so much at his ease as he wished to make the other believe.
               But he did not deceive Carlini, who, whatever other qualifications he might
                  possess, was certainly a keen physiognomist, and could read the thoughts, or at
                  least the characteristics, of a man by his countenance, as easily as he could the
                  title-page of a book.
               "Young man," he answered, "I do not threaten, but rather caution. I see thou
                  doubtest my ability to exhibit a miracle; and yet thou art afraid to put me to the
                  test."
               "Come, come, that is too good," returned the other, jocularly. "Afraid, indeed!
                  Why, I came here expressly for that purpose."
               "Sir," returned the astrologer, "thy skepticism shall be removed." He then fixed
                  his eyes sternly upon the other, and after gazing upon him for perhaps a minute,
                  resumed. "Now, sir, thou art wholly in the power of Carlo Carlini; and until I
                  will thee, thou canst not stir hand nor foot."
               The stranger made an effort to do so, but finding it impossible, was so affected,
                  that cold perspiration pressed through the pores of his skin, and stood in beads
                  on his face and hands.
               "Art satisfied?" inquired the astrologer.
               "I am satisfied you possess a power which I never believed till now was given to
                  mortal."
               "Enough, then,—and now to business. What brings thee here?"
               "It is reported you can tell a man's fortune by the stars."
               "I profess to do so."
               "I would know the past and the future."
               "Why the past?"
               "Because, if you can tell what will happen, you can what has happened; and as you
                  tell me right or wrong concerning the latter, so shall I know what dependence to
                  place on your predictions."
               "Be it so. Where wert born?"
               "England."
               "Place?"
               "London."
               "Age?"
               "Twenty-nine years, one month, seven days, and [looking at his watch] three
                  hours."
               "I will cast a horoscope, and make the calculation."
               The astrologer then took a bundle of almanacs from a drawer in the table, and
                  having selected one, examined it for a few moments attentively. He then referred
                  to an ephemeris of the same year, and taking up a pen, marked a square on a white
                  sheet of paper. Within this square, near the black lines, he next made characters
                  to represent the different planets, placing each in such position as the rules of
                  his craft dictated. This done, he examined them attentively for several minutes,
                  and again taking up his pen, began to make figures with great rapidity. In this
                  manner he was occupied some half an hour, during which time a dead silence reigned
                  in the gloomy Chamber of Fate—or, at least, a silence broken only by the rumbling
                  thunder of the approaching shower—and the stranger, pale as death, and with
                  compressed lips, sat and watched him, as though upon the first syllable he should
                  utter depended all his hopes.
               At length, raising his pallid, corpse-like face, and his black, snaky eyes from
                  the work before him, the astrologer regarded his guest for a short time, with
                  something like a mournful expression, and then said, in a clear, sonorous voice of
                  great solemnity:
               "My friend, go home, and seek not to know the mysterious ordination of the Book of
                  Fate."
               "Wherefore do this?" queried the other, with a slight tremor in his voice,
                  although he evidently made an effort to seem at ease.
               "Because it is not well with thee," was the solemn answer. "Seek to know no
                  more—but go home, and be earnest in thy prayers."
               "You think, then, I have not long to live?"
               "Seek to know no more!" was the still solemn rejoinder.
               "Speak out, Signor Carlini! I am a man, and a soldier, and have no vulgar fear of
                  death," returned the other, more firmly.
               "Ha! thou art a soldier, then?" said Carlini, eyeing the other closely; and if a
                  soldier, an officer in the king's army—for no man of thy address, look, and
                  manner, can hold the humble station of a private. The stars did not deceive me,
                  then, though thy dress is far from corresponding with thy calling."
               "Well, sir," returned the other, "since you know me to be a soldier, speak out
                  what else you know, for I would hear the worst at once."
               "Thou wilt have it, then?"
               "Yes; but first you shall tell me of the past, for reasons already named."
               "I will tell thee so much of the past, as will convince thee my words are true.
                  The last years of thy life have been rendered unhappy, by reason of a great
                  disappointment."
               "The nature of that disappointment?"
               "Love."
               The young man started, colored to the temples, and then said, with a sigh,
               "True—too true—but go on."
               "That event, sir, changed thy course of life. Had it not occurred, long years of
                  happiness had still been thine—on so trifling a matter does our good or evil
                  destiny sometimes depend. Of an ardent, high-souled temperament, thou didst fall
                  in love with a beautiful lady, who as ardently loved thee in return, and who was
                  in every respect worthy to become the partner of thy bosom; but friends and fate
                  interfered, ye were separated, she was married, and to drown thy sorrow, thou
                  didst forsake thy former employment in disgust, and take up the noble profession
                  of arms. The lady so loved, wedded another—but her heart was thine, as her
                  untimely death hath proven. Like a flower plucked from its parent stock, she
                  withered and passed from among the living to the holy mansion of the just."
               "She did! she did!" cried the young officer, covering his face with his hands, and
                  rocking himself to and fro in great mental agony. "By what means you are possessed
                  of this knowledge, Signior. I know not—but it is the painful truth."
               "Well, sir," pursued the other, "since that period, thy fortunes have been
                  various; and by the stars I read, that
                  from the captivity of war thou hast been delivered, and been favored with the
                  confidence and friendship of those high in power—in sooth, hast been elevated to
                  such a rank as might well make older heads than thine proud of the
                  distinction."
               "Again true," responded the stranger.
               "And have I told thee enough of the past?"
               "Yes, yes—I would now hear of the future."
               "Alas! that thou forcest me to tell thee thy doom."
               "My doom?"
               "Ay; for as surely as that thou continuest in thy present profession, so surely
                  wilt thou die a sudden and violent death."
               "Well," replied the other, "I have no fears of a soldier's death. I am prepared
                  for the fate of war, and trust, if I fall, I shall fall gloriously, in the cause
                  of my king."
               "But thou wilt not die in battle."
               "No?—how then?—by accident, or by the hand of an assassin?
               "Neither; thou art doomed to die upon the scaffold!" said the
                  astrologer, in a tone of great solemnity.
               The stranger started, and at the same instant a crash of thunder shook the house
                  to its very foundation, as if in confirmation of the awful words. True, there was
                  nothing remarkable in this, considering that the shower had been some time
                  approaching—but coming as it did, in conjunction with the sentence uttered by the
                  astrologer, it made a very startling impression upon the mind of one whose nerves
                  were unusually relaxed by what he had just heard. For a minute or two he spoke not
                  a word; and then rallying, said, with a forced laugh:
               "Come, come, my friend, you can not be serious in what you have said—so own up
                  that you have spoken to frighten me."
               "I would to heaven I could, and speak truth!" returned the other; "but the
                  stars—not I—have spoken, and they never lie. I have but translated their language,
                  at thy earnest solicitation."
               "And how long ere the consummation of this dire event?" asked the officer.
               "It is near at hand—it is even now impending; and at the very longest, I can not
                  stretch the time beyond three months."
               "And is there no way to avoid it?"
               "Art about setting out on a dangerous enterprise?" was the interrogative
                  reply.
               "Not that I am aware of, Signior. It is possible I may absent myself from the city
                  for a few days, on an affair of considerable importance; but in doing so, I shall
                  run no risk whatever, at least none is apparent. Stay, should I be successful in
                  this adventure, I may soon be called into battle—but there, you say, I shall not
                  die."
               "Avoid the present contemplated enterprise, if possible," said Carlini.
               "That I can not do, consistent with duty and honor, and therefore can not do at
                  all."
               "Then the consequences must rest with thee—thou art warned."
               "But you say I shall die on the scaffold?"
               "I have spoken."
               "But I see not how that can be, since I am certain that my heart contains no
                  treason."
               "Young man," pursued the astrologer, sternly and solemnly, "it is not for me to
                  argue my own assertions with one who is prone to be skeptical. What I have said, I
                  believe to be as true as holy writ. I have done."
               The stranger arose, and threw upon the table a gold coin.
               "Is that satisfactory?" he inquired.
               "No, for I would not take money from one to whom it has been my unpleasant duty to
                  utter such painful words."
               "But if those words prove true," rejoined the other, with an evident attempt at
                  jocularity, "I shall not need the money, and you should have something for
                  dispatching a man prospectively."
               "Stranger, thou art standing upon the verge of an awful abyss—consider well thy
                  steps!" returned Carlo Carlini. "Thy levity lessens not thy danger. Take back thy
                  gold—our interview is ended." As he said this, he arose and touched a small brass
                  knob that projected above the table. In a moment a black servant, not the one who
                  had conducted the stranger hither, made his appearance, holding in one hand a
                  light.
               "Conduct this gentleman to the street by the nearest passage," pursued Carlini,
                  addressing him, "and then return to me."
               "And since your master refuses this, take it you, for your trouble," said the
                  stranger, handing the negro the gold, whose eyes fairly sparkled on receiving it.
                  Then turning to the astrologer, the officer continued: "I may in time call upon
                  you again, to prove you mistaken in your prediction."
               "Never!" returned Carlini.
               "We shall see," was the response, as, with a graceful bow, the officer withdrew,
                  to follow his guide.
               He saw nothing more of a wonderful nature, but was conducted direct to the street,
                  by a near passage. The rain was falling in torrents; but unmindful of this, the
                  stranger plunged into the storm, and a moment later was lost in the gloom.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               A TRAITOR'S SCHEMES.
               THE course of our narrative again calls us to the residence of Joshua Smith, on
                  the bank of the Hudson. It was an early hour on the morning of a fine day in
                  September, and on the grounds owned by Smith, near the river, in a retired and
                  beautiful valley, through which the Haverstraw creek makes its last journey to the
                  Hudson, two individuals were standing, looking off upon the bay, and engaged in
                  conversation. These two personages were General Arnold and the proprietor of the
                  grounds.
               Arnold had come down from head-quarters in his barge the day before, had spent the
                  night at Smith's house, but not finding a suitable opportunity for a private
                  interview, had invited Smith to take a short stroll down by the river's bank. The
                  scene that now lay before them was one of rare beauty. The sun was just rising
                  above the eastern hills, and pouring a flood of golden light down upon the quiet
                  bay, whose bright waters seemed bent on making a suitable return in the shape of a
                  succession of silver wavelets. The air was soft and balmy, the dew sparkled on
                  leaf, and blade, and flower, and the birds skimmed over the waters gayly, or sang
                  most sweetly from among the foliage of a surrounding sylvan grove.
               But neither the sun, the water, the birds, nor the charm of the whole combined,
                  made any visible impression upon the mind of the plotting General, who, as soon as
                  he could properly bring the discourse to suit his purpose, said:
               "By-the-by, Smith, if I remember rightly, I said something to you the morning I
                  conducted Mrs. Arnold up the river, about keeping a good look-out on the enemy,
                  and reporting to me only, all intelligence you might gather of any
                  importance."
               "You did, General; and my reply was that I should be very happy to serve you in
                  any way, and that you might rely on me to use my best endeavors to this
                  purpose."
               "True; and that you have no superiors in this business, I have the word of my
                  predecessor, General Howe, who recommended you in the highest terms, as a wealthy
                  citizen, devoted heart and soul to the American cause; and said that you had a
                  written permission from him to pass the guards at all times, and do as you might
                  think proper, without question or hindrance."
               "General Howe so honored me with his confidence," returned Smith, proudly.
               "I will do the same, Mr. Smith," rejoined Arnold. "I should have given you the
                  pass before this; but the fact is, I have had so much to see to since taking the
                  command at West Point, that the matter was entirely overlooked till this morning.
                  Here is the required paper; and though it confers upon you privileges that, in
                  these troublous times, can be given to the very fewest number, yet I feel certain
                  no act of yours will ever make me regret my confidence in your integrity and
                  honor."
               "I trust I may be deserving of your excellency's distinguished consideration,"
                  rejoined Smith, as he took the proffered paper.
               "By-the-by, I suppose you have no important intelligence to communicate now?"
               "None, your excellency; unless it be a rumor of Sir Henry Clinton's intended
                  expedition to the Chesapeake."
               "Ah! yes, I have heard something of that," replied Arnold; "and I really do not
                  know whether to believe it true or not. It is all important that I have
                  information direct from the city; and
                  this brings me to an affair in which I may require your aid."
               "Your excellency has only to command, to be obeyed," answered Smith.
               "Thank you; you see the matter is just this: There is a young man in New York,
                  acting as a spy for me, with whom it is all important I should have immediate
                  communication; and I have hit upon a plan by which I think it can be effected.
                  This young man, whose name is Anderson, is believed by the British to be devoted
                  to their cause, and, not unlike yourself, holds Clinton's written permit to pass
                  the outposts of the enemy at any and all times. By a letter recently received from
                  him, I learn he has something to communicate of the utmost importance, and I am
                  now on my way to meet him, by appointment, at Dobbs' Ferry, and would like your
                  company down, if it would not be trespassing too much upon your time."
               "I shall only be to happy to accompany you, General."
               "Thank you—thank you kindly, Smith. Really, it is so tedious going by one's self,
                  with no more congenial spirits than a few common boatmen, to converse with whom is
                  like throwing pearls before swine. You will accompany me, then?"
               "With great pleasure, General."
               "Then I will step into your library, write a short note to Colonel Sheldon, and be
                  ready to set off in a few minutes. By-the-by, friend Smith, suppose anything
                  should occur to-day to prevent this interview, could I ask of you, as a great
                  favor, that you would let me have the use of your house for a short time, wherein
                  to meet my expected messenger?"
               "Certainly, General—my house is at your service."
               "Could you not manage to have your family absent? The fact is, you see, my dear
                  Smith, I wish, for important reasons, to have this interview as private as
                  possible. 'Tis true, I am now going openly to meet my secret agent; but in this
                  case he bears a message from Sir Henry Clinton, and this amply cloaks the real
                  designs of both. In short, my dear Smith, to make you my confident in this matter,
                  I expect to meet Mr. Anderson openly, in the presence of others, and before them
                  attempt a negociation concerning the exchange of certain prisoners; but hope, ere
                  the interview is over, to find an opportunity to fix upon a secret
                  meeting, that I may be able to get the desired intelligence; and as it may be
                  possible I shall require the use of your house, if you will be so obliging as to
                  get your family and most of your servants removed, I will endeavor, if in my
                  power, to requite the obligation."
               "Certainly, my dear General, certainly; it shall be done. I will take my family to
                  Fish-kill, under pretence of paying a visit to my relations; and on my return
                  therefrom, I will call at head-quarters, and inform your excellency thereof."
               "Just the thing, precisely; and now, as all is arranged satisfactorily, we will
                  retrace our steps to the house, and prepare for our trip down the river. I
                  declare, it will be delightful on the water to-day, and I am really eager to be
                  afloat. By-the-by, as to this affair, it may be as well not to mention it to any
                  one—not that there is any thing wrong about it—but then you know, my dear Smith,
                  we military men always make it a point to keep our most trifling acts from the
                  quizzing, vulgar, gossiping herd."
               "I understand, General," replied Smith, evidently elated at the idea that he, a
                  mere citizen, was thus raised so far above the "gossiping herd," as to possess the
                  confidence of so distinguished a general. "I understand the matter, and your
                  excellency may rely upon the secret being as safe with me as if no breast held it
                  but your own."
               The General and his tool—for Smith was neither more nor less than one—now returned
                  to the house of the latter; and being conducted at once to the library, Arnold
                  proceeded to write the following epistle:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "SMITH'S HOUSE, BELOW STONY POINT, Sept. 11,
                                 1780.
                           
                           "SIR,—Your letter, inclosing that of John Anderson to you, in which he
                              states he will come out with an escort to Dobbs' Ferry, and be there
                              to-day at twelve o'clock, in order to have the interview with me of
                              which I spoke to you, was received in due time; and as there are some
                              things in Anderson's letter of an equivocal nature, which I do not
                              understand, and as you say you are too unwell to ride down there
                              yourself to meet him, for the purpose of conducting him to your
                              quarters, as I requested, I have concluded to attend to the matter
                              myself, and am so far on my way. Smith will accompany me. In writing
                              to Anderson, over the signature of Gustavus, requesting
                              this interview, I was obliged to be very circumspect, lest the missive
                              should fall into the hands of the enemy, and so defeat our plans, with
                              the most serious results to him to whom it was directed. I managed,
                              however, to make him understand that if he came within the American
                              lines, he would be under your protection; and hence, I suppose, his
                              letter to you, of which there are parts, as I said, particularly those
                              relating to an escort and a flag, which I do not understand. However,
                              I will go down and attend to the matter myself, and trust to find all
                              right. Should I fail in having an interview with him to-day, and
                              should be come within the American outposts, you will send an express
                              to me, and allow Anderson to follow with an escort of two or three
                              horsemen, as my wounded leg renders it extremely difficult, not to say
                              painful, for me to ride so far as Salem. If your health will permit, I
                              should like you to accompany the escort.
                           "When General Parsons returns from Connecticut, you may show him this
                              letter, and explain the whole affair, so that there may not seem any
                              mystery about it. By complying with those requests, you will much
                              oblige
                           
                              Yours, etc.
                              B. ARNOLD."
                              
                                 "COL. SHELDON."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Having folded and sealed this letter, General Arnold dispatched it to Salem,
                  Colonel Sheldon's quarters—on the east side of the Hudson, some fifteen or twenty
                  miles distant—and then, accompanied by Smith, went down to his barge, which was
                  awaiting him, all manned, at the mouth of the creek just below. In a few minutes,
                  the barge was floating over the glassy waters of Haverstraw Bay, bearing its
                  treacherous freight, the oars of the boatmen glistening in the sun like so many
                  bars of silver.
               And here we find it proper to interrupt the thread of our story, in order to
                  briefly chronicle the plot of the perfidious Arnold to sell his
                  country to the foes of human liberty.
               Of strong and violent passions—haughty, self-willed, headstrong, overbearing—with
                  a temper that could brook no control, and a vanity that led him to acknowledge no
                  superior—combined with an intrusive ostentation, a lavish extravagance, a reckless
                  prodigality—Benedict Arnold was a man calculated to make far more enemies than
                  friends, and run through a fortune in a very short space of time.
               He was born in 1740, at Norwich, Connecticut; and even in boyhood displayed that
                  daring recklessness, that obduracy of conscience, that irritability of temper,
                  that innate cruelty and brutality, which so infamously distinguished him in after
                  life. Robbing birds-nests, and even maiming and mangling the young birds
                  themselves, within view of the old ones, that his ears might be greeted with their
                  cries of distress, was one of his favorite amusements. And what could be expected
                  of the man, who, as a boy, displayed such a brutal, vicious nature? Nor was this
                  all. He delighted to torment his schoolmates, by playing dangerous tricks upon
                  them, and then beating them if they dared to inform on him. Even at this age, he
                  seemed to stand in fear of nothing; and one of his feats of daring was to go down
                  to an old mill; not far from his father's residence, and while the big
                  water-wheel—which, in those days, was generally outside and uncovered—was going
                  round, to catch hold of one of its arms, and go round with it—now suspended high
                  in the air, now wholly immersed in water—to the great astonishment and even alarm
                  of the by-standers.
               These traits of character were rather sharpened than softened by time, and
                  consequently, in the army, Arnold had few or no friends, beyond the admirers of
                  his rash daring and personal prowess. While he held command of the army in
                  Philadelphia, he gave so much offense to the citizens and civil authorities, that
                  complaints were made against him, and he was subsequently suspended and tried by
                  court-martial. The sentence of the court, however, in consideration of the
                  valuable service he had rendered the country in several battles, was very light,
                  the verdict being that he should receive a reprimand from the
                     commander-in-chief mander-in-chief,
                  and be allowed to resume his official duties. But Arnold chafed not a little under
                  this dishonor, and secretly resolved to be revenged on a country which he now
                  regarded as very ungrateful. His worst passions were roused by this slight upon
                  his dignity, to call it by no harsher term, and he immediately set about carrying
                  out a devilish scheme, which he had planned in his idle moments. In doing this, he
                  had two objects—to revenge himself upon his enemies, and accumulate a good round
                  sum to support him in his extravagance. His style of living while in Philadelphia
                  was far beyond his means. He had a large mansion, furnished in the most expensive
                  manner, gave balls and dinners to distinguished characters, and kept his coach and
                  four, with an array of livery servants commensurate to his other follies. In
                  consequence of this, he contracted debts he could not pay, and an appeal to
                  Congress to liquidate them proved abortive. In this strait, he was ready to sell
                  himself, body and soul, for gold. Not that he cared a straw about the moral
                  obligation of his debts—but without new funds, he saw that he must dispense with
                  new luxuries, and this was a sore grievance.
               About this period, an event occurred which opened a ready means to the
                  accomplishment of the base project he had in view. Among the belles of
                  Philadelphia, was one universally acknowledged queen. This was the youngest
                  daughter of Edward Shippen, afterward distinguished as chief justice of the state
                  of Pennsylvania. She was young, being scarcely eighteen, beautiful, gay,
                  attractive, accomplished, and ambitious. Her father rather favored the royal
                  cause, and his was one of the families that remained in Philadelphia during the
                  period the British held the town. She was much admired, courted, and flattered by
                  the British officers, "and was a conspicuous personage at the gorgeous festival of
                  the Mischianza, an entertainment given in honor
                  of Sir William Howe, on the occasion of his resigning the command of the army, and
                  departing for Europe. Her acquaintance with Andre was on so familiar a footing,
                  that she corresponded with him after the British army had retired to New
                     York."*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Sparks' Life and Treason of Arnold.
               
               Arnold, at this time a widower bordering upon forty, became acquainted with Miss
                  Shippen, and was so smitten with her charms, that he soon made her an offer of his
                  hand; and she, ambitious, and dazzled by his splendor, unwisely accepted it. They
                  were shortly after married; and at the opening of our story, as the reader has
                  seen, they had an infant only a few weeks old.
               By this alliance, Arnold was thrown among a class of persons opposed to the
                  rebellion, as they termed the war, and all their arguments, of course, were in
                  favor of the treason he meditated. The correspondence between his wife and Andre,
                  which he was privy to, also laid him under new temptations, as by this means he
                  could make direct advances to the British commander, with whom Andre was a great
                  favorite. He wrote in a disguised hand, and over the signature of
                     "Gustavus," and further concealed himself behind a mercantile
                  mask, so that should any one of the missives fall into the wrong hands, it would
                  attract no more notice than an ordinary business letter.
               But even in this disguise, Arnold, by his ambiguous language, conveyed such
                  accurate information concerning American officers of great importance, that Sir
                  Henry Clinton, to whom Andre showed the letters, became deeply interested in their
                  contents and the unknown writer, and began to dictate the replies, which were ever
                  returned, as we have seen in a former chapter, over the signature of "John
                     Anderson."
               Thus matters went on for a long time, without any definite result. Arnold was
                  anxious to sell his country at a price that would pay him a fortune in British
                  gold; but Clinton did not care to buy, unless, to use a common
                  parlance, he could get his money's worth; and this was not to be got in the mere
                     person of a treacherous general. No, it was not the
                     man he wanted; it was what he might bring with him; and as for a
                  long time there was little prospect Arnold would ever be able to bring any thing,
                  so the discreet British general held out just sufficient encouragement to keep him
                  corresponding, in which capacity, under present circumstances, he was likely to be
                  more useful to him than in any other.
               At last Arnold solicited and obtained the command of West Point; and no sooner was
                  this effected, than the overture of the traitor assumed an importance, a
                  magnitude, in the eyes of Sir Henry Clinton, commensurate to the result to the
                  royal cause in the betrayal of the stronghold of an enemy into his hands—a
                  stronghold, in fact, which at this time was a key to the possession of the
                  country—and he directed Andre to hold out such mysterious inducements as would
                  hasten the negociation to the desired crisis.
               It was not positively known to Clinton or Andre, that Arnold and Gustavus were one
                  and the same; but there was strong circumstantial evidence of such being the fact,
                  and they of course acted upon this supposition. It was necessary, however, to make
                  the matter certain, and also to conclude a definite bargain, and this could only
                  be effected by a personal interview. For this interview, Arnold was as eager as
                  Clinton; and there was no one who could act as a substitute for the chief himself
                  so properly as Andre, who had all along been the correspondent on the British
                  side, and consequently knew every thing connected with the transaction from first
                  to last. Arnold even hinted that Andre should be sent to his head-quarters, and
                  there, under the disguise of a person devoted to American interests, make an
                  arrangement satisfactory to both parties; but this proposition Clinton
                  declined—fearing that the man who was willing to play the infamous part of a
                  traitor to his country, might take it into his head to prove treacherous to those
                  with whom he was dealing. He finally consented that Andre should meet him on the
                  Neutral Ground, and preparations to carry out this plan were accordingly made.
                  Arnold, to insure the success of his plot, and also to blind the eyes of any who
                  might watch his movements, informed Colonel Sheldon, who commanded the American
                  outposts on the east side of the Hudson, that he expected a secret agent from New
                  York, who would bring him a full report of the plans of the enemy, and that if
                  such a person came within the American posts, he must be conducted to Sheldon's
                  own quarters at Salem, and an express be immediately sent to Robinson's house,
                  where the General himself resided. Suspecting nothing sinister, Sheldon promised
                  compliance with the General's request; and Arnold immediately wrote to Andre,
                  informing him of the arrangement. On receiving this letter, Andre at once wrote as
                  follows to Colonel Sheldon:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "NEW YORK, Sept. 7, 1780.
                           
                           "SIR,—I am told my name is made known to you, and that I may hope your
                              indulgence in permitting me to meet a friend near your outposts. I
                              will endeavor to obtain permission to go out, with a flag, which will
                              be sent to Dobbs' Ferry on Monday next, the 11th instant, at twelve
                              o'clock, where I shall be happy to meet Mr. G——. Should I not be

                              me entreat you, sir, to favor a matter so interesting to the parties
                              concerned, and which is of so private a nature, that the public on
                              neither side can be injured by it.
                           "With all due respect, I have the honor to be

               This epistle proved an enigma to Colonel Sheldon, who had never before heard of
                  the name of the writer; but supposing it to come from the person to whom General
                  Arnold had alluded as his secret agent, he inclosed it in one of his own to the
                  General, asking an explanation of the language concerning the flag and escort, and
                  saying he was himself too unwell to ride as far as Dobbs' Ferry by the time
                  appointed, and hoped the General would either attend to it himself, or employ some
                  other trusty messenger.
               The reply of Arnold, written at Smith's house, the reader has already seen. Even
                  he was at loss to explain the ambiguous language of Andre; but it was enough for
                  his purpose to know that Andre was to be at Dobbs' Ferry at such a time, and he
                  was resolved to meet him at all hazards. Knowing that his progress down the river
                  would be observed, he put in the clause respecting having his letter shown to
                  General Parsons—who was daily expected on from Connecticut to take command of a
                  body of troops in the vicinity of Sheldon's quarters—in order that, should any suspicion be entertained of his movement,
                  this might be brought forward as an incontestible proof of his innocent
                  frankness.
               As by this digression we have made the reader acquainted with the general outline
                  of Arnold's maneuvers, for the completion of his treasonable projects, we shall
                  now return to the General himself, and follow him down the river to the place of
                  his intended meeting with Andre.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               A DANGEROUS MISTAKE.
               THE day, as we have said, was truly delightful, with a soft south breeze, that
                  stole up the bay, bearing on its invisible wings the sweet incense of forest and
                  plain, over which it had passed in light dalliance. The scene was one fully
                  calculated to make an impression on any mind more susceptible to the beautiful
                  than that of the plotting traitor. A broad glassy sheet of water spread out its
                  smooth surface to the bright sun, environed by hills, some of which rose
                  majestically above its tranquil bosom, clothed with a forest whose foliage
                  presented the variegated hues of early autumn, and whose inverted summits could be
                  seen far down the silent depths of the flowing river, along its shadowy margin. To
                  the right, peeping out from among the hills, was visible the little hamlet of
                  Haverstraw, with the flag of freedom floating above it, and spreading its starry
                  folds to the gentle breeze. Behind were the fortifications of Verplank's and Stony
                  Point, apparently resting upon the water, with the same glorious banners of
                  liberty gently waving over parapet and bastion. Near the fortress of Verplank's
                  Point, upon the side of the hill, a few white tents dotted the dark background,
                  with soldiers sauntering about among them, adding life to a portion of the scene,
                  and increasing the picturesque beauty of the whole.
               All these charms of scenery were not without their effect upon Smith, as, with
                  long-measured strokes, the hardy boatmen made the gay barge skim over the bright
                  waters, which rippled under her prow that pleasing sound so soothing to the ear,
                  and in such harmonious keeping with the delighted vision. For some time no one
                  spoke; Smith was busy drinking in the surrounding beauties of flood and field,
                  Arnold with dark thoughts of his own, and the boatmen stood too much in awe of
                  their stern master to venture a remark of any kind in his presence.
               At length Smith broke the silence.
               "Do you know, General," he said, "I think this bay a sort of kaleidoscope?"
               "Eh!" returned Arnold, starting from a deep reverie, and looking hurriedly around.
                  "Eh! why so?"
               "Because, come on it as often as I will, it always assumes new beauties; and the
                  charm it presents this morning, methinks I have never seen equalled."
               "Very fine, very fine," replied Arnold, in the same tone of indifferent
                  acquiescence he would have praised a garden patch. "I said the ride would be
                  delightful. An excellent place for fishing here, I should judge."
               "O, very," returned Smith, somewhat ironically, fixing his gaze upon the little
                  village of Haverstraw, where a few loiterers were seen on the high bank, watching
                  the progress of the General's barge down the river.
               "Yonder, to the right, is a fine-looking mountain," resumed Arnold; "has it a
                  name?"
               "Yes, your excellency, it is called Long Clove."
               "Hum! another Dutch appellative, I suppose?"
               "Doubtless."
               The conversation dropped here, and save an occasional common-place expression,
                  nothing more was said, till the party had passed the Long Clove on the right, and
                  Teller's Point on the left, where the river suddenly contracts to about its usual
                  width, and then as suddenly expands into another broad sheet of some ten miles in
                  extent, known as Tappan Bay, which, with its beautiful, romantic, and majestic
                  scenery on either hand, may not inappropriately be likened to a large mirror set
                  in a heavy-carved frame. At the farther end of this bay, where the Hudson again
                  narrows to its regular channel, the traveled route from Tappan to White Plains
                  crossed the river, and this crossing was known as Dobbs' Ferry.
               "Ah! here we are, in sight of our destination," exclaimed Arnold, with an unusual
                  degree of animation; and as he spoke he opened a small telescope he carried with
                  him, and brought it to his eye. After looking through it a short time, he resumed:
                  "There is a sloop-of-war, if I mistake not, lying at anchor about two miles below
                  the ferry. I can not divine for what purpose she is there."
               "Perhaps she brings you freight, General," suggested Smith.
               "That may be; but why stop so far down?"
               "For a good reason, perhaps," answered Smith. "She may not care to be in too close
                  proximity to those white tents which dot the west bank of the ferry."
               "But she should carry a flag of truce, and that, of course, would protect
                  her."
               "It may be she has other business up here," suggested Smith again.
               "Ah! that is true—it must be so—for if she brings the persons seeking an interview
                  with me, I am sure, if they come with honorable intentions, they need have no fear
                  to come even into the American camp. We are not such barbarians as to forget what
                  is due even to our enemies, when they see proper to approach us in the peaceable
                  form prescribed by the law of nations. I declare, it makes my blood boil to think
                  of the insults heaped upon us in every way, by these overfed, arrogant, bull-dog
                  red-coats; and when I get into a fight with them, I always make it a point to wipe
                  off old scores—at least I have some satisfaction in letting out the heart's blood
                  of a few of old half-cracked King George's minions. It has been a long while now
                  since I have been able to rest well of nights, just because this crippled leg ties
                  me down to inactivity; but I trust the time will soon come, when a little more
                  blood-letting will allay the fidgets, and give me sounder sleep."
               As Arnold said this, his eyes flashed, his features flushed, and he must have been
                  keen of penetration indeed, who could have pronounced this assumed indignation
                  other than real.
               "Well," said Smith, in reply, "in the first place, as regards this vessel, you are
                  not sure, General, that she has come up on the business that interests you; and in
                  the second place, allowing that she has, it is too early for the appointment; and
                  unless the business can be transacted by another as well as your excellency, it
                  would be as proper for her to wait below for the present."
               "Right, Smith—you are right—I did not think of that. Twelve o'clock is the time
                  set for the meeting, and it is now hardly ten. I thank you for the suggestion.
                  Row, men, row—we must be at Dobbs' Ferry in two hours, and it is good ten
                  miles."
               The men renewed their exertions, and the barge sprang over the glassy waters.
                  Arnold threw himself back in a reclining attitude, and became lost in reverie;
                  while Smith, taking up the glass, amused himself in looking through it at the
                  different objects both on land and water.
               As the party drew near Dobbs' Ferry, the shrill notes of a fife, and the roll of
                  the drum, came borne across the water from the American encampment on the right,
                  where a cluster of white tents, retreating in military order behind the hills that
                  lined the shore, could be seen, with here and there a company marching to and fro,
                  their plumes waving, and arms glittering in the sun like bars of polished steel.
                  On hearing the music, Arnold arose from his recumbent position, and looked long
                  and steadily toward the western shore, during which time a close observer might
                  have seen a shade of uneasiness cross his sinister features. This encampment was
                  the head quarters of Washington; and knowing himself a traitor, he feared lest
                  some unforeseen circumstance might expose his guilty design, ere it were brought
                  to a consummation.
               "Now, then, for the eastern shore," he said, when about half a mile above the
                  ferry. "I think I will land on that side of the river."
               In a few minutes his barge drew near some half a dozen British gun-boats, which
                  were stationed in that part of the stream to intercept communications, and
                  otherwise annoy their foes in every possible manner. Every thing went well, till
                  the treacherous general had got within some two hundred yards of the nearest
                  craft, when suddenly Smith exclaimed:
               
               "General Arnold, what means the unusual commotion on that boat? See! the men are
                  running to and fro across the deck, and seem to be making preparations to attack
                  us. There is an officer looking at us through a glass, who seems also to be giving
                  orders to his men."
               "O, merely curiosity," returned Arnold; but the words had scarcely passed his
                  lips, when a bright flash was seen from the deck, and a cannon-ball came whizzing
                  over his head, followed by the booming sound of a piece of ordnance.
               "D—n—n!" cried the General, starting up in rage. "Do the infernal scoundrels
                  intend to murder us in cold blood? Ha! there they go again." he continued, as
                  another bright flash was seen, and two balls came in close proximity, one cutting
                  across the stern of the barge, and the other striking the water a few feet short
                  of the mark at which it was aimed. "By heavens! I wish I were near enough to cut a
                  few of their cursed throats."
               "See!" cried Smith in alarm, "they are making preparations to overhaul us, and the
                  other boats are no longer idle spectators. There! they open their cannonades;" and
                  as he spoke, three more flashes were seen on board as many of the other boats, and
                  three more balls came whizzing through the air, one of them actually passing
                  between the speaker and Arnold, the latter of whom ground his teeth in rage, and
                  uttered a horrid oath.
               At the same moment a small boat was lowered from the nearest gun-boat, into which
                  sprang some half a dozen armed men, who, each seizing an oar, began to row
                  directly toward our party.
               "By —!" exclaimed Arnold, "they do intend to capture us, and no mistake. This must
                  not be. All together, men, and pull, pull for your lives! for if taken, a stout
                  rope or a British prison will be your doom. Give way, lads—give way! and if you
                  beat them, you shall have a gallon of rum each."
               The General might have spared this tempting offer to men whose every nerve would
                  be strained to avoid the horrors he had just set forth, and who, consequently,
                  would not be likely to increase their efforts for life, for the additional luxury
                  of a gallon of rum. They grasped their oars with that look of savage sternness, so
                  frequently seen on the faces of the lower class in a moment of extreme peril, and
                  fairly bent them with their Herculean strength, as they drew them home with long,
                  regular, but rapid sweeps, every stroke almost lifting the barge from the water,
                  and sending it skimming over the surface, with a velocity one would have hardly
                  thought possible for it to attain by such means. For a while the gun-boats kept up
                  a regular cannonade—their shot falling all around our adventurers, and as fate
                  would have it, leaving the barge and those it contained untouched—but as soon as
                  the pursuing party had got far enough away to render their firing perilous to
                  them, it ceased, and then the danger to the pursued lay only in the event of being
                  overtaken.
               "Pull away, men! pull away!" cried Arnold, a good deal excited. "Pull away now,
                  all together!—by ——! the foe is gaining on us. O, the——scoundrels! if I only had a
                  swivel here to pepper them! Eternal curses on them for a set of blockheads! There,
                  now, give way! give way! that was nobly done: how the oars bend; we shall escape
                  them yet! only hold out a little longer! See! we are rapidly gaining the western
                  shore. The——bull-dog ignoramuses—not to know any better than this! O, I'll teach
                  them—only hold out a little longer, noble lads;" and thus alternately urging
                  forward and encouraging his own men, and cursing his pursuers for every thing mean
                  and base, Arnold continued for some fifteen minutes, by which time the small boat
                  was within fifty yards of the barge, and the latter some quarter a mile yet from a
                  point of safety.
               "We are lost!" exclaimed Smith, as he looked on the sinking and fainting boatmen,
                  down whose hard, weather-beaten features the sweat was rolling in streams, without
                  a rag upon their bodies from which a child might not have wrung water. "See, they
                  can not hold out, and our pursuers are gaining on us faster than ever! General, we
                  must take the oars ourselves!"
               "I'll be——if I do!" roared Arnold; "I will lay to and fight them first. I've got
                  two pistols and a sword with me, and I'll have satisfaction out of some of the
                  cursed red-coated scoundrels! Ha! see! we are saved, if we can only hold out five
                  minutes longer;" and he pointed to the shore down the river, near the ferry, where
                  two American gun-boats were seen to spread sail, and stand out toward him. "Come
                  on, you——thieving scoundrels!" he now yelled to his pursuers, exultingly. "Come
                  on, I say, and catch a tartar."
               For a few minutes the pursuers seemed to renew their exertions, as if aware the
                  fugitives were on the point of escaping them. They now gained rapidly upon the
                  General's barge, and there was every prospect that the latter would be captured
                  ere the succoring gun-boats could get near enough to afford any protection.
               The distance had been lessened to about twenty-five yards between the small boat
                  and barge, when the boatmen of the latter simulataneously rested on their oars,
                  and declared themselves unable to pull another stroke.
               "Then by ——! we must fight!" roared the General, uttering a 
                     blaspehmous
                     blasphemous
                   oath; and standing up in the stern of his boat, he drew his pistols, and
                  holding one in each hand, pointed them at his pursuers, who were now rapidly
                  coming within pistol-shot.
               "Surrender!" cried the officer in command of the small boat, a heavy-bearded,
                  bronze-featured, Sampson-like fellow. "Surrender, or——you, we will give you no
                  quarter."
               Arnold answered by discharging one of his pistols at the speaker, the ball of
                  which passed within an inch of his head—so near, in fact, that its whizzing caused
                  him to incline his head one side. And this trivial movement saved his life; for at
                  the instant he dodged his head, a six-pound shot brushed his ear, and immediately
                  the heavy boom of a cannon rolled across the water. The pursuers dropped their
                  oars, and both parties turned with surprise to the shore, where they beheld a
                  detachment of artillery, with two field-pieces, from one of which the smoke was
                  just clearing away, while along the barrel of the other an officer was glancing.
                  The next moment he stepped back, the match was applied, a bright flash was seen,
                  and as a heavy volume of smoke rolled toward the boats on the river, a ball struck
                  the water about two feet short of the small boat, and, glancing, passed between a
                  couple of the boatmen, dashing the spray in their faces, followed by the same
                  heavy booming roar.
               Instantly the order was given to put about and row back. The men obeyed with
                  alacrity; and a minute or two later, more than a hundred yards divided the
                  pursuers and pursued.
               "There they go, the——prowling, foreign thieves!" growled Arnold.
               "A lucky escape!" said Smith, drawing a long breath of relief.
               "Ay, lucky for them," was the General's response.
               The bargemen now resumed their oars, and in a few minutes the General and Smith
                  were landed on the west side of the river; the gun-boats put back to their former
                  station, and the artillery, after firing one or two more unsuccessful shots at the
                  retreating foe, retired from their position on the hill.
               As Arnold stepped upon the bank, a young, athletic, noble-looking officer, with
                  fine, regular, handsome features, a clear hazel eye, and an appearance both
                  prepossessing and commanding, approached him, and making the military salute,
                  said:
               "I trust you are not injured, General."
               "No, thanks to timely assistance, and the cowardice of our pursuers. Am I indebted
                  to you for this escape, Captain Milford?"
               "Only partially. I was waiting here for an escort to take me across, when I
                  chanced to espy your predicament, and immediately communicated the intelligence to
                  Major Holton, who ordered a detachment of artillery to take a couple of
                  six-pounders up the hill to your relief."
               "I am deeply obliged to both Major Holton and yourself," returned Arnold blandly.
                  "You say you are waiting here for an escort to take you across. You are still with
                  Colonel Sheldon's detachment of cavalry, then, on the opposite side?"
               "I am, General."
               "Where are you quartered?"
               "At Northcastle."
               "May I inquire what brought you here?"
               "I was sent by Lieutenant Colonel Jameson, who commands the detachment at
                  Northcastle, to Colonel Sheldon at Salem, with a verbal message concerning some
                  recent depredations dations of the Cow
                  Boys and Skinners; and Colonel Sheldon, on receiving the message, requested me to
                  be the bearer of a letter from him to General Washington."
               On hearing this, Arnold slightly started, and turned a little pale; but quickly
                  recovered his self-possession, without his emotion being noticed by the other, and
                  in a tone of assumed indifference, replied:
               "Ah! a letter to General Washington, eh? Have you any idea of the nature of its
                  contents?"
               "I have not, sir."
               "You delivered it, of course?"
               "I left it with Lord Stirling, as General Washington and aids are absent."
               "Absent!" repeated Arnold, feeling greatly relieved at this intelligence. "Do you
                  know whither he has gone?"
               "I do not, sir—I did not inquire."
               "Hum! hum! I am sorry, as I wished to see him ere my return." Then after a pause:
                  "Where did you cross the River?"
               "At King's Ferry."
               "And intend to return by Dobbs' Ferry?"
               "Ay, sir, as soon as the escort is ready."
               "A word with you aside;" and stepping out of earshot of Smith and the boatmen,
                  Arnold continued: "I suppose, Captain Milford, you are kept rather busy on the
                  outposts at present?"
               "Why, yes, sir—what with an occasional skirmish with the Cow Boys, now and then
                  administering a flogging to the Skinners, overhauling travelers, catching spies,
                  and keeping close watch upon the movements of the enemy generally, we have little
                  time to be idle."
               "Well, what I wish to say, is," pursued Arnold, in a very bland tone, "I am
                  expecting a young man to come up from New York, who will bring me intelligence of
                  the secret plans of the enemy; and should you chance to fall in with him, you will
                  at once conduct him to Colonel Sheldon's quarters, who already has my instructions
                  concerning him."
               "Is his name Anderson?"
               "It is."
               "Then I have already received similar orders from Colonel Sheldon himself."
               "Ah! well, yes; then it is all correct."
               At this moment a voice called Captain Milford, and looking up the steep bank that
                  here arose above them, the General and Captain espied an orderly sergeant standing
                  on the brow of the hill.
               "What is it, Champe?" inquired the young Captain.
               "The escort is ready."
               "Ah! then I must go," said Milford. "Adieu, General;" and turning away, he sprang
                  up the hill with great agility.
               "Present my warmest regards to Colonel Jameson and Major Tallmage," Arnold called
                  after him.
               "I will do so, General," was the reply of the young officer, as he gained the brow
                  of the eminence and disappeared.
               Arnold, accompanied by Smith, now went down to the ferry, where he passed the day
                  in waiting for an interview with Andre. Whether the latter was on the opposite
                  side or not, he did not know; but the parties did not meet. Arnold chafed and
                  swore a good deal to himself at the blunder of the guard-boats, and was altogether
                  in a very unamiable mood at his signal failure. Why he had been fired upon, when
                  his presence was expected by the enemy, sorely puzzled him; but he thought it
                  probable that the withdrawal of the guard-boats had been either overlooked by
                  those who knew of his coming, or that it was supposed he would approach with a
                  flag, which, for many good reasons, he did not think proper to do.
               As night drew near, with no appearance of Andre, the General went into the
                  ferry-house, and procuring pen, ink, and paper, wrote a letter to General
                  Washington, which he sent to Lord Stirling's quarters by one of the boatmen. This
                  letter, after expressing the regret of the writer that the commander-in-chief was
                  absent, went on to state some important matters concerning his command at West
                  Point, and incidentally, as it were, mentioned that he, Arnold, "had come down the
                  river to that place, in order to establish signals, which were to be observed in
                  case the enemy ascended the river; and also to give additional directions
                  respecting the guard-boats, and to have a beacon fixed on a hill about five miles
                  below King's Ferry, which would be necessary to alarm the country.
               Having written this to lull any suspicion which might by chance be raised in
                  regard to his presence at that time in that quarter, Arnold felt more secure; and
                  waiting at the ferry till after sunset, he went up the river in the night, landed
                  Smith near his own mansion, and continued on to his head-quarters at Robinson's
                  house, which he reached a little before daylight on the following morning.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               THE WAGER.
               THE plan of our story now requires us to return to Captain Milford, whom we left
                  on the point of departing from the American encampment for his quarters, at
                  Northcastle, some fifteen or twenty miles distant, back in the country, on the
                  opposite or eastern side of the Hudson. The escort before referred to was composed
                  of ten strong, robust dragoons, commanded by Sergeant Champe, the same who had
                  called Milford while conversing with Arnold. As the Sergeant will figure somewhat
                  conspicuously in our narrative, it may not be improper here to give a passing
                  description of his personal appearance.
               In stature he was about six feet, and his broad, massive chest, and large, brawny,
                  muscular limbs, gave evidence of a man of very superior strength. His countenance
                  was in keeping with the rest of his person, and in its general expression was
                  grave, thoughtful, and even taciturn. He had a large Roman nose, thin, compressed
                  lips, angular cheeks, rather prominent cheek-bones, cool gray eyes, stern and
                  penetrating, and a high, broad, intellectual forehead, which, projecting just over
                  the eyes, indicated great perceptive faculties. You could see at a glance that he
                  was a man of stern integrity, invincible courage, and inflexible perseverance—one
                  who would shrink from no responsibility, if once convinced he was acting
                  honorably, but one who could not be bribed to do a mean or dishonorable action.
                  His hair was sandy, and his skin was naturally of that fair, soft, effeminate
                  texture pertaining to individuals of this class; but constant exposure to all
                  kinds of weather had made it rough, and given it a peculiar red hue sometimes
                  produced by holding one's hands in very hot water. He was apparently about thirty
                  years of age, and had a rather thin sandy beard, which he kept closely shaved.
               As Sergeant Champe rode along by the side of Captain Milford, the contrast between
                  these two officers was somewhat striking. The latter, as we have already said, was
                  a well-formed athletic man. He was not bony, and not so muscular as his companion;
                  but still he was not much his inferior in strength, and certainly his superior in
                  agility, which, doubtless, as an antagonist, would have given him the advantage in
                  any struggle where mere animal force was not absolutely necessary. He was nearly
                  six feet in height, straight as an arrow, and built very compact and solid, every
                  portion of his frame and limbs being well knit together. His countenance was open,
                  intelligent and manly, with fine, regular, handsome features, and a full, clear
                  hazel eye, which would reflect every emotion of its owner—being soft and mild with
                  sympathy, languid with love, sparkling with wit and mirth, and flashing with
                  anger. In the round, well-turned chin, full, handsome lips, dilating nostrils, and
                  clear, open brow, were expressed decision and firmness without undue severity,
                  voluptuousness without sensuality, pride without haughtiness, and intelligence
                  without conceit. In short you could see at a glance that he was "every inch a
                  man," possessing a noble soul, full of lofty, generous thoughts, where the baser
                  passions held no place. Brave, resolute, and energetic, he had the confidence of
                  his superiors, and was already looked upon as a suitable personage for promotion,
                  when a proper vacancy should occur in the corps in which he served. His complexion
                  was dark, with dark-brown hair, and his skin was browned by exposure, but had none
                  of that reddish tinge which so peculiarly marked his companion. His age was about
                  twenty-five.
               Captain Milford and his escort crossed the ferry without molestation, and took the
                  road leading to White Plains, where it was thought probable he would fall in with
                  some of his corps, and be able to dispense with the dragoons, who had orders to
                  return as soon as they should see him to a point of safety. The road to White
                  Plains lay over an uneven hilly surface,
                  only partially cleared, with here and there a deserted farm-house, or the ruins of
                  one, as landmarks of the plundering devastation which had swept over the country.
                  The party was now on the Neutral Ground, of which we have before had occasion to
                  speak, and every-where the horrors of war were visible. Farms which a few years
                  since had been under the cultivation of the industrious husbandman—with horses,
                  cattle, kine, and sheep roaming over their verdant fields—now appeared gloomily
                  desolate, with tall rank weeds occupying the former place of the golden harvest,
                  and broken down fences every-where bespeaking neglect and decay.
               As the party rode along, silent and thoughtful, Captain Milford and his companion
                  gazed around upon the cheerless scene, without uttering a word, till at length the
                  former, in a tone of some despondency, partly addressing his companion, and partly
                  expressing his thoughts in soliloquy, said:
               "Oh! when will this desolation cease?—when will these deserted dwellings again
                  behold their rightful tenants?—when will these black ruins give place to cheerful
                  homes?—these farms, that now run to waste, feel the pruning hand of the
                  industrious yeoman?—and under what banner of sovereignty will this much-needed
                  change be effected?"
               "When the proud eagle floats the stars and stripes above the tri-colored cross of
                  St. George, will all these things be," calmly replied Champe.
               "Do you think, my friend, there is such a blessing in store for us?" inquired
                  Milford.
               "Can you doubt it?" interrogatively answered the other.
               "Heaven knows I would not—but I can not help thinking that at present our
                  prospects are rather gloomy."
               "What! with a noble French force embarked in our cause?"
               "Ay, Champe, even with this; for as yet no junction between the two armies has
                  been effected; and the news of Gates' defeat in the south, and the recent arrival
                  of Sir George Rodney's fleet at New York, will, I fear, fully counterbalance the
                  elation felt by the country on learning that France is with us in our unequal
                  struggle, and leave us in a state of mind scarcely more sanguine than before this
                  event."
               "'Nil desperandum de Republica,' is my motto,"
                  returned Champe, sententiously.
               "And so it is mine, as a general thing," returned Milford, coloring at this
                  well-conveyed reproof; "but my fears for success sometimes subject me to feelings
                  of despondency; and the scene upon which we are gazing, and the train of thought
                  associated with it, has been productive of an effect to which I strive to be as
                  much a stranger as possible. When a matter lays so near the heart as the success
                  or failure of our arms does mine, I hardly think the best of us can be blamed for
                  having our fears of the result, Sergeant."
               "Do not understand, Captain Milford, that I blame you for your fears," replied
                  Champe; "for Heaven knows it is a trying crisis in our history; but if we make our
                  doubts a public topic, the disaffected will have an opportunity to enlarge upon
                  them, prognosticate therefrom certain success to the royal cause, and thereby
                  cause the disheartened and timid to shrink from lending us their countenance and
                  support. No, no; whatever we may think, feel, or fear, Captain Milford, we must
                  make an outward show of unbounded confidence in our own resources; for as the
                  chameleon takes the hue of whatever object supports it, so the common soldier
                  argues triumph or defeat from the assurance or indecision of those who command
                  him."
               "Right, Champe," returned the Captain, warmly; "you are right, and I thank you for
                  the timely caution; for though I have never given expression to my thoughts or
                  feelings before any of my men, yet there is no knowing what I might, have done, in
                  an unguarded moment. But entre nous, Sergeant
                  Champe, what is your own private opinion as to the result of this contest?"
               "That we shall ultimately triumph."
               "Do you really think so, my friend?"
               "I do. You and I, Captain, may not live to see it; but as certain as that there is
                  a just God in heaven, so surely do I believe the reign of monarchy is at an end on
                  this soil already hallowed by the blood of patriots fighting for freedom. Look
                  around you, and behold the facts on which I found this prophecy! You see these
                  houses in ruins, or falling to decay; you see these once peaceful and happy homes
                  deserted; and where are the tenants, the rightful owners of the soil, whom we are
                  too weak to protect? Go search the army list, and you will find the names of
                  nearly one half of those capable of bearing arms enrolled thereon. When men freely
                  sacrifice home, wealth, and all domestic comforts, and, taking the hard fare of
                  the unpaid, half-starved, common soldier, periling their lives in the cause of
                  their country against a well-fed, well-paid, well-disciplined army, with every
                  inducement held out to them to desert and return to their so-called allegiance,
                  what chance has his Majesty of ever finding faithful subjects in such citizens?
                  His overwhelming host of minions may succeed in crushing them for a time; but like
                  the fabled Hydra, for every head decapitated a new one will grow upon the old
                  trunk, and they will be fairly represented in their posterity."
               Champe spoke with an enthusiasm almost foreign to his nature; for, as a general
                  thing, he was a man of action rather than words, and at all times calm, cool, and
                  self-collected; but this only showed how near his valiant heart lay the subject
                  which the Captain had introduced. His own enthusiasm aroused that of his more
                  excitable companion; and the moment he had concluded, Captain Milford exclaimed,
                  at the same time extending him his hand:
               "Sergeant Champe, henceforth count me among your warmest friends. O, would that
                  our army were composed entirely of such men as you! there would indeed then be no
                  cause to fear the result of our struggle. The chivalrous blood of old Virginia
                  runs in your veins; I am a native of New England; but though there may in some
                  minds exist a prejudice between the descendant of a Cavalier and a Puritan, yet I
                  trust no such simple accident of birth may ever be cause to weaken the warm
                  friendship I now pledge you."
               "Rest assured, Captain Milford, no such trifling matter will ever have any weight
                  with me. No matter where born, nor of what parentage; I feel that we are brothers,
                  embarked in a noble cause, and on my part no effort shall be wanting to Preserve
                  the fraternal and friendly tie. Nay, more, Captain; I acknowledge I feel honored
                  by being allowed to distinguish you from the many, by the term you have just
                  proposed; and though not a man given to flattery, I beg leave to say in return,
                  that no officer of your years and rank stands higher in the army, on the score of
                  courage and ability, than yourself."
               This unequivocal compliment, coming from one of Champe's well-known integrity,
                  caused a glow of pride to mantle the handsome features of the gallant Captain; but
                  he instantly said; with a gay laugh:
               "I cry you quits, Sergeant, ere my vanity has an opportunity to get the better of
                  my judgment."
               The party now ascended a steep hill, which commanded an extensive view; but there
                  was little in the gloomy aspect of the country to put one of a contemplative turn
                  of mind in a cheerful mood. The land was still uneven and hilly, with the
                  exception of a fertile plain, which stretched away from the base of the eminence
                  for the distance of about half a mile, the farther portion of it bounded by a
                  little rivulet, which wound around the foot of a ridge similar in appearance to
                  the one from which our party were taking their survey. About midway of this plain
                  was an old, quaint, dilapidated structure, with steep roof, small windows, huge
                  chimney, and pointed gables, which, before the war, had been used as a dwelling
                  for an honest, industrious Dutchman and his family. It was now, like most of the
                  houses in this quarter, untenanted, save by an occasional straggler, who
                  perchance, belated in reaching his intended destination, ventured to pass the
                  night within its gloomy walls. There were at this time no out-buildings belonging
                  to it; but here and there a heap of black, charred rubbish, half-buried in rank
                  weeds, proclaimed where had been several, ere the plunderer came with his
                  destroying brand. Why the dwelling was preserved beyond the general wreck, we are
                  unable to say; though it might have been too well defended to permit the cowardly
                  incendiaries to get near enough to fire it, without too much risk of their own
                  unworthy lives; or it might have been, as was sometimes the case, that the
                  marauders were satisfied to burn the out
                  houses and barns, and drive off the folded cattle by the light of the
                  conflagration. Whatever the cause of its preservation may have been, matters not
                  to our story; enough for our purpose, that it stood alone, as we have described
                  it, another landmark of the terrible devastation which had swept, and was still
                  sweeping, over this portion of the country.
               "Yonder is another tenantless house," said Captain Milford, gazing at it from the
                  brow of the hill, "and there is no knowing but it once contained another argument
                  in support of your prediction, Sergeant, in the shape of a true patriot now in the
                  army."
               "I know not whom it contained," replied Champe, fixing his cool gray eye steadily
                  upon it; "but if I were given to sporting, I would wager my horse against yours,
                  Captain, that it is not now tenantless."
               "Indeed, Champe," returned the other, "what induces you to think so?"
               "A head, attached to a body, which just now disappeared from one of the
                  windows."
               "The open window?"
               "Yes."
               "I will not contradict you, but I must say I think you are mistaken; for I was
                  looking straight at that when I spoke, and both before and after, and I saw
                  nothing."
               "Then I must congratulate myself on having the best eyesight, Captain."
               "You really think, then, you saw a human head?"
               "More—I know I did," was the positive rejoinder.
               "Well, if you did, Champe, you doubtless. Saw the head of some vagabond; and it
                  will afford us a little pleasant pastime to overhaul him, and hear his blundering
                  account of himself; but so confident am I that you are mistaken, that I will wager
                  twenty-five dollars of Continental scrip, against the middle button of your coat,
                  that you neither find a human being in the house, nor see one leave the
                  premises."
               "Done!" said Champe. "Forward, men—keep your eyes upon Yonder building, and tell
                  me if you see any one leave it."
               He spurred his horse as he spoke, and dashed down the hill, Captain Milford
                  keeping him company, and the others following at a fast gallop. A few minutes'
                  ride brought the party to the old structure, when Champe ordered his men to
                  surround it, and throwing himself from his horse, approached the central door, and
                  pushed it back on its rusty hinges. Milford also dismounted, and both together
                  entered a large, gloomy-looking apartment, with low ceiling, and a fireplace of
                  sufficient dimensions to consume at least a half-cord of wood at a time.
               Our friends at once commenced a search for the occupant, if such there were; and
                  after carefully examining the first apartment, they proceeded to the next, and
                  from that to the next, and so on through the whole house, peeping into every nook
                  and corner, and even crawling along under the steep roof, and feeling with their
                  hands close to the eaves, where it was too dark to see. But so far nothing but
                  dirt and cobwebs rewarded them for their trouble; and when at last every room in
                  the house had been brought under their inspection, Captain Milford said, with a
                  laugh:
               "Well, Sergeant Champe, I shall now be under the disagreeable necessity of calling
                  on you for that button. It is a pity to spoil the looks of your coat; but then,
                  you know, your eyes not being quite so sharp as you supposed, you may perhaps not
                  be able to discern the difference."
               "Laugh while you may, Captain," returned the Sergeant, good-humoredly; "but I am
                  just as confident of winning now as before."
               "Indeed! why, I thought our search complete."
               "You forget the cellar."
               "True enough—but we shall not be able to explore that without a light."
               "Then we must have a light."
               "But where will you get it?"
               "I saw an iron stick, with a piece of candle in it, standing on one of the shelves
                  of the dresser, in the first room we entered. Even here, it seems, my eyes do
                  better service than yours."
               "We shall see."
               "Of course we shall," returned Champe drily; "else what were the use of our eyes
                  in a wager like this?"
               The two officers now descended a flight of old creaking stairs, to the ground
                  floor, and having lighted the candle, by means of flint, steel, and punk, which
                  Champe carried with him, they proceeded to explore the cellar. The air here was
                  impure, damp, and cold, and the walls were covered with slime. There was little in
                  it, and consequently the search was soon over, without discovering any body but
                  themselves.
               "Well, what say you now, my friend?" asked the Captain, triumphantly. "What think
                  you of your eyes and the button?"
               "You forget the oven," replied the other.
               "Very well, we will search the oven; but we might have done that before coming
                  down here."
               Our friends ascended to the first floor, and proceeded to search the oven, which
                  was large, and built in the chimney, on one side of the fireplace. It was
                  empty.
               "Well, what next?" asked Milford.
               "The chimney."
               "Good faith! will you ever be satisfied?"
               "Not till I find the head, save the button, and win the scrip," was the reply.
               The friends approached the chimney, looked up, saw the blue sky through the top,
                  but nothing in the shape of a human being.
               "Come, come, Champe," laughed Milford, "I must have the button; so pray make a
                  virtue of necessity, and yield the wager. Even you, who saw the head,
                  must now see that you have lost."
               Champe made no reply; but taking hold of the huge chimney stones with his hands,
                  and placing his feet on such as projected, he quickly ascended some ten feet, to a
                  point where another flue entering, left a small space concealed from the view of
                  any one below. After remaining here a moment or two, he carefully descended, and
                  without replying to the triumphant jests of his companion, who was now more
                  importunate than ever for the payment of the wager, he gathered up a handful of
                  loose straw that was lying in one corner of the room, and lighting it with the
                  candle, threw it into the fireplace. He then entered the adjoining room, did the
                  same thing there, and then quietly rejoined his companion, without speaking a
                  word.
               For some moments nothing was audible but the crackling flame, as it greedily
                  devoured its combustible food, sending up a huge volume of thick, black smoke; but
                  at length a snuffling, sputtering sound was heard, quickly followed by a voice in
                  the real nasal twang, peculiar to a certain portion of the New Englanders, which,
                  in a sort of smothered shout, managed to articulate loud enough for our friends to
                  hear:
               "Let me eout! let me eout!—murder, fire, brimstone, thunder and lightnin', let me
                  eout! and darn it to darnation, stop off your darned old fire and smoke! or I swow
                  to Guinea, I'll jest report the hull capoodle on ye to Gineral Washington, and
                  have ye hung for a set o' prowling vagabonds and thieves! O,
                  boo-oo-oogh—stup-ff—stup-ff—ough! Murder! fire! let me eout!"
               The voice had proceeded thus far, ere Milford and Champe, both convulsed with
                  laughter, could succeed in removing the burning straw from the two fireplaces; and
                  then as much more time was spent in putting it out; when the Sergeant, in a stern,
                  commanding tone, said:
               "Come down here, you sneaking varlet, and give an account of yourself." Then in an
                  undertone to Milford he added: "He is evidently a countryman of yours, Captain,
                  and the making of his distinguished acquaintance will cost you twenty-five
                  dollars."
               "Well," laughed the other, "I can see the joke, if I couldn't the
                  head. I think you must have stolen the eyes of a lynx, Sergeant, and faded them to
                  a light gray."
               A great snuffling, sputtering, and coughing was now heard in the chimney, down
                  rattled the soot in large quantities, and down soon came the cause of this
                  disturbance, and the author of the sublime language which we have recorded as
                  uttered in a moment of great bodily fear and partial suffocation.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               A LIVE YANKEE.
               THE new-comer, thus singularly introduced to our friends, was one of those rare
                  specimens of the genus homo, in giving birth to
                  which New England stands unrivaled even at the present day. He was tall, lank, bony, and round-shouldered, had a long,
                  sharp nose, and sharp features generally, with small, keen black eyes, that peeped
                  out from under a low forehead, and glanced about with a shrewd, cunning,
                  suspicious expression. His hair, somewhat between a tow-color and dirty brown, was
                  long, uncombed, and not only fell around his face and neck in no very elegant
                  profusion, but over his low forehead even down to his eyes. It was impossible for
                  our friends to guess his age, owing to his face being literally covered with soot;
                  but as we do not need to wait for him to perform a very necessary ablution, we may
                  as well state here, that about thirty winters had passed over his head. His dress
                  was in keeping with his own ungainly person. A kind of surtout, made of homespun
                  cloth, served the double purpose of coat and waistcoat. Under this was a
                  tow-colored shirt, with a flaunting bandanna tied carelessly around his neck. His
                  trowsers were too short to reach the tops of his heavy cowhide brogans, and as he
                  wore no stockings, there was in consequence an ample display of bony ankles. A
                  hat, with an immense bell-crown, and a rim of an inch in width, which came
                  tumbling down the chimney just after its owner, all covered with soot and dirt,
                  completed his attire. He was, take him all in all, a singular being; and you could
                  hardly judge, by looking into his countenance, whether to pronounce him honest or
                  dishonest, harmless or dangerous, there was such a curious commingling of candor
                  and duplicity, simplicity and cunning, timidity and boldness. His eyes, as we have
                  remarked, expressed both shrewdness and suspicion, and his sharp, intelligent
                  features showed an active mind, either for good or evil. A half-smile, which
                  lurked around the corners of his mouth, gave him a look of easy assurance, and was
                  at the same time of so doubtful a nature, that one was at a loss whether to
                  attribute it to good-humor or natural deceit.
               Brushing the soot and dirt in some measure from his face, hair, and eyes, and
                  spitting it from his mouth, he looked at the two officers with a mingled
                  expression of anger, fear, and curiosity, and then said:
               "Consarn it all! why didn't ye say you wanted me to come deown, without raising
                  sich an all-fired smoke? I swow! I thought the hull darned old shanty was afire—I
                  did, by thunder."
               Captain Milford, in spite of his efforts to look serious, burst into a hearty
                  laugh; but Champe, with a grave countenance, sternly demanded:
               "Who are you, and what brought you here?"
               "You want to know who I be, do ye?" was the rather insolent rejoinder.
               "Answer my questions, knave, or I'll have you tied up and flogged."
               "Wal, then, as I see you're in 'arnest about it, I'll tell ye. I'm Joshua
                  Snipe—ginerally called Josh for short—all the way from the state of Connecticut,
                  and I was fetched here by my legs."
               "And what were you doing here?"
               "Darn it all, I thought you knowed that; I was hiding up the chimbley."
               "And why were you hiding?"
               "So you wouldn't find me."
               "And why were you afraid we should find you?"
               "'Cause you officer fellers al'ays bother a feller so asking questions."
               "And if your pursuits and intentions were honest, why should you have any fear to
                  be questioned?"
               "Wal, I didn't want the trouble of answering; and besides, I couldn't tell, so for
                  off, but you might be Britishers."
               "Well, sir, answer me truly—for what purpose are you here? and what business have
                  you in this part of the country?"
               "Why, I haint no business here at all, and that's what troubles me; 'cause you see
                  I'd like tarnal wal to git into some kind of business, if so be I might make a
                  speck by it. I'll jest tell ye the hull on't, and may be you can help me a bit. Ye
                  see, old Snipe, my dad, was as brave a chap as could be skeered up in our parts,
                  and al'ays had a sneaking notion arter a fight, so much so that all the neighbors,
                  for a great way round, called him Fighting Snipe. Wal, he was tarnel poor for a
                  long spell arter I got to be a youngster, and used to go out to days' work for
                  Deacon Sam Peabody, a near neighbor bor of ourn. I guess you never heerd tell on
                  the deacon, may be."
               "Go on with your story, sir, and be brief."
               "Wal, he used to go out to days' work for the deacon, and used to arn jest enough
                  to keep marm and six children, all gals but me, from starving."
               "Well, well, Mr. Snipe," interrupted Champe, "we care nothing about this
                  rigmarole. Come to the point, and be as brief as possible, for our time is
                  precious."
               "Darn it all, that's jest what I'm coming to, if you'll let me alone. Wal, you
                  see, dad he had a putty hard time on't, and we too—but arter a while, marm she
                  tuck sick and died, and the deacon he died, and dad he got the place to halves of
                  the deacon's widder, and then we got along better, only he sot me to work, and I
                  had to pull up like a nigger—but we got enough to eat, any how."
               "I see you are trifling with us, fellow," again interrupted the Sergeant, seizing
                  Mr. Joshua Snipe by the collar. "Come, we must take you along, and let you tell
                  your story elsewhere."
               "I aint a trifling with ye, I swow, by gosh, I aint!" cried the now frightened
                  Yankee. "Every word I've told ye's true as preaching, and a darned sight truer'n
                  some kinds of preaching I've heerd afore now."
               "But why don't you come to the point?" asked Captain Milford, sternly.
               "I'm coming to the p'int as fast's I can. I aint a woman, by a darned sight, and
                  so I don't see as how I'm 'spected to keep up with one talking," returned Josh,
                  rather angrily.
               "You are a shrewd knave at all events," said the Sergeant, releasing his hold on
                  the Yankee's collar, and turning his head aside to conceal a broad grin, while the
                  Captain laughed outright. "But you have only got three minutes to finish your
                  story in," pursued Champe, "and so I give you fair warning."
               "Wal, as I's a saying," resumed Josh, "arter marm and the deacon died, and dad got
                  the deacon's widder's farm to halves, we got along putty wal, till the war come
                  on, and then dad, who hadn't had a fight for a long spell, said he was going to
                  Bosting to jine it. Wal, the next day he set out, and the fust thing we heerd from
                  him was, that he'd been killed at Bunker's Hill."
               "Ah! this sounds better," interrupted Milford. "So your worthy father was one of
                  the first martyrs on the shrine of freedom."
               "Wal, I calculate he was—least ways he got killed in the Bunker fight, if that's
                  what you mean, Gineral."
               "I am only a captain," smiled Milford "but go on with your story, for we have
                  delayed here too long already."
               "Wal, Capting, since you will have it so—but I swow you look like you oughter be a
                  gineral, if you aint—wal, as I's a saying, arter dad got killed. I stuck to widder
                  Peabody's farm like a tick to a sheep, till all the gals got married off—the
                  youngest one, Eunice, went last March—and then I packed up my duds, and told the
                  deacon's widder she might get somebody else to farm it, for I was jest a going to
                  tramp a bit, and see the world for myself. The deacon's widder hated to let me go
                  like darnation, and I reckon Sal Stacy didn't like it none too well; but ye see
                  Sal had another feller a courtin' her, and she thought may be she could git him,
                  and kind o'gin me the sack; but I calculated I'd be even with her, and I shouldn't
                  wonder if I was; for jest afore I left, the other feller left too, and so she's
                  got nobody now."
               "Ah! then here is your secret, after all, Mr. Snipe," returned Milford, good
                  humoredly. "Disappointed in love, you thought, like many another gallant knight,
                  you would drown your grief in the wild excitement of war. Eh! is that it!"
               "Wal, so'thing like that, Gineral—Capting I mean," returned Josh, with a rather
                  simple look. "Wal, ye see, I sot off, and tramped abeout a good bit, till I got
                  clean out of money; and then I let myself to a farmer through haying; and arter
                  that I jest thought I'd come over here to the army, and see how things looked; and
                  if it suited me, I'd a notion I'd list, and try fighting a spell, jest for
                  variety."
               "So you wish to enlist, do you!" demanded the Sergeant.
               "Wal, I don't know yit, 'cause I haint seen the fellers train—arter I've seen em
                  train, I can tell better."
               
               "Are you aware, Mr. Snipe, that you are in a very dangerous part of the country?"
                  pursued Champe. "I am surprised you have not been robbed and murdered, traveling
                  thus, alone, without even a passport."
               "That's just what I's coming at, Major."
               "I am only a sergeant, sir."
               "Ye-a-s—I thought you looked like you might be a major, so fierce and dignified
                  like. Wal, Sargent, since you will have it so, I's jest a going to say I'd been
                  robbed of every darned thing I'm worth, but these ere clothes, and I've been
                  kicked and cuffed about as if I was a nigger. But when I git to Gineral
                  Washington's lines, I calculate to tell him the hull story; and if he's the man I
                  take him for, I guess the darned scamps 'll wish they'd never had nothing to do
                  with Josh Snipe. But now I think on't, I'll jest tell ye so'thing that's a going
                  to happen to-night—so'thing that'll make your hair stand right up, I guess."
               "Well, out with it, and be quick!" said Champe.
               "Wal, ye see, as I's coming down through the country here, and not exactly liking
                  the chaps I meet on the road, I thought I'd take it cross-lots. I got robbed day
                  before yesterday, and ever since I've been afeared some of the darned scamps would
                  kill me. I'll jest up and tell ye how it was."
               "Never mind that, now, my good fellow," interrupted Milford, "but come directly to
                  the point of the story you set out with."
               "Wal, ye see, arter being robbed and kicked about a good deal by them ar darned
                  thieving scamps I's telling ye on, I begun to be putty keerful how I let any body
                  see me; and so, for the last two nights, I've slept out o' doors, in the branches
                  of the trees—and a putty considerable darned hard kind of a bed it was, I tell
                  you. Wal, last night I mounted a tree, arter chucking an ear of old hard corn I
                  found in a mean-looking house I come by in the daytime, and I'd jest got myself
                  cleverly fixed for a nap, with my back agin a big limb, and lots of branches each
                  side to keep me from rolling off—I'd jest got fixed this way, I say, and was
                  beginning to feel right dozy, when I heerd a lot of fellers all talking together,
                  putty loud, jest as if they was disputing about so'thing, and gitting mad. I laid
                  right still and listened, but couldn't make out a darned thin for a good spell,
                  though the fellers was coming right toward where I was all the time—but jest as if
                  they knowed I was in the tree they kept lowering their voices all the way up. At
                  last I heerd one on 'em say:
               "Now hush, can't ye, and not make sich a darned noise about it! 'Spose any body 'd
                  be a listening?' and then another feller said—
               "'Pshaw! you talk like a fool, Jack—as if there was any one about here to listen,
                  at this time of night. By Jupiter! I'd like to catch any feller a listening—I'd
                  jest cut his darned heart out on him.'
               "I swow to Guinea! I never felt more uncomfortable in my life, than I did when I
                  heerd that feller say that; and the way the sweat rolled off o' me, made me think
                  o' the time when I first tried to keep up with dad a mowing, on Deacon Sam
                  Peabody's widder's farm. I knowed if they found me out, there'd be one Snipe less
                  in the world, putty tarnal soon, too; and being as I thought a good deal of that
                  Snipe, I jest held right tight to the limbs, and didn't breathe louder'n thunder,
                  no how. Wal, the fellers—there wasn't less nor seven or eight on 'em—they kept
                  talking away, and disputing abeout this and that, and 'tother, till I wished to
                  thunder they'd clear out and let me go to sleep. By'm-by, one on 'em says—
               "'Wal, you can do's you like; but if I've got any thing to do or say in't, I'll
                  have the throats of every one on 'em cut, and the old shanty burnt up with them
                  all in it."
               "'Jemima,' says I to myself—'so there's murder abeout; and here you be, Josh
                  Snipe, you good-for-nothing feller, a listening to it, without daring to say your
                  soul's your own. Now,' thinks I, 'If I could only see Gineral Washington, and tell
                  him all abeout"——
               "Well, well, cut your story short," cried Champe, impatiently, "and come to the
                  point. Who are these men? and whom do they in tend to pillage and murder?"
               "You want to know who they be, do ye? Wal, there you git ahead of me; but they're
                  some darned scamps or other, you may depend upon it. All I know consarning the
                  persons they're going to attack is, that I heerd one o' the fellers say there was
                  four on 'em—an old man, his wife, one son, and daughter— and that he agreed to
                  kill three, and take the gal for his pains; but another feller said he shouldn't
                  do that, for the gal had got to be killed along with the rest."
               "And did you hear the name of this family?" asked Milford, anxiously.
               "Ye-a-s, I heerd one of the fellers mention it—but consarn me, if it hasn't
                  slipped my mind. Let me see? Bont—Bony—Burt?"—
               "Burnside." suggested Milford.
               "Ye-a-s, that's it—Burnside—I guess you know 'em, don't ye, Capting?"
               "Ay, sir, and a worthy family they are. By heavens! they shall be protected, too,
                  and these midnight assassins shall reap the reward due to cut-throats! You
                  overheard this last night?"
               "Yes, Capting."
               "And the attack is to be made to-night?"
               "Yes, Capting, abeout ten or twelve o'clock."
               "Then no time is to be lost—it is now hard upon three. Champe, can you be spared
                  from your corps over night?"
               "I regret to say I can not, Captain. Major Lee gave me express orders to set out
                  for camp the moment I should see you to a point of safety. He said it was possible
                  you would find some of our corps at White Plains, in which case he should expect
                  to see me before sunset."
               "Ah! this makes it bad!" returned Milford, musingly. "The Burnsides live about
                  five miles below here; and should none of my men be at White Plains, it will be a
                  rather tedious ride to Northcastle and back again, in time to prevent this
                  horrible tragedy. But prevent it I must, and will, at all hazards. You are not
                  deceiving me in this matter?" he queried, fixing on Josh a searching look.
               "Wal, I calculate I aint, Capting," was the cool reply. "Why, what good d'ye think
                  it 'ould do me to lie abeout it?"
               "None, Mr. Snipe, unless you have a penchant for
                  a striped back," was the marked rejoinder.
               "I don't know what you mean by pangshang," said Josh, simply;
                  "but I am not any ways curious abeout a striped back—for dad lernt me enough o'
                  that when I was a youngster."
               "Perhaps if none of my corps are there," pursued Milford, musingly, "I can fall in
                  with Paulding and some of his men, and persuade them to accompany me. Go I will,
                  at all events, if I go alone."
               "And who is this Paulding?" asked Champe.
               "A trusty fellow, and one of a brave little band of scouts, who have done us and
                  the country good service, in procuring important intelligence from the enemy,
                  arresting suspicious characters, and, to some considerable extent, protecting the
                  inhabitants around here against the marauding bands of Cow Boys and Skinners. They
                  are generally scouting in this quarter, or below, and it is more than probable I
                  can learn of their whereabouts at White Plains, even if I do not find some of the
                  party there. Come, we must be on the move. Champe, I will pay my wager at the
                  village. Josh, you must go with us—you can ride behind one of the troopers."
               Thus saying, the Captain led the way out of the house, mounted his horse, and in a
                  few minutes the whole party arrived at the village of White Plains, at this time
                  containing scarcely more than a dozen houses. As none of his corps had been here
                  through the day, Milford made inquiries, for Paulding, and learning that he was
                  somewhere about the place, he told the Sergeant he could get along without him.
                  The two officers then shook hands and parted—Champe to return to camp, and Milford
                  to prepare, for a new adventure.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               A STRANGE METAMORPHOSIS.
               ON the same day that the events of the last few chapters occurred, Rosalie Du Pont
                  was seated in her little boudoir, beside one of the windows, which commanded a
                  southern, view. Her position was one of careless ease. Her soft, white arm, bare
                  to the elbow, was resting on the casement, her head upon her hand, with her
                  beautiful fingers half buried among her raven ringlets, which in wanton profusion
                  swept down her lovely face, and in rich, heavy rolls, lay upon her alabaster
                  neck.
               Her soft, dark eyes were fixed mournfully upon some objects without, and a shade
                     of deep, sad thought rested on her
                  features, and ever and anon her snowy bosom would swell with a long, heavy
                  sigh.
               A casual observer would have seen little in the view to make her sad. The curtains
                  of the window were drawn aside, and through a trellis covered with creeping vines,
                  a gentle breeze stole in, and kissing her lovely person as it passed, played
                  wantonly with the loose papers on her escritoire, the music leaves on the table,
                  and gliding around the apartment, slipped out through the open doorway, softly,
                  silently, and unperceived. Looking down through the vine-clad trellis of the
                  window, the eye fell upon the shrubbery and garden before mentioned—then upon the
                  dark river, gliding calmly and silently along—and then, continuing the view in the
                  same direction, upon the heights of Brooklyn, and the redoubts and military works,
                  where, a few years before, the American army had taken refuge, after that
                  disastrous battle by which the British gained a decided victory, and subsequently,
                  from this cause, the possession of New York, which they had ever since
                  retained.
               But not upon any thing we have mentioned was the gaze of the beautiful Rosalie
                  riveted. Turning more to the left, and looking across that point of land, a part
                  of which is now used for naval purposes, a portion of Wallabout Bay was visible,
                  with several dark hulks floating upon its bosom. These only she saw, and these,
                  and the thoughts associated with them, caused her features to assume that
                  mournful, look, and her breast to heave those long, sad sighs. And good cause had
                  she for mournful looks and sighs, if that her gentle heart were tuned to throb
                  with sympathy for brave men doomed. Those low, dark, floating hulks were English
                  prisons for Americans; and from their noisome holds, where disease, fed by disease
                  and absolute starvation, ran riot, more than eleven thousand human
                     beings were borne to an untimely grave, and their bones left to whiten
                  and decay beneath the dark waters.
               "Oh! cruel, cruel war!" murmured Rosalie, wiping a tear from her eye; "and cruel,
                  cruel tyrants of a race that would be free! Are these the horrid means ye use to
                  make yourselves masters of those who will not bend the knee to earthly monarch?.
                  Out upon such cowardly assassination! for I can call it by no milder terms.
                  Meeting a gallant foe upon the open field, and man to man, life staked' gainst
                  life, there striving for the victory, is noble, even in so base a cause as yours,
                  compared to such a vile resort as this. Think Heaven will smile upon your
                  murderous deeds, and crown your efforts with success? No! for Heaven is
                     just, and ye will find it so in time. Oh! I that the time were
                  come to end this human butchery, and let the broad white folds of gentle peace
                  float o'er a land now rod with blood of martyrs! Ay, martyrs—that's
                  the word—martyrs on freedom's holy shrine—martyrs in a cause that has the
                  undivided sympathy of every philanthropic heart throughout the world. Europe is
                  looking on in wonder at this long-protracted struggle, and even monarchy itself
                  begins to sympathize with the unfortunate, and lend its powerful aid to right the
                  wronged. France, la belle France, my native
                  land, home of my childhood, thou, I am proud to say, hast set a noble example, in
                  sending hither aid to the oppressed! And thou, noble champion of liberty—thou who
                  from thy ancestral halls of luxury and ease didst come to lift thy arm against the
                  foes of them that would be free—thou noble, gallant Lafayette!—immortal honors
                  shall be thine! and millions yet unborn shall couple thy proud name with his, the
                  man of men, the great, the good, the heaven-sent Washington!
               "Oh! that I were a man!" pursued Rosalie, with enthusiasm; "that I were a man,
                  possessed of a hundred lives, that I might lay each down in the great sacred cause
                  of liberty, to show these minions of King George how much I hate—these noble
                  patriots how much I love them!"
               As Rosalie said this, with swelling heart, glowing features, and in a tone too
                  loud for prudence, a hand lightly touched her shoulder. She started, her face grew
                  ashy pale, and turning, she beheld Munee standing quietly by her side. In an
                  instant she recovered her self-possession, the blood again coursed rapidly, along
                  its proper channels, and in a hurried voice she said:
               "You here, Munee? how long have you been listening?"
               The mute caught up a pen and wrote:
               "Too long, did I serve King George as faithfully as my mistress."
               "I have been imprudent, Munee, I see; very imprudent; but yonder is the cause. You
                  see that boat, returning to that hulk, Munee! It has been out on an unhallowed
                  mission—to consign more tyrant's victims to their watery grave! Poor fellows!
                     their earthly troubles at last are over; and I could rejoice at
                  their fate, did I not know how soon they will have company from among the living;
                  and sympathy for those so doomed usurps the place of joy. But art sure, Munee, no
                  other listener heard my treasonous thoughts?"
               "There were none near when I entered," wrote Munee, "and I took the precaution to
                  close the door. But my sweet mistress must not so risk her thoughts aloud
                  again."
               "I will not, my kind friend, believe me," said Rosalie, seizing the hand of the
                  mute, and pressing it warmly. "But the horse?"
               "Awaits its rider," wrote the other.
               "At the place I named?"
               The mulatto nodded an affirmative.
               "Then quick! assist me to make my toilet for this new adventure. Make haste—braid
                  up my hair! What! tears, Munee! Come, come, be not so sad—no harm will befall me,
                  depend upon it! I shall be back to-night, or early in the morning, for to-morrow
                  night I must attend Sir Henry's ball. You shake your head, but you shall see. You
                  must personate me, Munee, in my absence. You need not fear interruption, now that
                  uncle and aunt are both away; for while you were gone for the horse, I called the
                  servants together, and told them they must not intrude upon my privacy to-day,
                  under any circumstances, and they promised obedience. Now I think of it again,
                  Munee, perhaps it would be as well for you not to make any change in your apparel;
                  and should any thing happen—there, do not look so frightened! I do not mean to
                  myself—should any thing happen, I say, that might expose you, and inquiry be made
                  for me, you can simply answer that I am out, and you know not how soon I may
                  return. It was lucky I thought to have you get another suit throughout, the exact
                  counterpart of the one you wear; for by this addition to our wardrobe, there can
                  be two Munees at the same time—Munee the elder, and Munee the younger;" and
                  Rosalie laughed gayly, not because she felt in a laughing humor, but that her
                  seeming light spirits might raise the spirits of her desponding servant.
               Some half an hour was spent in completing the metamorphosis of Rosalie from a
                  young lady into a stripling boy; but when done, the change was so great her own
                  father would not have known her. Her long, flowing ringlets were braided close
                  upon her crown, and then covered by a curly, black wig, which had been procured
                  expressly for the purpose. The jacket and trowsers fitted her as if made for her;
                  and when she stood before the glass, with the gold-banded blue cloth cap upon her
                  head, she burst into a gay laugh, and said:
               "Pardon me, Munee, if I hurt your sensitive feelings—but really, I see nothing to
                  prevent our being twin brothers, except our color, and that is easily
                  remedied with this preparation."
               As she spoke, she took up a vial of dark liquid, and pouring out a small quantity,
                  rubbed it freely upon her hands, face, and neck. In an instant her fair, white
                  skin assumed that sallow-brown hue peculiar to the mulatto, and even Munee
                  acknowledged her to be a very handsome representative of the colored race.
               "And now good-by, Munee, till to-morrow. Pshaw! you must not cry, girl! I tell you
                  I will be prudent. Ah! the passports—I was nearly forgetting them. Good-by!" and
                  shaking Munee's hand warmly, Rosalie bounded out of the room, and down the stairs,
                  leaving the other standing pale and motionless, and gazing after her with tearful
                  eyes.
               Rosalie turned up Queen-street, and walking very fast, soon reached a cross-street
                  leading out of an open space on the summit of a hill. Taking this, she hurried
                  down the hill, into a low, marshy portion of the city, where stood several
                  mean-looking houses. Selecting one of these, she rapped hastily on the door. It
                  was opened by a large, fat woman of forty, with broad, heavy features, which were,
                  in some measure, relieved from dulness, by small keen, intelligent black eyes.
               "Well, boy, what do you want?" she inquired, in a harsh, gruff tone.
               
               "Is this the residence of Dame Hagold?" interrogatively rejoined Rosalie.
               "Yes, Dame Hagold stops here—what then?"
               "Can I see her?"
               "What's your business with her?"
               "That I can only reveal to herself."
               "Well, tell it to me, then—I'm her."
               "It is private, and must not be spoken where it can possibly be overheard," said
                  our heroine, in a low tone, glancing cautiously around.
               "O, it's private, hey? Come in, then;" and as the other entered, Dame Hagold
                  closed the door with a slam, and added, "Who sent ye?"
               "My mistress."
               "And who's your mistress?"
               "Any listeners?"
               "No, I never have them things—there's nobody in the house but us."
               "Well, then, it was Rosalie Du Pont sent me."
               "Ha! Rosalie Du Pont, hey!" returned the other, with a look of interest, her tones
                  becoming less harsh, and her manner more respectful. "So Rosalie Du Pont sent
                  you?" she continued, eyeing her guest very closely. "How long have you been in her
                  sarvice?"
               "Only a few days."
               "I thought so. I knowed I never seen ye before. Well, what are ye laughing at. I
                  reckon you haint been teached your place as yet. Where's Munee, her tother
                  servant?"
               "He is with her still."
               "Be you brothers?"
               "Yes."
               "How comes it you can talk and he can't?"
               "He was sick, about five years ago, and lost his speech."
               "O, that's it, hey? Well, if you comes from Miss Rosalie, you've got her ring, I
                  'spose?"
               "Yes, here it is," returned the other, holding out her hand.
               "Ha! two on 'em, hey! and both diamonds. What's tother for?"
               "What—why, that—that is for something else," purposely stammered Rosalie, averting
                  her face.
               "Young chap, you're a spy," cried the other, indignantly, seizing Rosalie roughly
                  by the arm. "You aint what you pretend you is, or else you stole that ring—so own
                  up, or it'll be the worse for ye."
               "I am not what I pretend to be, sure enough," laughed Rosalie; "but I think my
                  disguise is perfect, since it has deceived you, mother Hagold."
               "Why, who are you?" queried the dame, in surprise, releasing her hold, and looking
                  eagerly and searchingly into the laughing face of her guest. "No, it can not
                  be—yes, it is!" and hurriedly, as she spoke, the dame tore off the cap and
                  wig—"Yes, it is, as I'm a sinner, Rosalie Du Pont herself! Why, gal, what are you
                  up to now, you eccentric creature? Why, if I'd a been your mother, I wouldn't
                  known ye from a half-bred nigger boy. Well, well, this is a curious world, and no
                  mistake. But again I ask, what are you disguised this way for?"
               "I am going into the country, toward White Plains."
               "Not alone!"
               "Yes."
               "Why, what ails the gal? you surely won't run sich a risk?"
               "How much of a risk is it?"
               "A powerful one—all your life's vo'th, in these troublous times. The Cow Boys and
                  Skinners is out every night now, and don't let any one off they can git their
                  hands on to. My curses on 'em both for plundering me, and burning my house!" cried
                  the dame, savagely. "But I've marked 'em, and I'll be even with the villains yet,
                  if I live."
               "Well, I am resolved to go, if only for the novelty of it. You know, mother
                  Hagold, when I once set my mind upon a venture, it is no trifling matter can stop
                  me."
               "I know you're self-willed and headstrong as old Nick himself; but still I must
                  protest agin your going out there to git captured, and may be killed—for sartingly
                  one, or tother, or both 'II happen to ye."
               "I think not. But tell me—have you any news since I saw you last?"
               "Well, no, not much wo'th telling—news are scarce now. I can't find out nothing
                  about Sir Henry's plans. All I can pick up is jest the same old story, about the
                  Chesapeake expedition; and it don't vary but trifling, though I don't believe much
                  into it, after all."
               "Have you made any thing at your business, lately?"
               "Not much—times is getting dull—and as long as there aint much chance of a fight,
                  soldiers don't keer particularly about their fortunes. I advertised in the
                  Gazette, Saturday, that I'd come back to town, and could be found at my old
                  quarters, in Queen-street, every night after seven; and last night I had two
                  customers, one on 'em a gentleman. He kept his face hid a good deal; but I knowed
                  he was a gentleman by his hand, before I seen his face."
               "You did see his face, then?"
               "Yes, I seen it, and I knowed him at once, although he was disguised as a
                  citizen."
               "Who is he?"
               "Guess."
               "I can not."
               "Major Andre."
               "Indeed! and what kind of a fate did you predict for him?"
               "Well, not over good; his palm was dreadfully cut up with trouble, and his line of
                  life stopped powerful sudden. Poor fellow! I reckon the next fight he gits into
                  will finish him."
               "God forbid!" rejoined Rosalie, solemnly; "for he is one of the most noble young
                  men I have ever met. But I have always noticed the good die first. How did he take
                  your prediction?—did he seem to put any faith in what you told him?"
               "Well, I don't hardly know; he looked kind o' sad and troubled, and said as how it
                  tallied pretty well with what another fortin-teller had told him."
               "Who?"
               "He didn't say, but I guessed it was Carlini. He axed me what I thought of one
                  man's holding another motionless jest by his will—and you know Signor Carlini's
                  got the knack of doing them things."
               "And what did you answer him?"
               "That it wasn't nothing so very wonderful to them as understood the hidden
                  sciences of man's composition; for if mind governed matter, mind was the most
                  powerfuler; and some minds being more powerfuler than other minds, could govern
                  them, and will their matter to do as they pleased."
               "A very lucid explanation," laughed Rosalie. "But, come; I must be going; for the
                  afternoon is half spent already, and I design being back in the morning; and
                  to-morrow night intend to accompany this same gallant Major Andre to Sir Henry
                  Clinton's ball."
               "Heaven forbid you be disappointed!" ejaculated the dame. "But do you know where
                  you're going?"
               "I wish to see the Burnsides: they are true, are they not?"
               "As steel. A right smart ride that—do you know the road?"
               "No, and it is part of my business here to have you point it out, so I shall make
                  no mistake."
               "Gal, you're mad—mad as a moon-struck loon—to think of making sich a ventur as
                  this, and you not even know the way at that! I declare I'll jest go down and tell
                  your uncle Percy of your folly."
               "What? betray my confidence, Dame Hagold?—for shame!"
               "Well, well, you know I aint in earnest, Rosalie; but I declare I ought to do
                  something desperate, to stop you. Are you going to ride?"
               "Yes."
               "Then you'll sartainly be captur'd; but I can't help it."
               "No, good mother, you can not help it; and so be quick, now, and tell me the
                  road—for every moment's delay makes my return just so much later."
               "But pray tell me what you're going for?"
               "Partly for a ride, and partly to convey some intelligence I have gathered, that
                  may be of importance to our friends."
               "Why don't you send Munee?"
               "Why, you know he is dumb; and the last time he was out, as he informed me today,
                  when I questioned him closely on the subject, he was near losing his life, because
                  he did not answer the challenge of the outpost guard. He stopped, and groaned, and
                  the sentry advanced to him with leveled musket, when he held out his passport, and
                  by signs made him understand he could not speak. I had rather venture myself, than
                  have any harm befall him."
               "But you can send somebody else?"
               
               "No, I would rather trust myself, this time at least. But the road, mother?—you
                  forget the road."
               The dame, in a few hurried sentences, now conveyed to Rosalie the desired
                  information, coupled with much caution and advice, respecting how to proceed, and
                  how to conduct herself in the event of such and such things happening.
               "And now good-by," she said, in conclusion, "and may the great God preserve you
                  from all harm!"
               "Amen!" responded Rosalie, in a solemn tone; and giving the other's band an
                  affectionate squeeze, she took her departure.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               TROUBLESOME ADVENTURES.
               ON quitting the premises of Dame Hagold, Rosalie hastened to the junction of
                  Queen-street and Broadway—which was here nothing more than an unpaved road—and
                  continuing up this some two hundred yards, she came to a very genteel-looking
                  farm-house, near which a fine, noble steed, bridled and saddled, stood tied to a
                  sapling. As she began to undo the halter, a man came out of the house and inquired
                  if the horse belonged to her.
               "If it was left here an hour or two since, by a dumb boy, for one Henry Pierpot it
                  does," replied Rosalie.
               "All right," replied the man; and vaulting upon the back of the noble animal,
                  Rosalie put spurs to him, and galloped away up the road, leaving a cloud of dust
                  behind her.
               During the first half hour, she passed several parties of soldiers, none of whom
                  offered any interruption, though more than one petty officer eyed her very hard.
                  By this time she was some four or five miles on her way—city and suburbs had
                  entirely disappeared—and the road she was travelling led over a wild, hilly
                  country, with only here and there a habitation at long intervals. Suddenly, as she
                  turned the angle of a hill, she came upon another party, of a dozen in number,
                  headed by a sergeant, who had stopped at a spring beside the road to rest
                  themselves, make a frugal repast, and replenish their canteens. Some were sitting
                  around the spring, eating their lunch and cracking jokes; others were stretched at
                  full length upon the ground, under the shadow of a few tall oaks, with their hats
                  lying by their side, and their knapsacks serving them for pillows; while another
                  party of four, among whom was the sergeant, were amusing themselves with a game of
                  cards. As Rosalie suddenly burst upon them, the sergeant and several others sprang
                  up in surprise; when finding they had been disturbed by nothing more important
                  than a "white nigger," as one of them termed our heroine, they began to vent their
                  spite upon the innocent cause of this interruption, in a series of coarse
                  imprecations and ribald jests, such as it had never been poor Rosalie's misfortune
                  to listen to before, and which caused her heart to sink within her—though she
                  managed, by a powerful effort, to cloak her fears, under a well-assumed
                  indifference. But she was not allowed to pursue her journey without still more
                  alarming demonstrations of the sergeant's displeasure; for she had scarcely passed
                  the party, and was just beginning to congratulate herself on escaping from such a
                  vulgar crowd, when the leader called out gruffly:
               "Halt, you——mongrel thief, and give an account of yourself! Who are you? and what
                  are you doing up in this quarter, hey?"
               At first Rosalie thought of putting spurs to her horse, and ridding herself of the
                  party by flight: but a moment's reflection convinced her this course would be both
                  impolitic and dangerous—the former, because it would attach suspicion to her, as
                  being on an unlawful business; and the latter, because in all probability the
                  sergeant would order his men to fire, and a chance shot might arrest her progress
                  forever. Besides, what had she to fear from British soldiers, while she had in her
                  possession the passport of their chief, which they were in duty bound to respect?
                  Resolved upon her manner of proceeding, she wheeled her horse suddenly, and fixing
                  her eye sternly upon the sergeant, who was leisurely approaching her, she said, in
                  a tone of severe dignity:
               "Did you address that language to me, sir?"
               "Yes——ye! to you," answered the officer, with a swaggering air.
               "Have a care, sir, or I will report your insolence where you will least like to
                  hear from it."
               "Who are you?" inquired the sergeant, more respectfully, evidently a little awed
                  by the bold, confident, haughty tone of the other.
               "This paper will inform you," answered Rosalie, drawing the passport from her
                  pocket and handing it to the sergeant, who opened it and read:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Permit the bearer, a mulatto youth, to pass the British lines and
                              outposts, at all times, without question or hindrance.
                           
                              "H. CLINTON, Major-General.
                              "HEAD-QUARTERS, NEW YORK, "Aug. 15, 1780."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "That's all right," said the sergeant, respectfully returning it; "but I couldn't
                  know you had it, you see, when I stopped ye. Pass on!"
               Rosalie made no reply, too glad to escape without more words; and putting spars to
                  her horse, she soon left the party far behind her.
               She met with no other adventure, except being once or twice required to show her
                  passport, till she reached a wooden structure spanning the stream that divides
                  Manhattan Island from Westchester county, when a sentinel, pacing before it, not
                  only demanded her written authority to cross the bridge at that time, of day—it
                  was past sunset, and beginning to grow duskish—but when he had received and
                  examined it, gave it as his private opinion that it was a forgery, and called the
                  officer of the guard—a strapping, big-headed Dutchman, who was sitting on the
                  steps of the guardhouse close at band, quietly engaged in smoking a meerschaum—to come and look at it.
               "Yaas," drawled the other, slowly taking the stem of his pipe from his mouth, and
                  lazily puffing out a thin, white wreath of smoke, with an air of great
                  satisfaction and self-complaisance; "Yaas, dat ish all perry vell for me to comes
                  to you; put you pringst him to me, an wilt pe all very mush petter."
               After examining the paper by the light, carefully turning it over some half a
                  dozen times, and scrutinizing the signature right-side-up, up-side-down, sideways,
                  and in every other possible manner his beetle-headed guardship could think
                  of—besides making the sentry read it over to him, till the latter could repeat it
                  from memory—this wonderful specimen of Hollandish extraction at last decided the
                  matter in this wise:
               "I think him all pe rights mit Sir Henree's own hand write; put ash it pegins for
                  to grows dark, I tink de poy better pe keeps in to guard-house all nights, till
                  ter morning—eh! Shon?"
               "Do it, sir, if you dare!" cried Rosalie, in a sharp, firm tone; for overhearing
                  the conversation, she saw that the quickest mode of making an impression upon the
                  dull comprehension of such a dolt, would be by a bold, confident, and threatening
                  manner. "Ay," she continued, "I repeat, do it if you dare! and as I live, I will
                  have you court-martialed for disobeying the orders of your commander-in-chief.
                  Sentry, give me back that paper, and let me pass, or I will make it the worst
                  day's work you ever had a hand in! Good heavens! is it possible that Sir Henry's
                  private messengers are no better respected than this? and even his own signature
                  regarded as doubtful authority! I shall take good care to let him hear of
                  this."
               "Shon," said the Dutchman to the sentry, laying down his pipe, and looking anxious
                  and troubled—"Shon, ter poy speaks goot, and Sir Henree may be not like him. I
                  think him over, and I tinks I gives him a mug of peer, and lets him co, mit
                  himself, and dat will pe petter ash goot."
               At this moment the attention of all three was directed to the bridge, by the
                  clattering of horses' feet on the opposite side. The sentry resumed his post, and
                  almost at the same moment two British officers, splendidly equipped, and mounted
                  on two noble beasts, covered with foam, dashed across, when their progress was
                  arrested by the challenge of the sentinel:
               "Halt! who goes there?"
               "Friends: Here are our passports; examine them and be quick!" and as the sentinel
                  an to the guard-house for a light, the two new comers walked their horses along,
                  till they came abreast of Rosalie, where they drew rein, when one of them, whose
                  features Rosalie could not distinguish in
                  the deepening darkness, but whose white hair denoted him to be a man somewhat
                  advanced in life, said, jocularly—
               "Whom have we here for a traveling companion?"
               "Unfortunately for myself, gentlemen, I am going the other way," answered our
                  heroine, "so soon as these dolts here can be satisfied that Sir Henry Clinton's
                  written permit is sufficient authority for allowing me to do so."
               "And do they dare dispute that?" questioned the second horseman, quickly. "I must
                  look into this matter. Where is the paper, boy?—for by your size and voice I judge
                  you are not yet a man."
               "I gave it to the sentry, who I believe gave it to the officer of the day,"
                  replied Rosalie, in a tone that was nigh betraying her agitation; for she fancied
                  the other's voice was not unknown to her, and now feared this second investigation
                  might result in more serious consequences than the first.
               Already she regretted having drawn so much scrutiny upon herself by her imprudent
                  remark; but it was now too late to repent, and so she nerved herself for the
                  trying moment.
               The Dutch officer now advanced to the horsemen, and making the military salute,
                  said, as he reached them their papers:
               "Pegs bardon, shentlemens, for make you stops. All ish rights—all ish goot."
               "But why do you detain this boy, here?" demanded the younger horseman. "He tells
                  me you have his passport, signed by his excellency, Sir Henry Clinton; let me see
                  it!"
               "Here it ish. I pegs"—
               "Get me a light," interrupted the other authoritatively.
               The light was soon brought, and the frightened Dutchman began to stammer forth
                  another apology, when he was again interrupted by the horseman, with, "Peace,
                  man!" and at the same moment the light and paper were held before his face, and
                  every feature of his handsome countenance was revealed to the trembling Rosalie,
                  who saw her worst fears confirmed.
               The young officer was Major Andre, and his companion was Colonel Beverly
                  Robinson.
               "This is all correct," said Andre," so far as the pass is concerned," and he
                  turned his large, lustrous eyes full upon Rosalie. "And I see nothing wrong here,"
                  he added, after a close and severe scrutiny of her person. "Why do you tremble so,
                  boy?" he continued, observing that Rosalie was greatly agitated. "No harm can
                  befall you here; though if you ride much farther on this road to-night, I will not
                  answer for your safe return. You have been wrongly delayed here, and those who
                  have taken upon themselves the responsibility of retarding a messenger bearing the
                  pass of Sir Henry, couched in such positive terms, had better have a care how they
                  exercise such unlawful powers in future. Not a word in your defense!" he
                  continued, sternly, addressing the Dutchman, who was once more on the point of
                  trying to exonerate himself. "Not a word in your defense, sir, but thank your
                  lucky stars if my good nature lets you off with nothing more severe than a
                  reprimand. And you, boy," he went on, turning again to Rosalie, and eyeing her
                  somewhat suspiciously, "it must be important business that takes you into the
                  country to-night. The date of this pass is rather old; and as it confers marked
                  privileges, the bearer must certainly be a personage of some importance. May I ask
                  if Sir Henry sends you himself?"
               "He does not," replied Rosalie, by a master effort, speaking in a calm, quiet
                  tone. "But the permit, which you pronounce genuine, I believe is positive on the
                  point of prohibiting the bearer from being annoyed with questions."
               "You are right, boy," rejoined Andre, coloring, and restoring the paper to
                  Rosalie. "You are right, lad, and I am wrong in questioning you. Ride on!"
               "And yet," hesitated our heroine, "lest you should suspect me without cause, I may
                  venture to say that I am in the service of Miss Rosalie Du Pont."
               "Indeed!" exclaimed Andre, with a marked change in his demeanor; "then I must say
                  you serve a noble mistress. But I thought her messenger a mute; and you, I
                  perceive, not only have a tongue, but can use it with an elegance of diction
                  seldom found in persons of your class. Pardon me! but you are not he who passes
                  for dumb?"
               "Not exactly," was the smiling response; "he you mean is my twin brother."
               "Ah! yes; I see now, there is a strong likeness. I thought you resembled some one
                  I had seen, but did not know where to place you. Have you been long with Miss
                  Rosalie?"
               "Only a couple of days. I came on a visit to my brother, and expect to leave
                  shortly. I undertook the task before me, rather than let him risk his life again
                  in this manner."
               "Ay, it is a very risky business, boy, and I am sorry to see one so young and
                  inexperienced as you seem to be, making so bold a venture. If you are taken by the
                  rebels, you know the old saying, 'a long rope and short shrift.' Miss Rosalie
                  should be more prudent with those that serve her than she seems to have been of
                  late; for though I can but applaud her loyal spirit, in striving to assist her
                  king and country all she can, yet the little she can do for us, over and above
                  what is done by others, is certainly not commensurate to the hazard she runs. But
                  I am delaying you and myself. Commend me to your mistress, if you see her before I
                  do, which is hardly probable, unless you return to-night, which Heaven send you
                  may do in safety! Come, Colonel, we must make up for this delay;" and putting
                  spurs to his horse as he spoke, Andre dashed away up the road, the Colonel
                  following close behind, and soon overtaking him.
               Rosalie watched the two officers till their shadowy forms were swallowed up in the
                  darkness; and then, without replying to the Dutchman—who, laboring under the
                  belief that he could only escape some terrible calamity by a complete exculpation
                  of himself, was already enacting the ludicrous tragedy of murdering the "king's
                  English"—she put spurs to her own gallant steed, and soon found herself on the
                  other side of the bridge.
               Night had, by this time, unfurled her sable wings, and settled over reposing
                  nature. Clouds, flitting athwart the heavens, shut off a goodly portion of
                  starlight, and made the night dark; and the soughing of a strong breeze among the
                  trees, rendered it unusually gloomy. The scenes through which she had passed, the
                  many warnings against danger she had received, the loneliness of her situation,
                  the uncertainty that lay before her, all conspired to depress the spirits of
                  Rosalie to an unwonted degree; and more than once she was on the point of turning
                  back, when she would seem to overcome her fears with a hasty "pshaw," and allow
                  her steed to continue upon his course.
               The road she was traveling was none of the best, even for that period, and led
                  over a rough, hilly country, in many places heavily wooded on either side; and
                  frequently, as Rosalie descended into some dingle, where interlocking branches
                  overhead made it impossible for her to distinguish a single object, she would
                  cling to her beast and shudder, with the dread of some impending calamity. Her
                  progress was necessarily slow; and when a couple of hours had elapsed, after
                  crossing the bridge, without bringing her to her destination, she began to grow
                  weary and discouraged, and to regret having been so foolish as to undertake such a
                  serious adventure. She now came to a fork of the road, and took the right; and
                  after continuing along this for something like an hour, without finding the house
                  she sought, her heart sunk with despair; and she fully resolved, if the next half
                  mile did not reward her efforts with success, she would retrace her steps, and
                  return home, much wise for her sad experience.
               At this moment, the glimmer of a distant light caught her eye; and as this was the
                  first she had seen since crossing the bridge, it made her heart bound with joy;
                  and putting spurs to her jaded steed, she rode forward at a fast gallop. As she
                  drew nearer to the light, it suddenly disappeared, which somewhat damped her
                  hopes, lest it should prove but a deceitful ignis-fatuus after all. She did not
                  slacken her speed, however, but kept her gaze steadily fixed in one direction; and
                  a ride of a quarter of an hour brought her alongside of a genteel-looking
                  farm-house, which from the description received from Dame Hagold, she doubted not
                  was the residence of the Burnsides, and the dwelling from which she had seen the
                  light, though all now appeared dark within, as if the family had retired for the
                  night.
               Dismounting at once, she approached the
                  door, and rapped loudly. Receiving no answer to this, she rapped again, and again,
                  each time louder than before—but still no answer. Rosalie now became alarmed, lest
                  something had happened to the family; for well she knew they lived in a portion of
                  the country where, and at a period when, neither life nor property were safe
                  against prowling bands of plunderers and assassins. Almost fearful to make another
                  trial, lest she should attract the notice of some lurking marauder, and yet not
                  wishing to return with her perilous enterprise unaccomplished, she finally
                  resolved upon one last desperate effort; and procuring a heavy stick, she struck
                  several times on the door, and shouted:
               "What ho! within here! If you hear me, for the love of heaven let me in! I bring
                  news of importance."
               She listened again, and her heart bounded with joy, for she fancied she heard
                  smothered voices in eager conversation; and she was about to repeat her demand for
                  admittance, when a light step approached the door, and a stern voice said:
               "Who's there?"
               "A messenger from Rosalie Du Pont."
               "Any one else?"
               "No, I am alone."
               The door was now speedily unbolted, and the voice said, hurriedly:
               "Come in! come in!"
               "But my horse," hesitated Rosalie; "he is fatigued, and must have immediate
                  attention."
               "Never mind the horse now, but hurry in, that I may bolt the door again."
               "You need not be alarmed," began Rosalie; "there is no one—"
               Her speech was cut short by the rush of a body of men from a thicket close at
                  hand; and uttering a piercing scream of fear, she threw herself forward to enter
                  the house; but ere she could accomplish her purpose, she felt herself roughly
                  seized and hurled back; and at the same moment some six or eight dark figures
                  flitted past her, and effected an entrance, uttering deep imprecations and horrid
                  oaths. The next moment she heard the roar of a volley of musketry, succeeded by
                  shrieks, groans, and a terrible confusion within; and as she turned, with the
                  instinct of self-preservation, to fly from such a scene of horror, a blow on the
                  head, from an unknown hand, laid her senseless upon the earth.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               THE ATTACK AND THE DISGUISE.
               WE left Captain Milford at White Plains, going in quest of one John Paulding, for
                  the purpose of organizing a party to proceed forthwith to the protection of the
                  Burnsides. It will only be necessary here to say, that Paulding was soon found,
                  and on being informed of the danger supposed to threaten this worthy family, who
                  were known to be staunch Whigs, he not only gallantly volunteered his own
                  services, but declared that, in an hour's time, he would place ten more brave
                  fellows at the Captain's disposal. He was good as his word; and in less than an
                  hour and a half from his arrival at White Plains, Captain Milford, at the head of
                  twelve stalwart fellows, of whom Josh Snipe made one, all armed to the teeth, with
                  muskets, pistols, cutlasses, and knives, was on his way to the residence of Peter
                  Burnside.
               As the design of Milford was to kill and capture as many of the marauders as
                  possible, every precaution was taken to make the expedition a secret one; and in
                  consequence of this, the whole party rendezvoused at a well known wood, about a
                  mile from the village, without horses, whence they set off a foot across the
                  fields. Taking a circuitous route, in couples, within hailing distance of each
                  other, and moving slowly and cautiously forward, they came in sight of their
                  destination a little after sunset. Here they waited until it was quite dark, and
                  then proceeded in a body to the dwelling of the Burnsides—the main party halting
                  just in its rear, until the Captain should make known his business, so as not to
                  occasion the family any unnecessary alarm.
               Although an early hour in the evening, he found the shutters closed, and the door
                  bolted—but had no trouble in gaining admittance; for the moment he mentioned his
                  name, the door flew open, and he received a hearty welcome; this being not the
                  first time, by several, the gallant Captain had been a guest beneath neath the
                  roof of Farmer Peter, as the head of the house was sometimes familiarly
                  denominated.
               "Ah! glad to see you, Captain Milford," said the host, a stout, hale man, about
                  fifty years of age, with gray hair, fresh complexion, and a fine, open,
                  intelligent countenance. "In fact, we are always glad to see you; and Betty here,
                  if you are away more than a week without calling, gets dreadful uneasy, and gives
                  me no rest, for wondering what has become of Captain Milford."
               "Now, father, I'll be even with you for telling every thing," returned Betty, a
                  fine, stout, healthy, rosy-cheeked lass of eighteen, who might very properly be
                  termed a rustic beauty; and as she spoke, she blushed to the temples, and went
                  bounding out of the room to hide her confusion.
               The old man laughed, and remarked that Betty was a fine girl, a little shy, but
                  would make some honest fellow none the worse wife for all of that.
               The hostess was a fat, fair, round-faced, matronly dame, of about forty-five, who,
                  unlike most of her sex, used her ears far more than her tongue, and seldom joined
                  in a general conversation, unless directly appealed to, and even then made her
                  remarks short and to the point.
               The only remaining member of the family, if we except two black servants—old Tom
                  and his wife Dinah—was a bright, sprightly, handsome, black-eyed lad of fifteen,
                  who, as soon as the first salutations were over, advanced to the Captain and
                  said:
               "Shall I see that your horse has an agreeable time over a few oats?"
               "No, George, I thank you," returned Milford; "my horse is well stabled at White
                  Plains."
               "At White Plains!" repeated father and son in the same breath. "Surely you did not
                  walk?" added the senior Burnside. And then, without waiting for a reply,
                  continued: "But I see by your fatigued and heated looks you did; and so before I
                  bother you with questions, you must have some supper. We have just finished; [the
                  table, covered with a clean, white cloth, and set out with bright pewter dishes,
                  stood shoved back against the wall, at which the two blacks sat eating], but we
                  will have something ready in a few minutes. Come, Dinah, hasten—the gentleman is
                  hungry. Do you like ham and eggs, Captain?"
               "All in good time, Mr. Burnside; but just now I have something important to
                  communicate;" and the Captain, in as few words as possible, made the whole family
                  acquainted with the object of his visit.
               As might be supposed, alarm and horror sat on every countenance; and old Tom and
                  Dinah were so frightened, that their eyes increased to nearly double their
                  ordinary size; and their sooty complexions lost several shades of color.
               The old farmer's first surprise over, he was prompt and decisive in his
                  arrangements. The house was a two-story building, of moderate size, with a door
                  central way of the front, which opened into a kind of vestibule, or entry, of some
                  three feet by five, with an inner door on either side, and stairs facing the
                  entrance, leading to the upper apartments. Of these two inner doors, the one on
                  the left opened into a sort of dining and sitting room, where the meals were
                  served, and where the family generally assembled in their every-day social circle;
                  and the one on the right into a large square apartment, with painted floor, and
                  frescoed ceiling and walls, which was kept reserved as a kind of parlor wherein to
                  entertain visitors of note. Dividing the men into three parties, the Captain, at
                  Farmer Peter's request, stationed two of them within the apartments just
                  mentioned, and the other on the stairs, so that, on the entrance of the robbers, a
                  terrible cross-fire could be poured in upon them, leaving them very little chance
                  of escape. The women were withdrawn into a rear apartment up stairs, where the
                  danger, in the event of an attack, would be less than in any of the lower rooms.
                  In these positions, the several parties awaited the onset of the banditti in
                  silence; for it was judged better to dispense with all conversation, so that in
                  case any of the marauders should be prowling around, they would believe the family
                  had retired for the night, and make the attack earlier than had been agreed upon
                  in the conversation overheard by the Yankee.
               Two hours were passed in this manner,
                  when Mrs. Burnside, becoming slightly indisposed, probably occasioned by
                  nervousness, a light was taken into her room; and the windows not having shutters
                  to them, allowed it to be seen from without; and this was what had caught the eye
                  of Rosalie, and hastened her approach; although, as we have recorded, it was
                  shortly after withdrawn.
               The clattering of a horse's hoofs on the highway, and the arrival of Rosalie, were
                  heard distinctly by all; and it was believed when she rapped on the door, that
                  this was a scheme of the robbers to get the door unfastened by some one of the
                  family, and thus effect an easy entrance. At first it was thought best not to take
                  any notice of it; but when they heard the voice of the knocker, they knew it was
                  either that of a female or a youth; and to prevent any mistake, it was decided,
                  after a hurried consultation between Milford, Paulding, and Burnside, that the
                  last-mentioned should approach the door, and challenge the party without, and then
                  be guided by the answer as to further proceedings. The mention of the name of
                  Rosalie Du Pont satisfied the farmer that the speaker had no connection with the
                  villains expected; and in consequence the door was hastily unbolted, and the
                  new-comer bidden to enter with all haste. Had Rosalie known the danger which
                  menaced her delay, she would have escaped all harm; but ignorant of this, and
                  anxious to have her horse cared for, she dallied till the bandits, concealed in
                  some bushes close at hand, heard enough to lead them to suppose their presence
                  suspected; when resolved to accomplish their design by a coup de main, they simultaneously rushed forward, and, hurling back
                  Rosalie, effected an entrance before the door could be closed against them.
               As they sprang into the house, Burnside darted into the room on the left; and at
                  the same instant the three parties, from the right, left, and front, gave them the
                  contents of their muskets. Three of the marauders were shot dead, four more were
                  severely wounded and disabled, leaving their leader and one other—for their force
                  consisted of ten persons, and nine had entered the dwelling—unhurt. The scene of
                  confusion, and, on the part of the assailants, dismay, which followed this
                  discharge of musketry, baffles description. Shrieks, groans, curses, and shouts,
                  resounded on all sides, above which the hoarse, stentorian voice of the leader of
                  the bandits could be heard:
               "We are betrayed! we are lost! h—l's curses on the traitor!—fire, villains, fire,
                  and then retreat!"
               As he spoke, he discharged both pistols toward the party on the left, and then
                  sought to gain the door; but he was too late to effect his exit; for the door was
                  closed, and between it and him were Milford and Paulding.
               "Surrender!" shouted the Captain, presenting a pistol to his head—"or I fire!"
               "Fire, and be——!" cried the infuriated ruffian, as he leaped forward to grapple
                  with his opponent.
               "I spare you for the halter!" rejoined Milford; and quick as lightning, he struck
                  the bandit full in the face with the butt of his undischarged weapon; and as the
                  blood gushed out of his nose and mouth, he fell back senseless upon his wounded
                  comrades.
               Meantime, Paulding secured and disarmed the other; and the rest of his men,
                  leaping upon the wounded assailants, wrested from them their weapons, and could
                  hardly be restrained from despatching them on the spot. The contest was a short
                  and bloody one, but the victory for our friends was complete. Of those that
                  entered the dwelling of the Burnsides with unlawful intentions, not a man escaped;
                  and fortunately none of the other party were injured beyond a scratch, which one
                  of them received from one of the pistols discharged by the leader of the
                  bandits.
               As soon as order could be restored, the dead and wounded, along with the others,
                  were taken into the family room and left under a strong guard; while the rest of
                  Paulding's men, after reloading their muskets, headed by Milford, made a sally, to
                  learn if any more were skulking about the premises.
               One of the first objects they discovered on coming out of the house, was Rosalie
                  Du Pont, lying unconscious where she had been struck down by the only one of the
                  bandits that had escaped. Milford was one of the first at hot side; and as he bent
                  over, to examine her hurts, he said, sadly—
               "Poor lad! I fear thou art an innocent victim of these accursed cut-throats; but,
                  by heavens! they shall pay dearly for their wicked doings. Ah!" he continued,
                  placing his hand on Rosalie's heart, "he is not dead. Goon, comrades; Paulding, I
                  resign the leadership to you; scour the grounds well around here, and be certain
                  there is no concealed foe. I will in with this youth, and see what can be done for
                  him: perhaps he is only stunned, and not dangerously injured."
               "Don't you wan't help to carry him?" inquired Paulding.
               "O, no—I can manage him with all ease;" and as the others departed, Milford raised
                  Rosalie in his arms, and bore her into the house mustering to himself as he
                  went—"So, then, the lad is not dead, as I feared, Heaven be praised! and doubtless
                  he bears something for me. Will you show me into a room with a bed in it?" he
                  continued, addressing the host, who opened the door for him. "This poor boy is
                  wounded—how badly I do not know—but, with your permission, I will be alone with
                  him till I ascertain. You doubtless think my request a singular one—but—"
               "O, no matter, Captain—no matter," interrupted the other. "You have your reasons,
                  and that is enough for me. Thank Heaven, that along with other failings, I am not
                  overly inquisitive! Right up the stairs, Captain, the first room on the left.
                  Stay! shall I assist you?"
               "O, no, I thank you; I will only trouble you for a light."
               "Bless me, yes;" and as the farmer hastened into the next room for a candle,
                  Milford ascended the stairs, and entering the apartment indicated by the host,
                  deposited his burden on the bed.
               Immediately after, the good man of the house handed in the light, inquired if
                  there were any thing else he could do, and being answered in the negative,
                  retired, closing the door behind him. Rosalie now began to show signs of returning
                  consciousness; and on looking for the wound, Milford was surprised he could not
                  find one. There were a few drops of blood on her neck; but he could find the skin
                  in no place broken. The blood appeared to have issued from among her hair; but on
                  feeling and examining her hand, all was dry, and no fracture was visible. For some
                  moments Milford stood perplexed as to the mystery of this, during which time
                  Rosalie was gradually reviving, when the idea suddenly flashed across his mind
                  that the youth—for so he still believed her to be—wore a wig. No sooner had this
                  thought entered his head, than he put forth his hand for the purpose of
                  ascertaining if his conjectures were right; but at the same instant Rosalie
                  started up suddenly, opened her eyes, started hard at him a moment, glanced around
                  the apartment, and exclaimed—
               "Where am I? and why am I here? And you, Edgar Milford—you"—she continued,
                  wonderingly—"how came you here with me? Am I awake, or is this a dream?"
               "You are awake, boy; you have been wounded—stunned, I presume, with a blow on the
                  head. But you seem to know me?"
               "He calls me boy, and says I seem to know him," returned Rosalie, in a kind of
                  wondering soliloquy, starting strangely upon the Captain. "Why, Edgar, do you not
                  know me?"
               "I have not that honor, my lad," answered the Captain, with a kind of haughty
                  reserve; "but if you serve Rosalie Du Pont, as I have understood you do, perchance
                  we may become somewhat better acquainted. You will please drop the familiar manner
                  you have for some unknown cause adopted, of calling me by my given name, and
                  henceforth address me as Captain Milford. It ill becomes one in your position—and,
                  if I must speak plainly, of your color—to attempt to set up for an equal with
                  those you have to deal with, merely because your sweet, kind, noble-hearted
                  mistress shows you undue lenity at home. I do not say this to hurt your feelings,
                  but merely to put you on your guard for the future; for nothing is more
                  disagreeable to me, and to others I know it is the same, than to be obliged to
                  have any thing to say to a forward, upstart, impertinent servant. Perhaps you of
                  the town think we of the country know nothing of good manners; but you must not
                  overlook, that most of us have been in town a good portion of our lives, and
                  therefore are not wholly ignorant of town etiquette. But enough of this; pray tell
                     me where and when you saw me before,
                  for your face is new to me."
               When Milford first began his reprimand, Rosalie looked at him in astonishment, for
                  her mind was still a little bewildered from the effects of the blow on the head;
                  but suddenly the whole truth of her disguise, position, and errand, flashed across
                  her brain; and she blushed deeply, even through the dark stain that changed her
                  fair skin to the hue of the mulatto. Milford saw the blush, but attributed it to a
                  far different cause than the right one; and doubtless took much credit to himself
                  for the effect of his words upon a rather impertinent servant; for Rosalie seemed
                  very much humbled, and turned her head aside, as if in shame, but in truth to
                  conceal a quiet laugh, which she found irresistible. At one time she resolved to
                  tell him all; but on second consideration, deemed it the wisest course, for
                  various reasons, to keep her own secret; and when he had finished speaking, she
                  replied—
               "I crave pardon, sir, if my language gave offense. I did not intend any
                  disrespect. I have so often heard my mistress speak of you, as Edgar Milford,
                  that, unconsciously, I had fallen into the same habit; but I will correct it."
               "Ah! so you heard your mistress speak of me, eh? What did she say—a—I believe I
                  have not been favored with your name as yet!"
               "Henry Pierpot is my name. I don't know as I am at liberty to tell you what she
                  said. But what has become of those ruffians I saw entering the house?"
               "Some are dead, some are badly wounded, and all the living are prisoners."
               Rosalie slightly shuddered, as she continued:
               "But how happened it, Captain, that you were here at such a critical moment?"
               "I had heard of their intentions beforehand. It was their design to rob and murder
                  these worthy people, and then set fire to the buildings; but I am inclined to
                  think they will never make another similar attempt."
               "What will be done with them?"
               "They will be taken to my quarters, at Northcastle, and there be tried and hung.
                  But of your mistress—what of her? is she well?"
               "Well, to the best of my belief save a head ache, which she had when I saw her
                  last," replied Rosalie, again managing to conceal a smile.
               "Nothing serious, I trust?" suggested Milford, anxiously.
               "O, no, sir—I think not."
               "But you have not told me where you saw me before."
               "I think it was in Charleston. You were taken prisoner by the British."
               "Ay, and owe my release to your noble mistress. But, surely, you are not the young
                  lad that was with her then? I think she called him Munee; and if I remember
                  rightly, he was dumb—or if not, at least he pretended to be so."
               "Munee is dumb—I am no nearer related to him than a brother."
               "Ah! I understand. But I have little time to spare—so we must talk fast. Do you
                  bring any news for me? Were you intrusted with a letter for any one?"
               "No; my mistress thought the risk too great for me to bear a written missive, and
                  so my only message is a verbal one."
               "For whom?"
               "Why, I believe it was intended to reach you, through Mr. Burnside."
               "Then you may as well tell me at once, and not trouble a third party."
               "A certain person—I will call no names—bids me say, that the rumor respecting the
                  design of Clinton to sail for the Chesapeake is false, and circulated to deceive
                  the American commander. No force of consequence will be withdrawn from New York;
                  but active preparations are being made for some enterprise of great moment, and
                  Washington must be on his guard against a fatal surprise."
               "Indeed!" said Milford; "this is important, and must be made known to our
                  commander-in-chief without delay."
               "And inform him also," pursued Rosalie, "that should he succeed in effecting a
                  junction with his French allies, he can not, at the present time, please Sir Henry
                  Clinton better, than by laying siege to New York with the combined forces—as the
                  British general is not only fully prepared for this but hoping and expecting it.
                  The latter has some deep scheme on hand—but what it is I am unable to say; though
                  if one as humble as myself were permitted to give expression to conjecture"—
               "Well, say on!" rejoined Milford, as the other hesitated.
               "I should hint at treason in high places," concluded Rosalie.
               "Good heavens!" cried Milford, with a look of alarm. "What foundation have you for
                  this surmise?"
               "Hardly any—none, perhaps, that would have weight as evidence. I must own it
                  proceeds as much (if not more) from my own forebodings, as from any thing I have
                  seen or heard. Doubtless I am influenced not a little by a dream I had last night,
                  connected as it was with a slight incident which occurred the day previous. A week
                  or so ago, a British officer, high in the confidence of Sir Henry, called to see
                  me"—
               "You?"
               "My mistress, I should say," pursued Rosalie coloring; "I feel so much interested
                  in her fortunes, that making myself identical may almost be pardoned,—called to
                  see my mistress, I say, for the purpose of inviting her to a ball at Sir Henry's,
                  which comes off tomorrow evening. Well, on Saturday he called again, staid a few
                  minutes, and left. After he had gone, I saw a letter lying on the carpet,
                  addressed to some person whose name I disremember—it certainly was not the
                  officer's in question—and, prompted by curiosity, I opened it. The first and only
                  words my eyes fell upon, were these:
               "'All is arranged for our meeting—have no fears to come within the American
                     outposts! Colonel'——
               "The name of the officer was on the opposite page; and ere I could turn to it, I
                  heard the gentleman's step in the hall. I hastily folded the letter, and had
                  barely done so, when this personage entered the room, and inquired if I had seen
                  it. As I held it out to him, he colored deeply, and seemed not a little confused;
                  but immediately rallied, and laughingly remarked it was a borrowed epistle, and
                  the owner was very anxious to have it preserved. Well, so much for the letter—now
                  for the dream."
               "No matter about the dream, Henry," interrupted Milford; "dreams go for nothing.
                  Can you not recall the address of the epistle? for that is of more consequence by
                  far. Bethink you now, seriously."
               Rosalie pondered a moment, pressed her hand on her temples, and then exclaimed,
                  suddenly:
               "I have it! I have it! It was 'John Anderson, merchant."
               "Indeed!" exclaimed Milford, with renewed interest. "So, so," he muttered,
                  musingly: "so, so! then the young man is detected, and will doubtless swing for
                  it!"
               "You know something of this Anderson, then?" said Rosalie, in surprise.
               "No, nothing, only his name."
               "Do you think him a spy?"
               "It is not always wise to give expression to one's thoughts, boy, in these
                  critical times," replied Milford, with an air of reserve.
               "Well, I must give mine so much expression as to say that I do think the
                  individual in question a spy," returned Rosalie.
               "Well, then, I am sorry for him."
               "I think you misunderstand me, Captain—I mean a British spy."
               "Ha! a British spy! say you so?" cried Milford, quickly. "What reasons have you
                  for this suspicion?"
               "I was about to tell you my dream."
               "Confound your dream, boy! I have something more important to think about,"
                  rejoined the Captain, testily. "Who is the gentleman to whom you gave the
                  letter?"
               "I beg leave to withhold his name," replied Rosalie, with a cold, offended
                  air.
               "So, then, you wish to serve your mistress and her enemies at the same time, eh?
                  By heavens! if I thought you were playing a double game, I"——
               "Well, sir, speak out."
               "No matter, no matter," returned the Captain, evidently half-ashamed of his
                  suspicions and display of temper. "Have you any more news?"
               "I believe I have mentioned all of any importance."
               "When do you return to the city?"
               "To-night, if possible. But may I be permitted to ask a question?"
               "Say on."
               
               "Do you know, or suspect, who wrote that letter to Anderson?"
               "I suspect."
               "Is he a man of stern integrity, above suspicion?"
               "He is."
               "Then my fears must be groundless," rejoined Rosalie, thoughtfully. "There can be
                  no harm, however," she added, "in closely watching the movements of all
                  parties."
               "Certainly not," coincided Milford, "I hope you will have a safe journey back,
                  Henry; and when you see your mistress, commend me to her in the warmest terms, and
                  say to her that my thoughts are divided between herself and my country. Had I
                  time, and it were safe, I would write. Warn her to be guarded, very guarded, in
                  all she says or does; for were any harm to befall her, no one would more deeply
                  grieve to learn it, than he who sends this message. God bless and preserve her! is
                  my constant prayer. Be true to her, Henry, for her like you ne'er may find
                  again."
               "I will treasure up your words as my heart's blood," returned Rosalie, in a voice
                  made tremulous by deep emotion.
               She paused, her heart beat wildly, and she was on the point of making herself
                  known, when the voices of the returning party were heard outside. Milford started
                  up quickly, muttered something about duty, and left the room.
               "Better as it is," sighed Rosalie, "for he would certainly not approve of this
                  adventure."
               Below stairs all was now noise and confusion, consequent upon the return of
                  Paulding and his men, who reported that no more of the freebooters were to be
                  found; though one of the men declared, that shortly after setting out in search,
                  he distinctly heard the feet of a horse going at full speed.
               "Then doubtless the villain has run off with my steed," said Rosalie, who
                  overheard he remark.
               Such proved to be the case—her horse was stolen—and she was obliged to procure one
                  of the host, who had two in his stable, Captain Milford volunteering security.
               It was near upon midnight when Rosalie set out for home, which she did without
                  making herself known to the Captain, although she had another tête-a-tête with him of a few minutes' duration,
                  relating to some matters unnecessary for us to mention.
               Without following Rosalie on her fatiguing and perilous journey back to town, let
                  it suffice here to say, that by great good fortune she reached home in safety, a
                  little after daylight, and, entering the house through the garden, stole up to her
                  room, unperceived by any of the servants. Here she found poor Munee sitting in a
                  chair, fast asleep—the faithful and affectionate creature having watched all night
                  for her mistress, and only been overcome by wearied nature a few minutes before
                  the arrival of the latter. We scarcely need add, there was heart-felt rejoicing,
                  when the mute was aroused by the gentle touch and sweet voice of Rosalie. It was
                  that rejoicing which is expressed by tears, and a heart too full for words.
               Leaving Milford and his men to find their way back with their captives, we shall
                  now turn to an entirely different scene.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               THE BALL AND THE PLOT.
               THE ball at Sir Henry Clinton's was a splendid affair. At an early hour in the
                  evening, carriage after carriage, bearing gentlemen and ladies of rank and
                  fashion, with powdered and liveried servants, rolled up to the door and deposited
                  their distinguished burdens The whole mansion seemed a blaze of light so
                  brilliantly was every portion of it illuminated. The large hall for dancing was in
                  the second story, and occupied nearly the whole extent of the building—the
                  partitions of the different rooms having been removed for this purpose—thus making
                  a grand apartment, which was fitted up in a style commensurate to its size, the
                  occasion, and the rank of him who gave the entertainment. Through this saloon—for
                  it was worthy to bear the name—ran a row of fluted columns, beautifully twined
                  with laurel, and hung round with the different banners belonging to the army and
                  navy of Great Britain, while the royal colors were festooned over the grand
                  entrance. Magnificent drapery concealed the walls, and gave the apartment a
                  gorgeous appearance; immense chandeliers, depending here and there from the
                  ceiling, made it as light as day; while large mirrors, in every quarter, doubled
                  and trebled the beauty, splendor, and grandeur of the whole. The platform for the
                  musicians, covered with crimson velvet, was in the center; and here more than
                  fifty of the best performers were stationed, whose united efforts filled every
                  portion of the room with a strength of melody seldom heard.
               But as it is not our design to enter into a detail of the ball itself, we shall
                  therefore only touch upon such incidents as have a direct bearing upon our story.
                  We may remark, however, en passant, that the
                  saloon was well filled with personages of both sexes, possessing rank, riches, and
                  beauty, among whom were a few alike distinguished in the field and the councils of
                  the British nation.
               Among the beauties present, Rosalie Du Pont was conspicuous. Robed in spotless
                  white, with a pink rose on her bosom—her snowy arms bare below the elbows—her
                  raven tresses falling around her alabaster neck—a single gold band around her
                  head, with a large diamond sparkling in the center of her smooth, fair forehead,
                  rivaled only by her flashing eyes—with all her features intellectually
                  animated—she never appeared more fascinating, more lovely, more dazzlingly
                  beautiful than now. And as she promenaded through the saloon, hanging on the arm
                  of the handsome, accomplished, and distinguished Major Andre, every eye was bent
                  on the pair, either in admiration or envy. Rosalie seemed in a great flow of
                  spirits; mirth sparkled in her eyes, wit rolled from her tongue, and she became an
                  object of universal note. Wherever she went, a crowd followed her, each one eager
                  to be distinguished by being seen in so matchless a presence; and her engagements
                  for the dance always numbered some five or six in advance of the present sett.
               At length, becoming wearied with her coterie of
                  admirers—wearied with the scene in which she was playing no inferior part—Rosalie
                  refused any new engagements, and in terms so peremptory, that only one individual,
                  and he a conceited coxcomb, ventured to press his suit; and he, we may add, had
                  little cause to congratulate himself on the result; for turning to him, with a
                  look of haughty scorn, Rosalie said, in a tone of the most cutting sarcasm:
               "Sir, are you a brazier by trade?"
               "No, Ma'm'selle, I'm a gentleman," lisped the other, with an air of great
                  affectation.
               "Then I am at a loss to account for your having such a brassy face,"
                  rejoined Rosalie, turning away with an expression of sincere contempt.
               A shout of laughter from those near enough to hear the conversation, attracted the
                  attention of others more remote; but ere the retort of the beauty could be
                  repeated, the coxcomb had left the saloon, nor did he again make his appearance
                  among the guests that night.
               It was a late hour when Rosalie concluded her engagements, and found an
                  opportunity to steal from the saloon unfollowed. Heated and fatigued, she sought
                  the garden, which, beautifully laid out, and tended with great care, skill, and
                  taste, by an experienced gardener, presented no mean attraction, with its vineclad
                  arbors, rosy bowers, shaded avenues, and labyrinthine walks, as the presence of
                  more than fifty people, already strolling about here, bore ample testimony.
                  Rosalie was not now in a mood to come in collision with any more admirers—she
                  wished to be alone—and hearing loud conversation and laughter just in advance of
                  her, as she was entering the garden, she turned back, and perceiving a door on the
                  left opening into a library, lighted only by the great lamp in the hall, she
                  stepped in here, hoping she might for a time wholly escape
                  observation, and have to herself a few minutes of calm, quiet reflection.
               It was not light enough in the library to enable Rosalie to read, even had she
                  been so disposed; and after merely glancing at the goodly array of books on the
                  shelves, she passed behind a screen that had evidently been set in here from some
                  other room, and threw herself down upon a settee, which stood along the wall.
                  Scarcely had she settled herself into a comfortable position, when a party
                  approached the door, and a voice, which she immediately recognized as Sir Henry
                  Clinton's, said.
               
               "Step in here, gentlemen—we shall not be disturbed here; and as light is not
                  necessary to our conference, I will close the door."
               How many entered the library, Rosalie could not tell, nor of whom the party was
                  composed; but she knew by the sound of feet there were several, and she was on the
                  point of making her presence known, and beating a retreat, when she heard the door
                  close, and found herself enveloped in darkness. At the same moment, Sir Henry
                  proceeded, and the words that reached her ears arrested her attention, and held
                  her spell-bound.
               "And now, Sir George," he continued, "I will come to the point in as few words as
                  possible. That our mercantile correspondent is General Arnold, there is in my mind
                  not the shadow of a doubt. True, there has been no meeting between him and Andre,
                  here, as yet, although there was an appointment for one yesterday, and which would
                  have taken place, only for an oversight of Captain Sutherland, who commands, as
                  your excellency knows, the sloop-of-war Vulture. The meeting, per arrangement, was
                  to have taken place at Dobbs' Ferry, on yesterday, at twelve o'clock; and for this
                  purpose the Vulture sailed up the river the night previous, bearing Andre, or
                  Anderson, as he is known in the correspondence, and Colonel Robinson. The Vulture
                  anchoring a mile or two this side the ferry, Major Andre thought it best to await
                  the approach of General Arnold, before proceeding to the rendezvous. Near twelve,
                  Arnold's barge was seen coming down the river; and landing on the east side of the
                  Hudson, the Adjutant and Colonel set off to meet him. But a mistake occurred,
                  which prevented the meeting, and was nigh being fatal to Arnold himself.
                  Sutherland had neglected to withdraw the guard-boats; and as Arnold approached
                  without a flag, they, of course, considered him a legitimate enemy, and fired upon
                  him. He was doubtless a good deal astonished, and angered, and beat a hasty
                  retreat, followed by a small boat, which was nigh overhauling him, when a couple
                  of rebel guns opened upon it, and so he fortunately escaped capture, which would
                  in all probability have spoiled our plans. I have not heard from Arnold since; and
                  it is possible, out of malice to us for this gross mistake, he may
                     decline further negociations; but I think not, as the stake, if he
                  win, is in his eyes of too much importance to be sacrificed for a mere whim. Andre
                  and Robinson remained on the east side of the ferry till near sundown; but finding
                  there was no likelihood of a meeting, they procured a couple of horses, and rode
                  into town, to make report to me of their failure."
               "And what does your excellency propose now?" inquired another voice, which Rosalie
                  took to be that of Sir George Rodney.
               "Why, I have thought the matter over seriously," replied Sir Henry, "have
                  consulted with my friends here, Andre and Robinson, on the subject, and we have
                  finally decided on this plan, which, if your excellency and General Knyphausen
                  approve, shall be carried into effect as soon as possible. Colonel Robinson will
                  return to the Vulture, with orders to Captain Sutherland to take her up as far as
                  Teller's Point, where the negociation will be greatly facilitated, without any
                  personal risk. The Colonel will then write a letter to General Putnam, under
                  pretense he is still in the Highlands, soliciting an interview on private
                  business. This he will inclose in one to General Arnold, requesting the latter to
                  hand it to Putnam, or if Putnam has gone away, to return it, to him—adding, that
                  if such be the case, he trusts, from Arnold's well-known humane and generous
                  character, he will grant the same favor he was about to ask of Putnam. These
                  letters, in one envelope, will then be sent with a flag to the officer commanding
                  at Verplank's Point, some five or six miles above, with a request that the parcel
                  be forwarded to Arnold's headquarters without delay."
               "But suppose," interrupted Sir George, "that by any accident these letters fall
                  into the wrong hands, suspicion be awakened, and they be opened and perused?"
               "Well, what then?—there will not be a line in them which Washington himself might
                  not read, without guessing, or even mistrusting, the object for which they were
                  written."
               "Only it might strike him as singular," pursued the other, "that a colonel in the
                  British service should request a private interview with one of his generals.
               "I would grant you so, Sir George," rejoined Clinton, "were the officer in
                  question any other than Colonel Robinson."
               "And why not him as well as another?"
               "Ah! I overlooked the fact that you know nothing of Robinson's private affairs. I
                  will be more explicit. The house and grounds where General Arnold now resides, are
                  the rightful property of the Colonel, which, by a law of the State of New York,
                  has been made confiscate, because of the latter's adherence to the crown. The
                  purport of the letters is to be a request for a private interview, for the purpose
                  of ascertaining if some means can not be devised for recovering and retaining this
                  estate, which, under existing circumstances, will seem all very right and proper.
                  I believe I have stated the matter correctly, Colonel Robinson?" concluded Sir
                  Henry, appealing to that officer, who made one of the party present.
               "You have, your excellency," was the reply.
               "Ha! I see it now," returned Sir George. "A capital plan: but go on, Sir
                  Henry."
               "Well, these letters," resumed General Clinton, "being forwarded to General
                  Arnold, will of course convey to him the important fact that Colonel Robinson is
                  on board the Vulture; and will be a sufficient excuse for him to return them in
                  person—or, if not, by another party—in which case he can readily make known where
                  and when an interview can be had. Such is our plan."
               "And I like it well," returned Sir George. "I approve of it, most decidedly."
               "I concur with Sir George," said another voice, in a foreign accent, which Rosalie
                  doubted not was that of General Knyphausen, who commanded the Germans.
               "I hope the scheme will be successful," pursued Sir George Rodney; and as I told
                  you before, Sir Henry, I am ready to give you any naval assistance in my
                  power."
               "And again I return thanks for the offer," answered Sir Henry.
               "I suppose it is unnecessary for me to suggest caution," pursued Sir George; "but
                  we should never for a moment lose sight of the fact that we are dealing with a
                  traitor."
               "I am too well aware of that," replied Sir Henry Clinton, "to run any needless
                  risk; and this makes it so important there should be a personal interview with
                  Arnold. Every thing must be arranged definitely, not only in what manner he is to
                  surrender himself, the forts, and garrison to me—so that the King's troops, sent
                  on the expedition, shall be in no danger from a counter-plot or surprise—but also
                  the precise amount we are to pay him, and the precise rank we are to bestow upon
                  him, in return for all the noble sacrifices he will make in our behalf."
               "I care not for the gold," rejoined Sir George, sarcastically; "for every rascal
                  can be paid in filthy lucre; but if this traitor is destined to hold rank in the
                  British army, I thank Heaven my lot has been cast on the water."
               "We shall be obliged to give him a commission, without doubt," answered Sir Henry;
                  "and though I dislike the idea as much as your excellency can, yet the bargain is
                  so important to the cause we serve, that we must make the end justify the means,
                  and so put up with it."
               "Ay, it should be a very important end that can justify such means," returned the
                  other.
               "So it is, Sir George—so it is an important end—no less than the end of this
                  rebellious struggle—the coup de grâce of this
                  war," replied the General, quickly.
               "Ay, so you say, General Clinton; but you must pardon me if I do not see it in the
                  same strong light as your excellency. If we succeed in getting possession of West
                  Point and its dependencies, it will be an advantage gained, I readily admit—ay, a
                  great advantage—but I can not so readily admit that it will be the finishing
                  stroke, as you term it, of the war."
               "Of course something must depend on the time when it falls into our hands,"
                  rejoined Sir Henry. "Now Washington, it is well known, to me at least, is on the
                  point of effecting a junction with his French allies, and but for your
                  excellency's arrival here with a fleet, would doubtless proceed at once to lay
                  siege to this city; and may even do so as it is; at all events, he will be likely to make West Point a
                  depot for his military stores till some decisive plan of operations is determined
                  on. Now, if we can get possession of this post at the critical moment when the
                  deposit is made, we shall thwart his plans, cripple his exertions, breed
                  disaffection in his army, and as Congress is too poor to recover from the blow, it
                  is altogether probable our own terms will be acceded to, and so the rebellion will
                  end to our own satisfaction and the glory of King George. But with your
                  excellency's permission, I will take another opportunity to discuss this subject
                  more at length, for I fear our company will be missed, and our friends be at a
                  loss to account for our absence. Come, gentlemen, as our plan is settled for the
                  present, let us return to the saloon, and join in the hilarious excitement of the
                  occasion."
               "With all my heart," returned Sir George, laughing; "for after so serious and
                  important a council of war, I think a little music and dancing would not come
                  amiss. Eh! Major?"
               "Certainly not to me," replied a voice that Rosalie had not before heard, but
                  which she at once recognized as that of Andre's. "I must hunt up my fair partner,
                  and see if she will not honor me with her hand for another sett, notwithstanding I
                  understand she has peremptorily refused more than a dozen eager admirers that
                  pleasure already."
               "Ah! Major, you are a lucky fellow," rejoined Sir George, pleasantly; "and many a
                  one would give ten years of his life to stand in your shoes this night. I observed
                  your partner closely, and must unhesitatingly pronounce her, not only the
                  handsomest lady in the saloon, but the most beautiful creature I ever beheld."
               "And as good and loyal as she is beautiful," chimed in Sir Henry. "I would there
                  were more of her sex like her. But come, gentlemen, come;" and opening the door as
                  he spoke, he went out, followed by all the others.
               It were no easy task to portray the feelings of Rosalie Du Pont, as half-dead with
                  fear, afraid to move, or even draw a natural respiration, she listened to the
                  detail of a scheme on whose failure or success the triumph or defeat of the
                  American struggle for freedom depended. There was no longer any mystery to her in
                  the strange hints that Andre had thrown out concerning the success of the British
                  arms, in the event of the allied armies besieging New York. The enigma of the
                  Chesapeake expedition was now clearly solved; and the fears that, from some
                  unknown cause, she had entertained, of there being treason in high places, now had
                  a terrible confirmation—at least to her a terrible confirmation—for, as the reader
                  has already seen, all her sympathies were enlisted in the American cause.
               It was, therefore, with a feeling of inexpressible relief she saw the party
                  depart, and found herself alone, undiscovered. Now came the thought of what was to
                  be done. Had she a right to make use of the knowledge thus accidentally obtained,
                  and endeavor to thwart this treasonous project? or was she bound to keep it as the
                  secret of others, who were to all appearance her personal friends? She thought
                  rapidly, and even with pain, but the struggle with herself was soon over. This
                  secret had not been intrusted to her in confidence; she had learned it by one of
                  fortune's chances, as it seemed to her providentially; and to make use of it to
                  serve the cause whose interests she had at heart, seemed more a duty than a breach
                  of faith. She was not pledged to retain the secret, and she felt it could inflict
                  no personal injury, save on the person of a treacherous general, whose very acts
                  condemned him in the eyes of those who were about to pay him for his villany. And
                  was it not just and proper he should be punished for his meditated crime against a
                  nation that had elevated him to the distinguished position he now held? Her heart
                  whispered in the affirmative. By exposing him, she would only be taking advantage
                  of an accident, the same as those who were to reap success from his perfidy; and
                  that this was justifiable, under the circumstances, she felt convinced beyond a
                  doubt.
               "Had I overheard a plan to assassinate a friend I esteem," she argued, mentally,
                  "should I not be accessory to the crime, did I not take immediate steps to make it
                  known, and bring the guilty to justice? Conscience says yes. Then how much more
                  necessary that I should act promptly from the present knowledge, which threatens
                  not merely the death of an individual, but of a nation—that will bring sorrow and
                  woe not only to the present generation, but to generations yet unborn!"
               Having thus settled all scruples with respect to the course she designed to
                  pursue, the next question was how this important intelligence could be immediately
                  conveyed to General Washington. There was no time to be lost, for the scheme of
                  iniquity was already ripe, and on the very point of success, and the delay of a
                  single day might be fatal to her hopes.
               "I can not go myself," she reasoned, "and whom can I send? Ah! I have it," she
                  mentally added, a moment after. "Yes, he must know of some one, and he has power
                  to accomplish almost any thing he undertakes. I must see him this very night."
               All these thoughts passed with lightning rapidity through the mind of Rosalie; and
                  as she came to the final decision, she arose, and cautiously advanced to the door
                  leading into the hall. Fortunately, no person was in sight, although voices could
                  be heard at the top of the stairs and in the garden; and gliding forward with a
                  quick, light step toward the latter, she soon found herself in the open air, where
                  she drew a long breath of relief; for until now the fear of discovery had made her
                  weak almost to fainting.
               The garden was brilliantly illuminated; and by the light of the hundred lamps
                  depending from the trees and shrubbery, she saw it was occupied by the larger
                  portion of the guests, some of whom were seated under the arbors tète-a-téte, while others, arm-in-arm, were strolling
                  about in every direction. A constant hum of voices, relieved every now and then by
                  a gay ringing laugh, proclaimed general conversation and great conviviality. All
                  seemed to be enjoying themselves, and, what was more important to Rosalie, all
                  appeared occupied, for just now she desired above all things to be alone, that she
                  might have time to regain her wonted composure, and seriously reflect upon the
                  terrible plot she had discovered, and the part she was about to take to prevent
                  its succeeding. Perceiving an unoccupied seat to the right of the main avenue,
                  where it chanced to be less light than elsewhere, she advanced toward this,
                  thinking she might here escape observation, at least for a few minutes. But she
                  was disappointed, for she had not advanced half a dozen steps, when she felt a
                  hand lightly touch her arm, and a full-toned, musical voice said, playfully:
               "Ah! truant, so I have found you at last. Come, the queen of night must not
                  withdraw her luster, and leave us to grope in darkness thus early."
               As Rosalie heard these words, a strange, faint, tremulous feeling made her whole
                  frame quiver like an aspen; she felt the blood for sake her cheeks, and retreat to
                  her heart; and a kind of awful dread rendered her powerless and unable to move.
                  Fortunately it was only momentary in its duration; and partially recovering
                  herself by a great effort, she half-turned her head, with a coquettish air, and in
                  a tone of playful irony, replied:
               "The gallant Major Andre must be short of metaphors to-night, or he would not
                  compare such dazzling splendor as mine to the pale moon. Or," she added, quickly,
                  "is it possible he is moon-struck?"
               "I must protest the pale moon is no such bad comparison after all," rejoined
                  Andre, catching a slight view of the other's features. "Why, Ma'm'selle Rosalie,
                  your face is as white as a sheet, and your hand trembles nervously. Good heavens!
                  are you ill?"
               "Yes, I do feel slightly indisposed," murmured Rosalie, faintly. "I am glad you
                  are here, Adjutant; for I would ask, as a favor, you will take me home without
                  delay."
               "Certainly, certainly. Take my arm back into the mansion, and I will call
                  assistance, and order the carriage."
               "No, no, do not call any one; I will remain here till the carriage is ready; I am
                  strong enough for that. And let me beg of you, as a favor, you will not make my
                  indisposition known to any one till I have gone, and then make my excuses and
                  regrets to the host and his family. Do not look so alarmed, Major; it is nothing
                  serious; a little faintness from over-exertion, and a heated room, perhaps. There,
                  go and order the carriage, and I will be here on your return. Here is the
                     number of my shawl, which any of the
                  servants will hand you."
               "I will soon return," said Andre; and he hastened into the house.
               He was good as his word; and in less than ten minutes Rosalie was on her way
                  home.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               THE ASTROLOGER AGAIN.
               "I AM really sorry this has occurred," said Andre, as the splendid carriage,
                  containing Rosalie and himself, rolled almost noiselessly over the flinty
                  pavement; "for I had been anticipating great pleasure in being honored with your
                  hand for another dance."
               "And I sincerely regret my sudden indisposition has been the cause of depriving
                  Major Andre of so important a gratification," replied our heroine, somewhat
                  ironically.
               "Pshaw!" rejoined Andre, in a vexed tone; "why will you always persist in putting
                  a wrong construction upon whatever I say?"
               "Because, against my express desire, you will persist in addressing to me
                  meaningless compliments," replied Rosalie.
               "Well, well, I will not offend again," returned the Adjutant. And then, as if to
                  change the subject, he added: "Has your messenger returned yet from the
                  country?"
               "Yes, he came home this morning. But how know you anything of his journey?"
               "I met him at the bridge;" and Andre proceeded to narrate the particulars of the
                  meeting, little dreaming that the incident was more powerfully impressed upon the
                  mind of his hearer than on his own.
               "Ah! yes, I have heard something of this," said Rosalie, as the other concluded;
                  "and taking all things into consideration, I hardly think I shall again send out
                  for more news."
               "Just the course I would advise," rejoined Andre; "for the little intelligence of
                  the enemy's movements to be gained at present, is not adequate to the risk your
                  messenger must necessarily run. Besides," he added, after a moment's pause, "I may
                  as well inform you, apropos to your decision, that, for the present, the other
                  course will be wholly impracticable."
               "I do not understand you," almost gasped Rosalie, alarmed, yet scarcely knowing
                  what she had to fear.
               "Why, his excellency, Sir Henry Clinton, for especial reasons, has just issued
                  orders, to have the lines and outposts doubled, a vigilant watch to be kept, and
                  no person, under the rank of major, to be allowed to pass toward the enemy, and
                  not then, unless he show his written permit, bearing date the very day the attempt
                  is made; and all persons coming from the enemy are to be arrested and conducted
                  straightway to his presence.'
               Well did Rosalie now understand the wherefore of this caution; and her heart sunk
                  within her, as she reflected on how small was the chance of conveying to
                  Washington intelligence of the diabolical plot for the ruin of himself and
                  country. But still she was determined the effort should be made; and while
                  studying out some plan by which to effect her purpose, she suddenly recollected
                  she was not alone, and that her silence might be mistaken for indifference or
                  caprice, and she said, hurriedly:
               "Major Andre must pardon me for not replying to his remarks; but, really, I feel
                  far from well."
               At this moment the carriage stopped before the residence of Rosalie; and as the
                  Major assisted her to alight, and saw her into the mansion, he expressed a hope
                  her illness would not prove serious, and said he should take an early opportunity
                  of sending round to learn the state of her health. He then wished her a good
                  night, returned to his carriage, and a moment later the sound of wheels announced
                  his departure.
               Rosalie now informed the servants who had waited up for her, that they were at
                  liberty to retire as soon as they pleased, and she could get along without any
                  assistance; and taking a silver lamp from the porter, she slowly proceeded to her
                  own apartment, where she threw herself down upon a seat, with an air of extreme
                  exhaustion. She had spoken no untruth, when she told the Major she was far from
                  feeling well; for what with the excitement and fatigue of her journey to the
                  country try loss of rest for two successive nights, together with the startling
                  plot she had just overheard—a plot which involved the ruin of her dearest and most
                  cherished hopes—she was now in a fitter condition for the bed, than for the
                  adventure she had in contemplation. But undue excitement lent a transient strength
                  to her nearly worn out frame; and after sitting a few minutes to recover her
                  shattered faculties, she hastily arose, and throwing off her ball attire, donned
                  the disguise she had so successfully used the night previous. She now put out her
                  light, locked the door of her dressing-room or boudoir, which communicated with
                  her sleeping chamber, and stealing softly down the stairs, entered the shrubbery,
                  and passed out of the garden through a wicket gate that opened upon the bank of
                  the river.
               Some fifteen minutes later, Rosalie stood before the gloomy residence of Signor
                  Carlini, demanding of the black porter, who slept near the gate, instant
                  admittance to the presence of his master, on pressing business; for well she knew
                  the habits of the astrologer, who made it a point never to slumber while the stars
                  shone, although he seldom received a visitor at so late an hour. To this demand
                  the black replied, that his master was surveying the heavens from his observatory,
                  as he styled a small cupola built on the ridge of the house, and that he had given
                  express orders not to be disturbed.
               "I must see him, nevertheless," replied Rosalie, "and I will stand between you and
                  harm. Here, take him this ring, and say that the bearer must have immediate
                  audience, on business that will not admit of a moment's delay. And for your
                  trouble," added Rosalie, as the negro received the ring through the little wicket
                  before mentioned, but still seemed to hesitate whether he should take it to his
                  master or return it, "for your trouble here is half a crown, which, if you bring
                  back a favorable answer, shall instantly have a fellow to jingle with it."
               This was a temptation irresistible; and away went the black, with a haste that
                  argued little fear of his master's displeasure. Presently he returned, and opening
                  the gate, informed our heroine that, through a little extra persuasion of his own,
                  his master had swerved from his usual habit, and consented to see her. Rosalie was
                  not slow to take the hint; and slipping another half crown into the hand of the
                  guide, she followed him to the same apartment wherein we first introduced Carlini
                  to the reader; though unlike her predecessor on that occasion, she saw no dazzling
                  lights and no magic changes.
               The Chamber of Fate was now exactly as we described it then, the astrologer was
                  seated in the same manner and place, and the large globe lamp, hanging over the
                  black table, shone on the same deadly-pale, strongly-marked countenance, and
                  small, black, fiery eyes.
               "Well, boy, thy business with Carlini?" said the astrologer, in the same clear,
                  sonorous tone, making a gesture with his hand to the chair opposite. "This ring I
                  know—is its owner thy mistress? and did she send thee? Come, speak! speak! for I
                  have left the heavens, and all the starry host, to give thee audience."
               "Are we alone?" asked Rosalie, glancing round the apartment.
               "As much alone as two can be, while the spirits of departed friends keep us
                  company," was the singular answer.
               "I mean, is there no danger of our being overheard?"
               "None; but if thy communication be a very important secret, thou mayest speak
                  low."
               "It is important," said Rosalie, hurriedly. "In the first place, I am Rosalie Du
                  Pont."
               "Thou?" returned the astrologer, arching his brows, with a look of surprise.
               "Yes, I am in disguise. Behold! this is a wig; and look! this arm is as white as
                  your own."
               "Ah! my lady," began the other in an altered tone, at the same time rising and
                  bowing with a deferential air.
               "Hush!" interrupted Rosalie, with a gesture of impatience; "no time for idle
                  ceremony now. I must say what I have to say, and be off; for the old church bell
                  has just tolled three, and daylight must find me in bed at home. I will,
                  therefore, come to the point at once. Not two hours since, I accidentally
                  overheard a plot which threatens destruction to all our hopes, and death to freedom. You start,
                  Signor Carlini, as well you may, when I tell you this vile scheme is to be
                  accomplished through the treachery of a distinguished American general, who has
                  the confidence of Washington and Lafayette, and who has recently been appointed,
                  by the former, to the command of one of the most important military posts in the
                  country."
               "Just Heaven! can this be true! of whom dost speak?" cried Carlini, greatly
                  excited, his small black eyes fairly emitting rays like fire.
               "Of General Arnold—no less—who, for a stipulated price, will betray West Point and
                  its dependencies into the hands of Sir Henry Clinton. I see you are disposed to be
                  incredulous, as I would be with less proof than I have had; but wait one moment,
                  and I will convince you of the truth of my words. I will not scruple to tell you
                  all in confidence; but remember! it must go no further; this I enforce, as a
                  condition, on your honor as a gentleman."
               "Which is sacred, my lady. Pray, go on." Rosalie now proceeded to relate, in a
                  hurried manner, how she had been at Sir Henry's ball, and what she had chanced to
                  hear concerning the meditated treason of Arnold. And she wound up by asking:
               "And now what is to be done? It is all important this scheme should be
                  communicated to Washington immediately; and yet I am at a loss for means to convey
                  the intelligence; and therefore have I sought you, who rarely fail in any thing
                  you undertake."
               "A trusty courier must be dispatched at once," replied Carlini; "this intelligence
                  is too important to risk by any chance conveyance."
               "But a courier will hardly be able to get through the lines, for"—
               "He must have a pass," interrupted Carlini, decidedly, "even if it be a forged
                  one; for in this strait, where the fate of a nation hangs in the balance, the end
                  will surely justify the means."
               "But a pass will not avail him," rejoined Rosalie, quickly, "as I was about to
                  inform you when you interrupted me. I have it from Major Andre, that Sir Henry
                  Clinton has issued imperative orders, to have the sentries on the lines and
                  out-posts doubled, and that no person, under the rank of major, shall be allowed
                  to pass toward the enemy, and not even then, unless he bear a written permit,
                  dated the very day he presents it."
               "Ha! is this so?" exclaimed Carlini, knitting his brows, with a troubled look.
                  "This is bad for us—unfortunate—decidedly so."
               "You see they fear us," returned Rosalie; "they fear their diabolical secret may
                  leak out; and they are taking every precaution to prevent its reaching our
                  friends."
               "But we must try and thwart their plans, nevertheless," rejoined Carlini, walking
                  up and down the room. "Let me see! let me see! Ah! there is but one way—a courier
                  must get through the lines. Does your lady-ship know of any one, who, for love of
                  country or gold, can be tempted to make the trial?"
               "I know of no one," answered Rosalie, "and therefore have I come to you."
               "It is a fearful emergency," rejoined Carlini, resuming his walk back and forth,
                  and seeming to reflect intensely. "A fearful risk," he added, after a short pause.
                  "But it must be done," he said, as if in conclusion of the argument held in his
                  own mind: "ay, it must be done; it is the last resource; God grant it may not
                  fail! for I love the youth and the cause I serve." Then turning to Rosalie, he
                  continued: "There is one way, your ladyship, by which the trial can be made. There
                  is in town a noble youth, whose life I saved; and who, out of gratitude for the
                  act, solemnly vowed to do any thing honorable I might require at his hands. He
                  loves me as a son, and I may add, I love him as a father-therefore you can readily
                  understand how painful it is to my feelings to request him to set out on so
                  dangerous a mission; for if taken, and the slightest evidence be adduced
                  concerning his object, he will as surely swing as that I am a living man."
               Rosalie shuddered, a faint, sickening feeling came over her, and staggering to a
                  seat she threw herself heavily down upon it, and placing her arms upon the table,
                  rested her head upon them.
               "Thou art ill, my lady!" said the astrologer, with a look of some alarm. "Surely
                  mere sympathy for one thou dost not know would not affect thee thus."
               "Go on," said Rosalie, faintly; "do not mind me; I shall be better soon."
               "Here, try some of this cordial," pursued the other, producing a vial of dark
                  liquid. "If thou art faint, weak, and nervous, it will revive thee, and give thee
                  new strength. Only a little, only a few drops," continued the other, as Rosalie
                  reached out her trembling hand for the vial, "for much would do thee harm."
               Rosalie touched it to her tongue, and returned it. A moment after she said:
               "Ah! I feel better already: that should be called the Elixir of Life."
               "Thou hast guessed the name, my lady. To resume my subject: I have thought of a
                  plan by which the danger to this young man can be materially lessened. Should no
                  paper of any kind be found upon his person, there would not, of course, be
                  sufficient proof of any secret design to justify hanging him; and therefore he
                  would not, in all probability, suffer any thing more serious than a short
                  imprisonment and rude examination."
               "You mean, then, he shall carry a verbal message," said Rosalie.
               "No, my lady, for his word, unsupported by other evidence, might not be sufficient
                  to induce Washington to take those prompt measures which the emergency of the case
                  demands."
               "But it would be enough to put him on his guard; and by watching the movements of
                  the traitor, he might detect him in his rascality, and that would be all the proof
                  he would need."
               "True, that is true; but still I think my plan the best. But I forget, I have not
                  yet explained it to your ladyship." Here the astrologer advanced to one side of
                  the room, drew aside the black tapestry, and from a shelf in the wall, took down a
                  box, which he opened, and shortly produced a silver bullet. "By this contrivance,"
                  he continued, exhibiting it to Rosalie, "we can send a written message without
                  much risk to our messenger. I perceive you look puzzled, my lady—let me explain.
                  Here, as you can see, when I press on the sides thus, a small door, or lid, flies
                  open, showing the ball to be hollow. Well, into this aperture our written message
                  can be placed, and our messenger can conceal the bullet about his person. Should
                  he be taken, he has only to swallow the ball at once, and then he will have
                  nothing to fear. But, good heavens! your ladyship is ill!" exclaimed the
                  astrologer, suddenly struck with the deathly pallor of the other, and an air of
                  extreme exhaustion which all her efforts could not overcome. "Ha! she is sinking,"
                  he added, as he sprang forward to give her support.
               "Air! air!" gasped Rosalie, faintly: and as she uttered the words, she sunk
                  lifeless into the arms of the astrologer.
               Stretching her fair form upon the table, Carlini hurriedly procured water, and
                  dashed it into her face, at the same time pouring out a few drops of his Elixir of
                  Life, with which he moistened her lips. Soon she began to revive; and when
                  animation and consciousness had fully returned, she said:
               "I will go home, Signor Carlini, and leave this business wholly with you."
               "I will attend your ladyship," returned Carlini.
               "No, no—I will not—"
               "Nay, not a word—I shall go!" said the astrologer, in a decided tone.
               And well was it for Rosalie he went; for so weak and faint was she, at times, as
                  to be unable to stand without support. How she reached her own room, after
                  Carlini, who persisted in conducting her to the foot of the stairs, left her, was
                  ever a mystery to herself; but reach it she did; and when Munee entered her
                  chamber shortly after daylight, and found her stretched upon the floor insensible,
                  her surprise and grief may readily be imagined. To raise her up, strip off her
                  disguise, wash the dark stain from her hands and face, and place her properly in
                  bed, was the first care of the faithful mute; and to arouse the servants, and have
                  a 
                     physican
                     physician
                   immediately sent for, her second.
               Fortunately the disguise of Rosalie, and her absence from the house after her
                  return from the ball, was never known to, or even suspected by, the rest of the
                  household; and this she owed to the presence of mind displayed by Munee.
               
               When Major Andre, faithful to his promise, called at an early hour to inquire
                  after Rosalie, he learned, much to his surprise and sorrow, that she was
                  delirious, and suffering from a raging fever of the worst type.
               Leaving our heroine on her sick couch, and the astrologer to carry out the plan
                  already known to the reader, we must again shift the scene, and introduce new
                  characters upon our stage of action.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               WASHINGTON AND THE TRAITOR.
               SOME several days after the events recorded in the last two chapters, and on a
                  fine, delightful afternoon in September, a group of officers was collected on the
                  western bank of the Hudson, at King's Ferry. The central figure of this group, and
                  who was ever addressed with a certain air of deference by the others, was very
                  tall, his stature not being less than six feet, but so symmetrically proportioned
                  as not to appear much above the ordinary size, unless a comparison were made
                  between him and those who stood around him, when his noble dimensions became
                  strikingly apparent. There was a certain air of commanding majesty about this man,
                  aside from mere proportions—a kind of god-like dignity, if we may use the term
                  without irreverence—which none who saw him once could ever forget. Very few men
                  could approach him without a feeling of awe; none dared presume on a trifling
                  familiarity. And yet there was nothing withering, terrible, or even haughty, in
                  either look, speech, or action. No, all was calm and quiet as a lake without a
                  wavelet. His face was one a child would love, and stand less in awe before than
                  even a man in years—it was so noble, so mild, so serene, so benignant, and so
                  gentle in expression. And yet, withal, was it grave almost to sternness, dignified
                  almost to cold reserve, and thoughtful almost to melancholy. You felt, in gazing
                  upon it, you were looking upon the face, of no ordinary man—that you stood in the
                  presence of a superior being—a being to love and reverence. That broad, high,
                  thoughtful brow; those large, soft eyes; that classic shaped nose; that handsome
                  mouth; that well-turned chin;—in short, each feature, either separately or
                  collectively, expressed a majesty before which that of mere royalty must sink in
                  comparison as the puppet sinks before the man. It was the majesty of goodness, of
                  greatness, set there by nature; and whether surrounded by princely velvet, or
                  beggar's sackcloth, it could not be mistaken. Over this benign countenance, when
                  in repose, lingered a sweet, almost melancholy smile, that proved one of its
                  greatest charms, albeit it made you sad to behold it. It touched your inmost
                  sympathies; and while you might sorrow to behold it there, you could not wish it
                  otherwise. This officer wore a blue cloth military coat, in shape not unlike those
                  now worn by the Quakers, which was fastened by a single button across the breast
                  of his fawn-colored waistcoat, or vest. A white cravat, buffskin breeches, high
                  top-boots, and a three cornered hat, completed his attire, which set off his
                  commanding figure to the best advantage. A heavy, gold epaulette pressed either
                  shoulder, denoting his high rank, and a beautiful sword was attached to his
                  girdle.
               But why dwell on a portrait which is indelibly impressed upon the heart of every
                  true American—ay, for that matter, every true lover of liberty throughout the
                  world! Need we say more, than that the personage of whom we have attempted a
                  slight description, was the commander-in-chief of the American forces, the father
                  of his country, the immortal George Washington?
               On the left of General Washington stood another important personage in our
                  country's history. He was a stout, thick-set man, with a broad, heavy,
                  strongly-marked, intellectual countenance. This was the Marquis de Lafayette.
                  Grouped around the two generals, were several other officers, holding the rank of
                  colonels and majors; and these composed the suite of Washington, who was now on
                  his way to Hartford, to have an interview with Count de Rochambeau, for the
                  purpose of effecting the long-desired union of the two friendly armies.
               At the moment introduced, Washington and his retinue were looking at the beautiful
                  barge of General Arnold, which, propelled by two stout oarsmen, was rapidly
                  nearing the shore; the General himself being seated in the stern, stiffly erect,
                  pompously equipped, and steering with his own hands.
               "Arnold certainly has a very handsome water-craft," observed Washington to
                  Lafayette; "and on so fine a day as this, one could be more disagreeably employed
                  than in gliding over the tranquil bosom of the Hudson. If we had any time to
                  spare, I should not mind a short ride in it myself."
               "With the General's permission, I think we may as well cross the river in it,"
                  returned the Marquis.
               "Ah! true—doubtless we can test its luxury a little in this way," smiled the
                  commander-in-chief.
               The boat had by this time touched the shore, and Arnold immediately advanced
                  toward the group of officers, with a dignified, respectful air, and a very placid
                  countenance; but in truth, his feelings were very different from what they seemed;
                  and though not appearing to do so, he closely scrutinized every feature and
                  expression of every member of the party. He saw nothing, however, indicating a
                  knowledge, or even suspicion, of his guilty design; and greatly relieved by this,
                  his salutations were more cordial than usual.
               "I give you good day, gentlemen," he said, touching his hat, and slightly lifting
                  it from his head, with true military grace and politeness, and as a special mark
                  of deference to his senior in command.
               All returned the salute, even to Washington himself, with the same air of
                  respectful courtesy, when the latter said, pleasantly:
               "I was almost envying you, General, the possession of so beautiful a boat, and
                  time to sail in it on a day like this."
               "If your excellency will accept of it as a slight token of regard—"
               "No, no," interrupted Washington, "I could not use it if I had it, for duty leaves
                  no time for pleasure. I thank you all the same; and for the gift, if you will
                  substitute the loan of it to cross the river—"
               "Most certainly," interrupted Arnold, in turn. "I was about to ask of your
                  excellency, as a favor, that you would honor me by passing over in it. I knew your
                  excellency was to set out on your journey for Hartford to-day, and I came down
                  expressly to meet you though I feared I might be too late."
               "Yes, I am on my way to visit the Count and hope soon to have matters arranged for
                  more active operations than it has been our fortune to experience of late. The
                  army has been rapidly increasing for some time by new recruits, who will not long
                  be satisfied with mere drills: inactivity is a foe to content. How comes on your
                  wound, General? I see you still walk lame."
               "Yes, your excellency, and I fear there is little reason to hope any change for
                  the better just at present. My surgeon tells me I must keep perfectly quiet—but
                  that I believe is something I never did in my life, and I am, to quote a common
                  phrase, almost 'too old a dog to learn new tricks.' Were it not that I fear active
                  service at this time would cripple me for life, I assure your excellency, and you,
                  gentlemen, I should not long be found in command of so idle a post as West
                  Point."
               "None know that better than his excellency and your humble servant," chimed in the
                  Marquis of Lafayette, with a smile, and graceful indication of the head. "General
                  Arnold never was represented, even by his enemies as a very quiet
                  individual, particularly fond of retirement."
               "At least not before his second marriage," remarked Washington jocularly; "but
                  almost any man might be tempted to domestic retirement, with so young and
                  beautiful a wife, saving your presence, General Arnold. But apropos: how is Mrs.
                  Arnold, and the rest of your family?"
               "I thank your excellency, they were well when I left home."
               "I hope to have the pleasure of dining with your good lady on my return, and I
                  shall also proceed to inspect the works at West Point—so I give you fair warning,
                  General, to be prepared at all points."
               "General Washington can never come save as a welcome visitor to the quarters of
                  Benedict Arnold," was the cordial response of the wily traitor.
               "Thank you," returned Washington, "and make sure I shall profit by the knowledge.
                  Tilghman, (turning to one of his aids, whose dress bespoke the rank of colonel,) do you think
                  the horses have sufficiently rested to continue our journey?"
               "I think so, your excellency," returned that officer, bowing; "but I will look to
                  their condition myself, if such be your excellency's pleasure."
               "Do so, and if not ready give orders to have them taken across at the earliest
                  moment practicable. Meantime, we will cross ourselves; and what leisure I have, I
                  will employ in an inspection of the works on the opposite side."
               Colonel Tilghman touched his hat and withdrew; and immediately turning to another
                  officer near, who was the quarter-master, stationed at Stony Point, the
                  commander-in-chief continued:
               "Major Kierse, I will see that that matter is attended to on my return. Tell
                  Carson I think his prices are high, but do not positively reject. Get a refusal
                  for a few days, say a week, and by that time I trust I shall know better what to
                  do. If you can get him to fall ten per cent., however, close with him at once, and
                  let him deliver at West Point. Adieu."
               "Adieu! and may your excellency have a pleasant journey and speedy return;" and as
                  this officer retired, Washington said quickly:
               "Come, gentlemen, let us try Arnold's barge, and see what virtue there is in
                  cushioned seats."
               This was spoken without the slightest shade of sarcasm; but it seemed to touch the
                  General, for his face flushed to the temples. He said nothing, however, and the
                  party descended to the water, and entered the boat. Washington took his seat in
                  the stern, as did also the Marquis, Arnold in the bow, and the other officers
                  where they found most convenient places. As the boat pushed out from the shore, a
                  military salute was fired from the redoubt at Verplank's Point; and as soon as its
                  echoes had subsided, Washington observed:
               "Colonel Livingston, it seems, is prepared to receive us." He then glanced down
                  Haverstraw Bay, and perceiving a vessel anchored near Teller's Point, immediately
                  produced his glass, and looking through it steadily, added, in a low tone: "It is
                  a sloop of-war—but for what purpose is she there? Does any one know her name?"
               "I do not, General," returned the Marquis.
               "I believe, your excellency," rejoined Colonel Hamilton, who, sitting near,
                  chanced to overhear the question, "she is called the Vulture; she passed Dobbs'
                  Ferry in the night, I am told."
               "But what is she doing there?" queried Washington, quickly, but still in a low
                  tone. "She is certainly venturesome, to advance so far into the territory of an
                  enemy, unsupported. She must be closely watched."
               "I understand," returned the same officer, "that a boat put off from her bearing a
                  flag, and came to Verplank's Point; but for what object I do not know."
               "Ah! then, doubtless Colonel Livingston can tell us something about her," rejoined
                  Washington, shutting his glass, and turning his attention to something else.
               This conversation was carried on in a tone too low to be heard by Arnold, who, as
                  we before remarked, was seated in the bow; but those who sat near him observed
                  that he turned very pale while Washington was speaking, seemed very uneasy, and
                  exhibited considerable emotion. Another incident shortly after occurred, which
                  made the guilty man tremble, and by which he came near betraying himself. The
                  conversation, as was natural, turned upon the war, and the object the party had in
                  view.
               "If we can only effect a speedy union with our land allies," said Washington, "and
                  get the coöperation of Count de Guichen's fleet, we shall probably give Sir
                  Henry's men something more important to do than stealing cattle, pillaging honest
                  farmers, singing ribald songs, and plunging into general dissipation. Ah! that
                  disaster of Gates was so unfortunate; but for that, I could think our prospects
                  more flattering now than ever. However, we must not despair of retrieving our
                  losses, even in the south."
               "But what will Congress say to Gates?" inquired Lafayette.
               "He will doubtless be removed," answered Washington, "even if it be not done
                  already."
               "And who will supersede him?"
               "I do not know: Greene should, for he is an efficient commander."
               "Does your excellency think the report true, concerning Sir Henry's expedition to
                  the Chesapeake?"
               "No, Marquis, that is only a feint to deceive us. Clinton has an object in view
                  nearer home. I forgot to mention to your lordship, that I received positive
                  information on this subject, from a young officer in Colonel Sheldon's detachment,
                  who, by some means, procured it from one of our city friends."
               "To whom does your excellency allude?" Washington whispered a word in the other's
                  ear.
               "Ah! indeed?" said Lafayette, in a low tone; "I am glad to hear it. She has the
                  true blood in her, General—pray Heaven no harm befall her."
               "Amen, Marquis," returned Washington, gravely. "It is a post of danger, which few
                  in her position would care to undertake."
               "But to come back to our starting-point," said the Marquis, after a moment's
                  pause. "Your excellency was speaking of Guichen—have you had any intelligence of
                  him of late?"
               "I am sorry to say, none whatever. It is strange, is it not, my lord? I am fearful
                  some disaster has befallen him, or that he has returned to France."
               "He would hardly do that, I think," replied Lafayette. Then looking toward the
                  bow, he continued, in a louder tone, "General Arnold, since you have a
                  correspondence with the enemy, you must ascertain, as soon as possible, what has
                  become of Guichen!"
               Arnold, who had taken no part in the recent conversation, but was busy thinking
                  over his treasonous projects, on hearing himself thus addressed, in language that
                  seemed to imply a knowledge of his guilty doings, and who for the moment thought
                  his base plot had been detected, at first turned as pale as death, then quickly
                  flushed up to the very roots of his hair, and starting to his feet, laid his hand
                  upon his sword, and in a fierce tone demanded:
               "Who dares accuse me?—what does your lordship mean, by addressing such language to
                  me?"
               All looked surprised, but none more so than the Marquis, who hastened to
                  reply:
               "I did not intend any offense, General Arnold, but was merely alluding to the
                  freedom of intercourse which, owing to the water communication, has ever existed
                  between West Point and New York."
               "I beg your lordship's pardon! I was hasty; I should have known," rejoined Arnold,
                  in a tone of conciliation, who now perceived the gross mistake he had made, and
                  was anxious to gloss it over. "I am always hasty—always rash," he continued,
                  deprecatingly, as he reseated himself, and wiped the perspiration from his face;
                  "it has been my failing through life, and will doubtless follow me to my
                  grave."
               At this moment, the barge touched the shore, and the party landed in silence, and
                  walked up to the military works, where they were met by Colonel Livingston, with
                  whom Washington immediately entered into conversation. These incidents concerning
                  Arnold made no striking impression at the time, but were afterward recalled with
                  painful distinctness, when the perfidy of the traitor had become known to the
                  world.
               About a quarter of an hour after crossing the river, the horses of Washington and
                  suite were brought over, with an extra one for Arnold; and the whole party
                  remounting, set off for Peekskill. On their way to this place, Arnold seemed in an
                  unusual flow of spirits, and chatted and laughed gayly. This was done to quell any
                  suspicion which might have been excited by his stupid blunder while crossing the
                  ferry; but he might have spared himself this effort at jovialty—for an effort it
                  was, and a severe one, too, in his peculiar frame of mind—as no one of the party
                  had the least suspicion of his guilt.
               At Peekskill the party passed the night; and watching his opportunity, the wily
                  traitor drew Washington aside, and said, with all seeming frankness:
               "I have sought this opportunity, your excellency, to lay before you a private
                  matter, and get your excellency' advice. Your excellency has doubtless heard that
                  I this morning received a letter from the enemy, sent up from the Vulture by a
                  flag to Colonel Livingston's quarters, and thence forwarded to my own?"
               
               Washington merely nodded assent, and Arnold proceeded:
               "Here is the letter; it is from Colonel Beverly Robinson, who inclosed another to
                  General Putnam, probably on the same business. You perceive he is anxious to find
                  some means by which he can recover and retain the estate where I now reside, and
                  solicits a personal interview with me to advise with him what steps to take. Now I
                  desire your excellency's opinion as to the propriety of my granting his
                  request."
               "By no means do it," replied Washington, as he finished a perusal of the epistle;
                  "for your doing so would only afford grounds of suspicion in the minds of some,
                  and all these things had better be avoided. We military men can not be too careful
                  of our reputation at present; for we are watched by jealous eyes, and slander
                  flies on every breath of air. Besides, you could do nothing in the matter, were
                  you ever so much disposed; for it is a case which does not come within the powers
                  of a military officer, or a military tribunal. The civil government of the state
                  is the only authority that can act in his case; and I am surprised that a man of
                  Colonel Robinson's reputed sense should think of applying to any other."
               "I am happy to learn your excellency's views of the matter exactly coincide with
                  my own," rejoined the traitor; "and I will embrace an early opportunity of
                  returning Colonel Robinson, for answer, that his request will be impolitic for me
                  to grant."
               "Speaking of letters," pursued Washington, "reminds me that some days since I
                  received one from you, in which you mentioned your intention of establishing a
                  beacon about five miles below King's Ferry, whereby the country would be alarmed
                  in case the enemy should make any demonstrations toward this quarter. Have you put
                  your plan in execution yet, General?"
               "I have not, your excellency."
               "I wish you would, then, without delay, as, from some hints I have recently
                  received of Sir Henry's designs, I think it an important precaution."
               "I will attend to it, your excellency. But may I inquire if your excellency
                  apprehends an attack from the British soon?"
               "It is always safe to be prepared," returned Washington, evading the question.
               Arnold colored, bowed, but made no reply, and the interview ended here. The moment
                  he was left to himself, the traitor ground his teeth in rage, and with a horrible
                  oath, muttered, half audibly:
               "By ——! I will teach him how to answer me some day."
               As we have before said, the party passed the night at Peekskill; and early the
                  following morning Washington and his retinue resumed their route to Hartford;
                  while General Arnold returned to West Point, and, knowing he had no time to lose,
                  immediately took active steps toward the accomplishment of his infamous
                  design.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               STRATAGEM MANEUVERS.
               THE plan of Sir Henry Clinton for effecting an interview between Colonel Robinson
                  and General Arnold, as detailed to Sir George Rodney, on the night of the ball, in
                  the hearing of Rosalie Du Pont, was, as the reader has been made aware by the
                  events of the preceding chapter, so far successfully carried out, as to have the
                  letter of Robinson reach the hands of the traitor; and but for the arrival of
                  Washington at King's Ferry at this important crisis, the desired meeting would
                  have taken place, and Arnold's scheme of villainy would undoubtedly have been
                  consummated. But as matters turned out, the traitor deemed it too impolitic, not
                  to say hazardous, to venture an interview with Robinson in direct opposition to
                  the advice of Washington, and therefore set his wits to work to bring about a
                  meeting of a less public nature. To this end, on his return to head-quarters, he
                  immediately wrote two letters to Colonel Robinson, one inclosed within the other,
                  which he dispatched to the Vulture by an officer in a flag-boat. Both of these
                  missives were carefully worded; but why two were sent, when one would have
                  answered the purpose, is something we can not explain. The envelope letter merely
                  stated, in general terms, that the writer had consulted Washington, who
                  disapproved the proposition, and said it was a business wholly belonging to the
                  civil authority. The inclosed letter was more explicit, and, among other things,
                  went on to say, that on Wednesday night, the 20th inst., a person would be at
                  Dobb's Ferry, or on board the Vulture, who would be furnished with a boat and a
                  flag of truce, and whose secrecy and honor might be implicitly relied upon. He
                  also advised that the Vulture should remain in her present position till the time
                  appointed; and concluded by saying, that he expected Washington to lodge at
                  Robinson's house on Saturday night next, and that he would then lay before him any
                  communication he, Robinson, might wish to make.
               Washington crossed King's Ferry on Monday, the 18th of September, and this letter
                  was dated at Arnold's head-quarters the day following; and as it did not reach the
                  Vulture till late in the afternoon of the same day, there was, consequently, but
                  little more than twenty four hours between its arrival and the time appointed for
                  the meeting.
               Previous to this, however, and shortly after his return from his first
                  unsuccessful attempt to meet Andre—which, as the reader has seen, was only
                  prevented by a mistake of the guard-boats—General Arnold, not knowing any thing of
                  Sir Henry's plan in regard to sending Robinson, wrote a letter to John Anderson,
                  in which, in his usual ambiguous style of a mercantile correspondent, he cautioned
                  Andre not to reveal any thing to Colonel Sheldon or any other person, saying that
                  he himself had made one confidant too many, who had prevented some very profitable
                  speculations. He then concluded as follows:
               "A person, in whom confidence can be placed, will be at the landing on the east
                  side of Dobbs' Ferry, on Wednesday evening, the 20th inst.; and if you will be
                  there, this person will conduct you to a place of safety, where I will meet you.
                  It will be necessary for you to be in disguise—I can not be more explicit at
                  present. Meet me if possible. You may rest assured, if there is no danger in
                  passing your lines, you will be perfectly safe where I propose a meeting."
               This letter bore the usual signature of "Gustavus;" and on receiving it, Andre
                  immediately consulted with Sir Henry as to what was best to be done under the
                  circumstances. Robinson having already gone up the river on this business, it was
                  finally decided to await some message from him, as it was more than probable the
                  affair would be settled before the time appointed in Arnold's letter.
               To further secure Andre against difficulty, Arnold, at the same time he wrote to
                  him, also wrote to Major Tallmage—who, as the reader has already been informed,
                  was quartered at Northcastle—and requested him, in case a person by the name of
                  John Anderson arrived at his station, to send him without delay to head-quarters,
                  escorted by two dragoons.
               A copy of the letter which Arnold had written to Andre previous to Robinson's
                  arrival at Teller's Point, was also inclosed to the last-mentioned officer by
                  Arnold, at the same time he sent the others; and after a brief consultation on
                  board the Vulture, Robinson and Sutherland decided to forward the whole three by
                  express to Sir Henry Clinton, who would thus be informed exactly how matters were
                  progressing. This was accordingly done, and Sir Henry received them at a late hour
                  the some night.
               Andre was with him when the courier arrived; and as soon as the letters had been
                  read and commented upon, it was agreed that the latter should set out the
                  following morning for Dobb's Ferry, to meet the messenger of Arnold—or rather
                  Arnold himself—for it was believed by both Clinton and Andre, that he was the
                  individual alluded to in his correspondence, as it was customary for him to speak
                  of himself in the third person, in order to make the deception more complete.
               Ere his departure from New York, Sir Henry Clinton positively enjoined upon Major
                  Andre not to change his dress, nor disguise himself in any manner, as proposed by
                  General Arnold, nor to go within the American lines, nor under any circumstances
                  whatever to take papers.
               "Remember," he said, "you are dealing with a traitor—a being lost to every sense
                  of honor and moral rectitude—and therefore you can not be too guarded how you
                  place yourself in his power. But," he added, "I do not think Arnold will ever ask you to venture within
                  the American lines, as it is probable he will come off to the Vulture himself, and
                  the business will all be transacted there. Now go, and may the Almighty bless you,
                  guard you, and grant you a speedy return!"
               "Farewell," said Andre, with a heavy heart; for the terrible prediction of the
                  astrologer was now ringing in his ears, and a strange, unaccountable dread was
                  creeping over him. "Farewell, Sir Henry! my friend! my benefactor! Should any
                  thing occur that we never meet again—"
               "Tut! tut!" interrupted the other hastily: "nothing of the kind shall occur.
                  There, God bless you! go!"
               Andre grasped Sir Henry's hand, pressed it to his lips, and sprang away with an
                  overflowing heart. Alas! that we must say it—never to meet his benefactor again on
                  earth.
               It was Andre's first intention to go up to Dobbs' Ferry, and thence send a message
                  to Captain Sutherland, requesting him to drop down with the Vulture to that place;
                  but as it was rather late in the day when he arrived there, and as Arnold's letter
                  stated a messenger from him would either that be night at the ferry, or on board
                  the Vulture, Andre resolved to push forward to the vessel without delay.
               It was about seven o'clock in the evening when he arrived at his final
                  destination, where he remained over night; but, much to his disappointment,
                  without seeing Arnold, or receiving any message from him. His anxiety to complete
                  the business in hand was now very great; for the time favorable to the object was
                  fast slipping away; and it was well known, from Arnold's correspondence, that
                  Washington was expected back on the coming Saturday.
               On Thursday, the day following his arrival on board the Vulture, not having, as we
                  just remarked, heard any thing from Arnold, Andre wrote a rather desponding letter
                  to Sir Henry Clinton, in which, after stating what he had done, he went on to say
                  that this was the second journey he had made without any ostensible reason, that a
                  third would undoubtedly excite suspicion, and, therefore, he had thought best,
                  under the circumstances, to feign sickness, and remain where he was for the
                  present, in the hope that something would soon transpire favorable to his object.
                  And it was also possible, he argued, that Arnold, not knowing of his arrival, had
                  sent a messenger to the ferry, who, in consequence, had missed him, and that a
                  little more time might set every thing right.
               As soon as this letter had been dispatched to Clinton; Andre, Robinson, and
                  Sutherland, the only persons on board the Vulture who knew any thing of the
                  treasonous plot, at once set to work to devise means of making Andre's presence
                  here known to Arnold. An incident which had occurred the day previous gave them an
                  excellent opportunity for doing so, without incurring any risk or exciting the
                  least suspicion. On the day of Andre's arrival, a flag of truce had been exhibited
                  at Teller's Point, seemingly to invite a friendly intercourse with the vessel. The
                  captain so understanding it, had sent off a boat with another flag; but the moment
                  it approached within a short distance of the shore, it was fired upon by several
                  armed men hitherto concealed. This, of course, was a violation of the laws of war;
                  and was deemed not only a fit subject for remonstrance, but a sufficient reason
                  for dispatching a flag-boat with a letter to the American commanding officer.
                  Accordingly, the dispatch was prepared, dated on board the Vulture, September the
                  21st, signed by Captain Sutherland, and countersigned by John Anderson, as
                  secretary. This, of course, would convey to Arnold the important fact, that Andre
                  was on board the Vulture; and yet, if read by others, would occasion no suspicion
                  of a sinister design.
               Let us now return to Arnold. It will be remembered that in a former chapter of
                  this true history; we described an interview between the traitor and Smith, in
                  which the latter agreed to have his family removed whenever the former should
                  desire, in order that Arnold and Anderson might meet at his house, and be
                  undisturbed in their intercourse. We will not impute to Smith any bad motive in
                  thus readily yielding to the request of Arnold; for from all the evidence we have
                  seen on the subject—and we have spared neither time nor expense in collecting the
                  facts we here record—we do not honestly believe that he had any idea of the base
                  plot in which he was a very prominent actor. No; we believe that, being naturally
                  vain, his better judgment was dispossessed by the flattering attentions of an
                  officer holding the distinguished position of Arnold, and that he thought he was
                  doing his country good service in assisting him to obtain accurate information
                  respecting the designs of the enemy; this being the plea which Arnold held out to
                  him for having an interview strictly private. Be this as it may, however, we will
                  not longer interrupt our narrative to intrude our opinions upon the reader, but
                  proceed to state the facts as they occurred.
               After making a second appointment for Andre to meet him or his agent at Dobbs'
                  Ferry, Arnold informed Smith what he had done, and further added that the time was
                  approaching when he should expect him to fulfil his promise, not only in having
                  his family removed, but in himself going down to the ferry to meet Anderson, for
                  the purpose of conducting him to his own house.
               Accordingly, on Monday, the same day that Washington crossed King's Ferry, Smith
                  set off with his wife and family up the river, ostensibly to pay a visit to his
                  relations in Fishkill, a small village on the Hudson, a few miles above West
                  Point. Leaving his family there, Smith the next day set out on his return; and as
                  Arnold's head-quarters was only a little out of his road, he called there on his
                  way back to let the General know that so far his request had been complied with.
                  Arnold had just returned from his trip down the river, and written the letters to
                  Robinson, elsewhere mentioned; and consequently Smith's arrival could not have
                  been more opportune, nor the information he brought more welcome than now.
               Arnold now told him, that instead of proceeding to Dobbs' Ferry, as at first
                  intended, he wished him, on the night of the following day, to go on board the
                  Vulture, and bring on shore Colonel Beverly Robinson, who wished to see him in
                  private on some business connected with the recovery of his estate; and to give
                  the matter an apparent interest in his own eyes, hinted that Robinson might be
                  induced to desert the British, which just at this time would be of incalculable
                  benefit to the American cause. He then gave Smith the customary pass for a flag of
                  truce; and a letter to Colonel Robinson, together with directions how to pass the
                  American gun boats, (which were always stationed on the river, whenever a British
                  man-of-war came up, in order to prevent intercourse with the shore,) and how to
                  proceed when he should get alongside the vessel. He also told him that Major
                  Kierse, the quarter-master at Stony Point, would supply him with a boat whenever
                  he should want one, and that he could proceed with all safety, as all the officers
                  were acquainted with his purpose.
               With these instructions and his papers, Smith left Arnold, and pursued his route
                  home, where he arrived the same evening; and on the following day, Wednesday, he
                  set about making preparations to execute the wishes of the General. But he met
                  with two obstacles which completely frustrated his design. In the first place,
                  there was no boat to be procured short of the Continental village, some miles
                  distant; and, in the second place, he could not get any one who would consent to
                  row it. He tried Samuel Colquhoun, one of his tenants, and used every kind of
                  persuasion, argument, and even added a bribe; but all to no effect: the man
                  positively refused to go; alleging as a reason, that he feared being taken up by
                  the guard-boats.
               Finding himself utterly foiled in his attempt to comply with the wishes of Arnold,
                  Smith thought it advisable to forward the General immediate intelligence of his
                  failure; and he accordingly mounted Colquhoun as an express, who rode all night,
                  and reached Robinson's house just before sunrise. Arnold received Smith's written
                  message in bed, and immediately sent the bearer word that no answer was required,
                  and that he might return without delay.
               At an early hour in the morning, Arnold started down the river; and as chance
                  would have it, he arrived at Verplank's Point just as the flag-boat, sent off by
                  Captain Sutherland, had left on its return to the Vulture. Colonel Livingston at
                  once handed him the letter of remonstrance, countersigned by John Anderson. Arnold
                  understood it at once; and it was with a
                  gleam of delight he thus learned that Major Andre had come up from New York, and
                  was now on board the vessel at Teller's Point. To make preparations for bringing
                  him on shore the following night, was now his sole object. With this design, he
                  informed Colonel Livingston that he had been made aware there was a person on
                  board the Vulture, who, if he could procure an interview with him, would give him
                  secret intelligence of the enemy, and that to effect this purpose it was necessary
                  he should have the countersign to pass the guard-boats without molestation. Not
                  suspecting any thing wrong, Livingston readily gave him the word for the night,
                  and also promised to provide against any accident happening to his messenger.
                  Arnold's next care was to have a boat ready for the occasion, as Smith had written
                  him that he had not procured one. For this purpose he crossed over to Stony Point,
                  and not finding one there, despatched an officer in his own barge to the
                  Continental village, which stood near a creek that emptied itself into the Hudson
                  some distance above, with orders to bring down a row-boat from that place. Leaving
                  directions with Major Kierse to send this boat, the moment it should arrive, to a
                  certain place in Haverstraw Creek, Arnold now repaired to Smith's house, to make
                  further preparations for the nocturnal journey of the latter and the completion of
                  his own base design.
               Having thus shown the maneuvering of all parties for several days, and reduced the
                  whole affair within a definite compass, we shall now proceed to give the incidents
                  which followed something more in detail.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               THE MEETING OF ARNOLD AND ANDRE.
               THE sun had set, twilight had almost deepened into night, and the stars, one after
                  another, were just beginning to spangle the clear dome of the heavens, as, with
                  impatient strides, General Arnold paced up and down a small square chamber in the
                  second story of Smith's mansion. On two sides of this apartment were arranged
                  several heavy book-cases, the shelves of which separated a goodly collection of
                  books of various kinds; and partly for this reason, and partly by way of
                  distinction, the room was denominated the library. It occupied the south-eastern
                  angle of the house, and had two windows, one looking east, and the other south,
                  and these commanded an entire view of Haverstraw Bay. The apartment contained no
                  superfluous furniture. Besides the book-case, there was an escritoire in one
                  corner, several massive arm-chairs standing carelessly about, and a heavy oaken
                  table in the center, on which books and papers were mingled in what we may be
                  allowed to term literary confusion. On one of these books, which occupied a higher
                  position than the rest, stood a neat silver lamp, whose clear but feeble rays were
                  just sufficient to make objects visible, without bringing them into bold relief.
                  As Arnold, in his impatient strides, passed this light, an occasional gleam fell
                  upon his face, and showed it very pale, while now and then some muscle could be
                  seen to twitch and quiver, indicating that the mind, which governs the outward
                  man, was in a state of unusual excitement and agitation.
               Several times did he halt before one or other of the windows, and peer out, with a
                  quick, eager look; but only each time to experience a fresh disappointment, if one
                  might judge from the haste with which he ever resumed his walk, and the bitter
                  imprecations which occasionally passed his lips.
               In this manner nearly half an hour rolled away, and the treacherous general was
                  just working himself into a terrible passion, when a quick step was heard along
                  the corridor, and the next moment the door opened, and Smith entered.
               "Well?" cried Arnold, in an impetuous tone, turning almost fiercely upon the
                  other
               "He will be here presently, your excellency," answered Smith, respectfully.
               "Presently?" repeated the General, savagely; "and when is presently? he should be
                  here now—ay, should have been here half an hour ago. Presently, indeed! Am I a
                  dog, to wait patiently the coming of this man as if he were my master?"
               "Well, General, it is not altogether his fault. I could not find him as soon as I
                  expected, and then he complained of fatigue, and said he could not come till he
                  had eaten his supper."
               "Umph! By ——! then I am to wait for his loggerheadship to eat, eh?
                  and the business of state to suffer for his empty belly? Well, well, things have
                  come to a pretty pass, truly."
               "I fear, your excellency, he will be of little service to you when he does come,
                  unless your persuasive powers are greater than mine," rejoined Smith.
               "You think he will refuse to go, eh?"
               "I know he will."
               "Indeed! well, let him—ay, sir, let him!" returned Arnold, sneeringly; and then,
                  with sudden energy and a horrid oath, added: "By —! sir, he shall
                  go!—mark that! I say he shall go!" and his features became flushed with passion,
                  and his black eyes seemed to shoot rays of fire.
               To this Smith made no reply; and after pacing up and down the room a few times
                  more, Arnold stopped, threw himself heavily into a chair, and in an altered tone
                  said:
               "By-the-by, friend Smith, what was that you were telling me a while ago about the
                  capture of a spy by the British? I only heard part, as, while
                  you were talking, I was busy thinking over some important matters of my own. You
                  must pardon my inattention—but recently I have had so much on my mind that I am
                  only surprised I retain my reason."
               "Why, your excellency was asking after news, and I replied that the most important
                  I had heard was the capture of a spy, which intelligence a friend of mine picked
                  up down the river. It seems that a young man was taken while attempting to pass
                  the British lines, and while the guard was conducting him to the nearest station,
                  he was observed to put something into his mouth and swallow. The guard related
                  what he had seen to his commanding officer, who immediately had the prisoner
                  searched; but not finding any thing on his person, and his suspicions being
                  aroused he sent for the surgeon, who administered an emetic. The result was, the
                  prisoner vomited up a silver ball, which, on being broken open, was found to
                  contain a paper giving an account of a recently discovered plot of the British
                  against the Americans."
               "Indeed!" returned Arnold, quickly; "and did you learn the nature of this
                  plot?"
               "I did not."
               "Well, and what was done with the spy?—hung, of course."
               "If not, doubtless he will be," replied Smith. "I only heard that he had been sent
                  to General Clinton's head-quarters for further examination, as it was supposed he
                  was only an agent in the business, and not a principal, and there was a great
                  anxiety to find out the latter. If his life is spared, depend upon it, it will
                  only be by his turning King's evidence."
               The conversation was here interrupted by the entrance of a servant, who said that
                  one Samuel Colquhoun was below, who wished to speak with General Arnold.
               "Show him up instantly," replied the General; and very soon after, a stout,
                  muscular, coarse-featured individual, whose plain, dirt-soiled dress, heavy boots,
                  sun-browned complexion, and calloused hands bespoke the ordinary laborer, entered
                  the library.
               "Well, Mr. Colquhoun, it seems you are here at last," said Arnold; "though I must
                  be free to say your tardiness has tired my patience not a little. But let that
                  pass. I have sent for you, my man, to request you will do me the favor of
                  accompanying Mr. Smith in a boat to the Vulture, and bring thence to shore a
                  certain person with whom it is necessary I should have a private interview to
                  night. The boat is already in the creek below here, and you have nothing to do but
                  row down and back, and for this service I am willing to pay you liberally. Come,
                  what say you?—will go, of course."
               While Arnold was speaking, Colquhoun stood with his back against the door, and his
                  hat in his hand, which he was looking down upon and twirling about in a rather
                  embarrassed manner, evidently meditating upon the reply he should make to the
                  General's request. When the other had done, he still hesitated a moment, and then
                  said:
               "Why, you see, your excellency, I should like to accommodate you—but the fact is,
                  you see, I was up all last night, riding express, and I'm too tired to undertake
                  so hard a job. Besides, your excellency, I don't much like the notion of going out
                  on the Bay in the night; for the
                  guard-boats is all about; and if they should happen to git hold of us, as I know
                  they will, it would be a right troublesome job maybe, and I'd much rather be clear
                  on't. Now, your excellency, I wouldn't mind going in the morning, by daylight,
                  with a flag of truce; but this night business don't suit; and so, although I'd
                  like to oblige your excellency in every thing that's proper, I must, for the
                  reasons I've told you, decline going to-night."
               "Why, my good fellow, the morning will be too late," replied Arnold; "for there is
                  a person on board the Vulture whom I must see to-night, and who must be brought on
                  shore without delay. The business I have with him is of the utmost importance to
                  the country; and if you are a true friend to your country, I am sure you will not
                  hesitate to go on the mission I send you. You shall be furnished with a flag of
                  truce, and I will give you the countersign, so that you will have no difficulty in
                  passing the guard-boats."
               "It seems to me," joined in Smith, "that you are wilfully obstinate, Sam. Can you
                  not do what General Arnold requires of you for the public good? Remember, that I
                  am to go with you, and whatever risk you may run, I shall, of course, run the
                  same; and do you think I would venture on a dangerous enterprise, or insist on
                  your accompanying me tonight, were it not all important this person, whoever he
                  is, should be brought on shore?"
               Colquhoun listened, twirled his hat round more than ever, and after some
                  hesitation, again replied:
               "Why, I'd like to accommodate ye, gentlemen; but I don't much like this night
                  business, as I said afore; and besides, I don't see what use there is in going in
                  the dark, when it appears to me that daylight might do just as well. It's out of
                  the regular way of doing things; and these secret businesses always is dangerous,
                  say what you like about 'em."
               "The business on which I send you is no secret," replied Arnold; "it is one well
                  known to all the officers; even Major Kierse furnishes the boat you are to go in;
                  and the commanders of the guard-boats have had their instructions from Colonel
                  Livingston himself, understand the countersign, and will let your boat pass
                  without molestation. As to the business being put off till morning, that is
                  impossible; for it is absolutely necessary the man should be brought on shore
                  secretly, in order to prevent the transaction from becoming generally known to the
                  inhabitants, who would, of course, make more or less talk about it, start a
                  thousand vague rumors, and in all probability defeat the great end I have in view
                  for the public good."
               "Well, General, if I was ever so much inclined to go, I couldn't manage the boat
                  alone," rejoined Colquhoun.
               "Well, then," chimed in Smith, "why not call your brother Joseph?"
               "I don't believe Joe would go," answered Sam; "but to please you, I'll try
                  him."
               "Be quick, then, for I am very impatient, as we have delayed too long already,"
                  said Arnold; and as Colquhoun went out, the traitor added, to Smith: "The fellow
                  don't intend to go, I see plainly; but by ——! he shall, or it shall be the worse
                  for him."
               In about half an hour, Samuel Colquhoun returned, in company with his brother
                  Joseph. Smith immediately took the latter aside, and used the same arguments with
                  him he had done with Samuel, and with the same result, for the brothers had agreed
                  upon one point while left to themselves, namely, that they would resist all
                  persuasions, and refuse to embark in an enterprise which, notwithstanding all that
                  Smith and Arnold might say to the contrary, they believed to be improper and
                  hazardous. Arnold next tried his persuasive powers; but finding all his arguments
                  fruitless, that the brothers were firm in their determination, he at length
                  resolved upon a different course, and in a harsh, imperious tone, said:
               "Men, you are stubborn and wilful, and have refused to comply with my request,
                  just to have your own way. Now, if you persist in this—persist in refusing to give
                  your aid to your country in a time of need—there remains but one course for me to
                  pursue. I shall be obliged to look upon you as disaffected toward the common
                  cause; and, by ——! as surely as that my name is Benedict Arnold, I will put you
                  both under arrest in less than twenty-four hours; so choose now between doing a
                  worthy deed, or being forever branded with disgrace."
               On hearing this threatening language, the brothers became alarmed; and after a
                  short consultation together, said, that under the circumstances, they would
                  consent to do the General's bidding.
               "Well, then," replied Arnold, "you must prepare to set off forthwith; and to show
                  you that I do not ask your labor for nothing, I will promise you, as a reward for
                  your services, fifty pounds of flour apiece."
               Arnold then drew Smith aside, and after a short consultation, said, in
                  conclusion:
               "You have all the necessary papers—manage as I have directed, and you will have no
                  trouble. Let there be as much expedition as possible. I shall be at the rendezvous
                  before you."
               Arnold then accompanied the party to the boat, which was at the landing near the
                  mouth of Haverstraw Creek. A considerable delay had been occasioned by one means
                  and another, and it was past eleven o'clock when the boat got under way, and
                  retreated from the shore. By the General's directions, the oars were muffled, and
                  not a sound was audible, as it glided over the tranquil waters, and was finally
                  swallowed up in the darkness. Arnold watched it on its progress, till only a mere
                  speck was visible, and then retraced his steps to Smith's house, with what feeling
                  we must leave to treacherous souls to imagine.
               The die was now cast; the last link which connected him with those great, immortal
                  spirits, contending for liberty and the rights of man, was now broken; and nothing
                  seemed to remain for him but success in his vile undertaking, or an ignominious
                  death upon the scaffold. It was, therefore, with strange feelings, not unmixed
                  with fears for the result, that Arnold reflected upon his work of treason; but
                  there was no hesitation; he had coolly, deliberately, resolved upon his course of
                  infamy, and he was now as determined as ever to push it through at all
                  hazards.
               As soon as he had returned to the mansion, he ordered one of the servants to
                  saddle two horses, and prepare to accompany him; and in less than half an hour, he
                  was on the road leading to the village of Haverstraw. He did not enter the
                  village, however, but, when fairly in sight of it, turned off to the left, and
                  made his way as best he could to the bank of the river, at the foot of the Long
                  Clove mountain—the place agreed upon between him and Smith as the rendezvous.
                  Ordering the servant to remain at some distance with the horses, Arnold next
                  ensconsed himself in a dense thicket, and, with all the patience he could command,
                  awaited the arrival of Andre.
               Meantime, let us return to Smith. The night was clear and serene, the stars shone
                  brightly in the great firmament above, and not a ripple disturbed the glassy
                  surface of the tranquil bay, as the boat, steadily propelled by the strong arms of
                  the oarsmen, glided silently over the bosom of the waters, with its white flag
                  hanging motionless around the staff in the bow. Not a word was spoken, not a
                  whisper breathed, as though each were too much impressed with his dangerous
                  mission to give voice to thought. Gradually the boat approached its destination,
                  undisturbed, till at last the dark sides of the Vulture loomed up dead ahead,
                  within speaking distance. A moment after, a hoarse seaman's voice challenged:
               "Boat ahoy! who are you, and whither bound?"
               "Americans," replied Smith, answering according to Arnold's instructions, "going
                  from King's Ferry to Dobbs' Ferry, with a flag of truce."
               "Heave to, and come alongside with your d—d lubberly craft, before I scuttle her
                  with a six-pounder," was the gruff response; and as Smith, anticipating some such
                  reply, ordered the oarsmen to approach the ship's side as quick as possible, the
                  officer of the watch continued to pour forth a strain of the most uncourtly
                  epithets with which his sailor vocabulary was stored.
               "You——lubberly, piratical rebels," he continued, "what are you doing out here at
                  this time of night? A fine time to be sculling your worm-eaten craft over his
                  Majesty's waters, on some thieving exploit, with a cowardly white rag stuck up to
                  keep gentlemen of our cloth from sending
                  you to Davy Jones's locker! How dare you—rebel greenhorns approach one of his
                  Majesty's vessels under cover of darkness? By —! I've a mind to give you the cat
                  o'-nine, and run you up at the yard-arm, without time to say the Lord's prayer;
                  and then you'd be too well served, for such—piratical dogs as you are!"
               While the night-watch was venting his spleen in this manner, Smith improved the
                  time in clambering up the side of the ship; and the sight of him standing coolly
                  on deck, without any apparent fear, increased the fury of the officer to such a
                  degree, that even Smith began to grow alarmed, lest he should proceed to some act
                  of violence; but just at the moment when his rage appeared at the highest, a boy
                  came on deck, and said:
               "It is Captain Sutherland's orders that the man be shown into the cabin."
               Smith followed the boy down; and on entering the cabin, perceived two officers,
                  one of whom, dressed in a colonel's uniform, with gray hair, and a venerable
                  countenance, he at once recognized as Beverly Robinson, with whom he had had some
                  slight acquaintance previous to the war. The other person, dressed in a naval
                  uniform, he did not know, but rightly conjectured him to be the commander of the
                  Vulture.
               "Ah, Mr. Smith," said Robinson, coming forward and extending his hand, "happy to
                  renew our acquaintance, sir. Eh! what is this?" he added, as Smith presented
                  Arnold's letter. "Addressed to me. Hum! take a seat, Mr. Smith, and I will see if
                  any answer is required."
               He broke open the missive as he spoke, and read to himself, as follows:
               "SIR,—This will be delivered to you by Mr. Smith, who will conduct you to a place
                  of safety. Neither Mr. Smith nor any other person shall be made acquainted with
                  your proposals. If they, which I doubt not, are of such a nature that I can
                  officially take notice of them, I shall do it with pleasure. I take it for
                  granted, Colonel Robinson will not propose anything that is not for the interest
                  of the United States, as well as himself."
               This was signed Benedict Arnold, Major General; and as soon as he had perused it,
                  Robinson turned to Smith, and asked him if he had any other papers.
               "These passports are all," replied Smith, putting them in Robinson's hand.
               The first read:
               "This paper duly authorizes Joshua Smith to go to Dobbs' Ferry, with three men and
                  a boy in a boat, with a flag, to carry some letters of a private nature for a
                  gentleman in New York, and to return immediately, he having permission to go at
                  such hours and times as the tide and his business suit;" and the other granted
                  permission "to Joshua Smith, Mr. John Anderson, and two servants, to pass and
                  repass the guards near King's Ferry, at all times."
               Both bore recent date, and were signed by Arnold; and as soon as Robinson had read
                  them, he understood the meaning; which was, that Andre, and not himself, should
                  come on shore—they also serving to secure the boat from being detained by the
                  water-guards, in case any of the latter had not been furnished with the
                  countersign.
               Robinson now spoke aside with Sutherland for a few minutes; and then apologizing
                  to Smith for having neglected to introduce him to the Captain, immediately did so,
                  and quitted the cabin, leaving the two in conversation.
               At once seeking Andre, Robinson placed Arnold's papers before him, and said:
               "I do not like this business. Arnold should have come on board himself, and not
                  sent a third party. He evidently expects you to go on shore to him."
               "And so I will," replied Andre.
               "Well, I would not," rejoined Robinson, in a decided tone; "for between ourselves,
                  I do not think too much confidence should be placed on the word of a man, who is,
                  by this very interview, seeking to betray his country. No; let him come to you, or
                  let the business fall through—it is too hazardous for you to go to him. Were Sir
                  Henry himself here, I do not believe he would consent to your leaving the
                  vessel."
               "Well, perhaps not," responded Andre; "but I am tired and sick of this suspense,
                  and will take upon myself all risks, for the sake of bringing the affair to an
                  end. It is useless to attempt to dissuade me, for I am fixed in my determination;
                  so pray assist me to get away, that I may be back before the dawn."
               "Well, you must conceal your uniform, for Smith is not aware you are a soldier.
                  There, this blue overcoat will do it."
               A few minutes after this conversation, Robinson conducted Andre, completely
                  enveloped in a blue cloth greatcoat, into the cabin, and advancing to Smith,
                  introduced him as Mr. John Anderson, adding:
               "As I am at this time not in very good health, Mr. Smith, I have deputed this
                  gentleman, who being perfectly acquainted with the business upon which the
                  consultation is to be held, can fully act in my stead, and give all the
                  information desired." Then turning to Andre: "You can express my regrets to
                  General Arnold, Mr. Anderson, and say that ill health alone prevents my going on
                  shore to see him to-night."
               Andre bowed an affirmative, and led the way out of the cabin, followed by Smith.
                  The Captain also accompanied the parties on deck, and proposed that one of his own
                  boats should go armed and tow the other; but this being strongly objected to by
                  both Smith and Andre, Sutherland did not urge the point, and the parties soon
                  after embarked in silence. The Colquhouns, with muffled oars, now rowed steadily
                  from the ship's side, and soon all were invisible to those who had watched them
                  from the deck.
               On their way to the rendezvous, Smith made several remarks, intended to draw his
                  companion into conversation; but as Andre replied not, or answered only in
                  monosyllables, the former ceased his vain attempts, and a deep silence, unbroken
                  save by the rippling of the water against the boat's prow, succeeded. At length
                  the shore was reached; and bidding Andre and the boatmen await his return, Smith
                  disappeared up the side of the steep mountain. The exact place of rendezvous had
                  been previously agreed upon between him and Arnold; and after groping about
                  sometime in the tangled bushes, a low, guarded voice in a nervous accent,
                  inquired:
               "Is that you, Smith?"
               "Ay, your excellency.'
               "Hush! is all right?"
               "Mr. Anderson has come on shore with me."
               For some time there was no reply to this, during which the bushes just to the
                  right of Smith were a good deal agitated, as if some person, closely hemmed in by
                  them, were shivering with the cold.
               "Conduct him hither," at length said Arnold, in an uneven voice; "and then be so
                  kind as to leave us to ourselves for a short time. Ah! I believe I am getting a
                  chill."
               "I hope not, General, for I too well know what that is. Indeed, I have suffered a
                  good deal with the fever and ague of late, and I fear this night's business will
                  not be likely to mitigate the disorder."
               Smith then returned to the boat, and requested Andre, or Anderson, as he supposed
                  him to be, to follow him; and having conducted him to where Arnold was concealed,
                  he left the parties together, in the darkness and dead hours of night, to
                  consummate their diabolical plot of treason.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TREASON.
               ALTHOUGH Smith did not make it known to Arnold, either by his language or manner,
                  yet he was anything but pleased with the request that he should not be present at
                  the interview between the General and Anderson. It seemed to imply a reserve of
                  confidence which he had never noticed till now; and considering all the sacrifices
                  he had made to bring about the meeting, he began to regard himself in the light of
                  a dupe, or tool, for the completion of some purpose very different from that
                  alleged by the General to him. The more he reflected upon it, the more vexed did
                  he become; and he paced back and forth along the shore in no enviable mood,
                  expecting every moment to see the concealed parties make their appearance. Minute
                  after minute went by, an hour rolled away, and then another, and still the General
                  and Anderson came not. The oarsmen, meantime, had fallen asleep in the boat, and
                  Smith was thus left entirely to himself.
               
               At last, his patience having become completely exhausted—more especially as the
                  cold night dew was beginning to affect, somewhat seriously, a frame none of the
                  strongest, and which had of late suffered no little from the tertian ague—Smith
                  aroused the boatmen, and asked them if they were willing to assist in rowing the
                  boat back to the vessel.
               "No," replied Sam, "not an inch, even if General Arnold puts us under arrest for
                  not doing it."
               "Well," returned Smith, "it is near morning, and we must leave here, at all
                  events."
               He then went into the bushes toward the spot where Arnold was concealed, who
                  hearing him approach, called out:
               "Well, who's there?"
               "The night is far spent," replied Smith, "and I have come to tell you that it is
                  necessary the boat should leave here before daylight."
               "Ah! then I will back to the vessel," said the voice of Andre, "and we will finish
                  this business some other time, General."
               "You can not return to-night, Mr. Anderson," rejoined Smith, "for no persuasion
                  would induce the boatmen to go back; and besides, I fear we have hardly time to
                  get up the bay before the break of day."
               "Good heavens! what is to be done then?" cried Andre, in a voice that denoted
                  alarm.
               "Have no fear," replied Arnold; "I will conduct you to Smith's house, where you
                  will be safe till I can find a way for you to return to your vessel. Follow me. I
                  have two horses just up the hill, and the servant who rode one can go back afoot.
                  I think, Smith, you had better have the boat rowed up to Haverstraw Creek as soon
                  as possible, and we will meet you at your own house."
               "Very well," replied Smith; and as he went back to the boat, Arnold and Andre
                  proceeded to where the black was still holding the horses.
               Bidding the latter hasten to his master, Arnold saw Andre mounted on one beast,
                  and mounting the other himself, the two set off toward Haverstraw village, making
                  a circuit as they neared it, so as to avoid notice. But they were not successful
                  in eluding observation; for just as they came abreast of the place, the voice of a
                  sentry cried out:
               "Who goes there?"
               "Friends," replied Arnold.
               "Stand, and give the countersign."
               "Congress," was Arnold's response.
               "Pass on," rejoined the sentry; and our party continuing their course, soon found
                  themselves in the broad highway.
               "My God!" exclaimed Andre, as soon as he dared permit himself to speak; "is it
                  possible that I am within the American lines?"
               "Even so," said Arnold; "but have no fear, my friend, you are under my protection,
                  and I assure you, you shall return in safety to your friends."
               Andre did not reply to this, but his feelings it is impossible to describe.
                  Unconsciously, as it were, he had placed himself within the very jaws of danger,
                  beyond the power of retreat, and nothing could now be done but abide the result.
                  Until he heard the challenge of the sentinel, he had fancied himself secure on
                  neutral, or, at least, unoccupied ground; but now all the perils of his situation
                  rose up before him, and strange forebodings filled his mind with gloom and dread.
                  He remembered the awful prediction of the astrologer, and he shuddered as he
                  recalled the words, "Thou art doomed to die upon the scaffold." Might
                  not those words come true? If detected, he would certainly be tried as a spy; and
                  if convicted, the penalty attached to the crime, by all nations, was too well
                  known to him to leave any doubt on his mind as to what would be his fate. He
                  remembered, too, the caution of his kind benefactor, Sir Henry Clinton, not to go
                  on shore, not to disguise himself, and not to permit himself to take papers. Two
                  of these injunctions he had disobeyed, and his heart smote him for it, although he
                  had reasoned himself into the belief that he was acting for the best. And then he
                  thought what would be Sir Henry's feelings, should he hear his project had been
                  discovered, and his messenger detected and doomed to death. And then his poor
                  mother and sisters, in the far away land beyond the seas—how would they bear the
                  news of his loss, their sole dependence, and what a stigma would an ignominious
                  death bring upon the family name! In all his gloomy reflections, Andre thought
                  more of others than of himself, save so far as his death would contribute to their
                  woe, and this showed the greatness and nobleness of a soul above the comprehension
                  of meaner minds.
               So lost was Andre in reflections of this nature, that several remarks of Arnold
                  passed unheeded, unheard; and even such as were forced upon his notice, failed to
                  arouse his conversational powers, or even draw his mind from its painful reverie.
                  At last, just as dawn was breaking, they drew up before Smith's mansion; and
                  bidding Andre alight and enter, Arnold conducted him at once to the library. Here,
                  as Andre threw off his overcoat, Arnold for the first time became aware that he
                  was in uniform; and with a start of surprise, he exclaimed:
               "Ah! Major, you should have come in disguise; it will be as much as both our necks
                  are worth, if you are discovered in these habiliments. Smith will see your dress,
                  of course; but I must trump up some plausible story to him about your excessive
                  vanity, and endeavor to procure a change, for it will not do for even him to know
                  that you are a British officer."
               "When I left the Vulture to meet you, of course I expected to return before
                  daylight," replied Andre, rather coldly; "and therefore only provided myself for
                  such an adventure. Had I been aware it was General Arnold's intention to detain me
                  till morning, and then conduct me within the American lines, I certainly should
                  have declined the risk of such a meeting, even had I known that the business on
                  which I came would thereby never have gone beyond a very interesting mercantile
                  correspondence."
               "It was not my intention to detain you," replied Arnold, quickly; "but you well
                  know our arrangements were not effected when Smith interrupted us, and you heard
                  what he said about the boatmen refusing to take you back. I can not govern
                  circumstances any more than yourself, Major Andre, and must say your sneering
                  insinuations are in very bad your sneering insinuations are in very bad taste, and
                  ill-timed. You should not overlook the fact, that if through me you are placed in
                  jeopardy, my neck is in just as much danger as your own."
               What reply Andre would have made is uncertain, had not Smith entered the room just
                  as Arnold ceased speaking. He started back in surprise, on perceiving Andre in the
                  full dress of a British officer; but Arnold immediately took him aside, and
                  said:
               "What foolish vanity some men have, my dear Smith. Now you see, this young
                  Anderson, who never in his life aspired to any thing above a counting-house
                  ledger, just to appear consequential in his interview with me, must foolishly go
                  and borrow an officer's uniform, as if such trappings could influence my decision
                  in any way."
               "Ridiculous," sneered Smith.
               "Ay, my dear friend, you may well say ridiculous; and would to Heaven that were
                  the worst of it—I would then let him enjoy his borrowed honors; but just suppose
                  he should be seen by any one—all the asseverations in the world would not convince
                  a stupid head that he is not what he seems; and the report would go abroad that we
                  are entertaining a British officer; and I need not say to one of your sound sense
                  and judgement, what would be the consequence to us, should such a rumor once get
                  started."
               "He should change his dress, then, without delay," said Smith.
               "Ay, my friend," rejoined Arnold, "that is just the point I was coming at; and if
                  you will lend him some clothes of your own, I will insist on his doing so."
               "I can furnish him a coat, if that will do," returned Smith; and Arnold signifying
                  that a coat might answer, the former immediately quitted the room to get it.
               In a few minutes Smith returned, bringing the desired article; and on presenting
                  it to Andre, he at once divested himself of his own coat and put it on, and it
                  proved to be a very good fit. Arnold now made some excuse and went out; and Andre,
                  turning to Smith, said:
               "You must pardon me, Mr. Smith, if I envy you the possession of this mansion and
                  grounds. What a delightful view of the Hudson you have from these windows;" and he
                  approached the southern one, as he spoke, and looked down the bay.
               Morning had fairly dawned, and the whole landscape reposed in that soft, rosy
                  light which invests every object with interest, if not with beauty. No mist was on the water, and the eye
                  had a full range of Haverstraw Bay, whose tranquil bosom was like a large mirror,
                  or plate of burnished steel. Away in the distance, where the Hudson narrowed to
                  its regular channel, and a bend in the river cut off all further view in that
                  direction, the low, black hulk, and tall, trim, tapering spars of the Vulture,
                  could be seen clearly defined against the slightly retreating back-ground of the
                  picture. On this vessel Andre fixed his gaze with a wistful look, and sighed at
                  the thought he was not now on board. Smith approached the window also, and
                  glancing in the same direction, said, with a self-satisfied air, in reply to the
                  other's remark:
               "Yes, I have a very pleasant residence here for the summer season."
               At this moment a bright flash was seen on the west bank of the river, opposite the
                  vessel; another and another followed in quick succession, and then boom, boom,
                  boom, came the roar of cannon.
               "My God!" cried Andre, starting back, and clasping his hands with a look of
                  horror, "they have attacked the vessel! Oh, heavens! what will become of me?"
               "Do not be alarmed," returned Smith, in a soothing tone. "I do not apprehend they
                  will do her much damage. See! they are active on board, and a few minutes will
                  suffice to let them drop down the stream, beyond reach of the shot."
               "Ha! look! behold!" cried Andre, again. "Great God! she is on fire;" and as he
                  uttered these words, his pale, noble countenance wore an expression of such
                  intense anguish, that Smith, who caught a glance of his features, afterward
                  averred, that were he to live a thousand years, he could never forget that
                  look.
               The vessel did seem on fire, sure enough; and a bright sheet of flame shooting
                  upward, and a dense volume of smoke rolling down toward the water, for a time
                  completely obscured her decks and hulk. But presently the flames were got under,
                  the smoke cleared away, the vessel dropped down the stream, the cannonade ceased,
                  and Major Andre resumed his former composure. We may as well mention, in this
                  connection, that the firing upon the Vulture was occasioned by a report having
                  been made to Colonel Livingston, that the ship was so near the shore the
                  inhabitants of Teller's Point and vicinity were apprehensive boats would land and
                  commit depredations, and he had, therefore, ordered down a detachment of artillery
                  to force her from her position. The fire on board was merely the burning of some
                  canvas and tar, which had caught by accident.
               After breakfast, Smith left Arnold and Andre together in the library, and here the
                  vile scheme of treason was consummated, and every arrangement made for putting the
                  British in possession of West Point—ay, even the day set when the latter were to
                  sail up the river to a bloodless victory. It is not our intention to weary the
                  reader with a detail of the "bargain and sale" of this transaction—for we have not
                  space, even if we had the inclination so to do—and therefore we shall give the
                  substance of the agreement in as few words as possible. In the first place, Arnold
                  was to make such disposition of the troops at West Point, as would weaken this
                  post, and cause it to fall into British hands with but little, if any, bloodshed.
                  For this purpose, so soon as it should be known that the enemy was ascending the
                  river, small parties of the garrison were to be sent out in different directions
                  into the gorges of the hills, under pretense of attacking the British; and here
                  they were to remain idle, while the latter were to land, march up the hill by
                  different routes, and simultaneously take possession of the works, with but
                  trifling opposition. On his part, Andre agreed, that in the event of this plan
                  being successfully carried out, General Arnold should receive from the British
                  government the sum of ten thousand pounds sterling, and the commission of
                  brigadier general in his Majesty's royal army.
               Arnold then put into Andre's possession six separate papers, which, according to
                  Sparks, were as follows: "First, artillery orders, which had recently been
                  published at West Point, giving directions how each corps should dispose of itself
                  in case of an alarm. This paper was of the utmost importance, as it would enable
                  the enemy, when they should make an attack, to know the precise condition of every
                  part of the garrison. Secondly, an estimate of the force at West Point and its
                  dependencies. Thirdly, an estimate of the number of men requisite to man the
                  works. Fourthly, a return of the ordnance in the different forts, redoubts, and
                  batteries. Fifthly, remarks on the works at West Point, describing the
                  construction of each, and its strength or weakness. Sixthly, a report of a council
                  of war lately held at head-quarters, which contained hints respecting the probable
                  operations of the campaign, and which General Washington had sent to Arnold a few
                  days before, requesting his opinion on the subjects to which it referred."
               "These papers," said Arnold, as he gave them into Andre's possession, "I think you
                  had better place between your stockings and feet, as they will be more concealed
                  there than elsewhere about your person; and should any accident happen, I rely
                  upon you, as a man of honor and a gentleman, to have them destroyed."
               "Rest assured, General Arnold," replied Andre, "that I shall take good care to
                  comply with your request; for my safety, as well as your own, depends upon my
                  doing so. When I enter the boat, I will have them tied round with a string, with a
                  weight attached; and if any danger menaces, they shall be sent to the bottom of
                  the stream. And apropos: what time will the boat be ready for me?"
               "Why," hesitated Arnold, "I have been thinking the matter over, and, all things
                  considered, have come to the conclusion that it will be your best plan to return
                  by land."
               "How!" exclaimed Andre, in surprise; "am I not to be sent back to the
                  Vulture?"
               "If you insist upon it, of course; but if you take my advice, you will not; for in
                  returning to New York by land, you will be more likely to escape detection, than
                  in passing from here to the Vulture by water; for every night the countersign of
                  the guard-boats is changed; and I could not learn what the word is for tonight,
                  without incurring suspicion; and without it you would undoubtedly be
                  captured."
               "Notwithstanding this," rejoined Andre, in a decided tone, "I must return to the
                  Vulture, and I insist upon General Arnold's keeping his promise, and putting me on
                  board."
               "Well, well, I will see what can be done," returned the other, evasively.
                  "Meantime, let me see these papers secured as I requested:" and while Andre,
                  taking off his boots and stockings, placed them next his feet, Arnold sat down at
                  the table and wrote a few lines, which he handed the young officer, saying, "Here
                  is your pass, and Heaven send you a safe and speedy return to the city. I must now
                  leave you, and set out for head-quarters; but you may rest assured I shall look
                  anxiously forward to our next meeting, when I trust a rebel passport will no
                  longer be needed to make your journey up or down the Hudson a safe one. I will see
                  Smith before I go, and give him the necessary instructions for guiding you safely
                  back to your friends. Commend me to his excellency, Sir Henry Clinton, and say to
                  him I hope the day is not far distant, when we, who have so long been enemies, may
                  meet as friends. Adieu, Adjutant!"
               "Farewell, General Arnold," returned Andre, solemnly: "God send we
                     may meet again under different circumstances!"
               The two officers then shook hands and parted; but the prayer of the young soldier
                  was never granted.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               THE JOURNEY.
               IT was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, when Arnold and Andre
                  separated for the last time; and as it was of material importance that none but
                  those already in the secret should know of the latter's presence in Smith's
                  mansion, the young Adjutant, in consequence, remained a close prisoner in the
                  library, where the entire day was passed in solitude, not even the host himself
                  intruding upon his meditations.
               And a sad, weary day it was to Andre—a day spent in gloomy reverie, with dire
                  forebodings. For hours did he pace to and fro across the chamber, with his head
                  bowed upon his bosom, his eye riveted on the floor, but his vision far away, and
                  fixed upon the scenes called up by his fertile imaginary creations. At one time he
                  fancied himself detected as a spy, hooted
                  at by the rabble, dragged before a military tribunal, tried, condemned, and led
                  forth to execution; at another time he was at the head of a gallant body of
                  troops, storming the heights of West Point, and leading his men on to victory; and
                  he saw the cross of St. George, by his direction, planted on the summit of the
                  highest mount, and waving in victory; while the loud huzzas of the soldiery awoke
                  the sleeping echoes of the pass, and told him his long-sought hour of glory had
                  come.
               And so life-like, so like reality, was each imaginary scene to Andre, that his
                  countenance betrayed all the different feelings which such opposites might be
                  supposed to excite; now sad, troubled, desponding, and gloomy—now bright,
                  animated, enthusiastic, and joyous. But the dark scenes prevailed over the light,
                  and his features, for the most part, wore a solemn, anxious, troubled look.
               Occasionally would Andre pause at the window and look out—occasionally would he
                  throw himself into a seat and seize upon a book; but nothing seemed to divert his
                  mind from the one great object of solicitude—a safe return to his friends—and the
                  day in consequence dragged slowly and wearily to a close; while action of body; in
                  walking up and down his narrow limits, seemed actually necessary to keep pace with
                  his excited and troubled thoughts.
               Toward night, Andre grew more and more impatient to see darkness once more settle
                  over the earth; and he watched the sun's decline with the same anxiety one in
                  prison, whose time of confinement is nearly expired, might be supposed to await
                  the coming of his jailer to set him free. At length the sun went down; and as his
                  dying rays were about to depart from the lofty summits of the neighboring hills,
                  Smith entered the library.
               "Well," said Andre, advancing toward him with a hasty step, "is all prepared for
                  my departure?"
               "Yes, Mr. Anderson, all is ready. Your supper waits, and I have ordered out the
                  horses."
               "The horses!" exclaimed Andre, in surprise. "Am I to return as
                  I came, in a boat?"
               "No, that is impossible."
               "How impossible?"
               "I have no boat ready, and no one to row it if I had."
               "Why not get the same boat and men you had last night?"
               "Because the men would not go if I asked them, and were only induced to go last
                  night by the threats, not the persuasions, of General Arnold, and he is not here
                  now."
               "But, surely, you can get others, Mr. Smith?"
               "No, you are mistaken; there are none would run the hazard of so perilous an
                  undertaking; and to tell you the truth, I should not like to repeat the excursion
                  myself—not only on account of the danger attached to it, but because I have
                  suffered all day with a chill from my venture on the water last night."
               "O, this is vexatious!" rejoined Andre, in no very pleasant humor. "I would to
                  Heaven I had never left the Vulture! I thought General Arnold had made
                  preparations for sending me back in the same manner I came—at least he gave me to
                  understand he would when we parted."
               "He mentioned something about it to me," returned Smith; "but when I told him
                  positively it could not be done, he replied that I must do the best I could to get
                  you safely to the city, and left me two passports, one authorizing me to go by
                  water, the other by land."
               "Well," rejoined Andre, with a sigh, "I suppose I must submit to my fate. But do
                  not let us delay; if the horses are ready, I am; which route do we take?"
               "We must cross the river here at King's Ferry, and go down on the opposite side.
                  But you will take some supper before you start?"
               "No, I am in no mood for eating, though I thank you none the less for your
                  hospitable offer."
               Smith, however, prevailed upon Andre to eat a few mouthfuls; and shortly after the
                  two set out, accompanied by a servant, and all three well mounted. Andre still
                  retained Smith's coat, and left his own behind; but the blue-cloth overcoat,
                  buttoned close to the throat, with its broad, heavy cape, completely concealed his
                  dress, and gave him the appearance of a private citizen on a journey.
               On their way to the ferry, Smith met several persons with whom he was acquainted;
                  and to every one he had something to say in a jocular tone, indicating not only a
                  mind at ease, but in an unusually light and buoyant state.
               "How now, neighbor Mason," he said to one—"how comes on the bob-tail roan?—it's
                  lucky for her the fly season is over."—"Ah, Peter, still with crutches, I see! I
                  suppose, though, you will kick against them erelong." "Well, Parson
                  Thorndike, I understand they are getting up a subscription for you as long as one
                  of your sermons. If they contribute Continental scrip, there will not be much
                  difference in the exchange."—"Ha! Bunstead," he said, to a red-nosed man, standing
                  in the door of a suttler's shanty, "you are a capital sign for this place; for
                  every one can see by your face there is plenty of liquor within."
               The man laughed, and invited Smith to try a bowl of punch with him. He consented;
                  but Andre rode on, and reaching the ferry before him, awaited in moody silence his
                  coming.
               As the party crossed over from Stony Point to Verplank's Point, Smith made several
                  remarks about the taking of the former from the British the year previous; but as
                  Andre did not reply, nor seem to take any interest in the matter, the other
                  dropped the subject.
               It was almost dark when they landed on the east bank of the Hudson, and rode up
                  through the works at Verplank's Point. Smith stopped at Colonel Livingston's tent,
                  which was near the road, and entered into conversation with that officer—but Andre
                  and the servant continued to move along at a slow pace. In a few minutes Smith
                  overtook his companion, and the party pushed forward in silence. Nothing worthy of
                  note occurred, till some six or eight miles intervened between our travelers and
                  the ferry, when a clear voice rang out:
               "Who goes there?"
               "Friends," answered Smith.
               "Give the countersign!"
               "I do not know it."
               "Halt, then, for examination!"
               Smith dismounted, and leaving his horse with his servant, went forward to where
                  the sentry was standing, and inquired who commanded the party.
               "Captain Milford," was the answer.
               "And where can I find him?"
               "Here," answered another voice; and turning, Smith discovered a person approaching
                  him. "Well, sir," continued Milford, as he came up, "who are you? where do you
                  belong? and what is your business here at this time of night?"
               "My name," answered the other, promptly, "is Joshua Smith; my residence is a
                  couple of miles below Stony Point; and myself and another gentleman are going down
                  as far as White Plains, on important business for General Arnold, from whom I have
                  a passport; and with your permission, Captain, we will resume our journey without
                  delay."
               "But may I inquire, sir, how far you intend to proceed to-night?"
               "As far as Major Strang's, or Colonel Drake's."
               "Well, sir, I am sorry to inform you, that Major Strang is not at home, and
                  Colonel Drake has removed to another part of the country."
               "Indeed!" rejoined Smith; "I am sorry to hear it."
               "Better take lodgings in the neighborhood here, and go on by daylight," suggested
                  Milford.
               "No," answered Smith, "we must pursue our route to-night—for much delay is
                  contrary to the General's express request."
               "Pardon me, then! but I must examine your passport before you proceed further. My
                  orders are very strict, and these are times requiring unusual vigilance."
               "Here it is," said Smith, handing Milford a paper, "but you will not be able to
                  read it in the dark."
               "Very true; but if you will accompany me to the house yonder, it will be an easy
                  matter to procure a light," returned the Captain.
               "I will attend you,' rejoined Smith; "but first I will speak a word with my
                  companion;" and he hurried back to where Andre was awaiting him, on horseback,
                  only a few paces distant.
               "Well," said the latter, in a low, agitated tone, "have we got into trouble
                  already?"
               "No, nothing alarming, Mr. Anderson. This officer is rather inquisitive, and we
                  shall be obliged to humor him. He has now gone forward to yonder house to examine
                  my passport; but give yourself no uneasiness—the paper is all correct—and he will not dare detain us
                  after reading it."
               "I feared something of this kind," returned Andre, despondingly. "Oh! would to
                  Heaven I had been put on board the Vulture!"
               "Well, well, regrets will not mend the matter now; so come on, show a bold face,
                  and depend upon it we shall get off without any difficulty."
               Smith mounted his horse as he spoke and the party set forward toward the house in
                  question, Andre silent and uneasy. As they drew up before the door, Milford, who
                  had reached the house in advance of them, came out, and handing Smith the pass,
                  said:
               "I am happy to say, Mr. Smith, I find the paper all correct, and will no longer
                  detain you—unless," he added, "you will grant me the favor to step this way a
                  moment." Smith dismounted, and having followed Milford beyond earshot of Andre,
                  the Captain continued: "If not objectionable, Mr. Smith, I should be pleased to
                  know the name of the gentleman accompanying you?"
               "Certainly—Mr. John Anderson."
               "Ha! John Anderson!" repeated the Captain, with a start, instantly recalling the
                  conversation he had held about this personage at the house of Peter Burnside.
                  "So-so," he muttered to himself, "then he was not hung. Strange! But, perhaps the
                  boy lied about the whole affair! Ha! I see it now. The officer alluded to had
                  Anderson's letter, but believed Anderson to be a British spy, at the very time he
                  was playing spy for Arnold. But then, again, who knows but he may be a British
                  spy, deceiving Arnold? I would there were some way to ascertain."
               "Do you know this Mr. Anderson?" inquired Smith, interrupting the Captain's
                  meditations.
               "No, not personally, though his name is somewhat familiar," replied Milford, at
                  the same time running over in his mind his best plan of operations to find out the
                  mystery concerning Anderson—for mystery there undoubtedly was—and prove to his own
                  satisfaction which party, Clinton or Arnold, was the real dupe of his duplicity.
                  "Ah! I have it," he said, mentally. "I must find out all I can from Smith, without
                  letting him suspect my object; and if this is not satisfactory, I will try and
                  detain him over night, and give Paulding a hint to be on the lookout below." This
                  plan being quickly arranged in Captain Milford's active mind, he continued to
                  Smith: "When I say the name is familiar, do not understand me, that I know this
                  John Anderson and the one I have before heard mentioned to be identical—though,
                  for aught I know to the contrary, they may be. But may I inquire what important
                  business takes you down so near the enemy's lines, and induces you and Mr.
                  Anderson to travel so dangerous a road at night? I do not wish to be thought too
                  inquisitive, Mr. Smith; but really, you can not know the perils of the route so
                  well as I, or else your business is indeed of the most pressing nature."
               "You think the road dangerous, then?" queried Smith, in reply.
               "Very dangerous, sir, indeed. The Cow Boys have recently been committing serious
                  depredations, and are now believed to be far up the country. Of late they have
                  leagued in several cases with the Skinners, and only last week I had a brush with
                  them myself. I accidentally heard of a plot to attack and murder an honest farmer
                  and his family, on a certain night; and raising a party, I went down to his
                  protection, and succeeded in killing and capturing nine of the ruffians. What were
                  not killed in the affray, have since been hung; but this, so far from producing a
                  salutary effect upon the others, I believe has only tended to make them worse; for
                  since then they have been more lawless and bloodthirsty than ever. They have
                  murdered several innocent persons already, and I understand, have vowed to be
                  revenged, by taking two lives for one; so you can judge for yourself whether or
                  not it is safe for you to pursue your journey to-night."
               "You certainly do not talk very encouragingly of the prospects ahead," returned
                  Smith, in a tone that showed he felt considerable uneasiness. "But nevertheless,"
                  he continued, after a moment's reflection, "I suppose I shall have to run my
                  chance, for my business admits of little delay."
               "Pardon me, Mr. Smith—but it must be a very pressing emergency that requires you
                  to put your life in such jeopardy."
               "Why, it is rather pressing," replied Smith, hesitatingly. "The fact is, you see,
                  Mr. Anderson and myself are employed by General Arnold to procure intelligence
                  from the enemy, and we expect to meet a person at or near White Plains for this
                  purpose, and any delay on our route might frustrate the interview and cause
                  serious disappointment to all parties."
               "Well, Mr. Smith," returned Milford, "I must say, with all due deference to your
                  judgment, that I do not think the reasons you have given for pursuing your journey
                  to-night, by any means justify the risk of doing so. You will be liable to
                  surprise and capture at any moment, by some gang of marauders; and I hardly need
                  add, after what I have told you, that if so taken, you will be uncommonly
                  fortunate to escape with even life. Now, a few hours, certainly, can make no great
                  difference in this matter; for knowing the danger and difficulty of travelling
                  through such a country as this, your informant, if he gets to the rendezvous
                  before you, will make all due allowance for your tardiness; and therefore I would
                  seriously advise you, as you value your life, to turn back and take lodgings at
                  one Andreas Miller's, whose house you just passed on your way hither. If you have
                  any scruples about seeking lodgings there, I will do the business for you; and as
                  soon as it is daylight, you can set off and pursue your route with comparative
                  safety. Come, what say you?"
               Smith reflected a moment, and then replied that he would consult his
                  fellow-traveler. Returning to Andre, he informed him what Captain Milford had
                  said, and asked what he thought of his suggestion.
               "I am for going on, at all hazards," answered Andre, who, for reasons known to the
                  reader, if not to Smith, preferred the dangers of the road to remaining in such
                  close proximity to the patrolling party of one so prying and vigilant as Captain
                  Milford. "Tell the Captain," he continued, with something of irony in his tone,
                  "that I am greatly obliged to him for his cautious suggestions; but that, knowing
                  my own business best, I must decline accepting his well-meant proposition."
               "But," hesitated Smith, "I can not say, all things considered, that I would like
                  the road overly well to-night myself. It is now hard upon ten o'clock, and will
                  therefore only be some six hours to daybreak; by lying over, resting ourselves and
                  horses, and going by daylight, instead of blundering along in the dark, we shall
                  doubtless make up for lost time, and certainly travel with more safety."
               "Well," rejoined Andre, with some asperity, "no argument will convince me it is
                  better to wait than go forward."
               Smith made no answer to this, but called to Captain Milford; and on that officer's
                  approaching him, said:
               "Mr. Anderson is desirous to get on as expeditiously as possible, and I wish to
                  know which road you think the safest for us to travel."
               "Why, as to that," replied Milford, "I consider neither safe; and though I do not
                  count myself a coward, yet I frankly confess I should not like to ride alone over
                  either to-night. Of the two, however, I should prefer the one through Northcastle;
                  for the Lower Party, or Cow Boys, have recently been out on the Tarrytown road,
                  and committed some serious depredations in that quarter. You will run great risk
                  in taking either road; and I must repeat my advice, that you lie over till
                  daylight—though of course you are at liberty to do as you please."
               "If we push on now," said Smith to Andre, in a tone too low to be overheard by
                  Milford, "the Captain will suspect there is something wrong, and perhaps set a spy
                  to watch us; and as I said before, a few hours can make no great difference,
                  except in our favor." Then turning to Milford: "I shall take your advice, and lie
                  over till morning."
               "You will find it to your advantage, believe me. Shall I accompany you to
                  Miller's?"
               "O, no, I thank you, I will not put you to that trouble."
               No choice was thus left Andre; and accordingly he and Smith and the servant turned
                  their horses' heads in a direction opposite to the course they were pursuing, and
                  bidding the Captain good night, were soon lost in the darkness. Captain Milford
                  watched them out of sight; and then springing over a fence, he crossed and open
                  field of some thirty rods in extent, when he came to a thicket, in the centre of which a fire was burning, and
                  around which were grouped some three or four figures, squatted upon the earth,
                  while several others were lying stretched out on blankets, with their feet toward
                  the flame.
               "Josh!" called out Milford, halting just without the thicket.
               "Here I be, Capting," returned a voice, with the real nasal whine.
               "Come here, then, I wish to speak with you."
               There was a rustling among the bushes, and the next minute our hero of chimney
                  celebrity made his appearance.
               "Wal, what d'ye want?" he said, as he came up to where the other was standing.
                  "Some other darned pokerish expedition, I expect."
               "You are right," returned Milford; "but come with me, and I will tell you as I go
                  along."
               "I knowed it," returned Josh; "I 'spect you think I've got as many lives as a cat
                  has, don't ye, Capting?"
               "I want you," pursued the Captain, in a low tone, without heeding the other's
                  remarks, "to set out immediately for the cross-roads below Teller's Point, find
                  John Paulding, and deliver him a letter."
               "What! to-night?"
               "Yes, this very night; and if he is not there, find out where he is, and take it
                  to him, without delay."
               "Gosh darn it! I've done a lot of things in my life, Capting, that was a great
                  deal agreeabler than this."
               "Doubtless; and you may have to do some, before you die, not so agreeable,"
                  returned the Captain dryly. "It is a dangerous route, I do not deny, and you will
                  have to go afoot."
               "You don't say! thunder and lightning! and I'm as tired as all git out."
               "I should have no objections to your riding, were it safe; but if you ride, you
                  must of course follow the highway; and I scarcely need tell you, that a horse does
                  not move along without noise."
               "That's a fact, Capting, clear as mud."
               "And should any of the free-booters be about," pursued Milford, "the noise of a
                  horse's feet would be likely to attract their attention, and I presume you have no
                  ambition to fall into their hands again."
               "No, I'll be gall-darned if I have!"
               "Therefore, your own feet will be safest," concluded Milford; "for you can either
                  travel the road, or cross the fields, as you choose."
               "Ye-a-s, I see, and a darned nice time I'll have on't. Wal, if I've got to go,
                  I've got to and that's the up-shot on't. Where's the letter, Capting?"
               "That will soon be ready."
               By this time the two had reached the highway; and bidding Josh await his return,
                  the Captain went forward to the little shanty where he had procured a light to
                  read Smith's passport, and after an absence of some five or ten minutes, again
                  made his appearance, and handed Josh a sealed note, saying:
               "Find Paulding, if he is to be found, and give him this missive, and you shall be
                  paid well for your journey in addition to your regular wages. You will be likely
                  to hear of him at Brinslow's, near Pine's Bridge. Here, take these pistols, powder
                  and ball. Away, now, and mind you bring me an answer from Paulding!"
               "I'll do it, or break a tug," said Josh. "Good-by, Capting."
               "Good-by, and may you have a safe journey back! Do not forget to call at
                  Brinslow's, as it is possible Paulding may be there."
               "I shan't forget any thing 'cept 'tis the extra pay," laughed the Yankee, as he
                  disappeared from the Captain's sight.
               "Now, if this Anderson is a British spy," mused Milford, as he walked slowly up
                  the road, "and on his way to New York, as I suspect, he will be likely, after what
                  he heard me say about the Cow Boys, to take the Tarrytown road; and a hint to
                  Paulding, to be on the watch and overhaul him, may somehow lead to an explanation
                  of what I must confess looks to me very mysterious. There may be something more in
                  the hints of that boy than I gave him credit for. He seemed shrewd, and
                  intelligent, and such servants are sometimes ahead of their masters in getting at
                  the truth of a mystery. At all events, there can be no harm in being cautious,
                  vigilant, and prepared for the worst. Strange, he should hint about treason in
                  high places, and then inquire if I knew Anderson's correspondent to be a man of
                  stern integrity! But pshaw! Arnold is above suspicion, though this man may be
                  deceiving him. But speculations avail nothing now, and time perhaps will show;"
                  and with this reflection, Milford turned off and sought his quarters for the
                  night.
               We must now return to our travelers.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               THE CAPTURE.
               AT the house of Andreas Miller, Smith and Andre found a welcome reception; but the
                  host was a man in humble life, with limited means and accommodations, and in
                  consequence our two travelers were obliged to share the same bed. The night proved
                  a troubled one to Andre; for dire forebodings crowded his mind, and deprived him
                  of sleep. All night long he rolled to and fro on his bed, and moaned or paced the
                  floor with an agitated step. It appeared to him that Captain Milford had somehow
                  penetrated his disguise, and had purposely magnified perils to delay his journey,
                  in order to have time to procure an order for his arrest. Every unusual sound he
                  fancied to be the tread of armed men coming to make him prisoner; and he who had
                  never in his life before been guilty of a dishonorable action—even if his
                  interview with Arnold, under the circumstances, could properly be called one—now
                  quaked and quailed like a wretch who had committed some heinous crime, and stood
                  in fear of avenging justice.
               In consequence of Andre's restlessness, Smith had little sleep; and much of the
                  time he lay awake, and, as he afterward averred, wondered what so disturbed the
                  mind of his companion.
               Andre did not undress himself the whole night; and as soon as the first streak of
                  daylight penetrated his humble apartment, he called his companion, and declared
                  himself in readiness to proceed on his journey. The latter immediately dressed
                  himself, aroused his servant, and in a few minutes the horses were at the door.
                  The host, hearing the preparations of his guests for instant departure, also made
                  his appearance, and urged them to delay a short time, and partake of breakfast;
                  but this Andre declined, pleading urgent business below as an excuse. Although
                  warmly pressed to take pay for his hospitality, the host generously refused; and
                  with many thanks for his kindness and trouble, our travelers set off in the gray
                  light of morning.
               The day proved a delightful one, neither too warm nor too cold for comfort, and
                  the morning breeze stole over the romantic hills on their route, and came to our
                  travelers with an invigorating effect. The patrolling guards of Captain Milford
                  were passed without molestation or hindrance; and when he found himself fairly
                  beyond them, on the highway to Pine's Bridge, the spirits of Andre, much to the
                  surprise of Smith, rose in exact proportion to their late depression. He could not
                  as yet look upon himself as safe; but in his view the worst dangers were passed;
                  and as he had gone through these without harm, a bright hope of ultimate
                  deliverance from his perilous undertaking and position made his heart buoyant.
               Crossing one of the head-water branches of the Croton, the party ascended a steep
                  hill; and on reaching its summit, whence a delightful landscape spread before
                  them, Andre turned to Smith, and with a joyful animation of look, speech, and
                  manner, strangely contrasting with his late gloom and taciturnity, suddenly
                  exclaimed:
               "O, what a beautiful scene!—how grand! how soul-inspiring! The sun just rising in
                  all his golden splendor, and pouring his soft light down upon every object, giving
                  each, as it were, a renewed life; yon tranquil Hudson rolling along in quiet
                  beauty, showing the mountains their faces far down the silent depths; and those
                  mountains, proudly lifting their heads far heavenward in the ethereal blue, as if
                  conscious of their greatness and grandeur; and behold here and there a forest,
                  here and there a plain, here and there a valley, here and there a sparkling
                  streamlet, and here and there a farm-house, once the abode of peace and plenty,
                  but now, alas! too often deserted. This only—the lack of the husbandman, with his
                  well-fenced, well-tilled, well-stocked fields—his lowing kine, bleating sheep, and
                  neighing and prancing steeds—these only are wanting to make the picture complete, and enrapture the gaze of an
                  artist. And this desolation comes of war, ruthless war, with its iron heel,
                  gauntlet-hand, and bloody front. Oh! when will it cease, and benign peace repeople
                  such scenes as these, and let all nature smile in the face of happy, contented
                  man? Ah! who can love war for the sake of war, and laud the victor, whose title to
                  fame is written in human blood and widow's tears! and the shouts for whose
                  ensanguined triumph is answered by dying groans and the orphan's wail! And what,
                  after all, are the victories of war, compared to the victories of peace! Is the
                  sword of the warrior to be put on an equality with the poet's pen, the artist's
                  pencil? Is the renown of having been more successful in human butchery than
                  another, to carry the name of the so called hero down to far posterity, along side
                  of his who has uttered great truths, noble thoughts, heaven-inspired wisdom, and
                  left behind him pure, lofty, and deathless creations of the mortal mind? No, no,
                  no! What are the heroes of antiquity, compared with those giant laborers in the
                  field of thought, who saved their names from total oblivion? Mere pigmies beside
                  colossuses—mole-hills beside mountains—planets beside the universe! Then let war
                  be put away from among nations; let arbitration settle all disputes; let standing
                  armies be disbanded; and let the blood-red soldier turn his mind and bend his
                  energies to the useful arts and sciences, and instead of destroying his fellows,
                  seek how he shall benefit mankind; and then will come the great jubilee of the
                  world, and the human mind will then be seen in all that greatness which most
                  nearly approaches the Divinity!
               "Ah! I see, my friend," pursued Andre, "my enthusiasm, after my late taciturnity,
                  surprises you; but the cool, invigorating air of the morning, and the splendid
                  scene before me, have aroused me from my mental stupor, and led me into a train of
                  thought, which ever has had, and ever will have, deepest hold upon my heart's
                  sympathies."
               "I was thinking while you were speaking," replied Smith, gazing admiringly upon
                  his companion, "that you are other than you seem; and that if circumstances have
                  placed you in the counting-house, nature has been foully wronged; for she has
                  given you oratorical powers which should be heard in the senate chamber of a
                  nation."
               "You flatter me beyond my abilities," rejoined Andre, coloring; "I shall never
                  aspire to such a dignity."
               Thus conversing, our two wayfarers rode cheerfully along Andre occasionally giving
                  evidence of possessing a lofty mind, in flashes of eloquence not unlike what we
                  have quoted, and which deeply interested, and sometimes seemed fairly to charm his
                  hearer. Nothing occurred to interrupt their progress, and almost before they were
                  aware of it, they came opposite an humble dwelling, within some two or three miles
                  of Pine's Bridge, when Smith, looking around him, declared that here his journey
                  toward White Plains must end.
               "But we will breakfast together before we part," he added—"that is to say, if we
                  can find any thing to eat. Let us try at this shanty—we may be able to get
                  something to stay our stomachs."
               Accordingly, they rode up to the dwelling before mentioned, which they found
                  occupied by a middle-aged Dutch woman. On inquiring if they could be accommodated
                  with breakfast, the vrow replied,
               "I give you so goot as I got; put the tievlish Cow Boys have been robbing me last
                  night, and dey took away ebery ting so much dat I gives you no more ash pudding
                  and melken."
               "Well, well, good dame, we can do very well on pudding and milk," answered Smith,
                  "so you will only make haste and let us have it, for we are anxious to be on the
                  move."
               "So quick ash der fire heats him," rejoined the other, as she flew about the room
                  making the necessary preparation for our travelers' breakfast.
               After Smith and Andre had satisfied their appetites, the former divided his small
                  stock of Continental scrip with the latter; and having made arrangements by which
                  Smith's horse should be returned or paid for, the two shook hands, and with many
                  well-wishes for each other's safety and happiness, parted—Smith retracing his
                  steps and pursuing the route to Peekskill, and Andre proceeding direct to Pine's
                  Bridge, and thence toward New York.
               A short distance below Pine's Bridge, the road which Andre was traveling forked to
                  the right, and led off to the highlands along the Hudson, and so on to Tarrytown,
                  and this was called the river, or Tarrytown road; while the other continued
                  straight forward, and led direct to White Plains—both having one terminus, namely,
                  New York. When he came to this fork, Andre reined in his horse, and for a moment
                  seemed undecided which route to take; but remembering Captain Milford had said
                  that the Lower Party, or Cow Boys, had been far up the Tarrytown road, he chose
                  this, as being in his view the safest: for the Cow Boys, belonging to the British
                  side, would not be likely to trouble him, when once convinced he was an officer in
                  the royal army. This decision showed the sagacity of Milford in his letter to
                  Paulding—but let us not anticipate.
               The day was delightful, the scenery on all sides beautiful, and Andre, believing
                  himself nearly out of danger, jogged along in good spirits, occasionally turning
                  on his saddle to admire some view more picturesque, romantic, and attractive than
                  the others. At length, about ten or eleven o'clock in the day, he came to a deep
                  dingle, through which flowed a gurgling streamlet of pure, fresh water. He halted
                  here to let his horse drink; and while the animal was thus employed, he looked
                  around; and for the first time since leaving Miller's that morning, a cold shudder
                  passed over him, and he experienced an awful dread of some impending calamity. The
                  dingle was very dark; for large spreading trees, with a dense undergrowth, walled
                  in the path, or road, on either hand, and interlocking branches overhead almost
                  excluded daylight. It was, in fact, just such a place as would make the lonely
                  traveler think of robbery, murder, and all the worst crimes in the calendar; and
                  hardly waiting for his horse to finish drinking, Andre jerked the rein, and
                  spurred him up the opposite steep hill. He had scarcely advanced a half a dozen
                  roads, after reaching its summit; when he heard a rustling in the thicket to his
                  right, saw the bushes violently agitated, and the next moment a man sprang into
                  the road before him, and pointing a loaded musket to his breast, said, sternly:
                  "Halt! or I fire."
               Andre instantly turned pale, reined in his horse, and looked hard at the other a
                  moment, as if to determine what course to pursue—whether to shoot him down, and
                  attempt an escape by flight, or hold a parley with him, and endeavor to get off by
                  milder measures. His decision was soon made; for the next instant two more stout
                  fellows, armed with muskets, entered the road before and behind him, and convinced
                  him that resistance were useless. All three had on round hats, and each wore a
                  gray blouse belted around the waist. Their features were sun-browned, and each had
                  that stern, sullen, dogged expression of countenance, so often seen on persons of
                  the humbler class, when they have resolved upon some bold act, and yet are not
                  exactly convinced in their own minds that their design is justifiable, nor what
                  will be the consequence to themselves if they persist in carrying it out. But the
                  one who first entered the road appeared the most intelligent of the three; and
                  though his look was stern, and his determination seemed inflexible, yet his dark
                  eye had a kindly gleam, and his whole countenance was marked by an expression of
                  frankness, honesty, benevolence, and simplicity. It will only be necessary to add,
                  that this individual was John Paulding; and that his two companions were David
                  Williams and Isaac Van Wart—men in humble life, whose names were made immortal by
                  the very deed we are on the point of recording.
               Scanning each and all with a rapid glance, Andre looked Paulding full in the eye,
                  and said, in a bland tone, and with as much composure as he could assume:
               "I trust, sir, that you, and these gentlemen with you, will do me no harm."
               "Where are you going?" demanded Paulding, in the same stern tone as before.
               "Below," replied Andre.
               "How far below?"
               "Gentlemen," rejoined the Adjutant, evading the question, "I hope you belong to
                  our party."
               "What party?" asked Paulding.
               "The Lower Party."
               "Well, we do—what then?"
               
               "Then I trust it will only be necessary for me to prove to you I am a British
                  officer, out of the country on particular business." He pulled out and exhibited a
                  gold watch, as he spoke, as an evidence of the truth of his assertion—for, at that
                  day, it was a very rare thing to find such an article of luxury in any hands but
                  those of English officers, or English gentlemen. "After this," he added, "I hope
                  you will not detain me a moment."
               "The Captain was right," muttered Paulding to himself; and then, in a harsher tone
                  than ever, and with brows contracted, he said to Andre: "Dismount, sir, at
                  once."
               Andre turned pale as death; he saw he had made a great mistake; but controlling
                  his emotion as much as possible, he said, with a kind of laugh:
               "My God! I suppose a man must do any thing to get along." He then dismounted, and
                  producing Arnold's pass, continued: "Gentlemen, you had better let me go, or you
                  will get yourselves into difficulty; for your stopping me will detain the
                  General's business; and if you know any thing of Arnold, you know he is not one to
                  treat lightly any disrespect offered to his messenger, especially when that
                  messenger has his written guarantee of safety. I am on my way to Dobbs' Ferry,
                  where I expect to meet a person who will give me intelligence of an important
                  nature for General Arnold, and I demand to be released instantly, and allowed to
                  pursue my journey."
               "What's your name?" asked Paulding, looking at the passport.
               "John Anderson," replied Andre.
               "Then what did you say you was a British officer for?"
               "Because you said you belonged to the Lower Party, and I thought that would be the
                  easiest mode of getting past you."
               "Well," returned Paulding, shaking his head doubtfully, "you musn't be offended,
                  Mr. Anderson, at what we are going to do; we don't intend to take any thing from
                  you; but there is so many bad people going about these times, that we have to be
                  on the lookout for everybody. I don't say, mind, that you be one of these
                  characters; but you're a stranger to us, you know; and as you have told so far a
                  crooked story, by your own admission, I feel myself in duty bound to have you
                  searched. Ike, [to one of his companions,] just fasten the gentleman's horse,
                  while me and Dave take him into the bushes here, and make him strip."
               Who can tell the feelings of Andre, who now found himself on the point of
                  exposure, at the very moment when he had felt himself most secure! They must have
                  been terrible, if one might judge by his pale face and ashy lips; but like a brave
                  man, he had resolved to bear his misfortune without complaint, and with true
                  heroism; and as his captors were taking him into the bushes, he merely said:
               "Gentlemen, I trust you will conduct your search with as much forbearance and
                  delicacy as possible."
               "You shan't have any cause to complain on that score," replied Paulding.
               "We're not gentlemen born, as they say in England," chimed in Williams; "but we're
                  not such boors but what we know how to treat a fellow-being with decency. There,
                  this place will do; and now, Mr. Anderson, you may strip as quick as you've a mind
                  to."
               Andre, without a word, proceeded to divest himself of his blue overcoat; then his
                  round hat; next the coat lent him by Smith—which was a deep claret, the buttons
                  and button holes laced with gold tinsel—next his nankeen waistcoat; and lastly,
                  his breeches, which left exposed a flannel waistcoat and drawers, and high
                  top-boots. Each article, as he removed it from his person, he handed in silence to
                  his captors, who proceeded to search them with great care, but of course without
                  making any important discovery.
               "Nothing, so far," said Paulding.
               "Not a stiver," returned Williams.
               "We haint searched the boots," put in Van Wart, who had joined the party.
               "That's true—we must look into them," rejoined Paulding. "Come, Mr. Anderson, will
                  you take them off, or shall we do it for you?"
               "I protest against this unlawful search," answered Andre, in a voice that
                  quavered, in spite of his apparent efforts to be composed.
               "We must do our duties," rejoined Paulding, in a determined manner. "You're
                  suspected of something wrong, Mr. Anderson; but the minute you give full proof of
                  being innocent, you shall be set at liberty. Come, the boots!"
               Andre groaned mentally, and a sudden weakness came over him, as he remembered the
                  awful prediction of Carlini. He had not strength to withdraw the boots himself;
                  but with a resignation bordering on despair, he sat down on a stone, and extended
                  one foot to his captors. Van Wart instantly seized the boot, and drew it from his
                  leg; and while the others were searching it, he proceeded to feel around the foot.
                  Suddenly he exclaimed:
               "Here's papers!"
               "Where?" cried Paulding and Williams, in a breath.
               "Here, next his foot, inside the stocking."
               "Quick! off with it!" said Paulding. The stocking was jerked off with little
                  ceremony, and three folded papers fell to the ground. Paulding seized, opened
                  them, glanced at their contents, and immediately exclaimed:
               "By heavens! he's a spy."
               All now looked at Andre with that peculiar expression with which men of
                  sympathetic feeling regard a fellow being irrevocably doomed, to the law's last
                  and heaviest penalty. Andre was very pale, but apparently calm; and he returned
                  the look of his captors, with the expression of a brave man who knows his fate,
                  and yet feels grateful for the commiseration of those whose duty hurries him to
                  his doom. That silence and exchange of looks was far more solemn and impressive
                  than words; for the language of the heart is ever more powerful than that of the
                  tongue.
               Paulding was the first to break the silence:
               "This is a mighty bad business, Mr. Anderson."
               "Let's search, tother boot," said Van Wart. Andre took this off himself, also the
                  stocking, and handed Paulding three more papers, who, after looking at them,
                  inquired:
               "Any thing more, Mr. Anderson?"
               "That is all, I pledge you may honor as a gentleman," replied Andre."
               "Then you may dress yourself, as quick as you please, for you must go with
                  us."
               As Andre arose, and proceeded to don his garments, Williams said:
               "You're caught in a mighty bad business, Mr. Anderson, and I hardly need tell such
                  as you what'll follow, unless you get away. Now, what'll you give us to let you
                  go?"
               "Any sum of money you may demand," answered Andre, eagerly, his features
                  brightening with a ray of hope.
               "Will you give us your horse, saddle, bridle, pistols, watch, and a hundred
                  guineas besides?"
               "Yes," replied Andre quickly; "and though I have not the money with me, I will
                  send it to any place you may name, even if it be to this very spot, so that you
                  shall be sure to get it."
               "Well, wouldn't you give us more?" pursued Williams.
               "Yes, I will give you any amount of dry goods, and, as I said before, any sum of
                  money you may ask—ay, gentlemen, even though what you demand impoverish me and
                  enrich you," replied Andre; "and I swear to you, by the soul of her I love best,
                  who is now in Heaven! that I will religiously keep my promise, and send the amount
                  agreed upon to any place yourselves may name."
               "No," sternly interposed Paulding, "if you would give us ten thousand guineas, you
                  should not stir one step!"
               Andre's countenance fell. He saw in that look of honest determination there was no
                  hope—that however humble that man before him might be, he possessed a soul above
                  corruption. He sighed, hung down his head, and was silent.
               "Come," pursued Paulding, "hasten and dress yourself, for we must be on the
                  march."
               "Whither will you take me?" asked Andre, dejectedly.
               "Where you'll be safe till you have your trial."
               Andre shuddered, made no reply, but proceeded to don his garments with a haste
                  that betrayed no little agitation.
               "I suppose you'll get away, if you find an opportunity?" said Williams,
                  inquiringly.
               "Yes, I certainly shall," frankly answered Andre.
               "Well, we don't intend to let you have an opportunity," was the chilling
                  response.
               "Look well to your muskets, boys," said Paulding—" see that the priming's in good
                  order." And as each turned down the pan to put in fresh powder, he continued to
                     Andre: "We intend to treat you like
                  a gentleman, so long as you behave decent; but if you attempt to get away by
                  heavens! we'll shoot you down like a dog."
               When Andre had dressed himself, his captors conducted him to the road; and while
                  two of them guarded him, one on either side, the third walked close behind and led
                  the horse. In this manner they set off for Northcastle, the nearest military
                  station.
               For some time the whole party maintained silence, each busy with thoughts of his
                  own. At length Paulding inquired.
               "Is General Arnold concerned in this matter, Mr. Anderson?"
               "That is a very improper question," replied Andre, evasively.
               "Well, I'd like to know if your real name is Anderson?" put in Van Wart.
               "Gentlemen, I am your prisoner," said Andre, with a lofty dignity that was not
                  without its effect upon his captors; "you can command my person, but not my
                  secrets. You are now conducting me, strongly guarded, to deliver me over as a spy
                  to the proper military authorities. Let what you know suffice you for the present;
                  and let me beg of you, as a favor, you will ask me no more questions. Enough, that
                  I now assure you, when brought into the presence of a military commander, I will
                  reveal all."
               The men all looked abashed at this reproof and no more questions were put to their
                  prisoner. In the afternoon of the day of his capture, Major Andre arrived at
                  Northcastle, and, together with all the papers found on his person was delivered
                  over to Lieutenant Colonel Jameson, the commander of that military outpost.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXII.
               FRIGHT OF THE TRAITOR.
               ON examining the treasonable papers given him by Paulding, Colonel Jameson found
                  them to be in the undisguised handwriting of General Arnold; and yet, so far from
                  suspecting the General of any sinister design, he sought Andre for an explanation
                  of the whole affair. This course was certainly a most extraordinary one,
                  considering that hitherto is man had been regarded as possessing common sense.
                  Andre, of course, represented the matter in the most favorable light possible,
                  said that if confronted with Arnold he would make a full explanation, and
                  requested that he might at once be sent to head-quarters. Absurd as was this
                  request, yet Jameson was insane enough, of foolish enough—whichever you please,
                  reader—to grant it. He immediately wrote a note to Arnold, saying, "I send to you,
                  under the charge of Lieutenant Alien and a guard, a certain John Anderson, who was
                  taken while going toward New York. He had a passport, signed in your name, and a
                  parcel of papers, taken from under his stockings, which I think of a very
                     dangerous tendency." Here he gave a description of the papers referred
                  to, and concluded, "These I have reserved and forwarded to General Washington.
               What could be more extravagantly foolish than this, when we take into
                  consideration that Jameson had no sinister motive in so doing? Could not the man
                  foresee that if Arnold were concerned in the plot, he would, of course, attempt
                  and immediate escape? that whether he were or not, it was only right and proper
                  that such a grave affair should have a judicial investigation, and that it was his
                  duty to make all known to the commander-in-chief, and leave him to act? With
                  regard to foresight, some men seem born like moles, and of this class was
                  Jameson.
               As soon as the escort had departed with Andre, Jameson dispatched and express,
                  with the treasonous papers, to meet General Washington, then supposed to be on the
                  road returning from Hartford, where he had been, as the reader knows, to hold an
                  interview with the French Count Rochambeau. But Washington came back by a
                  different route than he went, and, inconsequence, the courier missed him.
               As we design to be brief in touching upon this portion of our true history we can
                  not do better than quote the language of Sparks in his biography of Arnold:
               "At the time when Andre was brought in a prisoner," says the biographer, "Major
                  Tallmage, next in command under Jameson, was absent on duty below White Plains,
                  and did not return till evening. He was filled with astonishment when Jameson
                  related what had happened, and could not refrain from expressing his surprise at
                  the course that had been pursued. To his mind, the case was so clear, or, at all
                  events, was attended by such peculiar circumstances, as not only to justify, but
                  require, prompt, bold, and energetic measures on the part of Jameson. In short, he
                  declared his suspicions of Arnold, and offered to take on himself the entire
                  responsibility of proceeding on that ground. To this idea Jameson would not
                  listen. He was agitated and irresolute at first, but finally refused to sanction
                  any measure which should imply a distrust of Arnold.
               "Failing in this object, Tallmage earnestly requested that the prisoner might be
                  brought back; to which Jameson with some reluctance, consented. As the parties
                  from below had been higher up the country than the post at Northcastle, there was
                  room to apprehend that he might be recaptured; and this was probably the
                  prevailing reason with Jameson for countermanding the order. Strange as it may
                  seem, however, if any thing can seem strange in this string of blunders, he would
                  insist on sending forward the letter he had written to Arnold, as will appear by
                  his order of countermand to Lieutenant Alien.
               "From some circumstances which I have just discovered he wrote to that officer, "I
                  have reason to fear that a party of the enemy is above; and as I would not have
                  Anderson retaken or get away, I desire that you will proceed to Lower Salem with
                  him, and deliver him to Captain Hoogland. You will leave the guard with Captain
                  Hoogland, also, except one man, whom you may take along. You may proceed to West
                  Point, and deliver the letter to General Arnold. You may also show him this, that
                  he may know the reason why the prisoner is not sent on. You will please to return
                  as soon as you can.'"
               The messenger with this letter soon overtook Lieutenant Alien, who, instead of
                  taking Andre to Lower Salem, as directed by Jameson, immediately set out on his
                  return to Northcastle, which post he reached the same night. On beholding the
                  prisoner, Major Tallmage was at once struck with his deportment, which he
                  considered decidedly military, and especially his manner of walking the floor, and
                  turning on his heel; and he expressed to Jameson his conviction that the man had
                  been bred to arms, and that, under the circumstances, he should be kept closely
                  guarded till orders should be received from General Washington, or Arnold. As
                  Northcastle was not so safe a military post as Lower Salem—which, being farther
                  inland, was less exposed—it was accordingly decided that Andre should be conducted
                  thither forthwith. In his consultation with Jameson, Tallmage, remembering the
                  letter he had some days before received from Arnold concerning one John Anderson,
                  could not avoid a strong suspicion of the General; and he so expressed himself to
                  Jameson; but the latter refused to credit there being anything wrong in that
                  quarter, and still insisted that the letter which Lieutenant Alien had brought
                  back should be sent forward.
               Finding he could do nothing with Jameson as regarded Arnold, Tallmage determined
                  that Andre, at least, should not escape; and so he set off with him to Salem. On
                  the arrival of Andre at this place, he was introduced to a Mr. Bronson, who was
                  attached to Sheldon's regiment, and who occupied a small apartment, which he
                  consented to share with the prisoner Andre at first was in nowise talkative; but
                  after having rested a while, and procured a change of a portion of his garments
                  from his room mate, he relaxed into familiar conversation, and even proceeded to
                  make a ludicrous sketch on paper of he escort and himself, which he handed to
                  Bronson, saying.
               "This will give you an idea of the style in which I have had the honor to be
                  conducted to my present abode."
               Sometime after this, knowing that all hope of being sent to Arnold must be
                  abandoned, he resolved to throw off his disguise, and stand forth in his true
                  colors. Accordingly, he sat down and wrote a letter to Washington, disclosing his
                  real name, rank, and intentions, and begged to be treated as a gentleman and
                  British officer. Without mentioning the name of Arnold, he stated that he had come
                  up the river for the purpose of meeting a person on the neutral ground, in order
                  to obtain important intelligence; that, unknown to himself at the time, he had
                  been drawn within the American can
                  lines; as also what course he had pursued to get back to New York, and how he had
                  been arrested by volunteers. This letter, which, had we space, we would give
                  verbatim, was signed by Andre with his real name, and handed open to Major
                  Tallmage, who perused it with astonishment. He had previously, as the reader
                  knows, come to the conclusion that the prisoner had been bred to arms; but he had
                  no idea he was a personage of such rank and importance.
               Having stripped himself of all disguise, and frankly confessed the business on
                  which he had been engaged, Andre felt greatly relieved in mind, and grew so
                  cheerful and entertaining, that he won the regard of all who formed his
                  acquaintance. We must now leave him, and follow up events in another quarter.
               We left Smith going up the river. The same day he parted with Andre, he returned
                  to his family at Fishkill; but on his way he called on Arnold, and informed him
                  where he had quitted the person called Anderson. This greatly relieved the mind of
                  the General, who believed that Andre would get safety to New York, and
                  consequently that he had nothing more to fear. It has been stated that the express
                  sent off to Washington missed him, on account of the General having taken a
                  different route back than was expected; and the reader has seen that the letter
                  dispatched to Arnold from Jameson, met with a delay, by reason of the return of
                  Lieutenant Allen.
               We must now repair to General Arnold's head-quarters, at Robinson's house. It is
                  the second morning since the capture of Andre, and yet the General has heard
                  nothing of his misfortune, and is, at the moment introduced, secretly
                  congratulating himself that he is safe within the British lines. The servants of
                  Arnold are busy preparing breakfast, Mrs. Arnold is superintending the domestic
                  affairs within, the aids of the General have strolled out for a short walk, to
                  catch the invigorating breath of morning, and he himself is slowly walking up and
                  down the piazza, with a limping gait, and thinking how soon he will exchange his
                  solitary residence in the country for one of life in the gay city, and his command
                  of half-paid, half-starved rebels, for that of the well-paid, well-fed soldiers of
                  King George. Suddenly his attention is attracted to a baggage wagon, which turns
                  up to the mansion, accompanied by three men, and filled with trunks. One of the
                  men, separating from the others, approaches him, and doffing his hat, makes a
                  respectful salute.
               "Well," said Arnold, sternly, "what is your business?"
               "So please your excellency," replied the man, bowing, "this is the baggage of
                  General Washington and suite."
               "Ha! so he has come at last? I am glad to hear it; but he is two days behind his
                  time; I expected him on Saturday; where is he now?"
               "I left him at Fishkill, your excellency, and he desired me to say he would be
                  here to breakfast."
               "At Fishkill? you mean Peekskill?"
               "No, your excellency, he returned by the upper road, and staid last night at
                  Fishkill. He did intend to lodge here, and set out from Fishkill before night to
                  come down; but on the way he met the French minister and went back."
               "Who is with him?"
               "General Knox, General Lafayette, Colonel Hamilton, Colonel Tilghman, Colonel
                  Lamb—"
               "There, that will do, my man," interrupted Arnold. "You may take the baggage into
                  the hall, and—but never mind, I will attend to it myself;" and as the other bowed
                  and withdrew, he entered the house.
               In a few minutes he came out again, and for the best, part of an hour continued to
                  walk up and down the piazza.
               "Well, Varick," he said, as one of his said now approached the house, "where is
                  your companion?"
               "Just below here, General; shall I call him?"
               "You may as well inform him that General Washington will breakfast with us, and I
                  expect him and suite every moment; so he had better not stroll away, for the meal
                  is now ready, and we shall sit down immediately the company arrives."
               Major Varick departed, but soon returned, accompanied by Major Franks. As they
                  drew near the mansion, two officers dashed up the road, and exchanging salutes
                  with the General's aids, drew up before the General himself. These were Hamilton
                  and Tilghman.
               "Ah! good morning, gentlemen," said Arnold, blandly. "A fine morning for a ride;
                  good air—excellent—but where are the rest of our friends?"
               "Why, his excellency, General Washington, has just ridden down to examine the
                  redoubts on this side the river," replied Hamilton; "and the rest of his suite,
                  save ourselves, keep him company. He bade us ride forward and say to General
                  Arnold, that as he should be some time detained, the breakfast had better not
                  wait."
               "Ah! just like our commander-in-chief," rejoined Arnold; "always business before
                  pleasure; and oftentimes, as in the present instance, business before eating.
                  Well, then, we will to breakfast. Come, gentlemen, leave your horses in charge of
                  the baggage-men, and we will sit down to our repast without further delay. This
                  way, gentlemen;" and Arnold passed into the mansion, followed by his own and
                  Washington's aids.
               The new-comers were introduced to Mrs. Arnold, and all sat down to the morning's
                  meal. Arnold himself did the honors of the table, and seemed in fine spirits.
                  Every thing went off pleasantly, and the meal was nearly finished, when one of the
                  servants announced a messenger with a letter for the General.
               "Bring it here," said Arnold.
               The letter was brought, and, without rising from his seat, Arnold proceeded to
                  break it open and read it in the presence of company; it was the long-delayed
                  missive of Jameson; and the first words his eye fell upon, showed the traitor that
                  his scheme of treason was detected, and that Andre was a prisoner. He turned pale
                  as death, and for a moment exhibited great agitation. There was no time to be
                  lost, for his neck might be in the halter at any moment. Controlling his emotions
                  with a powerful effort, he said, in a low tone:
               "Gentlemen, I must beg you to excuse me. My presence is immediately required at
                  West Point. When General Washington arrives, inform him that I have been suddenly
                  called over the river, but will return soon. William,[to one of his blacks] saddle
                  my horse, and bring him to the door without delay."
               Arnold then quitted the room, sought his chamber, and sent for his wife. As Mrs.
                  Arnold entered his apartment, he shut the door quickly, locked it, and then said,
                  with great rapidity, while the muscles of his face fairly quivered with
                  excitement:
               "I have no time to mince matters. We are about to part, perhaps never to meet
                  again, I have been concerned in a plot of treason, which is detected, and my life
                  now depends on my reaching the Vulture."
               "Oh! my God! my God!" shrieked Mrs. Arnold, in terror.
               "Hush! or you will alarm the house! Farewell" and the traitor turned back the bolt
                  of the door to fly. As he did so, he heard a heavy fall on the floor. He looked
                  around, and saw the partner of his bosom lying lifeless at his feet. Whether
                  living or dead, he had no time to examine. "Poor thing!" he groaned—"poor thing!"
                  and hurried down stairs. "Your mistress is ill," he said to a servant as he passed
                  through the house; "attend to her instantly." The next moment he was outside. The
                  servant had not yet brought his horse, but one belonging to Varick stood saddled,
                  and hitched to a post by the door. There was no time for idle ceremony. Jerking
                  the rein loose, he mounted in haste, and the next moment was dashing away toward
                  the river. There he found a boat ready, manned by six oarsmen. Dismounting, and
                  giving his horse his freedom, he sprang into the boat, saying: "Push out, men! row
                  for the center of the stream;" and as the boatmen, knowing nothing of his sinister
                  intentions, obeyed him, he continued: "I want you, men, to row me to the Vulture
                  with all speed. I am going with a flag, and bear important dispatches, and am in
                  great haste to return; as I expect to meet General Washington at my house. Now,
                  pull up, boys, let us see what you can do in the way of aquatic exercise, and you
                  shall have two gallons of run as soon as I return."
               The men sprang to with energy, the oars bent with their strength, and the boat
                  process rapidly down the stream. We will not attempt to describe the feelings of
                  the traitor on that guilty flight; but it must have been one of intense agony—not
                  of remorse, but fear— for every moment
                  he trembled lest he should hear a military summons for the men to land the boat
                  and deliver him up to justice. Time sped, and every minute he became more secure.
                  At length he came in sight of King's Ferry, and his heart almost died within him.
                  Could he pass this, he would be comparatively safe; but he feared lest Washington,
                  having got news of his treachery and flight, had sent a messenger here before him.
                  He would soon know; and taking a white handkerchief from his pocket, he held it
                  up, and let it flutter in the breeze. Colonel Livingston saw it, and supposing the
                  boat a flag-boat, sent down in haste, did not order it to land. Joy to the
                  traitor! A little more time, and he would be safe. The Vulture was just in sight,
                  at the lower end of the bay; he had only to reach that, and all fear of the halter
                  would be at an end. He urged the men to do their utmost, and the boat sped over
                  the waters. Nearer, nearer, and more near it drew to the Vulture, and the spirits
                  and hopes of Arnold rose in proportion. At last the boat ran along side, and
                  Arnold, mounting to the deck, ordered the men to follow him. Inquiring for Captain
                  Sutherland, he was shown into the cabin, where he found that officer, into the
                  cabin, where he found that officer, to whom he at once made himself known, and
                  conveyed the startling intelligence that Andre was a prisoner. He then called down
                  the leader of the boatmen, and in a haughty, overbearing tone, said: "Sir, you and
                  all your fellows are prisoners."
               "What do you mean, General Arnold?" replied the man, with spirit. "Didn't we come
                  aboard with a flag of truce?"
               "That makes no difference, insolence!" returned the traitor, savagely. "I tell
                  you, you are all prisoners; and by —! not one of you shall quit his Majesty's
                  vessel."
               "I appeal to you, Captain," said the man, turning to Sutherland. "I came on board
                  with a flag of truce, and consequently have a right to depart. Do you detain
                  me?"
               "Why, I do not wish to interfere with General Arnold's arrangements," replied the
                  Captain; "but I will grant you leave, on parole, to go ashore and get such things
                  as you and your companions may want; and doubtless when you get to New York, Sir
                  Henry will discharge you."
               "Such proved to be the case. Sir Henry, like a man of honor and a gentleman,
                  afterward set them all at liberty. We have recorded this incident, merely to show
                  the low, little, despicable meanness of Benedict Arnold, in retaining as prisoners
                  the very men who, by their manly exertions, had just saved his neck from the
                  halter.
               Let us now return to Washington.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               WASHINGTON AT ROBINSON'S HOUSE.
               WITHIN half an hour after the flight of the traitor, Washington, having finished
                  his inspection of the redoubts, arrived at Arnold's head-quarters with his suite.
                  Major Franks and Varick, as the representatives of the absent General, met the
                  party, and gave them a cordial welcome, stating that some pressing business had
                  called Arnold over the river, but that he would soon return.
               "Ah! so he has gone over to West Point?" said Washington. "Well, as I wish to
                  visit the works there, I will make a hasty breakfast, cross over, and meet him.
                  Come, gentlemen, don't let us stand on ceremony;" and he immediately led the way
                  into the house. "Where is your mistress?" he inquired of one of the servants.
               "She's taken suddenly ill, your excellency, and can't come down."
               
                  I am sorry to hear it. I hope nothing serious?"
               "I don't know, your excellency, she seems very bad."
               "The breakfast is ready, your excellency," said another servant, approaching.
               "Come, gentlemen, and sit down;" and the commander-in-chief immediately took his
                  place at the head of the table.
               The meal was a hurried one, and passed off in silence. As soon as Washington had
                  finished, he arose, and merely saying to Colonel Hamilton, "You will remain here
                  till we return, which I trust will be in time for dinner," he proceeded at once to
                  the river, accompanied by all the others.
               Here Arnold's barge was in waiting; and stepping into it, with his suite,
                  Washington, ordered the men to row them over to West Point, which was a mile or
                  two above on the opposite side. As the boat gained the middle of the stream, every
                  one looked around with delight. The river was narrow, calm, and deep; and on
                  either side steep mountains rose far heavenward, and in some places almost
                  overhung the dark glassy waters, which gave back, with all the minuteness of
                  nature, their rugged and romantic forms. To the right, some distance up the
                  mountain, and half-buried in the checkered foliage of autumn, could be seen the
                  mansion they had just quitted; while forward to the left, among the rocks, and
                  retreating up another mountain, the redoubts of West Point were visible, with the
                  impregnable Fort Putnam towering high above, and crowning the whole. The scenery
                  here, in every point of view, was truly grand and majestic; and as the barge
                  glided smoothly over the still water, with a faint pleasing ripple under her light
                  prow, Washington cast his eyes around, and with cheerful animation, said:
               "Well, gentlemen, I am glad, on the whole, that General Arnold has gone before us;
                  for we shall now have a salute; and the roaring of the cannon will have a fine
                  effect among these mountains."
               "Ay," returned Lafayette, "every salute fired here will be a dozen; and we shall
                  have a double welcome, in being greeted both by art and nature—for if echo has a
                  home, it must be here."
               The boat glided on, but no cannon was heard. Nearer and nearer it drew to West
                  Point; but still all remained quiet. And to the surprise of all, no one was seen
                  moving about, and no preparations for receiving such distinguished visitors were
                  apparent.
               "What is the meaning of this?" said Washington, with a look of displeasure. "Do
                  they not intend to salute us? are we not to be received with the respect due to
                  our rank?"
               The boat now headed to the shore, and at this moment an officer was espied wending
                  his way among the rocks down the hill. He reached the foot of the acclivity just
                  as the barge grated on the beach; and on perceiving who were its occupants, he
                  started, and his face grew scarlet with confusion.
               "Pardon me, your excellency, and gentlemen," he said; "had I known of your coming,
                  I should have been prepared to give you a different reception; but being taken
                  wholly by surprise, as I am, I trust you will excuse my apparent neglect, and also
                  my not having put the garrison into a suitable condition for a review."
               "How is this, sir?" exclaimed Washington, in surprise; "is not General Arnold
                  here?"
               "No, your excellency," replied the commandant of West Point—for such the officer
                  proved to be—"the General is not here, nor have I seen him for the last two
                  days."
               "This is most extraordinary," rejoined Washington, his astonishment increasing.
                  "We were told he had crossed the river, and that we should find him here. How is
                  this, Varick?"
               "Such was the statement he made on leaving," answered that officer.
               "It is as I tell your excellency," said the commandant.
               "No one doubts your word, sir," rejoined the commander-in-chief. "Arnold is not
                  here, and his absence is inexplicable. However, our visit must not be in vain.
                  Since we have come, though unexpected, we must look round a little, and see in
                  what state things are with you. Lead the way, commandant! Come, gentlemen;" and
                  the whole party set off up the hill.
               It was nearly four o'clock in the afternoon when General Washington and his suite
                  returned to Robinson's house. As they landed at the foot of the mountain, and
                  began to ascend by a winding path to the mansion, Colonel Hamilton was perceived
                  coming toward them with a quick step, while his countenance betrayed anxiety and
                  alarm.
               "What can have happened?" said Washington to Lafayette, who was walking by his
                  side. "Do you not see that Hamilton is very much agitated?"
               "He seems so," replied the Marquis, "and his face is very pale."
               "Well, what now?" asked Washington, anxiously, as the Colonel came within speaking
                  distance.
               "Something for your private ear, General."
               "Let us to the house then, at once;" and quickening his pace, the commander-in-chief separated from the other officers,
                  and walked alongside of Hamilton, without speaking, till both entered the mansion.
                  Hastening to a private room, the General closed the door, and then said: "Well,
                  sir? well, sir?"
               "General Arnold is a traitor!" replied Hamilton, abruptly.
               "Ha!" exclaimed Washington, with a start, "what proof have you of the charge?"
               "These, your excellency," rejoined the other, presenting the papers taken from
                  Andre's boots, and also the letter written by Andre himself.
               A heavy frown gathered on the noble brow of Washington, as he threw his eye
                  rapidly over each, and there was a slight agitation of the muscles around the
                  mouth.
               "When were these brought in?" he demanded, in a stern but even tone of voice.
               "A few minutes before your excellency's arrival," answered Hamilton. "As they were
                  represented to be of the utmost importance, I ventured to break them open."
               "But why so much delay? Jameson's note is dated the twenty-third—this is the
                  twenty-fifth—two days."
               "Why, your excellency, it seems that the express dispatched to meet you took the
                  lower road to Hartford, which he followed till he learned your excellency had
                  returned by the upper. He then came back to Lower Salem, where Major Andre now is,
                  and thus became the bearer of his letter also. But what is more strange, your
                  excellency, it seems that Jameson dispatched a note to Arnold, telling him his
                  confederate was captured, and that reached him this morning, which accounts for
                  his hasty departure."
               "I see it all now," almost groaned Washington, pressing one hand to his temple.
                  "Oh! Hamilton, this is trying! this is trying! to fight a powerful enemy with such
                  rank treason in the camp. But how do you explain Jameson's conduct, Colonel? is he
                  in the plot, too?"
               "I think not, General; for had he been in the plot, he would not have forwarded
                  your excellency these papers, and would have managed to give his prisoner liberty;
                  but his peculiar conduct I cannot explain, only by supposing that he did not look
                  upon Arnold as a traitor, and thought there was some design of the enemy to ruin
                  his character."
               "You may be right," replied Washington: "but his strange misconception and
                  egregious folly are almost tantamount to an over act. Arnold has fled to the
                  enemy, of course; but it is possible he may have met with some unforeseen delay.
                  Mount, Colonel, and ride in all haste to Verplank's Point, and tell Colonel
                  Livingston to let no boat pass. Arrest the traitor, if possible—if not, take such
                  steps for the preservation of the country as, in your judgment, the emergency
                  demands, and report to me as soon as you have done. We know not how many are in
                  the plot, nor on whom we can rely—therefore, be active, discreet, and vigilant. It
                  is a heavy blow, to come at this time—but we must strive to ward it. There,
                  go."
               Hamilton, without a word, quitted the room, and ordering his horse in haste,
                  mounted and rode swiftly away. Washington remained behind for a moment or two,
                  buried in thought. His brow was clouded, and his features looked troubled; but
                  soon the whole countenance resumed its naturally calm, serene aspect; and with his
                  wonted slow, firm, dignified step, he made his appearance in the sitting-room.
                  Here he found all the officers assembled, awaiting his appearance; and beckoning
                  Lafayette and Knox to follow him, he returned to the same apartment where he had
                  held the interview with Hamilton; and as he closed the door, said, without the
                  least visible agitation in manner or speech:
               "Gentlemen, I have most distressing intelligence to communicate. General Arnold
                  has been detected in a plot of treason, and has fled to the enemy." Both officers
                  gave a start of astonishment, and looked inquiringly at their commander-in-chief,
                  who merely handed them the proofs, and added: "There, read for yourselves."
               "Oh! this is terrible!" exclaimed the Marquis, after having hastily glanced over
                  the different papers.
               "The villain!" ejaculated Knox.
               "Whom can we trust now?" said Washington, almost mournfully.
               Some further conversation took place, relative to the steps to be taken to prevent
                  the plot from succeeding; and then requesting the officers with him not to divulge
                  the secret to any one, Washington led the way back to the sitting-room, where he
                  made several trivial remarks to the gentlemen there present, as though his mind
                  were perfectly at ease.
               "How is your mistress?" he inquired of a servant, who was passing in haste.
               "She is very bad, your excellency," whispered the domestic. "She's raving, sir,
                  and keeps a calling for you."
               "For me?" returned the General, in surprise; "why did you not tell me sooner? But
                  no matter; I will see her now; lead the way;" and Washington followed the servant
                  to Mrs. Arnold's chamber.
               Here he became involved in a scene calculated to unman a stoic, and unstring the
                  nerves of the bravest. Mrs. Arnold—her lovely features deadly pale, and marked
                  with strong emotion; her bright eyes gleaming strangely and wildly; her dress
                  disordered; her hair disheveled, and falling in heavy masses around her neck and
                  shoulders—was seated in a chair, with her infant in her arms, clasped to her
                  breast, and she was swaying to and fro, and moaning piteously. On perceiving who
                  had entered the room, she started up hurriedly, and advanced a step or two toward
                  Washington. Then stopping suddenly, she drew herself up to her full height, and
                  glaring upon him with the ferocity of a maniac, exclaimed:
               "So you have come at last, General Washington, here, to face me in my own
                  apartment? They told me villains were cowards, and I did not think you would thus
                  venture in the open light of day. But they lied—villains are not all cowards—else
                  why are you here?"
               "Be calm, Mrs. Arnold," said Washington, soothingly. "Pray sit down, and be calm!
                  I would not injure you for the world."
               "Not me—oh, no, not me—ha, ha, ha! You told no lie there, General; you would not
                  harm me, I know; but you would kill my child. Ha! ha! you start—you see I know.
                  Yes you would kill my child—my poor little innocent child, who never did any body
                  wrong. Yes, I have heard all about it—it is a horrible plot you have concocted to
                  murder this little innocent. My God! perhaps you have come now to do your
                  butcher-work! But you shall not—you shall not!" she fairly shrieked, straining the
                  child closer to her bosom and retreating to the farther part of the room.
                     "Oh no—you shall not harm it. Stab me, if
                     you like—send my soul to its Maker—but
                     touch not the child! Oh! harm it not!" she continued,
                  softening her tone to one of earnest pleading: "harm it not! harm it not! it never
                  did you wrong. See! see! the little innocent smiles in your face—it is so sweet,
                  so gentle!" and she fell to kissing it, and to weeping.
               "My dear madam," said Washington, much affected, "neither you nor your child have
                  any thing to fear from me; so I pray you be calm."
               "Ah! kind sir, good sir, I knew you would be gentle, and relent toward the
                  unfortunate," replied the lonely mother, again coming forward, smiling through her
                  tears, and taking the seat she had vacated on the General's entrance. "Yes, I knew
                  you would be kind, for you are the great General Washington, of whom even his
                  enemies speak in praise. You are he men call the Father of his Country
                     and I know you would not wrong one of your children. Is it
                  not a beautiful babe, sir?"
               "A sweet little child, madam."
               "So like its father." Here a shriek of anguish indescribable interrupted the word
                  that brought back to the poor wife a full sense of all her misery. "Oh! what was I
                  about to utter!" she continued, wildly. "Look like its father! Oh Heaven! be
                  merciful, and change it to some hideous monster, rather than
                     have it wear the face that will doom it to undying infamy!
                  Here, sir, here, sir—take and kill it—kill it in its innocence—and spare it no
                  misery which must be its portion else! Its father is a criminal; he will die on
                  the gallows; and the world, unsatisfied with this revenge will heap insult on the
                  child, and shun it as a viper—ay, worse, worse than a viper, the child of a
                  traitor! Me the world may scorn, may deride, despise, hoot at,
                  and insult in every possible form—I can bear it; but oh it
                  tears my heart-strings to think such a destiny is in store for this little
                  innocent;" and she again fell to weeping and moaning in the most heart-touching
                  manner, occasionally ejaculating: "Poor child! God protect thee! it was wrong for
                  thy father to treat thee so! he should have been true to his country, and his God,
                  for thy sake, if not for his own."
               
               It was a trying scene to Washington, to witness so young, beautiful, accomplished,
                  and apparently innocent a wife and mother, bewailing the sad fate of herself and
                  child, brought on by the infamous deeds of one in whom he himself had reposed
                  confidence, but to whom he must henceforth be an implacable enemy, and should he
                  be taken, must, as his judge, doom to the halter. He felt the delicacy of his
                  position, and how impotent were words to heal the wounds of a heart so lacerated;
                  and he took the first favorable opportunity of with-drawing from a spectacle so
                  afflicting.
               When he again entered the sitting-room, there was nothing in his look, speech, or
                  manner to imply that any thing unusual had occurred to disturb his equanimity.
                  Dinner being announced, he merely said:
               "Come, gentlemen, since Mrs. Arnold is unwell, and the General is absent, let us
                  sit down without ceremony."
               This self-possession, and wonderful command of his feelings, were among the
                  remarkable traits of this great man. Where others would have appeared excited and
                  indignant, he preserved his dignity and evenness of temper. Yet the reader must
                  not suppose him indifferent, or that his feelings were not tried as other men; nor
                  must he attribute his slow, calm movements to any lack of energy, or want of
                  decision. From the very first he had decided upon his course; but haste or
                  agitation would betray something wrong and excite suspicion; and what this might
                  effect it was impossible to tell, since he knew not how many, nor whom, might be
                  concerned in Arnold's plot. It was necessary for him to be discreet and composed;
                  and in exercising this great self-command, he showed not only his wisdom, but his
                  superiority, in rising equal to any emergency.
               When dinner was over, Washington arose, and with Lafayette and Knox, retired to a
                  private room. Here a consultation was held and letters written and dispatched to
                  the different military posts throughout the American lines. Haste was enjoined
                  upon every courier; and such was the exertions made by each, that by midnight
                  every mission was executed.
               At midnight that night, Andre was summoned from his bed, to be escorted to General
                  Arnold's late headquarters. The night was dark and dismal, and the rain fell in
                  torrents It was a gloomy journey.
               At midnight that night, a party of armed soldiers, with fixed bayonets, and
                  commanded by a French officer, burst into the room where Smith was sleeping with
                  his wife, and ordered him to dress without a word, and follow them. He obeyed, and
                  was also conducted through the cold, chilling rain to Washington's present
                  quarters.
               At midnight that night, the roll of the drum was heard in the American encampment
                  at Tappan, the soldiers sprang from their beds to arms, and the left wing of the
                  army was put in motion, and marched through darkness, mud, and rain, to King's
                  Ferry.
               Before the morning dawned, every officer, in every section of the country, had
                  received his orders, and was hastening to obey them.
               And all this was the work of the great commander of the American forces.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               WASHINGTON AT HEAD-QUARTERS.
               WE are aware that we have deviated from the rules which should govern every
                  novelist, in so long neglecting many of our most important characters; but we must
                  plead, in extenuation, that we have been recording facts, which in themselves
                  possess so much of dramatic plot and incident, that we could not think of casting
                  them aside and substituting fiction. Every one, we premise, has heard of Arnold's
                  treason, and Andre's capture and untimely end; but, at the same time, the very
                  fewest number have traced out, one by one, the machinations and incidents of that
                  damnable plot, whose timely detection saved our beloved country from total ruin,
                  and consigned to an ignominious death one of the brightest and noblest spirits
                  that ever adorned the British army. Major John Andre was a victim of
                  circumstances. Possessing genius of a high order, a disposition the most amiable,
                  a soul above every mean and base action, accomplishments the most rare, he went
                  through life beloved by all that knew him. Even the very act that doomed him to
                  the gallows, was looked upon by all as justifiable in him, save so far as the
                  rigorous policy of war required that he should be made a startling example, to
                  deter others from a like attempt. While Arnold, by every act of his, was damning
                  himself as a dastardly traitor—Andre, in aiding his conspiracy, was only zealously
                  serving his king. There can be no parallel drawn of either their deeds or motives.
                  All stratagems in war, to gain a decided advantage, are granted as fair in the
                  most strict codes of honor—the parties of whatever venture is made, of course
                  abiding the consequences, if apprehended by the enemy. Andre made his venture, was
                  detected, and the penalty of his detection, not his
                     crime, followed; for no one can denominate that as crime, which is
                  sanctioned by custom in every commander, of every army, in every portion of the
                  world. Pure and noble-minded as was Washington himself, he did not scruple to have
                  his secret agents, his spies, of whom to obtain important intelligence of the
                  enemy's design; nor did he look upon these agents in any other light than as brave
                  men, perilling their all in the cause of their country, without any hope of
                  reward, beyond a satisfied conscience. Andre was himself an agent of Sir Henry
                  Clinton; nor did he in his negociations with Arnold once feel that his own honor
                  was being compromised, however much, in his own heart, he might have despised the
                  man with whom he was dealing. One question, by way of illustration, and we have
                  done—though, candidly, we can not think that the conduct of poor Andre requires
                  even this justification at our hands, to induce the reader to regret his fate. Had
                  a British officer made an overture to Washington, to surrender to him, for a
                  consideration, an important military post, does any one suppose he would, on the
                  ground of honor, have rejected the proposition?—and had he deputed Colonel
                  Hamilton to settle the preliminaries, would any one regard Hamilton as in the
                  least debased by obeying the order or request of his commander-in-chief?
                  Recollect, then, that what Colonel Hamilton's position in such an event would have
                  been, Major Andre's was; and hence the sympathy that was felt for him in every
                  circle throughout the land, among his enemies as well as among his friends.
               The reader must suppose several days to have elapsed since the closing events of
                  the foregoing chapter. In the meantime, the Vulture has gone down to New York,
                  bearing the treacherous General to his new friends, with the intelligence of the
                  failure of his scheme, and the capture of Andre. The wife of the traitor, hearing
                  of the safety of her husband, and having become more composed, has gone with her
                  infant to visit her friends in Philadelphia, prior to her joining the father of
                  her child in New York. Andre has been removed from West Point to Tappan, the
                  headquarters of the American army, has gone through his examination before the
                  board of general officers, and this is their report:
               "First, that Major John Andre came on shore from the Vulture sloop-of-war in the
                  night, on an interview with General Arnold, in a private and secret manner.
               "Secondly, that he changed his dress within our lines, and under a feigned name,
                  and in a disguised habit, passed our works at Stony and Verplank's Point; was
                  taken at Tarrytown, in a disguised habit, being then on his way to New York; and
                  when taken, he had in his possession several papers which contained intelligence
                  for the enemy.
               "These facts being established, it is our undivided and unanimous opinion, that
                  Major John Andre ought to be considered as a spy, and as such, according to the
                  law and usage of nations, to suffer death."
               Washington had convened this board of officers—which consisted of six
                  major-generals and eight brigadiers, of whom General Greene was chosen
                  president—not as a court-martial, but to examine into the case of Andre, report
                  facts, and express their opinion as to what should be done with him. And the
                  foregoing is the report they brought him, which he subsequently transmitted to Sir
                  Henry Clinton, and on which he acted, not as his inclination, but as duty
                  prompted.
               It was about nine o'clock in the evening of the second day following the
                  examination of Andre, and in a private room of a house, known as head-quarters, in
                  the little village of Tappan, the commander-in-chief of the American army was
                  seated. The room was a very plain one, and was very meager of furniture. A table stood before the General
                  covered with papers and documents, and a wax-candle, burning in an iron stick,
                  partially lighted the apartment, and gave a bold relief to his pale, calm, noble
                  features. His countenance was grave and thoughtful, and a close observer might
                  have detected a look of care, grief, and anxiety; though every lineament was
                  perfectly tranquil, and nothing indicating passion was any where apparent. His
                  head was uncovered, and his venerable hair, brushed back from the temples and
                  forehead, exposed that broad, high, massive brow, which contributed so much to the
                  majesty of his lofty bearing. In his hand he held a paper, which he was perusing
                  slowly and thoughtfully; and when he had finished, he turned to the only occupant
                  of the apartment beside himself, who was seated at a little distance from him, and
                  said:
               "This is indeed a trying crisis, my lord. No one, I think, will deny, that since
                  the war began, I have had many a moment of deep affliction, of dark despondency;
                  yet, sir, I have had very few so trying as the present. Evils that come upon us in
                  the natural course of events, we strive to bear up against and remedy; but when we
                  find our friends, those in whom we have reposed all confidence, suddenly deserting
                  us, the heart receives a shock from which it is very hard to recover. We know not
                  then where or how to seek remedy; we become suspicious, which makes us isolated;
                  we know not whom to trust, nor with whom to counsel. Like the mariner without his
                  compass, we have no guide on which we can rely; and we act upon a venture, fearing
                  every thing we do is wrong; that instead of extricating ourselves from our
                  difficulties, every step we take may be plunging us into others—that we may be
                  steering a course directly opposite to the haven we would reach."
               "What your excellency says is too true," replied the Marquis of Lafayette,—for he
                  it was to whom the commander-in-chief addressed himself.
               "Now that Arnold is gone," pursued Washington, "and his plot detected, I feel that
                  such a man may well be spared from among us; for he was always rash, and always
                  getting into difficulty; but I am uneasy lest he has seduced better men into his
                  vile scheme. For instance, in this intercepted paper, I find the name of one of
                  our major-generals used in such a connection as to fasten upon him suspicion. It
                  may be a trick of the enemy, to cause disaffection in our army, and loss of
                  confidence in one another; and it may be founded on reality; and here lies the
                  difficulty, we cannot say which."
               "I see but one way to settle the matter," replied the Marquis; "and that is to
                  send another spy into the enemy's camp, and let him confer with those already
                  there."
               "In that opinion I concur, my lord, and am even now taking steps for so doing. And
                  I still have another object in view, which it is possible may be effected at the
                  same time. I allude to the recovery of the traitor."
               "Indeed, your excellency!"
               "Yes; if Clinton will not give him in exchange for Andre—and I shall know whether
                  he will or not on the return of Greene, whom I expect every moment—I have thought
                  of a bold device of having him seized in the camp of the enemy, and conveyed
                  across the river to Hoboken, whence he will be safely escorted to this place. Poor
                  Andre! my heart bleeds for him, and I really wish there were some justifiable
                  means of effecting his liberation. The only way it can be done, is by exchanging
                  him for Arnold, and this I fear they will not do. Greene, who has gone to confer
                  with a deputation from New York, concerning the prisoner's release, I have
                  instructed to hint at the matter; but I have no hope they will accept the terms;
                  in fact, they cannot do so honorably."
               "Poor Andre! his is, indeed, a hard fate!" said Lafayette, in a tone of deep
                  sympathy. "So young, so talented, so accomplished, so amiable, so every way worthy
                  to live, with such a brilliant future before him!"
               "Believe me, my lord," rejoined Washington, his voice for the first time betraying
                  emotion, "when I signed his death-warrant, I found my eyes growing dim; and, my
                  lord Marquis, I seldom weep. And here," he added. "pray read that letter, which
                  the prisoner sent me to-day, and then say, my lord if it he not hard, for one who
                  sympathizes in his noble, soldier like feelings as I do, to refuse him his last
                  request?"
               The Marquis took the letter which Washington handed him and read as follows:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "TAPPAN, 1st October, 1780.
                           
                           "SIR,—Buoyed above the terror of death by the consciousness of a life
                              devoted to honorable pursuits, and stained with no action that can
                              give me remorse, I trust that the request I make to your excellency,
                              at this serious period, and which is to soften my last moments, will
                              not be rejected.
                           "Sympathy toward a soldier, will surely induce your excellency, and a
                              military tribunal, to adapt the mode of my death to the feelings of a
                              man of honor.
                           "Let me hope, sir, that if aught in my character impresses you with
                              esteem toward me, if aught in my misfortunes marks me as the victim of
                              policy and not resentment, I shall experience the operation of these
                              feelings in your breast, by being informed I am not to die on a
                              gibbet.
                           "I have the honor to be, your
                           
                              "excellency's most obedient,
                              "and most humble servant,
                              "JOHN ANDRE."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "And this request you can not grant," said Lafayette, as he finished the
                  epistle.
               "No, my lord, the customs of war will not permit it," answered Washington,
                  mournfully. "Andre stands condemned as a spy; and if he pays the penalty awarded
                  to his deeds, he must die by the halter. As the chief of the army of these united
                  colonies, I must perform my duty, however painful it be to my feelings."
               "Has your excellency so informed the prisoner?"
               "No, I have sent no reply—nor shall I—as I know any I could make would deeply
                  wound his sensitive feelings."
               At this moment a hasty step was heard in the adjoining room, the door of the
                  apartment opened, and a military officer, of a stern, resolute, uncompromising
                  appearance, entered. It was Major-General Greene.
               "Well, General," said Washington, "have you seen Clinton's delegates on this
                  unhappy affair?"
               "I have had an interview with General Robertson," replied that officer; "but
                  nothing can be done in the way of exchange."
               "Then Andre's case is hopeless," rejoined the commander-in-chief.
               "So I should think," said the other, abruptly. "Robertson evidently had little
                  idea with whom he was dealing. He opened his negociation with fulsome flattery of
                  myself, and expressed his satisfaction in being enabled to treat with an officer
                  so distinguished, on an occasion so interesting to the two armies, and to
                  humanity, and all that. I replied, that I was not there as an officer, but as a
                  private gentleman, deputed by your excellency, and that the case of an
                  acknowledged spy admitted of no discussion. He then, after some preamble, about
                  being there to state facts, and all that, opened his heaviest battery, and
                  peppered away, till I grew tired standing a target of his eloquence. His main
                  arguments were, that Andre landed under sanction of a flag; that he acted wholly
                  by the directions of Arnold—who, being a major-general, was clothed in
                  authority—and therefore he could not be regarded as a spy. He then brought up
                  Arnold's testimony in evidence; but I soon checked him there, by replying that
                  Andre himself had admitted that he did not consider himself as properly acting
                  under a flag, and that all Americans would believe Andre in preference to a vile
                  traitor. He then wished to have the matter referred to Count de Rochambeau and
                  General Knyphausen, and so on. The interview finally closed, by his requesting
                  that I would represent the whole affair in the fairest light to your excellency.
                  The amount of it is, the enemy is seeking to gain time, hoping something may turn
                  up in favor of the prisoner, and that he will be liberated."
               "Well," rejoined Washington, firmly, "time can not be granted. We have delayed too
                  long already; but I wished to give the prisoner another chance for his life. He
                  would have suffered to-day, but for this interview. He dies to-morrow at twelve."
                  He then picked up a pen, and wrote a few lines, and folding the paper, handed it
                  to General Greene, saying: "There is the order for his execution. I rely upon you
                  to see it carried into effect."
               "There was no tremulousness in his voice, and nothing in his manner that betrayed
                  emotion, save that he arose and walked once or twice across the room, and then returned to his
                  seat. But notwithstanding, the heart of Washington beat warm with sympathy, and he
                  deeply felt for the unfortunate Andre.
               Some half an hour later, the Marquis de Lafayette and General Greene took their
                  leave; and almost immediately after, the guard announced Major Lee.
               "Let him pass," said Washington; and as the new-comer entered the room, the
                  commander-in-chief received him politely, offered him a seat, and then, without
                  wasting words, continued; "I have sent for you, Major Lee, in the hope that you
                  have some one in your corps, who is willing to undertake a secret and dangerous
                  project. He must be a man in whom can be placed implicit confidence—brave,
                  energetic, and discreet. I am free to admit that the project is one of great
                  peril, and one that has more risk than glory. In a word, it is nothing more nor
                  less than desertion from his corps, flight to the enemy, and a cunning but bold
                  attempt to seize Arnold. If he succeed, he shall be amply rewarded; if his design
                  is penetrated by the enemy, a gibbet will be his doom. Do you know of one
                  answering my description, who loves his country enough to venture all this?"
               "I think I do, General," replied Lee. "Sergeant Champe, of my command, possesses
                  all the qualifications your excellency has named."
               "In this paper, then, Major Lee," rejoined Washington, taking one from the table
                  and handing it to the other, "you will find all necessary instructions. Whoever
                  consents to undertake the service, I wish him to set out this night. You will
                  please hasten the matter forward. Adieu."
               Just as Lee departed, Captain Milford was announced and admitted.
               "Well, Captain," said Washington, "have you come to a decision?"
               "I have, your excellency: I will go."
               "Bravely said. I could have preferred one of lower grade; but, for many reasons, I
                  know of none so fitted for the undertaking. You have already rendered your country
                  good service in many ways, and shall not be forgotten. Your instructions are in
                  this paper. Get them by heart, and destroy it, lest it fall into wrong hands, and
                  cost you your life. Rosalie Du Pont, it seems, you already know. Be very guarded
                  how and where you meet her for should you be detected, it would be a double grief
                  to me to know that she had become involved in the same difficulty."
               "Her reputation and life are dearer to me than my own, your excellency," replied
                  Captain Milford, warmly; and then, bethinking him what he had said, he looked
                  confused, and his face became scarlet.
               "Ah! is it so, Captain?" returned Washington, with a placid smile. "I knew not of
                  this. I understand it all now. Well, well, Captain Milford, your secret is safe
                  with me; and I will only add, be very prudent, and may you be prospered in all
                  your undertakings! You will, if favored by circumstances, set out to-morrow night.
                  Remember, that besides ascertaining if [here his voice dropped to a whisper]
                  General———is leagued with the enemy, the seizure of Arnold is all important. But
                  that paper will give you full instructions. And now, Captain, farewell."
               "Farewell, your excellency," said Milford, with no little emotion, taking the hand
                  of the General, and pressing it reverently to his lips. "Should my evil star be in
                  the ascendant—should I fall ignobly—I rely upon your excellency to clear my name
                  of all dishonor. Again, farewell!"
               "Once more adieu!" returned Washington; and the next moment he was alone. "A noble
                  youth," he added to himself; "pray Heaven his fate be not like Andre's!" and he
                  became lost in a silent reverie.
