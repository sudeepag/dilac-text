                  CHAPTER I.
                  THE ROVER SHIP.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Majestically slow before the breeze,
                           The tall ship marches on the azure seas;
                           In silent pomp she cleaves the watery plain,
                           The pride and wonder of the billowy main.,"
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        STNSET
                        SUNSET
                      at sea. All was calm. "Old King Sol" was just casting his last fiery glances o'er land and ocean, ere he disappeared to draw the sable curtain around the globe, and wrap all in the impenetrable gloom of night. The scene presented was truly grand. As far off as the eye sight was capable of holding command could be seen the snow-capped waves, made so by the last lingering rays of that "glorious orb of day," as he slowly and majestically retired beyond the blue outline that marked the western horizon.
                  There is certainly nothing more calculated to inspire such feelings of awe and admiration combined, as the sun setting, on a calm summer's evening, at sea. Naught then disturbs the silence of the hour, save the shrill cry of some bird of the ocean, as he skims along the surface of the water, tipping now and then the sparkling top of a wave, or towering aloft in the blue vault of heaven, would utter a wild, shrill scream; then down, down, with an incredible swiftness, would be lost suddenly from view. Now and then a huge monster of the "briny deep" would leap from out his watery element, and catch some object that, 
                        perhance
                        perchance
                     , might be floating on its unruffled surface.
                  Such. in part, dear readers, was the view presented on the evening that witnesses the opening scenes of our story; and without farther delay we will come to the point at once.
                  On the evening under consideration, a vessel of neat and delicate build, we should judge of rather more than one hundred tons burden could have been seen approaching the shore of the isle of Swezo, one of the Lipari islands, situated on the northern coast of Sicily. Her long low sides were painted with a glossy blackness, that gave back a brilliant reflection of the last golden rays of the setting sun. Her tall, well-fashioned masts glistened with varnish, and contrasted well with the exquisite trim of her well tarred ropes, that now hung loosely in the air. Her snow white canvas was spread broadly to the scarcely perceivable breeze, that slowly wafted her shoreward. With this brief description of her external appearance, we transport the reader to her deck.
                  At one glance, one would have seen that she was heavily armed, and would be a dangerous enemy to encounter. From her open ports protruded the gaping mouths of several eighteen pounders, and mounted upon her stern was a long thirty-two!
                  A long, black flag, hung listlessly from her mast head, bearing the following inscription: "BLOOD FOR BLOOD! GARNELLE, THE AVENGER!" Her character was easily determined—it was that of a pirate or freebooter.
                  At the period we date our story, the isle of Swezo, and those in its immediate vicinity, were infested by bands of sea-rovers, and outlaws, who had fled from Sicily and Italy, to avoid punishment and oppression, and by leaguing themselves together became so formidable a body as to be dreaded by all who came in contact with them.—The island of Swezo, from its peculiar location and fitness, for such a class of individuals, had become the rendezvous of a fierce and bloody band, headed by a bold and daring chieftain, who by his dreadful deeds won the cognomen of "Garnelle, the Avenger." The crew of the rover ship were principally composed of Italians, Grecians, and a few natives of other climes, and their occupations at the time spoken of was as varied as were their characters. Some were mending their garments, others cleaning their arms; while the greater portion were amusing themselves by singing songs, smoking, and telling stories.
                  "Velos," cried one of a small party, who were seated upon a coil of rope, singing songs and yarn spinning, "Velos, give us a song of the good old times, can't you my red-jacket?"
                  "Cuss it, shipmates, I d'no any songs!" replied the individual addressed, an old rascal, with a face almost hidden by a 
                        prodigous
                        prodigious
                      pair of whiskers.
                  "No craw-fishing here, old fellow!" exclaimed one of his comrades.
                  "No—reel it off, Velos," said another.
                  "Open your gangway, my cute 'un!" cried a third.
                  Thus urged, the old sailor removed carefully the "quid" from the larboard corner of his extensive mouth, and safely depositing it in the pocket of his pea-jacket, cleared his throat and sang the following: 
                        
                           Come, ship-mates, listen my voice,
                           Ye rovers strong and brave;
                           O, hearken to a sailor's song,
                           Of life upon the wave.
                        
                        
                           O, give to me the rover's life,
                           The red flag waving free;
                           A well stored ship, the bloody knife,
                           And we're masters of the sea.
                        
                        
                           The land-sharks now I dread no more
                           For I'm on the deep blue sea;
                           The winds and waves may rage and roar,
                           But what are they to me?
                        
                        
                           O, a rover's life is my delight,
                           Whether on land or sea;
                           I spend my cash by day or night,
                           In jovial company.
                        
                     
                  
                  "Bravo! Bravissimo! Life to Velos!" shouted his comrades.
                  Upon the quarter deck of the vessel paced, backward and forward, a man, who by his dress and bearing, seemed to be the commander. In hight he was over six feet, and was in other respects powerfully developed. His dress consisted of a blue cloth jacket, that hung loosely from his shoulders, and was richly ornamented with lace, and trimmings of gold; while trowsers of lighter fabric, covered his lower extremities. His feet were encased in a light pair of sandals, and a broad morocco belt was clasped around his waist, filled with pistols and daggers. From this also depended a long, Grecian sword, the hilt of which was pure gold, on which the hand of the rover captain rested. His age, if we might judge from his sternly chiselled features, was near forty, and on his brow there rested a frown, that told equally with the fire that flashed from his piercing black eyes, that he was a man of his own will, and accustomed to command.
                  Upon his head, rested a small low-crowned velvet hat, from which waved a long black plume, casting a shade over his otherwise erwise dark features. A long, peaked black beard, served to give his features a still more fierce expression, while a moustache of similar hue garnished the upper lip.
                  Such, then, was the appearance of Garnelle, the Avenger.
                  "No signal yet, Captain?" asked a man who had approached unobserved beside the chief.
                  The one addressed started, but turning hastily around, spoke:
                  "Ah! Rierio, no signal yet,—by St. Marco! I cannot see the cause of this silence! Bernardo may not have yet observed our approach. We had best line off the 'Long Tom;' they will perhaps hear that."
                  "Your orders shall be obeyed. Captain," said the Lieutenant, who was called Rierio, "but I will inform you that sail has been discovered off our starboard quarter, and it is the opinion of those that have seen her, that she is a Neapolitan cruiser, sent out by the government to capture us."
                  The Captain drew a small sea-glass, and walking forward, tried for a moment to seam the horizon in the direction indicated, but immediately replaced it and said:
                  "You must have mistaken one of our own vessels for the one you speak of, for I do not think the government vessels would date to venture so near my head quarters."
                  "Perhaps so," replied the Lieutenant, not wishing to differ with his superior.—Then turning to the crew, he cried in a tone that was beard throughout the ship:
                  "Ho? Velos—charge you the Long Tom, and let him speak!"
                  Scarcely had a single minute elapsed, ere the gun upon the stern was swung round on the pivot upon which it was fixed, and thundered forth a charge that made the shores echo for miles around. But, to the surprise of all, no answer was heard! before the last echo of the gun had been lost in the distance, the Captain turned and thus addressed the crew, who sprang instantly to their feet.
                  "Men —this continued silence of Bernardo and his men, is a mystery that must soon be unraveled. There has either been foul work or treachery going on during our absence. To your posts, every one of you, and run the ship into the harbor! If the villains have betrayed me," he muttered in an under tone, "by the God that made me!—they shall know how Garnelle can punish traitors! Bravely lads," he cried aloud 
                        to to
                        to
                      the sailors, "double rations for double exertions!"
                  This seemed to be a sharper spur, for the men applied themselves with such renewed vigor that the vessel shot into the narrow channel with the speed of lightning.
                  A brief description of the harbor into which the rover ship was entering, may not prove uninteresting to the reader.
                  It was formed of a triangular nook in the middle of which was a high, rocky, barren island. Thus it was, when the ship entered, she could with much exertion be worked around the passage into the channel of the first entrance. To one unacquainted with its narrow windings, and numerous shoals, it was utterly impossible. The harbor was surrounded on all sides by high and insurmountable precipices; and on one side, near mid-way between the summit and base, was the entrance of an extensive cavern—access to which was only to be gained by a flight of steps cut in the solid rock, up which one could only ascend at a time. It was on this account that it was chosen by Garnelle, as a suitable place to deposit his treasures.—With great difficulty the rover ship was run in, and again safely moored in front of the cavern.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER II.
                  
                     
                        
                           "He knelt upon the cold damp earth,
                           His eye-balls starting wildly forth!
                           And as he kissed his gleaming blade,
                           He breathed a fearful OATH!"
                        
                     
                  
                  "Now for a solution of this deep mystery!" exclaimed Garnelle, as he leaped into a boat that had been lowered from the Sea Queen, the name of the pirate ship, and was speedily followed by an armed crew. The slender oars trembled beneath the powerful arms of the rugged sailors, and in a few moments the keel touched the rocks of the shore. In an instant Garnelle had leaped upon the steps that led to the cavern, and taking from his belt a small silver call or whistle, he blew three shrill notes upon it. But the only answer he received was the echo of the sounds he had himself produced. Ordering his men to ignite their lamps, as it was now quite dark, and quickly follow him, he sprang up the steps, sword in hand. On reaching the entrance he found everything within as dark and silent as the grave.
                  "Ha! no one on guard, as I was expecting!" he exclaimed in a deep, stern voice. "By heaven!—there is something at the bottom of this affair. Ho! light here, men!"
                  "Ay, ay, sir!" responded his crew, who had lighted their lamps, and instantly joined him.
                  They entered, and having traversed a narrow winding passage for some distance, came to a point where it seemed that there was no outlet. But Garnelle, who was in advance, took his sword point, and inserting it between what seemed to be separate portions of the wall, in an instant a huge piece of the solid rock moved aside, disclosing an entrance large enough to admit two persons at a time. Through this singular aperture they passed, and came at last into a large and spacious apartment, where a sight met their gaze that almost froze the blood in their veins, pirates, devils incarnate as they were!
                  It was a spectacle that was calculated to make the most brave and daring tremble, and pale with horror! Upon a floor of the apartment, in a pool of blood, lay the lifeless bodies of at least a dozen men, whose pale and immoveable features told that their daring spirits had taken flight. No weapons of any kind, save the side arms which the rover ever carries, could be seen about their bodies: and from the circumstance that the remains of a feast were still on the table, it was evident that they had been taken by surprise.
                  "O my brave and noble band," groaned the chieftain, as his eyes wandered over the terrible scene; "is it thus we meet again! There has been foul treachery here. Would to Heaven I knew who did this."
                  "Perhaps this may throw some light upon the matter," said the Lieutenant, approaching and handing the Captain a scrap of paper; "I just this moment discovered it upon the wall."
                  Garnelle began to read, and his brow grew dark as night as he perused the following:
                  "Villain! Pirate! Murderer!—Although you have thus far escaped the hand of Justice, your time has almost come. They say that you have a secret; but even this shall not save your neck from the garote. Almost every villain has his secret, but it is one of sin and infamy. As a step toward clearing the world of a gang of rascals, look around you and see the effects. If you have more bloodhounds for the slaughter, I pray you bring them on. Think not, villain, that you will always escape my vengeance; for the day will come, and that shortly, when I will have you within my power; then woe be to Garnelle, the self-styled Avenger!
                  "(Signed) JULIANE, King of Naples."
                  Then kneeled Garnelle down amid the lifeless bodies of his former band; and, while his eyeballs glared almost out of their sockets, he drew his sword, and, as he kissed its gleaming blade, he cried: "My murdered comrades! for thy lives, which thou hast too freely offered up as a sacrifice for thy wronged and outlawed leader, do I here, amidst thy inanimate forms, swear to avenge thy deaths, that the name of Delvani shall swim out of the world in blood! Ay, blood!" added he, springing suddenly to his feet and turning to his men, who started back with horror at his fiendish appearance. "Ye may be pirates now; ye may wade, swim or drink in blood, for Garnelle lives only for revenge!"
                  And there, in that room, where lay the bodies of their murdered comrades, did that pirate band swear to fulfill their leader's fearful oath
                  "Long live Garnelle, King of the Rovers!" shouted the crew.
                  "May we never want a better or braver leader!" said Lieutenant Rierio.
                  "Nor shall ye ever, while this arm of mine has power to wield a sword," exclaimed the chief, pressing again his lips to the weapon he held in his hand; "my murdered crew shall be avenged. Death to the nobles!"
                  "Death to the nobles!" hoarsely answered the crew, who in the meantime had been rejoined by their companions from the ship.
                  "Aye, death to the nobles! who would enslave their protectors, that they might thereby be possessed of power unbounded. Thank God, that the day is near at hand when the monarch who now rules over the destiny of fallen and oppressed Naples, shall be dragged down from the exalted position he now occupies, while reason and justice will again mount the throne."
                  Thus spake a deep voice near them. Turning, they beheld the form of a man emerging from a secret panel of the wall. He was a tall, gaunt person, with long, grizzly hair, which hung in disordered masses down his neck and shoulders. His features were rough and uneven, and bore a peculiar sternness about them, which told that his inward feelings were not of the most desirable kind.
                  His complexion was dark, from exposure and hardship. The passion "revenge," was clearly depicted in his eyes, that glared like two balls of fire. His dress was like that of the rovers, with the exception that he wore a blue scarf over is right shoulder, denoting one of rank.
                  "Bernardo, Bernardo," came from the astonished lips of the pirates, as they shrank fearfully back, believing the spirit of one who was resting in the tomb had suddenly appeared before them.
                  "What! you here, Bernardo?" demanded Garnelle, as he advanced towards the new comer; "How is this?"
                  "Listen, and you shall hear!" replied Bernardo, who, although a strange personage, was greatly beloved by the rovers, and held a station among them second only to Garnelle.
                  "Last night, as you may see, the crew were in this apartment carousing, while that lying villain, Turkill, at his own request, was placed on guard, at the entrance of the cavern. At different times, we thought we could distinguish some noise, or bustle, below; but, relying on our sentinel, we took no notice of it.
                  "At last, when the mirth was at its height, the door of the apartment was burst open, and a host of the Neapolitan troops rushed upon us. At their head was one who, in spite of his disguise, I recognised as King Juliane! By his side was that scoundrel Turkill.
                  "At once I knew it was Turkill who had betrayed us, and I drew a pistol determining to make short work with him. But unfortunately the villain observed my kind intention, and by leaping to one side the ball that was intended for him entered the head of a soldier at his back.
                  "But I need not dwell 
                        apon
                        upon
                      the scene. You can all see how it terminated. The poor fellows, although they had only their side-arms about them, while the troops were armed cap-a-pie, fought long and desperately, but were at last overcome by the superior number of the foe."
                  "You have not informed us how you made your escape," interrupted the chieftain.
                  "Seeing that escape was impossible only by stratagem," continued Bernardo, in a deep voice, "I fell down among the dead bodies and feigned death. The plan succeeded; and after having, as they thought, murdered all, orders were given to search the cavern for treasures, which they supposed were secreted—"
                  "The gold! the gold! burst from the pirates.
                  "Fortunately," said the narrator, "they did not discover the treasure room; and after refreshing themselves with some wine which was on the table, they departed, carrying their dead and wounded with them."
                  "Did the traitor Turkill escape unharmed?" inquired the pirate chieftain.
                  "He did," responded Bernardo, "and took quite an active part in the contest, murdering all who asked for quarters, in spite of his, the king's orders, who seemed anxious to capture some of them alive."
                  "The infernal traitor—he must die!" exclaimed Garnelle, fiercely.
                  "Yes! Here on my bended knees, I swear not to rest my arm until I have freed the world of a foul villain," exclaimed Bernardo, kneeling down and kissing the blade of a dagger which he drew from his belt. Then rising to his feet, he drew from his doublet a roll of paper, and said:
                  "Here is a proclamation left on the outer entrance by his Majesty, which I shall take the liberty of reading aloud for the benefit of all.
                  "'1000 SEQUINS REWARD!—I, Juliane Delvani; King of Naples, do hereby offer the above named reward of 1000 sequins to the person that shall deliver into the hands of my authorities, in the city of Naples, he person of one Garnelle, an outlaw and pirate who for a number of years has kept the citizens of our kingdom in constant alarm, by his terrible threats and daring deeds. To any one of the pirate band who may desire the reward, a free pardon will be added.
                  (Signed) JULIANE, King of Naples.'"
                  "So they have set a price upon me," remarked Garnelle, as Bernardo ceased reading, and he cast a glance around over the dark features of his crew, who stood silently listening. "1000 sequins for my head, and a free pardon besides. Think of it men—it would make you rich. Is it not enough to make you turn traitors?"
                  "No!" thundered the men in a voice.
                  "Ho! then for a carousal!—and revenge!" exclaimed the daring rover chief; and leading the way to another apartment, he was followed by the crew. Here for the present, we will leave them, and introduce to our readers other characters, who will act a prominent part in our story.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  PAST EVENTS.
                  
                     
                        
                           "'Twas some years ago.
                           It may be thirty, forty, more or less;
                           The carnival was at its height, and so
                           Were all kinds of buffoonery and dress."
                        
                     
                  
                  Come with us, dear readers, and gaze for while upon scenes and incidents long since hidden beneath the thick curtain of the past, which, though they may at first seem dull and uninteresting, will in the sequel of our story, be of considerable importance.
                  Some years previous to the transpiration of the events narrated in the preceding chapter, the kingdom of Naples was thrown into a state of extreme confusion, by a contest between two of its principal houses, Martino and Delvani, for the kingly power. The former monarch having died, and leaving no direct heir to the throne, it in consequence fell to the nobleman who was next highest in rank.
                  This was found to be no easy matter to establish, as the two houses mentioned had been rivals a long while, and both claimed the honor of superiority. In this state of things it was deemed prudent to leave a decision so important to the future welfare 
                        of of
                        of
                      the government, to the "People's Council," a body of eight persons, who were chosen by the people, and who ranked next in power to the king. In consequence thereof, Don Fernando Martino became the chief ruler of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, to the great annoyance of the discomfited house of Delvani.
                  Don Fernando's family consisted of two children, a son and daughter. His wife had died many years before, therefore 
                        the the
                        the
                      charge of rearing and educating his children, had devolved entirely upon himself.
                  Marco, the boy, was a noble youth, some three years the senior of his sister, Irene, and possessed a faultless, athletic form, combined with a proud unyielding spirit. He was brave, even to recklessness, and where ever danger was the thickest, there loved he to be. Thus it was he sought out the most hazardous spots in the mountains and forests near Naples, and amused himself by exploring its numerous caverns, accompanied only by his gun and dogs.
                  Irene Martino was a model of female loveliness, for which the Neapolitan ladies are so remarkable. Her naturally brilliant mind had received the polish of a thorough education, and was, moreover, entirely free from those disgusting ideas of nobility, that teach the doctrine of inequality; that one portion of the human family are born the slaves of the other, to toil and labor while their masters revel over their downfall. With this brief description, we will proceed.
                  The opponent of Don Fernando, from the house of Delvani, was a young noble, whose fierce passions overcome all the better impulses of the human heart. His age at the time we speak of, was somewhat more than thirty, to which a long series of licentiousness had added a dozen more at least. At this period, the Neapolitan court was thronged by a number of young nobles, who, being the heirs of their departed sires, had, by their extravagance and other bad habits, so squandered their fortunes, that the unsuspecting people were taxed in order to support them in a suitable manner. Of this class was Count Juliane Delvani; and when he was so defeated in obtaining the Neapolitan crown, by which he hoped to regain the wealth he had lost, his worst passions became aroused, and he swore he would yet set upon the throne!
                  It is not strange then, that the youthful prince, Marco, should become an object of his hatred, as next to his father he stood in his way. In the meantime, the prince was enjoying himself in the mountains, hunting the wild beasts of the forest, and exploring the numerous caverns with which the rocks along the sea coast were perforated, often encountering strange, curious adventures, in which his brave soul seemed to exist. He, innocent as he was, dreamed not that a conspiracy, dark and damnable, was hatching against him!
                  But there was another motive besides that of mere love of adventure, which drew the attention of young Marco to the mountains, which we will explain to the reader.
                  About a year prior to the time of which we have been speaking, the youthful adventurer, Marco Martino, having wandered rather farther into the forest than usual, and lost the smoking top of Mount Vesuvius from view, became bewildered and lost. He tried, by hallooing at the top of his voice, and firing off his gun, to make his whereabouts known, but in vain; and as night came speedily upon him, the prince, whose power availed him no longer, sat himself down beneath the boughs of a tree, intending there, alone with his canine comrades, to pass the night. Not long had he thus sat, musing upon his unfortunate situation, ere a hand was lightly placed upon his shoulder, his dogs at the same time setting up a fierce yell behind him. Quick as thought he leaped to his feet, and leveled his weapon at the disturber of his meditations, but dropped its muzzle the next instant as he exclaimed—
                  "A woman, by St. Paul!"
                  "Pardon me, Signor," replied the other, as she stepped forward, disclosing a set of features that Venus might envy, "if I have disturbed you—for I was passing homeward, and hearing your signals of distress, I made myself bold enough to approach, and see if I could afford you any assistance!"
                  "Pardon you, lovely being," said Marco, as he gazed with unfeigned astonishment, upon the upturned features of the lovely girl before him, and listened to her lute-like voice, with a rapture that he never before experienced; "no, by heaven, lady—for such as thyself I hold not the pardoning power?"
                  The picture then presented would defy description with the pen; and he must be a master artist that would attempt it with the pencil. A face white as alabaster, save spots of vermillion on either check, was slightly shaded by a profusion of silky curls, that fell in disordered masses about her neck and shoulders, upon which rested a head of the most beautiful cast. Two large eyes of piercing blackness rested within their moving sockets, and flashed upon young Marco with a brilliancy that completely dazzled him. A light crimson scarf thrown carelessly around her shoulders, scarcely concealed the outlines of her voluptuous form and bosom of dazzling whiteness. The remainder of her person was covered by a short Turkish dress, worn by the mountain girls of Italy. No wonder then, that the youth should be amazed at finding in those wild mountains, a flower of such rare beauty as to far surpass any one he had ever seen in the gay city of Naples, where flock the beauty of every clime in abundance.
                  "An angel, by heavens!" he again exclaimed, as he gazed upon the faultless figure and features before him.
                  "Oh, no, Signor!" exclaimed the beautiful girl; "poor wild, little Ellie bears little resemblance to those celestial beings to whom you would compare her. But I am wasting time here. My mother's cottage is but a short distance from this place, and if you will accept a shelter beneath our humble roof, you are welcome. Will you follow me, Signor?"
                  Need we say that her kind interrogation was responded to affirmatively? Need we say, that instead of following his fair guide, as requested, he had the brazen impudence to run his craft alongside, and engage the enemy in parley without the aid of a speaking trumpet? No, this, we venture to assert, the reader has already surmised; and we will only remark, that both were considerably surprised a half hour afterward, when they found themselves at the door of a small cottage on the sea-coast.
                  "Here is my mother's cot," remarked the fair conductress, us she opened the door, and bade the young nobleman enter.
                  The room was small, but neatly furnished with most of the necessaries of life, while everything told that the mistress of the house was a person of no ordinary taste.—By a cheerful fire sat an aged lady, engaged in reading an ancient and much-neglected work. Beside her was a young man with pencils and brushes, engaged in sketching upon a sheet that was spread out before him, a wild and picturesque landscape. The bold and easy hand which he wielded, showed that he was no novice in his employment.
                  "Ay, Ellie!" he ejaculated, as he beheld the entrance of the maiden and the prince, "so you have come back at last. We had almost began to fear that you had lost yourself in the forest. But," and he glanced at the stranger.
                  "O, I had almost forgotten myself," she replied, blushing deeply; "this is a stranger who has just lost his way in the forest, and desires to remain beneath our roof until morning."
                  "He is freely welcome," replied the young man, smiling, "and especially so, as he comes so well recommended. It shall be our endeavor, Signor, to make your stay with us agreeable as possible. But may I inquire by what name you are known, for I see by your dress and leaning that you come from the city?"
                  "Call me Martino," answered the young man, disdaining to use falsehood to conceal his real character.
                  "Pardon, Prince," uttered the other, kneeling down, "I now recognise your highness, and hope you will forgive my rudeness."
                  "Rise, noble youth," said Martino, hastily; "I ask not this—such homage may seem necessary in the court, but here we must certainly be equal. And now that I have given you my name, will you not return the civillity by doing the same? I see that we must be friends."
                  "With pleasure, my noble prince," answered the young man, as they were seated around the fire, "my name is Pierre Trancelli—this elderly lady is my mother, and that is my sweet sister Ellie, whom I love as a brother only can."
                  Marco cast a glance toward the young girl, whose face was instantly crimsoned with a blush, as their expressive eyes met, which seemed to say, that his was of a different kind, but was none the less ardent.
                  Marco Martino slept as soundly that night as if in the most splendid apartment of his father's palace. Though we said quietly, we meant not to imply that his mind was untroubled with dreams. Forms and visions floated in imagination across his pillow, and among them that of the lovely young girl was the most prominent. In the morning, after partaking of a cheerful repast, he took leave of the kind mother and daughter, not forgetting by the way, to ask permission to renew the acquaintance, which was readily granted, he set out to return to the city, accompanied by Pierre Trancelli, who had volunteered his services as guide.
                  Pierre was some two years younger than his noble companion, and was his equal if not superior in point of beauty. But there being considerable difference between the two, both mentally and physically, we will take this opportunity of describing both in as brief a manner as possible, by way of comparison.
                  Marco was well formed, tall, with black eyes and hair, rather of a dark olive complexion, which is usually the case with those of Italian blood, passionate, at times reckless and daring—constituting one we would ever desire as a friend, and dread as an enemy.
                  Quick, fiery and impetuous, he was ever ready to avenge an insult, or take the part of a friend; but if found in the wrong, he could not rest until he had asked and obtained pardon for the injury done.
                  In temperament Pierre was much more mild and considerate than was the young nobleman. In stature he was not so tall, or powerfully built; but possessed an easy, graceful carriage, that told that although he led the life of an humble retired artist, he had not ever been so. The contour of his features were classically Grecian, and in every lineament thereof could be seen a nobleness of soul, a combination of thought and action, that well became his outward appearance. His hair was of deep auburn, and clustered profusely about his high, marble brow, and his mild blue eyes spoke volumes for truth and integrity of character. But we will return.
                  It was near noon ere the two youths reached the city. At the gates they encountered a large body of men, who were just setting out in search of the absent prince. They found that his reported disappearance had already caused considerable excitement among the people, and a large assemblage had congregated at the royal palace of Don Fernando, who was almost mad with grief.
                  Pierre would now have returned home, but the prince would not permit him; so he reluctantly accompanied him to the palace. We will not attempt to describe the joy of the father and sister on their arrival. It would be useless. Our readers will already have pictured it in their imagination. Pierre Trancelli was warmly greeted by the father, who thought he could have no objections to owning such a noble son as he seemed; and as the beautiful Irene, blushing beneath the black silken tresses that clustered around her sweet face—we say, as she gazed upon the handsome youth before her, and heard the sweet, musical tones of his voice, she could not but acknowledge to herself, as a matter of course, that he was a noble person, and far, far surpassed any one she had before met!
                  Pierre, when he had seen his friend safely home, and had also met with one whom he did not expect, after receiving the kind wishes of old Don Fernando, who offered him a purse of gold which he refused, bade his royal friends farewell, and took his way homeward. Ere he had lost sight of the palace, he cast a long, lingering look at its proud walls. A white scarf waved from one of the upper balconies of the structure. Pierre at once lifted his plumed cap from his brow, and returned the signal. It was a signal of the heart! That instant his heart fled from his bosom, and he returned home to dream of Irene Martino and happiness! But it is said that the "course of true love does not always run smooth," which was the case in this instance.
                  While these little affairs of the heart were being carried on in the mountains, others of more importance, deeply affecting them, transpired in the city.
                  Don Fernando Martino, the noble old king of Naples, from some unknown cause, was found one morning dead in his bed, whither, the evening previous, he had retired in as good health as usual. At the time this event took place the young prince was absent; but messengers were instantly dispatched to bring him to the city. But in vain did they search the wilds of the mountains, the cottages of the peasants, and the numerous caverns where a man might dare to venture. No trace of the young nobleman was ever found.
                  Thus, at one cruel stroke, Irene Martino was made an orphan; losing, at the same moment, a kind father and protecting brother. In the midst of the deep mourning that followed this event, the "People's Council" issued an edict declaring Juliane Delvani, Knight of the Order of St. John, King and chief ruler of the kingdom of Naples.
                  Great was the astonishment of the newly elected monarch, when he was about to receive, in honor to his exalted position, the "crown of diamonds" which had graced the heads of Naples' kings centuries before, to find that that inestimable relic had disappeared. Search was made; thousands of sequins were offered for its recovery, but in vain. No trace could be found. Although one of considerable value, more than the one lost, was procured, it did not seem to inspire that confidence with the people which was formerly evinced, and murmurs of disappointment began to be heard from every quarter. One of the first acts of King Juliane, after coming into power, was to banish an old noble, Laroni Calvani, who, at the time of the contest between Don Fernando Martino and himself, as before remarked, was chief of the "People's Council," and had thereby secured his hatred.
                  This was the state of affairs which, for a number of years after the new king had began to exercise authority, had continued, when a chieftain, bold and daring, suddenly appeared upon the Neapolitan coast, striking terror into the hearts of all, by his dreadful deeds and fearful threats. It was whispered that he was seeking revenge upon the government, for some wrong received in times gone past; which seemed the more probable, from the fact that he scarcely ever molested the peasantry, seeming to war against the rich and noble. Several of the house of Delvani had already fallen beneath the band of the fearful rover; yet his thirst for blood seemed unabated.
                  He was known as Garnelle, the Avenger!
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  THE CAROUSAL.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Drain, drain the bowl, each fearless soul,
                           Let the world wag as it will;
                           Let the heavens growl, let the devil howl,
                           Drain, drain the deep bowl, and fill."
                        
                     
                  
                  GARNELLE, as before related, at the end of our second chapter, withdrew from the apartment, where lay the scene of bloodshed, followed by the crew. Scarcely had the door closed upon their retiring forms, ere a man emerged from a secret recess of the wall, and after looking carefully around him, hissed forth from between his clenched teeth:
                  "Death to the traitor, is it? Aye, two can play at that game—ha! ha! but you will have to be very cunning to entrap the fox! Go on, then, for Marlate Turkill defies you and your vengeance!"
                  As he said this, he drew his form up to its full height, and wrapping his cloak more closely around him, he noiselessly left the apartment, and in a few moments had reached the outer entrance of the cavern.
                  Here for a moment he paused—for a sentinel was pacing to and fro, upon a projecting rock at the entrance. But it was only momentary, for he drew his scull-cap down so as to partially conceal his features, and moved forward with a bold, firm step.
                  "Quis venit?" demanded the sentinel in Latin.
                  "Amicus," answered the other boldly.
                  The sentinel drew aside, while the stranger descended swiftly to the water's edge. A small skiff or gondola was moored upon the shore, near the boat brought from the ship by the rovers; and quickly leaping into it, the traitor, Marlate Turkill, rowed toward the schooner. When he had got about half the distance between the vessel and the shore, he suddenly changed his course, and bore down the channel toward the open sea. It will be remembered by our readers, that the Lieutenant of the Sea Queen reported to her Commander, in our first chapter, that a vessel had been discovered on the starboard quarter; but the Captain supposing that in the darkness he had been deceived, took little notice of it. The Lieutenant, however, was correct in his surmises. The vessel still remained as if in waiting, with her anchor speak.
                  She was a Neapolitan man-of-war, or cruiser, and bore the ensign of her nation aloft. The little canoe, before spoken of, when it reached the open sea, was directed toward the ship. A quarter of an hour afterward, she was hove alongside, and its inmate stepped on board. This seemed to be what they were waiting for, as instantly the sails shot up the mast, the rigging trimmed, and a strong breeze having sprung up, the vessel bounded away to the eastward, at the rate of ten knots an hour.
                  The apartment into which the rovers entered was one of great length, and magnificently adorned. The walls were lined with velvet, and were hung with numerous pistols, swords and daggers, describing circles and semi-circles, that glistened brightly as the glare of the lighted chandeliers fell upon them. The floor was covered with a rich Turkish carpet, while a long mahogany table extended the whole, length of the apartment. Chairs and sofas of the same costly material were strewn along its sides At one extremity of the table was fixed a magnificent seat, ornamented in the richest manner. In this, was seated Garnelle, the chief. The rovers sat around the revelling board, with their unfilled beakers before them, silently awaiting a signal from their leader to imbue the generous spirit; no one daring to do so without. To have gazed upon them at that moment it would have seemed that such a thing was impossible; yet no more than one glance was necessary to observe it by the wishful looks cast upon the object of their fondest desires.
                  We think it is a settled fact with every one, that a portion of mankind is endowed with a greater amount of skill and knowledge by Providence than the remainder, and that it is for the better we cannot doubt. That we must have Law, is self-evident. And what is Law? We are not prepared here to enter upon a lengthy dissertation of legal subjects, but will merely say that it is the will of a majority by which a minority is governed. If the people elect a governor or leader, he is their law, and they are bound to abide by his decisions. So it was with Garnelle. He was their chosen ruler, and they dared not disobey him. His discipline was strict, but not tyrannical; he wished to gain the good will of his subjects, but he did not allow any familiarity unbecoming a commander. It was his duty to command, theirs to obey—his to lead, theirs to follow.
                  Another reason, was personal fear. To be sure, had they been so inclined, their united strength was more than equal to his, but well they knew that ere they captured their leader, their numbers would be considerably smaller. They had seen Garnelle too often in battle not to be aware of this More cunning than the fox, quick, active and ever awake to the least sign of danger they would as soon have undertaken to catch the moon asleep, as to entrap their wary leader. It was even believed that he never slept. Such was Garnelle among villains and robbers, what he might have been elsewhere is not to be revealed here. But the impatient rovers were not kept waiting any length of time. Rising to his feet, and accepting a glass of the sparkling liquid, he lifted it to his lips as he exclaimed:
                  "Fill high your goblets, comrades! Drink your leader's oath: 'Death to the Nobles!'"
                  "Death to the Nobles!" thundered the crew and emptied their cups. Others followed; glass after glass mysteriously became empty, yet the floor of the apartment remained unsoiled; where the contents went we do not pretend to say, but leave it to our reader's imaginations.
                  Ere long, the wine imbibed began to take effect upon the feelings of the drinkers which began to manifest itself in various ways. Some imagined themselves on board the Sea Queen, a suspicious looking craft to windward, and, in expectation of a fight and a prize, began to make preparations for the engagement, by cramming a charge of napkins into their tumblers, using a dagger in lieu of a ram-rod. Others went through a series of forecastle sports, singing songs, spinning yarns, and dancing. Altogether, it was a strange, "conglomerated mass of glorious confusion."
                  "A song, a song from Velos!" shouted a dozen voices at once.
                  "Boys, can't some o' the rest o' ye sing, without bothering me all the time?" exclaimed our old friend, engulphing, at the same time, a glass of wine.
                  "A song, Velos, a song!" was the only answer.
                  "Well, boys, gin us a char, and I'll go ahead," said he.
                  
                     
                        Drink, comrades, drown all sorrow,
                        Drink, and drive dull care away;
                        We care not what may come to-morrow—
                        To-morrow is another day.
                     
                     
                        What care we if we drink too much?
                        Aye, what is that to I or you?
                        I love the punch-bowl's delicate touch.
                        And I love its contents too.
                     
                     
                        We have no care upon our minds,
                        Our consciences are clear:
                        We've left the breakers far behind,
                        And into port we steer.
                     
                     
                        We lift the bowl up to our lips—
                        We'll take another horn—
                        For it may be the last we'll tip
                        Until the judgment morn.
                     
                     
                        Once more! again I bid you drink,
                        If but a single drop;
                        Death may be nearer than you think,
                        Your voyage of life to stop.
                     
                  
                  
                  This song was greeted with shouts of applause by the pirates, and was followed by numerous others. The carousal was now at its height, the parties being completely intoxicated. Order was now at an end, confusion reigned predominant. The rovers seemed more like a legion of fiends fresh from Pandemonium than human beings; and as each individual considered it to be his duty to eclipse his companions by great feats and sayings, some idea may be formed of the aspect of affairs by the reader; we can not describe it.
                  "A song from the captain!" shouted one of the revellers, after a few moment's silence from all.
                  "Aye, aye—a song, captain!" echoed all.
                  "Comrades," said Garnelle, rising to his feet, and gazing sternly around him, "I would have been excused from singing tonight, but as you have requested me to do so, I will comply."
                  "Long live the captain!—Long live Garnelle, our bold chief!" cried the men.
                  "Here it is, comrades," said the pirate; and in a rich voice he sang the following
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              CHIEFTAIN'S SONG.
                              
                                 To the mast nail our flag,
                                 And there let it wave
                                 O'er the victims we drag
                                 Down, down to the grave.
                                 Let the drum loudly beat,
                                 Let the fife merrily play:
                                 For our foes, when we meet,
                                 Are compelled to give way.
                              
                              
                                 We fight not for riches,
                                 Nor do we for fame:
                                 The first we despise,
                                 The last is a name.
                                 Our object is vengeance,
                                 Our souls thirst for blood;
                                 For the wrongs we've received
                                 Rush on in a flood.
                              
                              
                                 Strike then to the heart!
                                 For your steel 'tis true;
                                 The foe is before you,
                                 You know what to do.
                                 The dead speak not,
                                 The living are foes;
                                 We'll drink of their blood
                                 As red as the rose.
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  For some moments, after the pirate had ceased, not a word was spoken. All seemed lost in the recollections that the words of the chief had called forth. And as that band of rude men sat there gazing sternly upon each other, all the natural fierceness of their natures was aroused by the potions of wine they had imbibed; a wild scene was presented which it were impossible to describe.
                  Each one, perhaps, had a deep secret locked up in his bosom to brood over, and each a private wrong to redress. No wonder, then, that the words just uttered by the chieftain should cause their thoughts to wander back to scenes long past, and again to be revenged. Many a dagger sprang half from its sheath, as the owner made these resolves.
                  But these emotions did not escape the quick eye of him by whom they were caused, for leaping quickly to his feet, he exclaimed:
                  "I see, by your looks, that ye desire revenge—ye shall have it. By the cross ye shall! To-night we will drink deep, for on the morrow we leave this spot forever. Ho! then for Naples! The tyrant shall be dragged down from his throne, and these proud nobles shall yet learn to tremble, and pale with fear at the name of Garnelle, the Avenger!"
                  The remainder of the night was spent in drunken revelry, in which the pirate chieftain freely participated; and he who had always before remained a silent spectator of these bacchanalian scenes, seemed anxious to drown all thoughts of the past in the depths of the bowl.
                  In this situation, we will beg leave to part with them for the present, and turn to other scenes.
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  THE ABDUCTION.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Silent was his cat-like tread,
                           As through the lattice he crept;
                           All was silent as the dead,
                           In where the victim slept."
                        
                     
                  
                  Night it was. The bright luminaries above were extinguished, and darkness reigned supreme throughout the heavenly vault. A thick haze, or fog, had gathered over the ancient and aristocratic city of Naples. Its towers and turrets, spires and balconies, seemed as a thousand dim phantoms flitting through the air; while the sound of the far off, roaring waves, as they madly lashed the rock-bound shore, added a melancholy tone to the otherwise impressive scene. The hum and bustle of business had ceased. The clang of iron-shod horses and men, the shouts and turmoils of the more riotous portion of the community had died away, and all, it seemed, had sought forgetfulness in quiet, unresisting sleep. The police—they who, above all others, should have been abroad—into whose hands the care of the now sleeping city was entrusted, it would have appeared to the passer-by, had deserted their posts; yet, by close observation, they could be discovered at 
                        invervals
                        intervals
                     , closely ensconsed in some low hovel, or in the doorway of a rich mansion—some reveling in the "land of dreams," while others seemed on the stand, debating the propriety of such a proceeding. At any rate, they seemed to be thinking of almost anything beside their duty; for now and then, as some sound would reach their almost deafened ears, they would unconsciously start, grasp their weapons, then all was instantly forgotten, and again they sounded the shrill, nasal charge, into the "Land of Nod."
                  But there were others abroad, beside the sleepy-headed police, and it is to these we now turn our attention.
                  It was near the noon of night, as mentioned, when two human figures, closely muffled, turned the corner of one of the leading thoroughfares of the great metropolis, and directed their steps toward the suburbs. By the dim, flickering light afforded by the street lamps, we are enabled to scan the personal appearance of each.—The first and foremost of the two was a young man, probably six feet in height, and reasonably developed in other respects. His form, though of rather delicate mould, exhibited a beautiful combination of strength and activity, which at once stamped him as a person of no trifling pretensions. His form was enveloped in a heavy Maltese cloak, closely drawn around his person, from beneath the folds of which could be seen the glittering Cross of St. John. His rank was at once explained—none but the most noble and high born were ever knighted by that powerful order. Upon his head rested a small palmetto hat, looped on either side by a magnificent silver buckle. His hair was dark and fine, and flowed down about his neck and shoulders. His eyes were also dark and piercing, and filled with a fire indicating the existence of lustful passions in his soul, that had never known the control of reason or been subjected to restraint.
                  The companion of the Knight of St. John was a heavy built, swaggering braggadocio; a man of words and bluster—a bully by profession, who could boast loudly of his deeds before the faces of his fellows; but who at heart was a coward, that would flee at the approach of danger if left to rely upon himself. He was the spy and guide of the Knight in his libertine adventures about the town, and was known as Colonel Masquade.
                  "It is getting dark as the devil in the streets," said the Colonel, as the two advanced in their walk. "I don't fancy a trip through here, for there is danger of the dagger of some midnight assassin;" and he drew back as if to let the other precede him into the darkness.
                  "Coward!" said his companion, "proceed! Fear you the sound of your own footsteps? On, or by my cross I'll prick thee with my dagger!"
                  This latter sentence was uttered in a tone of authority.
                  "Damnation! what a fix I'm in," muttered the Colonel, as he walked doggedly forward.
                  Passing rapidly down the street, the two suddenly turned to one side, and after looking carefully around them to see that they were not observed, entered a dark, narrow alley. Scarcely had they disappeared before another form cautiously emerged from behind the wall of a mansion close by, and carefully followed. Not being aware of this incident, the two first mentioned moved forward, thinking that all necessary caution was at an end. Again they turned the corner of the alley, into one still more obscure; and as often did the figure behind them do the same. The latter was evidently dogging their steps.
                  After traversing the alley for some distance, the Knight and his comrade paused before a building, from which issued a dim light, that showed that the inmates had not yet retired.
                  "This is the house, Sir Maylard; I've marked it well," said the Colonel, as he peered through the key-hole, where he could view the inner apartments, from whence the light proceeded.
                  The Knight replied not, but ordering the braggadocio aside, he gazed into the house himself. One moment seemed to satisfy them, and turning to the Colonel, he re marked hastily:
                  "By Heaven, 'tis she! Masquade, take you hold of the bell-rope. We must use caution, or all may yet fail."
                  "Ay, ay, my Lord," answered the other, as he grasped the rope, and gave it a vigorous pull.
                  "Softly, Colonel, or you will alarm the surrounding inhabitants," whispered the knight. "Have your arms in readiness, for we may meet with danger where we do not expect it."
                  "Ready, my Lord," replied the bully, in a trembling voice.
                  "Coward I" muttered the knight between his clenched teeth.
                  "Ho! without there!" cried a female voice this instant, within the house. "What means this disturbance at so late an hour of the night?"
                  "Open, madam. We are noblemen, who have been beset by robbers, and seek shelter for the night," replied the knight.
                  "We are only two unprotected females, Signor, and it were very imprudent to admit strangers without proper assurances that their motives are purely honorable."
                  "That you shall have, if permitted, lady," said the other.
                  "Hold! then a moment!" cried the voice within. In a moment a window above their heads was opened, and the head of a woman thrust out. "Now, signor, I will receive your assurances," she said.
                  "Do you doubt me now?" said Sir Maylrad, as he drew away the folds of his cloak, and disclosed the emblem of rank.
                  "O heaven! 'tis one of the king's courtiers!" came from the lady, and scarcely had a minute passed ere the door was thrown open, and Sir Maylard and his companion entered.
                  The room into which they were conducted, although not splendidly adorned, wore an air of comfort, which is sufficient to insure true happiness. The walls were lined with green Venetian prints, and in several places, bore paintings and landscapes that at once denoted the work of a master artist. A cheerful fire was burning in the grate, and cast a genial warmth through the apartment. Beside it sat a young girl.—Near twenty summers must have passed since this lovely creature first saw the light of day, and had one judged by her pale, careworn features, they would have seen that she had at one time experienced the chilling blasts of misfortune. Her person was slight, but well formed, and her dark auburn hair hung in graceful curls about her pure white forehead. The remainder of her person was in perfect accordance with what has already been described. The elder lady it would be unnecessary to describe, for every person who is blessed with a kind woman for a mother, may see her likeness before them.
                  After fastening the door, the old lady drew near the fire, where her guests had already seated themselves; and observing that the knight gazed with flashing eyes upon the young maiden, who had arisen, and was leaving the apartment, she said:
                  "Pardon me, Signor, this young lady is my daughter, Ellie Francelli; may I ask by what name you are known at court?"
                  "Lord Dungane," answered Sir Maylard, bowing without exhibiting the least sign of embarrasment.
                  "Ay, I have often heard of your excellency's kindness; and your companion?" she asked, looking at the fierce Colonel.
                  "Is Count Hirlde," said the knight. As he made this last remark, he boldly advanced toward the young girl, and taking her hand within both of his, said in a musical tone:
                  "I am extremely happy, fair Ellie, to make your acquaintance, and I sincerely hope that neither shall have cause to regret it."
                  This was said with such an air of truth and sincerity, and coming as it did from such a pleasing source, for we have already mentioned that the knight was very handsome, the young maiden could not but feel flattered and pleased, so she modestly hung down her head, blushing at the same time. This was not lost by the quick-sighted young noble, who at once attributing it to the right cause, begged her to be seated.—What could she do but comply? She, the young and artless creature, unacquainted with the vices and wickedness of the world, innocent as the unborn babe herself, she thought the remainder of mankind were the same. And had he not given his name? and was it not one of the noblest and most beloved young men among the nobility. If this was true, how could she, we say, do otherwise, and what reason had she to doubt his word? None at all. Poor Ellie; truly do we pity thee. Little dost thou think that he in whom thou resteth so much confidence, is merely a wolf in sheep's clothing who at each breath utters a falsehood; and only awaits the opportunity to destroy the innocent lamb.
                  In this way, did the innocent creature suffer herself to be led on, step by step, until the affair began to assume a more serious aspect; for while the valiant Colonel, alias Count, engaged the mother in earnest conversation in relation to the political state of the kingdom, railing out with much severity against some of the more licentious noblemen; the knight, becoming emboldened with success, and heated with passion, attempted to clasp the waist of his too willing victim, and to imprint a fervent kiss upon her lips. But he had mistaken his object; for the action had immediately betrayed his base designs to both mother and daughter.
                  "Hold, my lord! such conduct ill becomes a nobleman of your rank and pretensions, and having now overstepped the bounds of courtesy, I shall insist upon your immediate absence from my house!" exclaimed the mother, with flashing eyes. The Knight gazed silently around him for a moment, then as a shade of passion seemed to cross his proud and haughty features, he replied, in a tone of mingled scorn and contempt:
                  "Foolish woman—wert then so ignorant as for one moment to think I was the person I pretended to be; or that you could by a single word compel me to abandon the object I have in view? Know then, that he whom you thought to be the pious and benevolent Lord Dungane, is none other than Sir Maylard Calvani, the intimate friend of Juliane, King of Naples! How sounds this information in your ears, my pious mother?"
                  Upon hearing this startling announcement, both mother and daughter were for a moment paralyzed with astonishment.—They had often heard of the fame of the most noted libertine the profligate court of Naples could boast; and now when they saw him in their very presence, they could fully realize the danger wherein they stood. As soon as she could regain her speech, the elder lady attempted to cry out and give the alarm to the surrounding inhabitants; but that instant she was rudely seized from behind, and a heavy bandage passed across her face, completely stifling her cries. At the same moment that the bully seized upon the mother, the Knight turned to look after the daughter, who he found had fainted during the exciting scene that had just taken place. Snatching up her inanimate form in his arms, he bounded to the door; but finding it fastened, he ran to the one leading out into the back-yard,, and clambering over the wall with the insensible maiden still in his arms, he made his escape. The struggle between the mother and the bully was of short duration. Having succeeded in removing the bandage partly from her face, sufficiently to see her daughter borne off in the arms of the libertine, she felt herself endowed with a strength superhuman, and bursting from his grasp, with one powerful and well-directed blow, sent the bullying Col. Masquade, staggering to the further side of the apartment, where he fell heavily against the wall. Then with a wild, thrilling shriek, she rushed madly forth in pursuit of her child.
                  "Shades and shadows of a moonless midnight! I'm 'second best' once more, without scar or blemish, save an eye dreadfully 
                        buuged
                        bunged
                      up!" muttered the valiant Colonel, as he once more regained his equilibrium, and looked fearfully around him—"But by my crown, (or that of my hat) that infernal old vixen had almost demolished it entirely. But as old Father St. Marc says, 'let us not grieve over what cannot be helped.' So here's for the spoils of the victory."
                  And suiting the action to the word, he drew his long sword-blade, and using it in lieu of a crowbar, he commenced breaking open a chest that stood in one corner of the room. This had scarcely been accomplished when the front door was suddenly 
                        focerd
                        forced
                      from its hinges, and a man closely masked, sprang into the room, and confronted the astonished bully with:
                  "How now—robber, burglar, at your occupation, are ye? Where is your companion?"
                  "Spare me! spare me, good signor," exclaimed the other, trembling with fear. "I assure you I have no companion. I came alone."
                  "Liar," shouted the other, fiercely, drawing a sword from beneath the heavy folds of his cloak—"Tell me instantly who and what he is, 'ere I be tempted to take your worthless life as that of a dog!"
                  This was too much for the craven heart of the bully; so, with the fear of death staring him in the face, he gave the required information. Whereupon the other having gained all the intelligence he required, wound up the consultation by coolly kicking the Colonel out of the house, and fastening the doors to secure them from further molestation, he bent his steps towards the centre of the city. Who the masked stranger was, that appeared so opportunely, will probably be shown in a subsequent chapter of our story.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  THE WRECK.
                  
                     
                        
                           "The waves rushed madly up the sides,
                           Then swept the crowded deck:
                           A moment more the foaming tide
                           Washed o'er the silent WRECK."
                        
                     
                  
                  GARNELLE was again at sea. Again that stern and haughty chieftain stood proudly upon the quarter-deck of his noble ship, the "Sea Queen," and scanned the surface of the surrounding ocean. A few days before, they had set sail from the rendezvous, carrying with them on board their immense wealth, that had been hoarded within the cavern.
                  It was the intention of Garnelle, as soon as he had accomplished the object he had in view, to disband his crew and forsake the life he now led, for one of less peril and hardship. But alas! How soon were his hopes blasted! But let us not anticipate. It was on the third day after leaving the Island of Swezo, that a thrilling cry was heard at the mast-head of the rover vessel:
                  "Sail ho!"
                  Instantly all on deck was in confusion; and the Captain, walking hastily forward, demanded of the look-out:
                  "Where away?"
                  "Right ahead, sir," shouted the man on the look-out.
                  "What do you make her out?" again demanded Garnelle.
                  "A large ship—full rigged—and if I may judge by her decks, well manned and armed," answered the other.
                  Taking his glass from one of the men, Garnelle sprang into the rigging of his vessel, and for a few moments carefully scanned the approaching ship. Then giving it to his Lieutenant, he walked hastily aside, and muttered in an undertone to himself:—
                  "By heaven! this is too much! Who and what the commander of yonder vessel is, I know not. But this I know, he is the friend of Juliane, and that is sufficient to make him the foe of Garnelle. But that flag—bearing the inscription, 'Death to Garnelle.' He must be bold indeed that dares to wear that flag beyond the protection of the guns of Naples. By heaven! I'll make him repent the day he sought to battle with Garnelle!—Rierio."
                  "Aye, aye, sir," promptly responded the officer.
                  "See that the guns are double-charged, and ammunition and arms distributed among the men."
                  "Aye, aye, sir," and the Lieutenant bounded away to obey the instructions.
                  The captain turned, and gazed for some time upon the approaching vessel. It was not many minutes until she was within speaking distance, and every one on board of the Sea Queen could distinctly see the flag of the Neapolitan government flying from her peak, surmounted by a streamer bearing the significant inscription of "Death to Garnelle."
                  "Ship ahoy!" came ringing across the water, from on board the Neapolitan vessel.
                  "Aye, aye," answered the Lieutenant of the Sea Queen.
                  "What vessel—where from—and where bound?"
                  "The Sea Queen—Rover Isle—to Naples," responded the Lieutenant, fearlessly.
                  A sudden commotion was visible on board the Neapolitan cruiser, at this unexpected reply, and a voice shouted:
                  
                  "Then heave to, you infernal pirate, and surrender to his majesty's cruiser, 'Naples.'"
                  "Heave to yourselves, ye base hirelings of a still baser monarch!" shouted Garnelle, foaming with rage and fury, "ere we blow your cursed vessel out of the water!"
                  The only answer to this was a broadside from the other vessel, that fell short of the pirate.
                  "Velos," said Garnelle, to the old gunner who stood leaning calmly upon his old favorite, "is the long Tom charged?"
                  "It is, Captain," replied the other.
                  "Then give that cursed cruiser a shot that she will not forget in a life time," said the Captain, and the next moment the gun thundered forth a charge that shook the ocean to its centre.
                  "My God!" exclaimed the Captain of the Neapolitan cruiser, who with another officer was pacing the quarter-deck of his vessel, pausing now and then to give a word of command, "we shall be blown out of the water, as our enemy said, if we do not soon get out of reach of that heavy gun."
                  "Where is Count Valen?" asked the other, as he turned to gaze upon the pirate ship.
                  "He is here," replied a voice close beside them. The speaker was a man rather above the medium height, well formed, and if anything rather handsome than otherwise, only that his features wore rather a sinister expression. His hair and eyes were black, the latter brilliant and piercing. He was dressed in a full suit of armor.
                  "I am very glad to see you, Count Valen," said the Captain, blandly, "for just now we needed your advice. We have very unexpectedly came upon our long sought-for foe, who seems as eager for the combat as ourselves."
                  "Say you so?" demanded the other eagerly. "I am pleased, indeed, to hear it—I was fearful that we should have to give chase, and as the pirate is said to possess a vessel somewhat difficult to cope with, in that respect, I was not so sanguine of the result. All that I now desire, is to once get face to face with this villain, Garnelle when if I fail to perform my part in the scene, it will not be because I lack the will. But you are preparing to board, I see?"
                  "Yes; I am compelled to do so on account of a heavy gun our enemies have aboard, which has been playing the deuce with us," replied the Captain.
                  Scarcely had he done speaking, when another shot from the rover came tearing through the rigging, and striking the mizzen-mast near its centre caused it to fall upon the deck, killing instantly two men, and wounding several more.
                  "This is becoming too bad!" shouted the Captain. "Clear away the wreck, Cramni," he added to the helmsman. "We must board the vessel instantly. Lay us alongside her larboard—steady! So—prepare boarders—Gonsalvo, is all ready?"
                  "All, Captain," replied the Lieutenant.
                  "Then we will board, fore and aft at the same instant. Count Valen, I shall give you charge of one of the parties, while I lead the other. Steady, Cramni—boarders away!"
                  The two vessels came together with a loud crash; and the crews of each sprang forward, and engaged in a struggle of life and death. Loud and terrible was the battle-shout of the cruiser's men—"No quarter to pirates;" but louder still rang the hoarse voice of the rovers, as they yelled with demon-like fury—"Death to the nobles!" Red waved the flags above their heads; hut redder yet gleamed the swords of the combatants dyed in human blood. In the thickest of the fight the towering form of Garnelle was seen, dealing death at every blow of his sword. A dozen blows were intended for him at a time, yet they were turned harmlessly aside, while the one who wielded it fell dead at the feet of the chieftain, who seemed possessed of a charmed life.
                  Near by was a man dressed in a suit of armor who was desperately fighting his way to where Garnelle was standing. He, too, was a man of large proportions, and wielded his sword with deadly surety. They who opposed him fell as autumn leaves before the gale, and many minutes had not elapsed ere he stood face to face with the rover chief.
                  "Ha! Garnelle—pirate—I have thee at last!" he shouted, fiercely. "My dearest wish is granted. Now for revenge upon the foe of my name—the murderer of the Delvani's!"
                  The desperate blow accompanying these exclamations, was caught and parried upon the sword of the chieftain, as he replied in a tone that rang loud above the din of battle:
                  "Ho! accursed villain of an accursed race! You have sought your own doom! Didst thou think that I was unprotected? Behold I am even with thee. I, too, wear a coat of armor!" and turning aside the vesting that covered his bosom, he disclosed to view an under-shirt of mail. The secret of his remarkable preservation was explained; they wondered not, now, that their blows had fell harmless upon him. Clashed then their swords in fearful combat. Count Valen, for he it was, was the most noted and experienced swordsman in all Naples. From childhood, he had been accustomed to use the foil, and as he grew to manhood, his skill had often been required to extricate him from difficulties into which his fiery nature at times led him. Many were the victims that had fallen by his hand, and when, for the sake of wealth and power, he volunteered his services to hunt down and capture the dreaded freebooter, Garnelle, he had counted on an easy victory. He had counted his advantage, he being protected by a steel armor, but now that he found his opponent likewise armed, he began to fear for the result. He had often heard of the extraordinary powers of the one before him. They fought with the fury of demons, one for revenge, the other for self-aggrandizement. Both knew that it was a contest of life and death. Consequently every possible exertion was made to obtain the mastery.
                  Thus, for a time, it continued, and as the ring of their clashing swords was heard loud above the bloody fight that was being carried on throughout the ship, every one paused for a moment and gazed with feelings akin to awe, upon the two combatants. While they thus gazed, a strange tremor convulsed the frame of the pirate chieftain, and his before calm and determined features were clouded with a frown black as Erebus. His enemy concluding that it was fear that was agitating his bosom, set up a loud shout of victory. But the rovers knew well what to expect; they had seen him so before. Well knew they that a terrible storm was about to burst forth. But they had not long to wait!
                  Suddenly, as if awaking from a dream, Garnelle sprang forward upon his opponent, and dashing aside his weapon, as if it had been in the hands of an infant, he seized the other in his powerful arms, and with one bound reached the side of the deck: and raising him high above the bulwarks, he hurled his form headlong into the sea.
                  "Thus perish the foes of Garnelle, the Avenger!" thundered he as he turned to the amazed crew of the cruiser, who cowered beneath his terrible glance, "and now, minions of a tyrant, your time has come! You have sought Garnelle—you have found him—you have cried: no quarter to pirates; make then your peace with heaven—where shortly you must appear. Garnelle never gives quarter or expects any!"
                  So saying, he plunged forward into the midst of the foe, dealing death at every step. The cruiser's men outnumbered the rovers, by considerable. But they could not withstand the assault of the demon leader. They fled before him, and the rovers catching up the battle cry of their chief, pressed upon them, hewing them down as grass before the scythe. They retreated step by step, to the deck of their own vessel, but being closely followed, turned and made a last desperate resistance. But although many of the pirates fell, it was in vain—they were doomed!—the Avenger had spoken—no quarter was given or asked. A few moments more and not a living member of the cruiser band was left to tell the tale of the bloody conflict! Garnelle was revenged.
                  After the destruction of the men of the Neapolitan cruiser, as before related, her valuables were taken out, and the dead bodies of both sides placed on board. Then Garnelle ordered a fire to be built in her cabin, and, crowding sail upon his own vessel, he left the doomed ship to her fate.—They had not long left her sides before the fire was brought into communication with the magazine, and with a noise that shook the sea for miles around, she blew up, launching an hundred mingled corpses into the bosom of the deep, there to await the final resurrection.
                  Merrily speed the Sea Queen over the boundless blue water, that constituted her realm. Many of the pirate band had fallen in the late contest; but little cared they who remained for their fate. They mourned, it is true, the loss of their jovial company, yet they consoled themselves by thinking that each one's share of the booty would be so much the larger. When one man topples off the stage there are plenty of mourners; but 'tis to obtain his wealth that they mourn. They care not what becomes of his worm-eaten parchment, so that he leaves the "swag" behind.
                  Wild were the revels of these hardened wretches, who but a short hour before, had been engaged, hand to hand, in the work of blood. Songs were sung, legends told, and the merriment seemed at its height, when suddenly a cry was heard, as fearful as portentous, that caused many a heart to leap wildly in the bosom of its bearer.
                  "All hands on deck, to take in sail!"
                  In an instant every soul was crowded on deck. O, then what a thrilling sight met their gaze! The ship was rushing madly forward, at a furious rate, every stitch of canvas spread almost to bursting, while these tall, slender masts, that but a moment before were so straight and pliant, were bent beneath the fury of the gale—ready, at each moment, to snap assunder. Garnelle was there, trumpet in hand, urging his men to their duty.
                  "Down with the main-sail," shouted he, in thunder-like tones that rang loudly above the howling of the tempest. "Hold hard—stand ye firm at the helm, or we are lost! Every rag of canvas must be furled! Steadily, cheerily, my men, if ye wish to live an instant longer."
                  Instantly, a dozen dark forms sprang into the rigging to obey the command, but, alas! it was too late!
                  The crisis of the storm had come. Down, down, as if she was seeking the bottom of the ocean, passed that noble bark, sinking her bows, each moment, still deeper into its depths. Then, a loud dreadful crash was heard, as the main and mizzen-mast both went crashing by the board, sweeping and crushing half the guilty crew in its fall. One moment more, the waves washed over the deck, and Garnelle saw that only about a dozen of his crew were there. O, then, what a fearful cry went up from those guilty wretches, as they beheld their helpless situation! The ship being, by the last surge, cleared of the falling masts and spars, now lifted herself from the depths of the water, and once more dashed onward, seeming to defy the power of the elements. Then, for an instant, hope once more found a place in the bosoms of those left upon her decks; for could she only manage to ride out the storm in safety, they were saved. But it was only momentary, for the next instant the cry of "breakers!" was on every lip. But it was in vain they cried—they possessed no means to avoid the danger threatened. Then there was a terrific crash, as the bows of the vessel were lifted high out of the water, and instantly all was silent save the howling of the tempest and they roar of the waves, as they lashed the rugged rocks that marked the spot where the Rover ship had disappeared.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  THE CAPTIVES.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Despair shall round their souls be twined,
                           And drink the vigor of their mind:
                           As round the oak rank icy cleaves,
                           Steals its sap, and blasts its leaves."
                        
                     
                  
                  Take we now our readers to the proud, gay city of Naples. The shadows of evening were falling gloomily upon the earth, hiding from view the beauties of nature and art. Naples lay stretched out along the sea-coast, her numerous magnificent edifices enshrouded in the pall of night, giving them a specter-like appearance. In the saloon of one of her proudest mansions were seated two persons, conversing in tones that denoted extreme excitement. One was a richly dressed nobleman, it would seem near forty years of age; the other a beautiful young lady of scarce twenty. The young lady was beautiful in the extreme. Hair dark, glossy and curling—features regular and extremely classic—eyes black and piercing, combined with a form neatly moulded and bewitchingly lovely, were charms easier imagined than described; so we shall not attempt it. The nobleman was dressed after the most fashionable mode of the day, and his bearing denoted one of high rank. In height he was near the medium, and although regular, his features could not with any propriety have been termed handsome.
                  At the moment we would introduce our readers, he was kneeling at the feet of the beautiful lady, who, with a cold, melancholy look, heard his humble protestations of love.
                  "O, lady!" spoke he, in a tone as musical as he could command, "am I then doomed to bitter disappointment? Are my bright and flattering prospects to be forever blasted? Must I look quietly on and see thee become the bride of another? Say lady, that you mean not what you have just uttered! Say that thou wilt be mine, then will I be happy."
                  "Urge me not longer, Signor," replied the maiden, while a bright tear glistened in either eye. "Already have I told you that you could not win my love. I would be thy friend, Signor, but I can promise nothing else. Forget me, I implore thee; seek some one better calculated to make you happy, for in my heart I know that I cannot!"
                  "Is there no hope for me to gain your affections?" asked the nobleman, coolly rising to his feet, while a singular expression crossed his working features.
                  "None, Signor—none," answered the maiden, in a fervent tone.
                  "Then further 
                        disguse
                        disguise
                      is useless, Lady Irene Martino; you have refused the offers of one who has a right to demand your hand; I will now inform you that I, Juliane Delvani, am King of Naples, and as you do not choose to become willingly mine, you shall be mine by force. Ho! Carloe!"
                  Instantly a side door was thrown open, and two persons, dressed in the royal livery, rushed into the room. With a wild shriek the gentle Irene Martino sank into a swoon.
                  "Slaves," said the monarch, for he it was, "lift ye the form of this maiden carefully in your arms, and follow me instantly; and mind ye, that she utters no cry, or your lives will pay the penalty."
                  "Your majesty need not fear for us," replied one of the men.
                  "Then, by my crown! be hasty; we may be discovered," muttered Juliane, wrapping his heavy cloak about his form as he left the mansion, followed by the two attendants bearing the inanimate body of the gentle and wronged maiden.
                  Juliane Delvani, the King of Naples, sat in the private room of his palace—a gorgeous chandelier, suspended from the ceiling, threw a brilliant light over the scene—mirrors and sofas, of the most costly material adorned the apartment. The marble floor was covered with a most magnificent Turkey carpet, and the walls were lined with crimson velvet. The King sat beside a table covered with books and papers; but his thoughts were elsewhere. He soliloquised:
                  "Thus my revenge is almost complete.—My foes have fallen before me like the reed before the gale. The father first—then the son—and I became the King. But the mysterious disappearance of that crown is something I would almost give my right arm to solve; but it is of little import. It must have been lost on the night—ha! that fearful, terrible night—when—but no matter; it is past and gone now; I am King, and the only living member of that hated rival house of Martino is in my power. But one thing that troubles my mind is the fiendish hatred of this Garnelle, the Avenger. Four of my name have already fallen by his dreadful hand, and Heaven grant that Count Valen may not be the fifth. I tremble to think what might have been his fate ere this. Perhaps I may be his next victim.—Why it is that this fiend of blood has chosen my name on which to reek his terrible vengeance, I know not. That deep secret, that is said to be locked up in his bosom alone, must be the key to the mystery. Would to God that he was now before me, that I might wring it from him. He must be captured—his work of blood must cease. Until this is so, Juliane Delvani's throne is not safe beneath him. Ho! Carloe."
                  The next instant the door opened, and admitted one of the men who had assisted in the abduction of Irene Martino.
                  "Slave," uttered the monarch, haughtily, "have you seen my orders obeyed? Have you placed the two maidens together?"
                  "I have, your majesty," responded the other briefly.
                  "'Tis well, Carloe. Go you now and inform sir Maylard Calvani that I would see him immediately."
                  "I go, your majesty." And again the monarch was alone.
                  At the time the foregoing took place, quite a different scene was enacted in another apartment of the royal palace. It was the meeting of two long separated 
                        frienes
                        friends
                     —Irene Martino and Ellie Francelli, the sister of Pierre. After the first emotions of joy had passed, Ellie, looking up through her tears into the face of her gentle companion, said, in a sweet, melancholy tone:
                  "Is it possible, Lady Irene, that you, too, are a prisoner here?"
                  "Ay, yes, it is too true; but since I have met thee to share my lot, I feel less sad, and can endure my imprisonment with greater fortitude. But how happens it that you are hear? Let me hear your story; and in return I will give thee mine," replied Irene.
                  "My story is easily told," began Ellie, with a sigh. "At the time of your noble 
                        fatherss
                        father's
                      death, we were living, as you are aware, in our mountain home. When my brother Pierre heard that your brother—" here Ellie paused, and drew a deep sigh that told how much she lamented that event.
                  "Go on, dear Ellie; I can easily appreciate your feelings," interrupted Irene, kindly, while the tears started from her eyes.
                  Thus encouraged, the fair girl continued:
                  "When Pierre heard of that terrible event, he resolved that no means should be left untried toward discovering his lost friend. But it was in vain he searched.—Years have passed, but he is yet unsuccessful. A short time ago, being suddenly called to the land of our nativity, ancient and loved Greece, he removed myself and mother into the city. We have lived in a very retired manner. I scarcely ever ventured out in the city, and when I did so, it was in company with my mother, who was very fearful that my beauty would attract the notice of some of the wicked courtiers of King Juliane. But, alas! the fears of my kind mother were too soon realized. That most reckless and daring of all, Sir Maylard Calvani, encountered me in one of my walks, and determined to make me his victim. Need I tell you how, when my brother was far away, he came, and in spite of the feeble resistance of myself and mother carried me hither for purposes only known to himself. And my poor mother! God only knows what will become of her in my absence. May He protect and avenge the wronged and oppressed."
                  "Amen," uttered Irene, fervently—then, after a few moments' silence on the part of both, she said:
                  "My story is a brief one; you can imagine my grief—losing, as I did, at one cruel blow, the kind protection of a father and brother. I immediately shut myself out from the society of the world, and devoted myself to study and meditation. But this did not last long—I pined again for the world, to mingle in society, and hear once more the voices of the gay and happy. But it has been my ruin. The King sought my hand in marriage; I refused him.—To-night he again urged his suit, and met with a similar reception. But he had come well prepared, in case I should refuse his offers, which he had every reason to expect. It has terminated to his entire satisfaction, and Irene Martino is a prisoner, as well as yourself."
                  For some moments afterward neither spoke. The recollections of the past seemed to crowd upon the minds of each in such minuteness, that the most trivial events of their lives seemed to pass again before their gaze. Memory, that sacred treasure of the past, smiled once more upon them, and unfolded to their sight the many invaluable relies of by-gone days. The silence was broken at last by Ellie, who spoke as follows:
                  "Lady Irene, the situation in which we are placed at this time is certainly one of imminent peril, yet if we place proper confidence in Him who rules all things, I am persuaded all will yet end in a way that may be desirable to both. Cannot you turn aside your fears, and at least appear to be happy? Then would I feel more like making exertions to escape."
                  "I fully appreciate your kind motives, dear Ellie," replied Irene, "but you know not half the sadness that dwells within my heart. You have a kind mother and a protecting brother—these are the objects that urge you to live; but I am an orphan—no mother's care or brother's love is left me now; no father's wise council or directing hand is before me. I, Ellie, am truly an orphan! Can you blame me now for feeling sad?"
                  "No, lady, I could not. But something seems to whisper in my ear there is happiness yet in store for us both. They say that the 'darkest hour is the hour before day,' and may this not be our 'dark hour?' May it not be the fore-runner of joy and happiness? Let us hope, Irene; it is our only consolation."
                  "You are a wise, generous, and noble soul, Ellie," said Irene, throwing her arms around the other's neck and kissing her, "though it will be of little avail, I will for your sake, take your advice. I will hope."
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  THE BRAVO OF NAPLES.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Dark is the robe which wraps his form,
                           And tall his plume of gory red;
                           His voice is like the rising storm,
                           But light and trackless is his tread."
                        
                     
                  
                  The King of Naples and his favorite noble and companion, Sir Maylard Calvani, were seated in the palace of the former the second evening after the events narrated in our last chapter. They had just dismissed a man in the garb of a sailor, who had been making some important revelations, if we might be permitted to judge by the manner of each. "Thank Heaven, then," exclaimed Juliane, "I am at last ridden of my fearful enemy. This fellow says that he saw the wreck of his vessel near the coast of Sicily, during the late dreadful storm. But sadly do I fear that the ship of Count Valen has met with a similar fate; or what is worse still, been overpowered by Garnelle ere he perished."
                  "Far better had they met with a watery grave. But 'tis useless to mourn—let me rather rejoice that by his death I have escaped a dreadful fate. What a devil incarnate Garnelle was."
                  "He was, most assuredly, your majesty," replied the Knight," "but if report speaks the truth, there is an individual now in Naples who bids fair to rival, if not surpass, him."
                  "Say you so!" demanded the Monarch, hastily; "I am all anxiety to know who he is. Naples is becoming filled with these daring bravos, and an honest man durst not venture out without being strongly escorted. I hope the one you speak of is not another dreadful enemy of mine, seeking revenge?"
                  "If I am correctly informed," said Sir Maylard, "you have guessed the nature of the case precisely. There is a person now in the city who professes to be at enmity with your majesty, and if he but possesses half the character which is attributed to him, he is indeed to be feared."
                  "By my crown, this is something new to me!" almost shouted the monarch, leaping to his feet, and rapidly pacing the room, "did you

                      who he was, Sir Maylard?"
                  "I did not, your majesty," said Calvani, in a calm tone, which seemed to be part of his nature. "Of his past life, no information has been obtained. He goes by the name of Rio Rinaldo, and partly by his huge form and dreadful threats, he has been dubbed the 'Bravo of Naples."'
                  "Ah! does the villain publicly threaten our royal power?" exclaimed the King, starting with something like fear depicted on his features. "This matter demands instant attention. The bold traitor must be arrested."
                  "From what I have learned, I am led to think that it will require some exertion to get him into your power," said Sir Maylard, smiling at the nervousness of his monarch. "It is said that a few evenings ago, while publicly harranguing the people upon the present state of your majesty's government, he was suddenly surrounded by a body of your troops, who endeavored to take him prisoner, but he instantly drew his sword, and in defiance of all their efforts, cut his way through all their ranks, as though they were mere children, and effected his escape, no one knew whither. He is greatly respected by the people, and it is rumored that he is connected with a conspiracy to overthrow the Kingdom."
                  "Maleditto! this bravo of whom you speak must be another Garnelle," exclaimed the King, in great excitement; "but though he were a fiend from Pandemonium, he should not escape the punishment due all traitors. Sir Maylard, see that all measures are taken to secure his arrest as speedily as possible. I would not have my subjects tampered with too far, even by a bravo."
                  "I understand, your majesty," replied the Knight, as he arose and left the King alone.
                  Again it was night. Through the dimly lighted streets of Naples strode a man of powerful size. His upper person was enveloped in a heavy cloak, scarcely reaching to his knees, while a huge pair of goat-skin boots, with laced tops, encased his lower extremities. His head was covered with a broad sombrero, from which waved a long black feather, casting a shade over his dark, fiercely chiseled features. A mass of dark auburn hair fell down about his shoulders in wild confusion, giving him a singular appearance. A broad morocco belt around his waist bristled with daggers and pistols, and supported a sword, whose dimensions fully corresponded with that of its wearer.
                  Passing rapidly along the street, he paused at last before a large mansion, and knocked thrice upon the oaken door. The entrance was in a few moments cautiously opened, and a voice demanded.
                  "What wisheth thou here?"
                  "Justice," replied the bravo.
                  Upon giving this reply, he was instantly admitted.
                  We will take the liberty of entering also, and observing what takes place within the house. In an apartment, lighted by the rays of a single lamp, around a table covered with papers and writing materials, were seated at least a dozen persons. Their dress and bearing denoted them to be men of considerable rank and power in the Neapolitan Government; and as a general thing they were persons whose hair was frosted by long service. Some there were, however, that were just entering upon their career, and seemed in the enjoyment of their brightest hours. For what they were assembled may be learned from the remarks of one of the number, who seemed to be the leading individual among them. He rose and said:
                  "Noblemen of Naples, we are again assembled in secret session to endeavor to plan some mode by which we may rescue our beloved country from tyranny and misrule. For a long time have we patiently borne the heave yoke—submitted quietly to every wrong and indignity; but the time has come at last when there must be a change. The people have spoken and said that we must have a new ruler. We have undertaken to accomplish the work that is to bring such an event about. But, Signors, in order to do this, we must act speedily and cautiously. We may be branded as traitors, as conspirators; but when we consider that we are on the side of right and justice, we can bear all. Is it not so Signors?"
                  "It is," replied the others, instantly.
                  "Then let us proceed to business, for the evening is already far advanced," remarked the old noble; and, as the conversation that followed would be of little interest to the reader, we will only state that it was about an hour afterward that they were interrupted by the entrance of the bravo.
                  "So, so, gentlemen, you are all here once more," remarked Rio Rinaldo, lifting up the broad brim of his sombrero, and partially disclosing his dark features—"here to plot; but it is almost time to act. The flame is already kindled, and unless it bursts forth in power it may be quenched in its infancy."
                  "What mean you, Sir Bravo?" asked several of the conspirators at once.
                  "I mean," replied Rio, calmly, "that, by some means, information has reached the King that there is a conspiracy maturing against the Government, and, if we do not act with speed and caution, all our plans may be frustrated."
                  At this announcement several of the nobles turned pale and trembled upon their seats; but, not appearing to notice it, the bravo continued:
                  "But, although, as I said, Juliane had been informed that there is such an object in contemplation, he is, as yet, unacquainted with the progenitors. So, my masters, you may rest easy yet awhile, for, as long as Rio Rinaldo remains with you, there is no danger. But, I would inquire if you have completed your arrangements for the rebellion?"
                  "All is in readiness at any moment," replied one of the nobles.
                  "Then," said the powerful bravo, looking upward and seeming to invoke the assistance of Heaven, "may it speedily come! Then will the tyrant be made to feel that power does not rest in a crown alone, without the love of the people to sustain it.—The blood-stained victims of wrong and oppression seem to arise from the silent tomb and cry aloud for vengeance. Helpless females and orphan children, weeping over the graves of those near and dear, demand our aid; and shall we refuse it? No! the red hand of retribution is near. It will fall heavily upon the oppressors. Then, and not till then, will Rio Rinaldo be revenged."
                  This strange speech seemed to have considerable effect upon the nobles; and, as he concluded, the one who seemed the principal man among them, who was addressed as Don Emariel Salvados, approached, and laying his hand upon the shoulder of the swarthy bravo, said:
                  "Yours, strange man, must have been a deep and foul wrong, to make you harbor such fearful hatred against your foes. And being, as we are, so closely connected with you in the work of right and justice, we fain would know something of thy past life, so that we may sympathize with thee, at least. Confide in us, Rio Rinaldo, and if there be any way in which we can assist thee, it shall be done."
                  For a moment the stalwart form of the bravo trembled, as with emotion, but mastering his feelings with a powerful effort, he brushed a bright tear-drop from either eye, and replied:
                  "I thank you, my noble sir, for your kind feelings and intentions toward one who, I assure you, has been deeply wronged; yet I must decline giving you the information desired. It is a secret that must remain an inmate of my own bosom alone until the proper moment arrives for its disclosure.—That time may come, and it may never. If it does, you will doubtless become acquaint-with it; it not, it will perish with me. But I must leave you Signors, as I have other work before me to-night. So farewell, and may Heaven prosper our cause."
                  So saying, Rio Rinaldo bowed low to the astonished noblemen, and in a moment more had left the apartment.
                  "Strange being," murmured Don Emariel to himself. "There is a deeply hidden mystery connected with his life. He is not what he seems to be; of that I am fully assured. But I suppose that we will have to wait until he chooses to reveal his secret."
                  After a short consultation the meeting of the conspirators was dissolved, and the light being extinguished, each one sought his home in silence."
                  We will follow the bravo. Passing from the house where he had met the conspirators, Rio Rinaldo directed his course toward the palace of Juliane, King of Naples. Arriving at an open space of ground some distance below the palace, the bravo, who seemed to be perfectly conversant with the place, entered a small hut or habitation that stood in the center. After searching around amid the darkness for a few moments, he found a tinder-box, with which he quickly made a light; and from under a bundle of moss that lay in one corner of the room, he drew a dark lantern, which most probably he had secreted there for purposes of his own.
                  Lighting this he crossed to the other side of the room, and kneeling down upon the stone floor, drew from his belt a long dagger. This done, he inserted the point between the edges of two large stones, which had scarcely been done when one of the huge flags moved aside, disclosing the entrance of a subterranean passage. The bravo then took up his lamp, and, wrapping his cloak about his form, descended into the dark vault, closing the entrance behind him.
                  We would claim your attention once more, dear readers, in the private apartment of the King of Naples. On the night that witnessed the event related, Juliane sat alone in his private chamber. He sat before a fire that but feebly burned within the grate, and, with his head resting upon, his hands, seemed lost in deep meditation. Upon a marble stand that sat beside him, lay a rapier of the finest Milan steel and the most exquisite workmanship. For some time he sat thus, in silent commune with his own thoughts, until he was aroused suddenly by a hand being laid heavily upon his shoulder. Quick as the frightened chamois sprang he to his feet, and, grasping his sword, turned upon the disturber of his meditations with:
                  "Ho! villain. Who dares, thus unannounced, to seek the presence of Juliane, King of Naples?"
                  "I dare!" came in calm tones from the unknown.
                  "Then who art thou, scoundrel? Speak, ere I call assistance, and have thee dragged to the rack."
                  "I am one that fears not your threats, base monarch; one that defies your power. I am Rio Rinaldo."
                  "The Bravo of Naples?" shouted the King, trembling with rage and fear. "By Heaven, you have sealed your doom. Ho! without."
                  With this he attempted to reach the bell-rope, to alarm his attendants, but was prevented from so doing by the powerful bravo, who, dashing aside his drawn sword, pushed him back into the chair from which he had risen.
                  "What would you do with me, bold intruder?" asked the monarch, finding that farther resistance was useless, and would only bring harm to himself.
                  "I will not detain you long, Juliane Delvani," replied the bravo, sternly, trying to control a passion that seemed fiercely raging within him, "but will at once let you know the object of my visit. Within the last few days two gentle maidens of Naples have been forcibly abducted from their homes and confined by villains possessing rank and wealth, but devoid of every honorable principle."
                  "Thou liest, knave!" exclaimed Juliane, fiercely. "No nobleman has been so engaged."
                  The brow of the bravo darkened as he replied:
                  "I agree with your majesty there. No noble-man would be guilty of such base conduct. But, there be those in the court of King Juliane who bear a name they are not entitled to. But reply is useless. You are aware that the two maidens referred to, Irene Martino and Ellie Francelli, are within this mansion, and when I inform you that Rio Rinaldo demands their instant release, I trust it may be done."
                  "By my crown! this is too much to bear," cried the monarch, trembling with passion. "Do you dare to dictate to me? Do you know to whom you speak?"
                  "Ay, well do I know thee, Juliane Delvini," replied the bravo fearlessly.
                  "Too well, perhaps, for your good," he added significantly. "But I must not dally longer. Will you inform me how I may find the chamber of the maidens confined within these walls."
                  "By seeking it. You gain no information from me," answered the monarch savagely.
                  "Then, Juliane Delvani, your last moment has come," said Rio Rinaldo, drawing from his belt a long dagger, and advancing toward the trembling monarch.
                  "O, mercy? spare me!" shrieked the latter, as he noticed the dark and almost fiendish expression that rested upon the features of the bravo. "Spare only my life, and you shall have all you desire."
                  "Give me the key of their apartment; 'tis all I ask," replied the bravo, calmly.
                  "Here, here it is; take it—for the love of Heaven leave me. I would be alone," said Juliane, producing a bunch of keys.
                  "With pleasure, my most gracious Sovereign," replied the bravo, with mock-dignity taking the key, and at the same time sheathing his weapon. "But before I go, I insist upon securing for your majesty an easy resting-place for the remainder of the night." So saying, in spite of the other's resistance, Rio Rinaldo bound his royal companion, hand and foot, and after placing a delicate gag in his throat to prevent an alarm, he touched a secret spring in the wall of the apartment, which disclosed a sliding panel, through which he disappeared as quickly as he had come.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IX.
                  THE TRAITOR'S DOOM.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Ho! base villain'" he loudly cried.
                           "I have thee, by my crown!"
                           In blood his sword was dyed,
                           That sealed the TRAITOR'S DOOM.
                        
                     
                  
                  Our readers will perhaps remember the oath of Bernardo, the private Lieutenant, at the close of a 
                        preceeding
                        preceding
                      chapter, wherein he vowed to be revenged upon the traitor Turkill, who so basely sold the lives of his comrades; and they will also recollect that during the carousal in the cavern of the rovers, that he was entrusted with a treasure, and certain instructions concerning it, by Garnelle, the pirate Captain.—This latter he promised faithfully to perform, and shortly afterward he set out alone in a small boat toward Naples, where at last, after considerable peril and hardship, he arrived in safety. Having assumed a disguise, so that he might not be recognized, he commenced searching the whereabouts of his old enemy. It was not long before he discovered that the traitor Turkill had assumed another name, and was acting as a spy or tool of Juliane. This rendered his object more difficult to accomplish; and although he narrowly watched the motions of his intended victim, for a long time he was unsuccessful. But fortune, that fickle goddess, seemed at last to favor him. He happily formed an acquaintance with the terrible Rio Rinaldo, whose dreaded name was in every person's mouth, and from him obtained the information that Turkill, or as he was now known Carloe Venoradi, would be at a certain spot on the sea-coast, to assist in some villainy, which the reckless young nobles were almost constantly engaged in. This was precisely what he desired; and on the evening following the events of our last chapter, disguising himself as an humble fisherman, and well armed, he left his abode, and strode carelessly through the streets of Naples, intending to redeem his vow by ridding the world of one of the vilest characters that wears the human form—a traitor. With his head bent forward, as if in deep meditation, he walked rapidly onward, not seeming conscious that many suspicious glances were cast upon him by those he passed.—Just when at last he found himself grasped by a powerful arm, he seemed to recollect where he was, and turning fiercely around, he asked in one of the mildest tones:
                  "What mean you by thus rudely detaining me, sirrah! Would you rob me of my purse?"
                  "Maleditto!" exclaimed the other, clapping his hand furiously on the hilt of his sword; 'do you apply epithets to me—you low-born scoundrel? By the beard of Mahomet! I'll cleave thy head from thy shoulders."
                  "Cease, pratling fool! and permit me to pass, or rest the consequences upon your own head," said Bernardo, in a fierce tone.
                  "Ho! insulting dog," shouted the other, drawing a sword of tremendous length, with which he performed sundry flourishes above his head to the imminent danger of his neck. "Do you dare to say that to my face? I, who received the strokes of knighthood from the hand of Alexander the Great—I, who, for my bravery and daring, have received the thanks of a nation? Do you dare to repeat it?"
                  "Fool—stand aside," thundered Bernardo do, leaping forward, and with one powerful blow of his doubled hand, he laid the bullying Col. Masquade, who the reader has probably recognized, upon the earth. Then swiftly passing onward, he was soon beyond the gates of the city.
                  Some distance beyond the city of Naples, at the time we date our story, where the waves wildly lash the rocky shores, and where all vegetation has ceased to exist, on account of the frequent eruptions of Mt. Vesuvius, is a barren, rocky promontory, that extends for some distance out into the sea; forming, on one side, a rude bay or basin, where could be seen at all times, numerous boats and vessels, of light tonnage, riding safely at anchor. At the time of which we write, these vessels were owned by that class of individuals who make their living by shipping contraband goods from one port to another, without respecting the duty that, by the customs of nations, had been established. Although not of sufficient force to be deemed anyways formidable, yet they had become a source of considerable annoyance to the authorities of Naples.
                  On the evening in consideration, a man about the medium height, wrapped in a heavy cloak, was pacing slowly to and fro upon the promontory just described. Without pausing for a further description of the person we would introduce, we will merely state, what the reader has already surmised, that it was Marlate Turkill.
                  In his solitary walk, he uttered forth his feelings in the following soliloquy:
                  "So, it seems, I am still the slave of circumstance; still a traitor to my comrades and my better motives. When, for the sake of wealth, I sold the lives of my comrades, it was with the expectation of being instantly endowed with the power of a Prince.—But, alas! how were my expectations realized? Instead of a palace, I found a prison; and, instead of being made the equal of my pretended friends, I was made a slave.—They were thankful for my services, but scorned to level themselves with a traitor—traitor! Ay, I am a traitor, and so shall remain until my death. I have been revenged, deeply revenged. When Garnelle, for a breach of trust, compelled me to receive a dozen lashes on my naked back, I deeply swore that he should feel my vengeance. But, though my hand deprived him not of life, I am satisfied. My oath is canceled."
                  "So now, shall be mine; infernal traitors!" exclaimed a deep voice beside him.
                  The sword of Turkill flashed from its scabbard. "Who art thou, that thus menaces me, villain?" he shouted.
                  "I am one that knows the well, Marlate Turkill," replied the other, stepping forward and disclosing the tall form of Bernardo. "One that knows thee to be a consummate villain as well as a traitor! Cannot you recognize me now?"
                  "Bernardo, the Lieutenant!" exclaimed the traitor, in astonishment. "Does death allow its victims to return again to earth? But," added he, in a tone that resembled the hissing of a serpent, "be thou man or demon, living or dead, thou shalt not escape me now. Have at you, unto death!"
                  Their swords crossed each other, and a terrible contest began. Loudly roared the waves, as they dashed against the rugged rocks at their feet; but they heeded it not; They were fighting for a wager; that wager was life! The combatants were equally matched in size, and armed alike. The traitor fought with a determination that told he was determined to conquer or die, while his opponent was cool and collected, parrying the other's blows upon his weapon, seeming to await an advantage that would place the traitor within his power. At last with a dexterous movement, Bernardo succeeded is disarming his opponent, and sent his sword ringing into the air, some distance from where they were standing.
                  "Now, traitor," said he, in a hoarse voice, "your last moment has arrived.—Your betrayed, murdered comrades, shall be avenged. Kneel down, thou dark and damnable villain, and ask forgiveness of the God thou hast so greatly wronged!"
                  "Mercy, mercy!" shrieked the guilty man, as he sank down upon his knees, and for the first time, probably, in his life, raised his hands in a supplicating manner toward Heaven.
                  "Marlate Turkill, there is no mercy on earth for thee—thou must seek it on high," calmly replied the other.
                  "Oh, Heaven! must I thus die? Give me but an hour longer," entreated the doomed wretch.
                  "Not a minute," was the stern response.
                  "But I am not prepared to die!" pleaded the victim.
                  "Then thou wilt never be. Marlate Turkill, didst thou think of this when thou so basely betrayed thy comrades, and sent them to that place where thy guilty soul must shortly appear?"
                  "Mercy, mercy!" shrieked the traitor, as the other drew a pistol and presented it at his head.'
                  "Go, base traitor, and ask mercy of those thou hast wronged: I have none to give thee."
                  For a moment the scene was lighted up with the flash of a pistol, and the traitor, leaping wildly into the air, with a yell, fell back a lifeless corpse.
                  Scarcely had Turkill ceased to exist, when the stern avenger was aroused by the sound of footsteps approaching him. In another moment he was confronted by two persons, in one of whom he recognized the braggadocio, Col. Masquade.
                  "How now?" exclaimed the companion of the bully, who appeared, by his bearing, to be one of considerable rank; "what meaneth this bloody encounter?"
                  "It means that I have just ridden the world of one of the vilest villains that ever existed," answered Bernardo, calmly.
                  "I am thinking that the King will not thank you much for your pains," remarked the other, in a tone of sternness, "so I shall take the liberty of arresting you to prevent your doing more harm."
                  "By whose authority do you act?" exclaimed Bernardo, his anger beginning to gain control over him.
                  "My own," replied he, haughtily.
                  "And who are you, sir?" shouted the Lieutenant, fiercely.
                  "I am Sir Maylard Calvani, plebian!" answered the young noble, for he it was.
                  "Maylard Calvani!" uttered Bernardo, starting—then seeming to muse, he muttered:
                  "I could have almost sworn it was he—but how altered—yet how noble looking—how proud and haughty—so much like his father."
                  "What mean you by these strange words. Sirrah?" demanded the Knight, who had overheard the other's soliloquy.
                  "Sir Maylard," said the other, in a tone that made the cavalier start, "you have heard words that I unconsciously uttered, and have demanded an explanation—you shall have it."
                  "Years ago you had a father, his name was Laroni Calvani. He was a man of great wealth and influence in the Kingdom; and was also the bosom friend of Don Fernando Martino. At the time when the houses of Martino and Delvani were rivals for the royal power, your father was Chief of the "People's Council," and was accused by Juliane with acting an unfair part, by securing the throne to Don Fernando. For this, when Juliane afterward came into power, on the sudden death of Don Fernando and his son, your father was banished to the lonely isle of Sardinia for life, where, it was reported, he died.
                  "Reported?" interrupted the young nobleman, trembling in spite of himself; "my father did die, and his remains were buried in honor in the family vaults."
                  "Listen, Sir Maylard," said Bernardo, in a voice that slightly trembled: "the remains of Sir Laroni were not buried, as you were led to believe. It was only a ruse of Juliane, to secure his malicious ends. He hired a couple of villains to take the life of your father, while, to hide the deed, a coffin containing some heavy substance was brought to Naples, and buried, as you are aware."
                  "O, Heaven! my noble, wronged parent! can this be so?" said Sir Maylard, wiping the tears from his eyes.
                  "You shall quickly know," replied the other, as he continued: "It happened that the villains who had been employed by Juliane to murder your father were members of a noted band of rovers, congregated in and about the Lipari Islands, commanded by one Garnelle, who is well known to every one by his deeds of daring. They concluded, before putting him to death, to conduct him before their chief, and hear his decision in regard to the matter. They did so, and upon learning who the prisoner was, Garnelle willed that his life should be spared. Not daring again to return to Naples, he assumed the dress of a rover and served as one of the band. Unfortunately he was among those who were surprised by the troops of the King Juliane, through the base betrayal of the villain who lies at my feet; but by feigning death he saved his life."
                  "The proof! Where is my noble parent now?" shouted Sir Maylard, as he grasped the other by the arm.
                  Bernardo replied not, but throwing aside his fisher's garments, he tore off the pale, haggard mask and bushy hair that hid his face, disclosing a set of noble looking features, over which fell the few frosted hairs that time had left. Then did they recognize the rich dress of a Neapolitan nobleman! One moment more, and with a wild cry of delight, Sir Maylard darted forward and was clasped in the embrace of Laroni Calvani!
                  "By the soul of Hannibal!" exclaimed Col. Masquade, who stood by in silence, "this beats all my campaigns with Alexander the Great."
               
               
                  CHAPTER X.
                  THE ESCAPE.
                  
                     
                        
                           "I made a footing in the wall,
                           It was therefrom to escape;
                           I pined to break 
                                 conefinment's
                                 confinement's
                               thrall,
                           My prison became so desolate."
                        
                     
                  
                  "COURAGE, Irene—there is still hope," said the noble-hearted Ellie Francelli to her more timid companion, Irene Martino. At the time the fearless girl spoke as above, she was kneeling down beside a small trap-door that she had just succeeded in raising from the floor of the room in which they were confined. In one hand she held a lamp, for it was night without, with which she endeavored to pierce the gloom which enveloped every thing below. Her dark auburn hair hung loosely down her marble neck and shoulders, wafted about upon the wings of a chilling breeze that swept up from the dark passage. Her features were pale—extremely so; yet upon them at the moment beamed the bright light of hope.—But alas! how soon was it to vanish.
                  "What discovery have you made, Ellie?" asked Irene, who was seated at one of the windows, weeping bitterly.
                  "I cannot say that I have made any discovery, Irene," replied the other, "yet I have come to the conclusion that if we would escape, now is our chance. It will require some firmness, to be sure, in undertaking to find our way out of this gloomy vault; but when we consider that perhaps our lives, and, Irene, what is a thousand times more valuable—our honor—is at stake, we cannot risk too much."
                  "My God! No. Let us away, Ellie," cried Irene, starting to her feet, "let us rather die in a cold, damp dungeon, than remain one hour longer in the power of our captors? Let us endure cold, hunger, anything else but that! Lead the way, noble girl, and I will follow. If I displayed an unwillingness a moment ago, it was only because my fears overruled my judgment."
                  Having secured themselves from the cold as much as possibly by wrapping their cloaks about them, Ellie took up the lamp, and, followed by Irene, slowly descended the slimy steps into the subterranean passage. It was indeed a dreary place. The walls and floor were grown over with moss, while the damp, chilling breeze that whistled through the crevices, combined with the dropping water upon the moss covered flags, gave forth a dull melancholy sound, in contrast with the almost death-like silence that reigned throughout the vault.—But the fugitives wandered on, they knew not wither, regardless of everything else, so that they escaped from the powers of their persecutors. Thoughtless creatures! In their haste on quitting the dungeon, they had neglected to fasten the trap-door through which they had escaped. Still they hurried onward, Ellie urging the weak and timid Irene so retain her strength a few minutes longer, as they would most probably reach the outlet of the passage.—Thus encouraged, Irene struggled onward, but was fast losing strength. At last, when her physical powers had become almost exhausted, and she was about sinking to the earth, Ellie cried:
                  "One moment longer, Irene! Do you not see that light beaming along the passage? For the sake of Heaven do not give up here! One minute more and we are saved!"
                  With a powerful effort Irene struggled forward, supported by her heroic companion, to whom the prospect of freedom gave a strength almost superhuman; but the hopes that had been so suddenly inspired, as quickly vanished, for heavy footsteps were heard behind them, Then, the fearful mistake they had committed by leaving the door unclosed was brought vividly to their minds, and Ellie uttered wildly:
                  "We are lost! We are pursued!" and she sank to the earth insensible, with the lifeless form of Irene Martino clasped in her embrace.
                  How long Ellie remained unconscious she could not tell; but when at last she opened her eyes a tall form was bending over her holding in one hand a vessel of water, with which he was sprinkling her face.—As soon as he observed that she had recovered he sat the water down beside her, and remarked, in a tone that contrasted singularly with his giant form, for it was mild and pleasant:
                  "Near nothing, lady, you are with a friend."
                  "Then who are you, noble sir, that befriends me thus?" said Ellie, gazing upon the other with 
                        astonisement
                        astonishment
                     .
                  "It matters little who, or what I am, lady," was the reply, "so that I am a friend to the oppressed and a foe to the oppressor. I would be thy protector, for I see that thou needest one at this time.—Trust me, lady, and harm shall not come to thee. But thy companion here must have attention. Take this vessel of water and sprinkle her face, while I go and see if the passage is clear for our removal."
                  In a few minutes he returned, and Irene, having recovered from her swoon, he bade them follow him. This they quickly did, and in a few moments were in the open air, some distance from their place of confinement.
                  Swiftly leading the way, the mysterious guide was followed by the two girls. All was silent. The few stars that were shining in the sky overhead, for the night was far advanced, sent forth but feeble rays to light the pathway of the fugitives. Yet they cared not—they were free! For some time they wandered through the deserted streets, with which the guide seemed perfectly familiar, in order, as he said, to avoid the police, who he seemed not anxious to meet. At last they paused before a 
                        magnificant
                        magnificent
                      structure, which Irene instantly recognised as her own.
                  "Thank Heaven! we are once more safe," uttered Irene, fervently.
                  As she said this, the strange being who had accompanied them stepped forward, and, taking the bell-rope, gave it a ring, which was shortly answered by a servant of the house. Great was his surprise and delight upon meeting his lost mistress.—Soon afterward they were ushered into a splendid apartment of the mansion, and the two maidens, overcome by their feelings, sank down upon their knees, and silently, but seriously returned their warmest thanks for the timely escape, to that Being who never deserts the innocent in the hour of peril.
                  And that strange, dark-featured man, about whom was wrapped so much mystery—as he gazed upon their upturned features, and saw their lips move in silent prayer, a sudden tremor shook his giant frame, and tears—hot, scalding tears—ran down his sun-burned cheeks. Brushing them hastily aside, he turned and would have left them alone, had he not been prevented by Irene, who said:
                  "Stay, strange man; ere you leave us I would know by what name we may designate our preserver? I would know why you have so interested yourself in our behalf."
                  "Lady, it were much better perhaps that my name remain unknown to you; but as you have asked it, I cannot deny you.—When, lady, you hear the dreaded name of Rio Rinaldo mentioned, may you think that among all his bad deeds he has at least done one that humanity will not blush to own."
                  "Then are you, indeed, the fearful bravo?" asked Irene, shuddering, as she gazed upon his towering form.
                  "So I am often called, lady," said Rio Rinaldo, calmly, "but whether I deserve the appellation I am not to say. My reasons for rescuing you from the power of the King, I cannot explain—you may perhaps learn at some future day. But, before I go let me give you a word of caution. Yourself and companion must remain in close concealment for a few days at least; so that no one, save those of your attendants on whom you can rely, may know of your whereabouts. There is a storm gathering over this wicked city, and in a short time it will burst forth. Its effects will be terrible, yet if you follow my advice you shall not be harmed. The time has come when a heavy blow must be struck, and wo be to those upon whom it falls. O, Naples—land of my nativity—my wrongs and revenge—how dearly, how devotedly do I love thee: and I have deeply sworn, and that oath is registered on High, that I will not desert thee until thy tyrant rulers are laid low in the dust, and my wrongs are fearfully avenged."
                  "Noble man," exclaimed Irene, quickly "I will pray that your fondest desire may be realized. I, too, have deep wrongs to avenge, yet I have entrusted that vengeance to one on High, who has promised that justice shall be done. I only await the time when I may leave a world where there is so much wickedness, and join the spirits of my devoted parents, and brother, in the bright realms above."
                  "Say not so, lady; there is a dark cloud at this moment veiling your future destiny, which will disappear as suddenly as it came and there will meet your gaze a scene as unexpected as pleasant. Cheer up, Irene Martino, for happiness is yet there. Think not that Rio Rinaldo speaks without a cause."
                  The singular words uttered by the bravo had considerable effect upon the one to whom they were addressed. She raised up her tearful eyes to ask the meaning of his strange words, but the towering form of Rio Rinaldo had disappeared.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XI.
                  THE REBELLION.
                  
                     
                        
                           "By torch and trumpet fast arrayed,
                           Each warrior drew his battle blade,
                           And furious every charger neighed,
                           To join the dreadful revelry.
                        
                     
                  
                  AGAIN the sun rose in all its pride and splendor. It was the morning of the day when the King's banquet was to take place. At an early hour the streets of Naples were crowded with the peasantry of the surrounding country, so that it was impossible to pass. The lumbering of heavy vehicles over the stony pavement; the rattling of the coach wheels added to the shouts and boisterous laughter of the multitude, created such a din as was never heard before. Altogether a strange scene was presented.
                  Here rode the splendidly clad cavalier, dressed in a full suit of glittering armor; virtue and vice were mingled together without distinction. In the largest and most magnificent hall in the palace of Juliane, King of Naples, were assembled the wealth, beauty and chivalry of the realm.—At one extremity of the hall, upon an elevated divan, surrounded by his numerous courtiers and attendants, carelessly reclined the ruler of the "Two Sicilies." He was dressed in a flowing robe of satin, and upon his head rested the crown that made him powerful. But Juliane was far from being happy and contented, although he wore a careless, indifferent air. And truly had he cause to feel ill at ease. He had just received intelligence that there had been a riot in a portion of the city between the troops and citizens; and that, having become enraged, the latter were arming themselves for an open rebellion. Well knew he that his government was not liked by the 
                        massess
                        masses
                     , and he had every reason to believe that a majority of the nobility were unfavorable to his cause; and as he sat, upon the day of the banquet, and gazed around him, he thought that he could detect in the careless bearing of many a noble a secret expression, which, could it have uttered forth n words, would have spoken treason.
                  The monarch feared—he almost felt his throne tremble beneath him, and the crown that decked his brow fall at his feet. One thing made him fear more for the result of the rebellion, was the fact that Rio Rinaldo the dreaded scourge of Naples was reported to be engaged in it; and well knew he that no person in the kingdom was so well beloved by the people or 
                        pessessed
                        possessed
                      more influence with them than the strange bravo.—He saw at a glance that Rio Rinaldi held more power than himself.
                  For this reason had a reward of several thousand sequins been offered for his capture. But it was in vain; though they searched the city from one extremity to the other, no one was fortunate enough to capture him and claim the reward.
                  On the morning of the banquet, all the government troops had been ordered out, to be in readiness to quell a rising of the people, which it was evident was about to take place. The avenues leading from the palace were thronged with soldiers, in showy uniform, whose brightly polished arms glistened in the sunlight, presenting the appearance of a wall of steel.
                  Meanwhile, a grand feast was going on within the palace. Stern, warlike cavaliers were there, mingled with fair ladies, all dement ment, was covered with the choicest dishes to be procured, while the wines were the finest manufactured in Italy. All were apparently enjoying themselves in the best possible manner: and if one unhappy person was there, it could not be told from the expression of his features.
                  But there were those there who hid, behind smiling faces, and gay voices, feelings of anxiety. These were the conspirators.—They knew that a great blow was to be struck, and, should their enterprise fail, they need not expect mercy. Thus it was when the sound of firing and clashing of swords were heard not far off from the palace walls, they had almost betrayed themselves by their eagerness to behold what they knew was taking place. Instantly the hall, where a short time before all was so joyous and happy, was deserted, and many of the cavaliers rushing forth, engaged in the fierce struggle that was going on.
                  The King, with the greater part of the nobility, repaired to the balconies, where they could overlook the contest. The assaulting party were well armed, and outnumbered the soldiers two to one. They were principally peasants and mountaineers who were inured to hardships, and the remainder, of the laboring classes of the city. The desperateness with which they made the attack upon the soldiers promised success; but the next moment they were repulsed by the superior arms and discipline of the latter. Foremost in the ranks of the rebels rode a man on a milk white charger, who seemed to be the first in command. He was powerfully built, and wielded his heavy sword with dreadful precision.
                  Wherever was seen his tall black plume waving, was death and destruction dealt at every blow of his terrible arm. When the eye of the monarch rested upon this dreadful champion a fierce expression clouded his pale features, and instantly calling an attendant to his side, he exclaimed:
                  "Slave! Go instantly, and send Guy Velli, the marksman hither."
                  The attendant immediately disappeared, and in a short time the most noted marksman in Naples, Guy Velli, stood in the presence of Juliane.
                  "Would you like to make your fortune in a few minutes, Sir Marksman?" asked the monarch, so as not to be heard by those around him.
                  "Yes, sir," replied Guy, bowing low, "provided it will please your Majesty. May I inquire what your Majesty would have me do?"
                  "Look," said Juliane, pointing toward the ranks of the rebels, who were rallying under the example of their daring leader. "Do you not see that dark featured person, who rides the white charger?"
                  "I do, your Majesty; he is equal to a regiment, alone," replied the marksman, in a tone of admiration.
                  "Then I would have you take your weapon and pick him off," said the King in a low voice.
                  "It shall be done, your Majesty," responded Guy.
                  "Here, then, is a purse of gold; when you have completed the business you shall have ten times the amount."
                  "A thousand thanks, your Majesty," answered the marksman, eagerly accepting the purse; then kissing the hand of the monarch, he left the apartment.
                  As he stepped forth from the palace, he muttered to himself:
                  "I kill the leader of the rebels? shoot the friend of the people, and the foe of the tyrant? I could not resist taking the purse, though, for I need it badly. But may Heaven injure my eye-sight and palsy my hand if I ever intentionally harm one hair of Rio Rinaldo's head."
                  Eagerly did Juliane watch the contest between the troops and the rebels, for on its termination rested his fate. But when he saw his soldiers falling like grass before the scythe, his hopes forever vanished, and his heart sank within him. At this moment the rebels were reinforced by a large body of men on horseback, which struck the remaining soldiers with such a panic that his heart sank within him. At this moment the rebels were reinforced by a large body of men on horseback, which struck the remaining soldiers with such a panic that they threw down their arms and begged for quarter, which was given. Then came the long, loud shout of victory, that told Juliane Delvani was no longer a King!
                  Upon finding that the day was lost, the nobles who were still friendly to Juliane drew their swords and crowded around the throne, where he had retired, swearing to die in his defence.
                  At this moment a loud noise was heard at the entrance, and shortly afterward Rio Rinaldo, followed by several of the captured nobles entered the hall. The King turned deadly pale and sank back on his couch, while every person in the vast apartment gazed with fear and astonishment upon the giant form of the bravo.
                  With a proud—haughty step he strode down the isle to the foot of the throne, and calmly unbuckling his sword belt, he laid his arms at the feet of the monarch, as he said:
                  "Juliane Delvani, you have often wished to have the 'Bravo of Naples' in your power—now has your time come. Behold him here, unarmed!" For a moment the King gazed wildly around him; observing no one near him but friends, he leaped to his feet and shouted:
                  "Ho! Sir Cavaliers! seize the bold traitor!"
                  Instantly a score of swords flashed from their scabbards, and their owners sprang forward to obey the mandate; but as quickly paused with 
                        astonisment
                        astonishment
                      at what they beheld. Where, but an instant before, had stood the daring bravo, towered aloft the gigantic and terrible form of Garnelle, the Avenger!
                  Stern and haughty stood he there—that daring chieftain—the dread of the land and sea; and as he gazed around him, he smiled a grim smile.
                  "Why start ye back, bold Cavaliers?" he said, in a mild voice, that strangely contrasted with his person. "Does a mere change of costume so startle ye? Think ye now that I am Garnelle, the rover, I am more to be feared than when thou didst call me Rio Rinaldo, the bravo?" Then turning toward the trembling monarch, he cried
                  "Ho! Juliane of Naples, what think ye now of the power of your old enemy? But tremble not. Though thou art the last of thy race, and deserveth my vengeance most of all—yet for the sake of her thou didst so foully wrong, will I spare thy life."
                  During the time that Garnelle was speaking, a strange emotion seemed to affect the fallen monarch, who suddenly arose from his couch and staggered feebly toward the spot where the pirate chief was standing.
                  "Who—who are you?" he whispered in a hoarse voice.
                  "Garnelle, the Avenger," answered the other, calmly.
                  "But—but you are something else beside a pirate! Tell me, quickly, who and what you are?"
                  "Behold, then!" said Garnelle. In an instant the heavy steel armor that protected his form was thrown aside, and a second mask was torn from his face, disclosing a set of features almost feminine, and the dress of a Neapolitan prince and nobleman.
                  "My God! the prince! For—forgive me!" shrieked the unhappy Juliane, as he slowly sank back upon the floor. Before assistance had reached him, his guilty soul had gone to meet its kindred spirits above. Naples was without a ruler.
                  The silence was again broken by the entrance of several noblemen of high rank, among whom was Sir Laroni Calvani, who; upon being recognized by the assembled nobles, was greeted with shouts of applause. These having in a measure subsided, the old noble ascended the throne, and, taking the hand of the newly found-prince within his own, he placed upon his bare head a crown of pure gold, that sparkled with the cost liest diamonds, and said:
                  "Nobles of Naples, behold your rightful King! He who wears the 'Crown ofDiamonds,' the direct heir of the house of Martino!"
                  For a moment all was silent as the grave. Then burst forth such a shout as was never heard in those walls before:
                  "Long live Marco Martino, our King!"
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER XII.
                  CONCLUSION.
                  
                     
                        
                           "My pen is at the bottom of a page,
                           Which being finished, here the story ends:
                           'Tis to be wished it had been sooner done,
                           But stories somehow lengthen when begun."
                        
                     
                  
                  SILENCE being once more restored throughout the crowded hall, Marco Martino, the long-lost Prince, advanced a few steps in order to view the excited audience, and throwing back the long dark curls that clustered around his noble brow, and had once marked the terrible avenger, Garnelle, spoke as follows:
                  "Noblemen of Naples—You may and have cause to feel surprised at the strange transformation that has just taken place, and as an explanation is due, I will at once proceed, in as brief a manner as possible, to review the strange circumstances that have brought it about. Years ago, as you are aware, when I was a youth, my father, Don Fernando Martino, the then King of Naples, was discovered one morning dead in his bed from some unknown cause. At the same time I disappeared in a mysterious manner, and it was generally supposed that I had perished in the forest, where at the time I was engaged in hunting.
                  "This, though, was not the case. While in the forest, near the sea-shore, I was suddenly attacked by some ruffians in the garb of seamen or smugglers, who, disarming me, bound my hands and feet and carried me on board a small vessel that was anchored some distance off the coast. Not long afterward I found out that they were a part of a band of rovers, whose rendezvous was located in the Lipari Islands, and the vessel I was on board of was commanded by their chief in person, the noted Garnelle.
                  It being proposed that my life should be spared on the conditions that I would become a member of the piratical fraternity, I accepted them rather than lose my life, trusting that chance might furnish me a way of escape. For a long time I remained with the rovers, and by my bravery had been promoted to the second in command by Garnelle, who had become much attached to me. In an engagement at last with one of the Neapolitan cruisers, Garnelle was mortally wounded. Just before his death he called me to his bed-side, and confessed that he had been hired by Juliane Delvani, our deadly enemy, to strangle my father in his sleep, and afterwards capture myself and murder me. This he had intended to do, but admiring my manly form and reckless, daring disposition, he had been induced to spare my life on my consenting to join his band. He also informed me that on the night he had murdered my father, he had discovered the crown which my father wore—and being tempted by its immense value he had carried it off. This he now gave into my charge, and asking me to forgive him the deep wrong which he had done me, his guilty soul took its flight from the immediate body.
                  "The rovers were now without a leader, and I being the next in command, was unanimously proclaimed their Chief. This was what I desired, for, upon learning that Juliane Delvani, to accomplish his base desires, had murdered my kind and noble parent, I swore a deep and lasting oath that until his death was avenged my arm should know not mercy. I immediately assumed the name of the fallen chief, and procuring a mask to resemble his features as near as possible, I was afterwards known by no other name than Garnelle, the Avenger.
                  "For several years did I pursue my work of vengeance, and, having grown to a herculean size, the name of the terrible rover became the dread of the land and sea. One after another of the house of Delvani fell beneath my hand, until at last but two remained, the King and Count Valen. One day some of my men, who had been cruising about the Island of Sardinia, brought a person to the rendezvous, and informed me that they had been bribed by Juliane Delvani to put him to death. This excited my suspicion, and made me desirous of knowing who the person was who had so incurred the hatred of Juliane. Accordingly I ordered that he might be brought before me. What, then, was my astonishment, when I recognized in the prisoner the person of Sir Laronii Calvani, who, some years before, had been banished from Naples because he was a warm 
                        friond
                        friend
                      of my father. Upon finding out who he was I immediately discovered my secret to him, and he, not daring to exhibit himself in Naples, assumed the dress of one of my followers, and, under the name of Bernardo, took charge of one of my bands. In this state of affairs I continued until a part of my men were surprised and destroyed by the troops of the King. Bernardo, who was in command of the rendezvous at the time, only escaped by feigning death. Then did I swear that the 'name of Delvani should swim out of the world in blood.' My vow has been redeemed. On the night that I returned and found my crew so basely murdered, I entrusted the casket containing the 'Crown of Diamonds' in the hands of Bernardo, directing him how to proceed in case I should fall into the hands of my enemies. With this valuable charge he left the rendezvous, and shortly afterward arrived in Naples. In a few days I again went to sea, and encountered the vessel of Count Valen Delvani. I destroyed her and every soul on board. But my triumph was of a short duration; a terrible storm came upon us and drove the vessel upon some breakers, on the northern coast of Sicily, where every soul perished save myself, I being washed ashore insensible and was picked up by some wreckers who lived close by. With these men I remained until I had entirely recovered my strength, without being recognized, and at last procured a passage to Naples.
                  "Here I procured another disguise, and, in the character of Rio Rinaldo soon had the city in a dreadful uproar, by threats of vengeance. I mingled with all classes, disguised in every manner, so that no one who saw me once could recognise me again.—

                        Having
                      some time before discovered that a conspiracy against the Government, among some of the dissatisfied noblemen, was on foot. I managed to league myself with them, and to-day have succeeded in wresting the power from one of the basest tyrants that has ever existed.
                  "I am aware that I have committed deeds that, in the sight of the law, would deserve punishment, and now, if you, nobles of Naples, demand my life in return, it is in your power. Speak—have you aught against me?"
                  "No!" came in thundering tones from a thousand throats; and those who stood without the palace, catching the shout made the very vault of Heaven echo with:—
                  "Long live Marco Martino, the Hero of the Two Masks!"
                  Then arose the proud, stern form of the newly made King, and, as his towering person trembled with emotions of gratitude and joy, he exclaimed in fervent tones:
                  "Oh, Naples! though long have I suffered from thy wrongs and ingratitude, I love thee still,; and I solemnly swear to protect thee, so long as flows one drop of blood in my veins!"
                  
                  A few days afterward, a gay and happy concourse were assembled in the magnificent hall in the Palace of Martino. It was to witness the crowning of the nuptials of Marco Martino, the King of Naples and the beautiful Donna Ellie Francelli. After the ceremony had been performed, the happy monarch led forward to the altar his blushing ing sister, Irene, and placing her hand within that of a splendid looking cavalier, who wore the dress of a Grecian nobleman, he said:
                  "Don Pierre Francelli, in exchange for the lovely being thou callest sister, I give thee a prize that is far more valuable than gold or fame. Take her, for she loves thee and may heaven smile on ye both and make ye happy."
                  The gray-haired priest then performed a second ceremony that made Don Pierre and Lady Irene one forever.
                  As some further explanation may be deemed necessary by our readers, we will give it in as few words as possible. The father of Pierre and Ellie Francelli was an exiled nobleman, who, for a suspected crime had been banished for life from Greece, his native land. It was afterwards ascertained that he had been wrongfully condemned and by way of reparation, young Pierre was permitted to return and regain the honors taken from his parent. His descendants, for centuries afterward, occupied proud positions in the history of that ancient country. Marco Martino enjoyed a long and happy reign, and never had cause to regret that he had been the hero of the Two Masks, since it had brought about the consumation of his fondest desires.
                  Reader, our tale is done—our moral is drawn. Though vice and iniquity may, for a while, triumph over virtue, it will not always remain so. Retribution will over take them at last. The latter will receive its reward, the former its

               —OR.—THE VICTIM OF A VITIATED SOCIETY.
               BY EDWIN F. ROBERTS.
               
                  STAGE I.
                  THE STATION HOUSE.
                  THE attention of a thinking man is naturally drawn by certain events that now and then take place in society, those particular epochs of individual distress occur from the abuse of power and wealth, ending in a catastrophe of crimes; something, in fact, which makes men gaze, wonder, or horror-struck around them, while on carrying their thoughts back to the motive power—the final cause—they are astonished to discover in the criminal neither more nor less than a victim to the social system.
                  The conventions of society have established barriers between classes of men which are as absolute and arbitrary as the distinctions that have existed in despotic empires. Look, for instance, at that awful gap which lies between the low, the poor, the degraded, the artizan, the weaver, the miner, and the wealthy commoner and the aristocrat. It is not by drawing invidious comparisons that our purpose will be answered. By considering the literal fact alone, we shall arrive at the definite conclusion we are aiming at. If we show to men that they are giving a premium for vice, and at the same time turning their backs upon honest and patiently-enduring industry, we shall open their eyes to the homicidal fact of their annually sacrificing a number of innocent human beings in the neglect paid to their welfare. We have taken up a crusade against poverty, and we end by making the victim to this warfare a criminal. We have blasted his hopes and his energies, and have crippled all his soul within him by the very institution that should protect him, and have created a bitter and inextinguishable hatred in his heart. We have made a band of outlaws who carry on a guerilla warfare against us in the very hearts of our cities. It is intended to illustrate the working of this evil principle through the medium of the following story.
                  
                  "I am very cold, Richard," said the poor wife, as she drew the scanty clothing round her shivering form, on one Saturday afternoon, at the latter end of autumn.
                  
                  The husband, who sat by the mean bedside, and whose wan and poverty-stricken cheeks betrayed his own sufferings, heaved a deep sigh, as he aided her in gathering the clothes nearer to her feeble limbs.
                  "I am hungry, father," moaned out a little girl, who was almost hidden under the bed-clothes, nestling, as well as she could, in the mother's bosom. "I am hungry, father; give me some bread."
                  "Wait a little, my child," answered the agonized parent; "I shall finish my work soon, and then you shall have some;" and he at once rose up and applied himself to his labor.
                  On a little table, in a variety of old cups, was a quantity of colors; the gay hues of the carnation, the blue, the yellow, the pink, vividly contrasting with the dark and dingy colors of the damp walls, the tattered clothing, the broken chair or two; and above all, with the empty and dirty grate; for it was evident that the neat hand of the woman had not been about the chamber of late.
                  The man had been brought up as a painter; and though possessing more than a mediocre skill in his art, yet he had been unable to realise the visions of his youth, his ambitious dreams of honor and of prosperity were for ever vanished; and he was now compelled to turn his ingenuity to the making of artificial flowers, which, at one time, proved the means of a decent subsistence; but the greatly increasing numbers also engaged in that business, caused a ruinous fall in the prices allowed for them, so that it became but one step from beggary. The father was finishing a small order which he had received, and which was in a manner already forespent; for there were coals to purchase, food to be procured, the rent to pay; and, in fact, the amount he was to receive was barely enough to supply them with present necessities.
                  The man, whose name was Richard Rivers; was about thirty-five years of age. His face still retained the traces of its manly beauty, which had captivated the heart of his wife in days gone by. His forehead was lofty and wide, and bore the impress of an intelligent and cultivated mind. There was a 
                        morunful
                        mournful
                      sadness spread over the mild and melancholy features, however, which spoke of hope broken after hope, till his heart had sickened, and was now almost dead within him: still, without repining, and bearing up against the destitution that was like a huge snake curling around him, he went on with his work.
                  Not far from the table sat a pale-faced, interesting-looking lad, of about twelve years of age. His lips were thin and almost bloodless; his fresh youth appeared to have been suddenly destroyed by the iron hand of penury. The hollow eyes spoke of hunger; the thin hands of weakness; and his whole aspect expressed a debility which had withered the bold and joyous gaiety of the boy, and suddenly darkened the first glimpse of sunshine that his young life had known.
                  He was weaving some bits of velvet, cut in the form of leaves or the petals of flowers upon stems of wire, and, with taste and dexterity, forming an elegant flower which might, in some measure, give to the faded beauty of the ball-room a touch of a more youthful spring-time than she could look for now. If one were to follow that flower from its making to its ultimate destiny, one would gather, from the contrast and variety of "hands" through which it passed, some useful and grave lesson. From those thin and trembling fingers it goes to the large millinery establishments, where "white slavery" to a frightful extent is carried on before our eyes: thus, preparing, oh! ye poor mothers! a path for your worn daughters, in which they go shuddering forward to their destiny with no hope of saving them! Thence to the opera-box, on the bold brows of the coquette; and again, with other castoff articles, through the hands of the lady's maid; from her it passes by other channels till you discover it retouched—retrimmed in the shops of Russell Court, or at any other places where second-hand finery is to be picked up. But to return.
                  It was evening. The grey twilight without, which, because it was November weather, was giving place to that thick gloom—a combination of fog, rain, and smoke—which characterises the metropolis when the autumn is gradually merging into the winter. An empty grate and a foodless cupboard completed the dreariness of this dreary room, that was on the third floor of a house situated in the densest part of which Clare Market may be said to form the centre.
                  The man, with a sigh of weariness, at last passed his hand across his brow, and bade the young boy "Get a light." Henry instantly rose, and hunting about, in a few minutes found the remains of a candle, which he carried down stairs in order to obtain a light; and, while he was absent, the husband walked softly to the bed, sat sideways upon it, and gently laying his hand on the head of his wife, breathed a blessing upon it, as he touched her hair with his lips; and in silence he began to caress it.—Not a word was spoken by either, for they feared to utter a complaint on either side which might irritate a distress already breaking upon human powers of endurance.
                  In a few minutes the boy came back with a light, and placed it on the table. The father returned to his work, and for another half hour not a syllable broke upon the silence within that room.
                  One by one the boy handed to his father the flowers he had twined, whose rapid and dexterious hand imparted to them (with a small hair pencil) the life-like hues of Nature. Mechanically thus that monotonous work went on for an hour more.
                  At this time the wife was distinctly heard to draw one of those long, shivering sighs, which a deep but suppressed sobbing forces from the very bottom of the heart; and the little child also uttered a long, low moan of pain, such as when heard, would make one wish for the power of a beneficent genius in order to sooth the pang which wrings it forth. The boy glanced quickly up, and a flush crossed his pale cheeks.
                  "Mind your work, Henry," said the father in a calm tone, though his own working features betrayed a profound emotion.—Without another word he placed the flowers out of his hand, and went to the bedside.
                  "What is the matter, Charlotte?" he asked in a low voice, while he trembled from the effect of some unknown fear from head to foot.
                  "I don't know, Richard," answered the woman, faintly; "but I am afraid that the poor child is dying."
                  To draw the clothes from over the child's face was the work of an instant; to examine its pallid features occupied another; but the grateful father internally thanked Heaven, when he found that the little girl from hunger and weariness had only fallen into a sound sleep, and had nestled into the mother's bosom, even while uttering that faint cry.
                  For a while longer, then, this was a 
                        relie
                        relief
                      to their laden souls. The mother kissing the child, unmurmuringly rested her head back on the pillow, and the husband once more applied himself to his task, while the boy, whose emotions had almost paralysed him, only by the twitching of his lips, and the tears in his eyes betraying how much he was affected, proceeded without any other exhibition of feeling with his manipulation.
                  "I have finished now," observed Rivers, as he began to pack the glowing flowers in a pasteboard box; "and I shall only be away about half-an-hour. When your mother awakens, Henry, do you attend to her, and say I shall bring some food home with me."
                  "Yes, father," was the boy's answer, as his father drew on his hat and left the room.
                  The moment that Richard Rivers had descended the stairs, the boy rose up, went to the bed, and placing his two arms round his mother's neck, with a firm voice said, "Mother I am going out." She started from her slumber.
                  "Why, Henry? where are you going to?" she asked.
                  "To Goody Barnes's," replied the boy; "she knows that I am honest. She will let me have some oranges on trust, in order to sell them. I can then pay her for them, and perhaps bring a few pence home. Father has gone with the flowers, and will soon be back."
                  "My poor boy, you are dreaming," responded the poor woman; "she will not heed your request—she cannot afford it."
                  "Mother, I am not dreaming—I almost wish I was; but do not stop me," returned Henry. "Father will not be long, and I can do nothing now, unless I do that; and," continued he, "the people will be coming out of the theatre about that time. I may have a chance as well as any other. So kiss me, and wish me luck;" and he bent his head down to hers.
                  "May God bless you," said the mother fervently, as she pressed her lips on his cheek. "I know that you are anxious to do something, and I hope you may succeed."
                  "How is Maria?" asked Henry, as he took his cap.
                  "Fast asleep—the poor child," was the answer.
                  "Well, courage dear mother, I shall not be very long," and then with a quick step he left the spot and hastened to the little shop at the neighboring street corner. There he found Judy Barnes (for she was a warm-hearted Irishwoman) busied in her shop dispensing to her little 
                        custumers
                        customers
                      the several articles required of her; chattering in her queer way to the lisping fry at the counter, and evidently in a very good humor.
                  "Arrah! you small spalpeen," began Judy, the moment Henry entered; "and what does be makin' you look as wild as a Connemara cat to-night?"
                  "I want you to let me have some oranges on trust, Judy," began the boy impetuously.
                  "On trust! Now the heavens be above us," broke in Judy, astonished at his impudence, as it at first appeared.
                  "To sell," continued Henry. "I'll pay you for them—I will indeed," added he; "and you know that I cannot tell you a lie." The boy held up his hands imploringly.—The Irish woman was amazed at the earnestness of the boy's manner, at his pale and sickly face, whereon was written anxiety and impatience. "Faith! I know you'll not tell me a lie any how," replied she, in perplexity; "but by this and by that," added Judy, "I don't understand it at all, at all. To sell?" added she, with emphasis. "What does the boy mean?"
                  "Mother's ill—very ill," sad Henry, with feverish haste, almost wringing his hands in despair. "And little Maria has been crying for bread, but she's asleep now," added he, quickly, as if a proud impulse had been stung by the confession; "but—and—I mean—will you let me have a dozen or two to take to the theatre door and sell; perhaps I may get a few pence, and bring you the money you charge for them."
                  "The mother ill, and the child wanting bread!" muttered Judy. "Blessed angels bud this is tearin' grief—the poor boy," added she, laying her two hands on the counter, and gazing in his face with an expression of mingled pity and terror; "and his father can talk Latin like the priest, too;" this was the climax; for Judy could conceive of no predicament so profoundly distressing.
                  "Will you let me have them, Goody?" asked Henry, in a tone so entreating, yet so distressing, that the kind heart of the woman appeared to be wrung by the very cruelty of her delay.
                  "Will I let you have them?" she repeated: "to be sure I will, and a thousand welcomes, the craythers;" and without hesitation the fruit-woman took down a small basket, and began to fill it with her choicest fruit; for Judy, be it known, had somewhat of a reputation. "Tis for the mother. My blessin' on him for id," muttered Judy, as she piled the basket up. "I'm a poor widow," added she—"but there ye are, and if you never pay me a traneen, I'll not ax you for it. I'll only charge you a farthing a-piece for them," added Judy; "and you can get a halfpenny for each."
                  Henry, with many thanks, scampered off, and very soon the boy was standing among a crowd of others at the front of the theatre, as a number of people were elbowing and pushing their way, filling the whole space without for a short time, and gradually thinning as they passed into the taverns for refreshments, while the bolder of the fruit venders were pressing up their wares, Henry also, in a timid voice, said, "Please to buy my oranges—two for a penny!" unmindful of policeman Z, who happened to be in the immediate vicinity.
                  The boy had disposed of most of his fruit before the astounded official could recover the shock which the lad's audacity had given him; but when he did so, it was with an accumulated portion of indignant authority. Stalking up to Henry, his checks purpled with anger and disgust, he tapped him heavily on the shoulder, and said, "Come, young fellow, you must move off here."
                  Henry started: with some instinctive dread he gazed into the policeman's cloudy face; but it was a look of such utter astonishment, that Z growled out, "Was there ever sich an audacious young vagibond? Don't you hear me speak?" he added, in a sharper tone.
                  "Yes, sir," answered the boy; "but I don't understand—"
                  "Oh! come now, that gammon wont do for me. You must move on," was the surly reply.
                  "But—" began the boy, trying to think what he had done.
                  "Well, I'm blest if he ain't going to talk me over," muttered Z, starting back, and surveying this rebellious orange boy.
                  "I can't sell my oranges if I go away," said Henry, ingenuously.
                  Had a thunderbolt fallen at his feet, Z could not have been more astounded: he was almost exploding with the voiceless indignation that filled him.
                  A crowd of ragged urchins, who with their fruit baskets, had deferentially moved away at Z's approach, now a little emboldened, gradually drew nearer to the scene. Some few murmurs of encouragement, regarding the "little un's pluck," were also heard. This was decisive; for, almost furious, the man seized Henry by the arm, and demanded, "Are you going?"
                  "What wrong am I doing?" asked the boy, with a calm boldness that staggered Z, who, still more enraged at the jeers and laughter which came from the crowd, replied, "What are you doing?—you'll soon see—you're breaking the police regilations, you're obstructing the people—and—"
                  "I am only selling my oranges." persisted the boy; "therefore let go my arm—you are hurting me."
                  "Blest if I don't hurt you a little more 'fore I've done with you," cried Z; and he immediately began to drag him away. The boy, though utterly confounded at this singular attack, without any attempt at resistance, permitted himself to be taken to the station-house by his captor.
                  Some of his remaining oranges had been scattered by the man's rude hand into the street; and the crushed basket was triumphantly borne by Z to the inspector, as a witness of the boy's determined opposition, and his open defiance to the laws.
                  The charge was made and booked after the usual manner. A question or two was asked of Henry, who felt a fiery blood circling round his young heart, and he answered them in a manner to bring down the animadversion of the saturnine and dark-featured "officer of the night." "Take and lock him up," said he; and the zealous Z hastened to obey the order.
                  "Locked up!" shrieked the boy in affright. "What am I to be locked up for?"
                  "Take him away," repeated the officer; "he's an old offender, I can see;" and despite of Henry's cries and entreaties, he was carried through the yard; there, the heavy bolts of a cell being undrawn, he was thrust in, and the massive door fell back with a clang that chilled the poor boy's heart.
                  For a moment he stood rooted to the spot, in the middle of the floor, every faculty suspended by astonishment, fear, and rage, a silent, implacable rage, that neither shouted, nor wept, but seethed within that young bosom till it was wound to an unnatural tension by the deadly passion, for the first time, moving him.
                  It passed all his comprehension why he should have been dragged in so ignominious a manner, and thrust, as his instinct informed him, among the very refuse of the streets. The boy had been brought up in what might be termed a refined atmosphere of thought. He heard the purest and the correctest language from his parents daily, no matter how mean was the roof that sheltered them. That good breeding, which never deserts a man to whom custom and habitude had made it a second nature, was before Henry's eyes; while vulgarity—that is, the vulgarity of the vicious—shocked him; and his having been made to think at so early an age, had given him a bolder bearing, together with more decisive and characteristic traits than are usual at his age. Who can tell where innocence sometimes folds up its snowy wings? Here he was—and on Saturday night, too! no hope, no chance until Monday for release. Here he was—guilty of what? It might confound you, good reader, to reply, as much as it did the boy; but it is a notorious fact for all that.
                  As he became a little more accustomed to the light which faintly struggled through the narrow wicket, by the reflection thrown from the opposite wall of the paved yard, he began to stare around him, moved by some feeling of curiosity in despite of the cold which made his teeth chatter, and the ferocious indignation, which still coursed fiercely round his young heart.
                  Upon a wooden bench, lay extended the huge, burly form of a man, whose limbs and stature indicated the proportions of a Hercules. His face was not seen as it was buried in his hands; and the indistinct light of the policeman's lantern passing to and fro, threw so transient a gleam upon his clothing that no conjecture could be formed from that, as to what he was.
                  Another, with his back against a wall, his legs sprawling across the floor, and his head sunk on his chest, apparently in a fit of drunken 
                        sommolency
                        somnolency
                      was stationed close by the door. From his dress he seemed to be some dissipated artizan, who, instead of taking his week's wages home to his wife and family, had wound up his revel in this brutal hole.
                  The dim outline of one or two others might have been traced, seated in a stupor on the forms, or endeavoring to hug themselves into a broken slumber on the ground. One was blaspheming in a distant corner, and another was breaking out now and then with the chorus of some vile bacchanalian song.
                  Here was a goodly company for a young and uncontaminated boy,—one a thief, another a smasher, another a drunkard, another,—it is impossible to define all; but here was an innocent lad thrust for two nights and a day, doomed to hear all the fearful and disgusting language that passed between them, a witness of that frightful jocularity which is so expressive of the sang froid of vice, of vice that has grown hardened, reckless, and, in fact, complete.
                  The boy's passion, which rose up against the tyrannic justice thus dealt him, for a while made him proudly bear up against the hideous suspense. He still had in his pocket, at least, the amount he was indebted to Judy Barnes, and this was the only ray of comfort that shone upon him.
               
               
                  STAGE II.
                  THE TREADMILL.
                  AT last Henry began to creep slowly towards one of the forms, when he was nearly thrown down by the outstretched leg of the drunken man, who started up, and with an oath, would have felled him to the earth, in his rage, but that the tall figure first described, half rolled itself off, and striking the other a severe blow in the throat, sent him all-fours into the corner.
                  "Can't you leave the boy alone, you ugly brute," he muttered half aloud; and then savagely added, "What's brought you here?" turning to Henry, with a frown.
                  "I was selling oranges in the street," began the boy, alarmed at the tumult he had created; "and," continued he, "the policeman brought me here."
                  "Hallo! come, don't gammon me," cried the man suddenly; "here! let me see your face," and he took him by the arm, and led him before the wicket, where the partial light struggled in.
                  For some moments the man gazed upon that pale attenuated face. It appeared as if a great struggle was going forward in the man's mind, for he murmured in a softer tone:
                  "No, he's no liar. There's the stamp of innocence upon that forehead—how long will it last?" and then with a bitter laugh he added, "I can remember such a time, too—one victim the more. Hark ye, boy," continued he, with a morose voice, as if ashamed of the sympathy he had exhibited, "tell me the truth—what made you go into the street to sell oranges, and where did you get them?"
                  Henry then briefly related the events of the evening, which are already familiar to the reader.
                  The man ground his teeth savagely at that part of the boy's recital regarding his mother and little sister.
                  "So they took you up for trying to pick up a penny honestly, eh? Well, my lad, and what do you think honesty is worth?"
                  "I don't know," replied Henry, and he hung down his head in utter dejection.
                  "Look here," began the man, greatly excited, "you'll be here till Monday morning, or noon—what do you think you'll learn by that time?" and he glared into the wondering boy's face, who made no reply.
                  "Can you lie? can you blaspheme? can you steal? Speak! you little fool!" and the strong man shook him almost roughly by the arm; and without thinking whether he was giving the boy pain or not, continued with increasing vehemence—
                  "You can't do either—perhaps you have never tried? Well, by Monday morning, even to-morrow while the church-bells are ringing to prayers, you'll find how easy it is to do all these. Here is a pretty sprinkling of scoundrels," and he pointed with an expression of disgust and contempt to the reclining figures around. "These fellows make capital tutors, my lad; and you can't shut up your ears."
                  "Wot a complimentary chap you is," observed one ragged vagabond, with a hiccup. "Couldn't you include yourself in the lot, my man?"
                  "Silence! or I'll stop your jaw;" and the man turned upon the speaker, as if he really wished to find some one on whom his wrath could be exploded; while the tipsy speaker, having taken a survey of the boy's protector—for such at the moment he might be termed—was convinced that his wisest plan was obedience, and he was silent accordingly.
                  "Now, boy," said the man, "come and sit by me on the bench—don't be afraid of me, nor of these; no one shall harm you; I want to ask you a few questions. We had just as well be doing that as anything worse come along." And the boy followed him to the seat.
                  "Why didn't your father put you to a trade?" demanded the man, fiercely, as if in his irritation he wished to find fault with all and everything.
                  "He has tried," was the reply, "but no one would have me. Some wanted money, and father had none; and, then—" the boy hesitated.
                  "Well, what then?" impetuously asked the other.
                  "He wanted me at home to help him," returned Henry; "and that was scarcely help enough. Mother and—and Maria—" here the tears coursed his cheeks—"I don't think she'll work any more-"
                  The man seemed to be choking, for something stuck in his throat, and his movements were agitated and nervous; but he spoke no more; and as Henry had no question to reply to, he also was silent. An hour passed, and the boy still sate by the man's side.
                  "Are you cold?" asked the latter, feeling him shake and tremble, and passing his large hand over the lad's thin fingers.
                  "Yes," answered Harry, shivering and faint, between cold, hunger and weariness—"very cold."
                  "Come nearer to me, then," said the man in a low, gentle voice, and, lifting up his arm, he drew the boy closely to him; and, half-embracing him with his huge arm, the boy, as if conscious of a deep and friendly interest, leaned his head on the man's broad chest, and fell into a deep sleep. His guardian, in a stern tone, imposing silence upon every movement the others made.
                  Another hour or two crawled on, and there was a trampling of feet; voices, drunken and blasphemous, were bawling out; the rattling of locks and the clanging of doors resounded, as more prisoners were being put in—and then rose up shrill cries of terror and anguish, which the cold walls only echoed; for the man on duty without only bade them "hold their tongues," or gave them the option of being put "below." This awed some into silence, and those who were refractory only brought upon their heads the threatened infliction.
                  The Sabbath morning broke at last, and the boy opened his eyes as if waking from some horrible dream. Then came, with all its force, the thought of home, of his hungry parents, of his mother's terrible anguish and suspense; and uttering a shriek that rang through the cell, he cried out, "Oh! let me go home!" and fell fainting on the ground.
                  The policeman on duty, a savage fellow, thoroughly imbued with all the brutality of his office, unlocked the door at the cry, and asked gruffly, "What's all this row about, eh?"
                  "Why, it's only a boy dying with cold in your horrible den, here," replied the tall man, as he tenderly lifted Henry from the ground.
                  "You'd better keep a civil tongue in your head," was the answer. "You're in for no good, I'll be bound."
                  "You'd better get the lad some bread," retorted the other, coolly; "or he'll be dead before long, I promise you."
                  In fact, Henry gave every indication of being at the last gasp; and the startled policeman instantly brought in several pieces of black bread, which he tossed to the prisoners one after the other, keeping Henry's to the last, as a salve for his wounded dignity; and, finally, bringing in a pitcher of water, he re-locked the door, and left them to their scanty meal.
                  At last they were released, and marched across the street into the police-court through a crowd of curious people, who, despite the wet, appeared to take an interest rest in the scene—some having friends and acquaintances among the prisoners, and others being drawn by that all powerful motive attributable to the London character especially—curiosity.
                  We need not go through the details of the trial—such as it was. Henry knew not what became of his powerful friend, for they were separated; and the frowning magistrate, after making the policeman swear that he would tell the truth, did not dismiss the boy without a severe reprimand upon his hardihood, bidding him be careful "that he did not make his appearance there any more." The stupified boy then staggered out of the court, amid the commiseration of the people, and several audible execrations upon the policeman.
                  But where was he to go—the poor boy? He was dishonest; for he had not paid the Irish woman for the oranges, and his money had been taken from him by some handy fingers while in the cell. At last he crawled faintly homewards, his brains throbbing and his heart sick; for he was degraded in his own eyes. Standing at the door-way a moment to recover himself, he almost fell to the ground as he heard a wailing come from the chamber above.
                  It is as well to make short work of the sequel, because it is not with the details of the evil we have to do; but to show their working combined with every unfavorable circumstances, to signal out this boy, even yet uncontaminated, and thrust him farther and farther into the horrible slough of crime, so that he must become finally guilty.
                  The boy's little sister was dead. The father was lying ill of a raging fever, which grief, weariness, and distraction, had brought upon him; and Henry found the home from which he had been torn in so hateful manner a house of lamentation and woe.
                  A week had not elapsed ere the father and the little girl were laid in 
                        ths
                        this
                      sordid and revolting ground belonging to the parish workhouse; and then the boy returned home to his mother. That night they both wept for those so dearly loved, so dreadfully lost—and afterwards a direr distress came upon them.
                  
                  Some weeks after, the boy was crawling wearily along the streets, his emaciated face showing the ravages which destitution had made upon his frame. It was night, and he was standing in the shadow which the railings of St. Mary's Church flung upon the ground. The people were passing to and fro, heedless—because not knowing—of the poor lad's forlorn condition; and with his head sunk on his breast, he was thinking of the father and the sister in the ground—of the lorn mother in the miserable room—of himself famishing in the midst of plenty—when a tall man, suddenly crossing, brushed rudely passed him, nearly overthrowing Henry in his haste. The boy only turned his eyes in melancholy remonstrance upon the man, and cast them on 
                        the the
                        the
                      ground again; but evidently there was something in the meek reproach that affected the other powerfully, for he instantly halted and went up to him.
                  "I hope I have not hurt you, my lad," said he; and cursing his own stupidity, he bent his head to the boy's face, in order to look into the pale and wearied features, at the same time catching hold of the orphan's arm.
                  Henry started at the tones of the stranger's voice, so deep and so impressive; he lifted up his eyes, and there was a mutual exclamation of recognition passed between them.
                  "Why, my poor fellow, can this be the state in which I see you?" asked the man in a tone of great feeling.
                  "Yes," answered the boy, and he was silent as he looked upon the changed garb of his former friend. The strong and handsome form was now clothed in fine broadcloth, though the "cut" and "style" belonged to a peculiar fashion that was between the flash and the genteel. From the former it was redeemed by the bold and noble face, on which was written in those indelible characters, the index of a daring soul and of a reckless disposition. The features were dark and bronzed, while jet black hair and whiskers completed and gave relief and finish to the countenance; and the jewelry which he wore about his person was of the finest and most exquisite workmanship.
                  "I meant to have watched you from the court, the other day," said the man, "but I was obliged to move away a little faster than ordinary, and so lost sight of you; but tell me all about your situation now."
                  A few moments served to put the man in possession of the lad's sad history; and it was with a mingled feeling of astonishment, rage, and horror, that this hold and impulsive stranger learned to what a frightful extent a little beginning of evil can be carried.
                  "And that poor Irishwoman—have you paid her yet?" demanded he.
                  "No," was the answer. "I have not seen her since; I dared not. She believes I am dishonest."
                  "What matter what she believes," said the man contemptuously.
                  The boy lifted up his eyes; but that glance spoke volumes. It denoted that inward integrity which feels a degradation, even when falsifying its word from the force of any uncontrollable circumstance that may take place, and thereby overturn all preconceived plans. Evidently the man was surprised, for he was silent an instant, and then half muttered—"So young, yet there is a principle of the loftiest honor in that boy's heart. But, psha! the streets of London are the places where all this will be soon ground out of him. Shall I tempt him?" All this while the man was speaking in a kind of soliloquising tone, and still fixedly looking into Henry's face.
                  "Are you hungry, boy?" asked he.
                  "Very—very:—and my poor mother, at home, is hungry too," replied the lad.
                  "And I stand prating here like a fool," muttered the stranger. "Where does she live?" Henry told him, and he hastily scribbled it down on a tablet, which he took out of his pocket. He then inquired, and took down the address of Judy Barnes, the Irish fruitseller.
                  At this moment a ragged looking vagabond, passing by, caught the sound of the man's voice; he stopped, looked keenly at him, and exclaimed—"Well, I'm blowed, if here ain't the werry piping bullfinch hisself!"
                  The stranger, who was called the "bullfinch," turned upon the intruder with a brow as black as thunder, and growled out, "What's that you're saying?"
                  "Come, Captain Dark," was the response, "don't go to snub me—I'm not going to split. There's a bit of paper out against you, that I know for sartain, and you'd better be making yourself scarce."
                  "Malediction!" exclaimed the man, "then I must look to myself. Here, boy!" and he thrust a quantity of silver into Henry's hand, and flung the informant a piece of money, with thanks; and adding, "I will see you again, and your mother shall not want," he had left the spot ere Henry could recover from his stupor; and it was only the voice of the third party that roused him.
                  "Does you know him—him?" and he jerked his thumb over his shoulder, thereby indicating the stranger.
                  "No," answered Henry. "Do you?"
                  "Do I! Don't I? that's all; we was in quod together. But here's one of the peeler's a-coming," he added; and with a curse upon them he hastened away from the spot. leaving Henry standing alone, in a state of the most utter perplexity.
                  "Now, young fellow, who was them two just bolted from here?" exclaimed a hoarse imperious voice in his ear.
                  The boy knew the sound of that voice well, and he shook from head to foot as the ill-omened tones were heard. He shrank back in a kind of horror, and policeman Z put forth his strong arm, and dragged him forth to the light.
                  "Well, I never!" he ejaculated. "I thought as you'd come to no good," was his observation, "for your owdacious obstruction to the perlice in the execution of their duty. Come along, I must bring you to a gen'l'man as'll talk it over with you;" and incontinently Henry was collared.
                  The boy's chest was heaving, as he fiercely panted for breath. The blood in his veins seemed turning into fire. He beheld before him the tyrant who had trampled all his best feelings in the mud of the street, who had killed his sister and murdered his father; so this young lad's terrible conclusions tended. With a cry of rage he sprang at the man, and inserting his fingers between the stock and the neck, buried them in his throat with a fierce and tiger-like power.
                  For an instant the man was frightened, and he felt the unpleasant strangulation so far overpowering him, that he twisted the boy's arm, till it was nearly broken, who, with a cry of agony, let go his hold; and the silver in his hand falling in the street, he stood with tottering limbs and quivering frame, the prey and captive of the victorious Z.
                  "So, here's tin, is there?" muttered Z, with a grin of delight. "This here will give you a dance at the mill. Come along;" and drawing his staff with his right hand, the boy saw only a process of more ill-usage if he attempted further resistance, so he obeyed, and once more he was the inmate of a police-cell.
                  The next day he was brought before the magistrate who had so lately pointed out to him the atrocity of resisting the police, and the wickedness of being a poor orange-seller. It was represented to his worship by the zealous Z, that Henry was the companion of men of bad character; that he had money in his possession unaccounted for, and, finally, that everything was to be suspected of him. To every question put to him, however, Henry persevered in keeping the most obstinate silence; he would not open those thin and livid lips; and when the policeman related the attack upon him, with a few poetical additions, the worthy magistrate held up his hands in horror while committing him for a fortnight to the House of Correction.
                  Behold him, then, at the treadmill, the Cambridge of Crime, where he would be perfected in all that he was formerly deficient in; where his evil passion could brood and foster over the black and malignant thoughts which now drove away from his mind the love of truth, the ambition of doing good, and the fear of God!
                  It can possess little interest to the reader to go through a detail of the weary days the boor boy spent in that lazar-house of pollution, nor the schooling which he received day by day, till things he would have shuddered at before became familiar to his fancy.
                  He heard nothing of his mother; and if he thought of her lone misery till all became a cloud before his eyes, and his brain throbbed, his face did not exhibit it. It grew calm—almost terrible to look upon in its marble impassability. He moved among the ruffians around him with neither dread, nor repugnance, nor contempt: he was one of them, although their superior.
                  
                  One day, while working at what was allotted to him, the door opened, and the jailor entering, called him by name, stating that the period of his imprisonment was over, and that he was at liberty. It was a word that he had almost forgotten, and it scarcely woke up any emotion in his breast. He turned his eyes towards the door, however, and beheld another man.
                  Henry recognised the stranger in an instant. "Be silent, boy," was the man's whisper, as he advanced into the room; "and get out as soon as possible. Turn down the first street, and you will see a cab: go to it; I shall be waiting for you;" and then leaving him, the man continued his survey of the place, conversing upon indifferent topics. In half-an-hour the boy was free and in the cab. "My mother!' was the first sentence he spoke.
                  "She is quite well," was the reply of Captain Dark, as the cab drove rapidly away.
               
               
                  
                  STAGE III.
                  THE PENITENTIARY.
                  WE must now carry the reader over a space of about three years, Henry Rivers being now in his sixteenth year.
                  Without kindred and friends, with a blighted character, and a crushed heart, the life of this unhappy boy was one unvarying scene of poverty and wretchedness, without any one single hope for the future. His mother was the only being that prevented his becoming a suicide or a murderer; for he had all but sworn that he would make the policeman a sacrifice to his vengeance; but his filial affection was far too powerful, and he devoted himself to the support of his mother with a zeal that was almost sacred.
                  Having no other means of subsistence, he betook himself to his father's trade—that of making artificial flowers; in addition to which he painted fans and engraved with great skill, occasionally disposing of a few pictures in water colors or oil; and by the miserable remuneration he received for these, he contrived to hang upon the out-skirts of humanity, though the privations of both him and his mother at times almost maddened him—they were so terrible.
                  The man who was called Bullfinch, had made one or two fruitless attempts to induce the youth to join him in his malpractices, though he never would distinctly state them. He had, as he promised, given the mother aid at the time, and paid Judy Barnes the boy's debt; but Henry would receive nothing more from him; and after a long altercation on the former point, when Henry flatly refused, the man cursed him for a fool, adding that one day he would be able to calculate the advantages derivable from his "honesty:" that everything around him now conspired to shake. He sought by a certain fierce and rugged eloquence to rouse up in the stubborn boy a contempt for the laws which had so fearfully persecuted him; and while Henry acknowledged with a bitterness of soul the infamies he had endured—the sense of honor still powerful and not yet eradicated—inclined him to be honest for his own—nay, for his mother's sake; and Captain Dark, otherwise Bullfinch, left him, enraged with his failure; so that during a long space the boy lost sight of his former friend.
                  The hand of poverty lay heavy upon those two—the mother and the son, the widow and the orphan: and the gripe of disease also came, as it comes to the wretched, the unhappy, and the destitute, taking them as it were by the throat, and racking their limbs with the torture of rheumatic fever, or making their joints like water with epidemics that swept over the low neighborhood where they dwelt, while the Angel of Death shook his dark wings, sparing only those who prayed to die and were prepared.
                  The pale boy's face only grew paler, more marble—stern, more like that of Medea when she brooded upon her horrible revenge. There was something striking in the neatness, the scrupulous cleanliness of Henry Rivers; in the brushing of the shabby black clothing now grown rusty and thread-bare: it seemed like an iron-like respectability struggling with a destiny that would surely be the victor after all; and yet the indomitable boy would not give in, not he. He never thought of the degradation which had been inflicted upon him without being stung to the soul; for even as he passed along the street, young lads, already the companions of thieves, just beginning their career—just budding into vice, used to call out after him, reminding him in their revolting slang that he had been to the police-cell, and to the treadmill, and that he must be no better than they; and all this the boy bore with a lofty silence, with a stoicism that at his years might be wondered at.
                  He was one day passing the fruit shop of Judy Barnes, whom for three years he had determinedly avoided, when the old woman suddenly seizing him by the arm, hurriedly said that she wished to speak to him, and drew him into shop.
                  "What is it that you want with me, Goody?" asked he, though his heart beat fast, for he remembered what his having been there before had cost him.
                  "What do I want with you, my poor boy?" repeated the sympathising orange-seller, pushing open a little inside door, and ushering him into her sanctum, where a cheerful fire was blazing. "What do I want? Why, I want to spake wid you—I want to know what you're doing, and why you're never coming to see me?—and why you've got such a thin, pale face? and, ochone!" she cried, carried away by her pity—"bud it's a sad sight enough, and I know that the mother of ye is starvin'.—Don't be lookin' at me like a tiger; I bid ye," continued the excited Judy, thrusting a loaf, together with butter and cold meat across the table to him, "bud ate and thank the Lord for id; an' tell me where your mother, the crayther, lives, an' I'll go and see her."
                  "You will!" cried Henry, in surprise.
                  "Yes—I: why shouldn't I—I should like to know?" and with that irritable peculiarity belonging to her people, she "fired up" in an instant at the conclusion which she drew, that Henry was too proud to permit her visit.
                  But his thoughts were far different. "I did not think that any body would take the trouble to see her or me," said he; and resting his head on his hand, with a moan that was wrung involuntarily from him, he cast his desponding eyes out on the ground.
                  "Will you eat?" cried Judy; "will you hould your whisht? will you lave off making them pitiful faces, and breakin' my heart? Why didn't you come to Judy and get more oranges, my poor boy?" she added, laying her withered, yet gentle hand on his shoulder. The very touch, the very tone so human, so womanly, so benevolent and kind, made the boy's heart crack to bursting: he wished to weep, to cry right out, but he dared not.
                  "I could not come," said he in a broken voice. "I had not paid you—I was held as dishonest, and I had not the courage to speak to you any more.
                  Judy, lifting up her hands, only muttered an anathema against the "murtherin' police," as she termed them: and having made Henry promise that he would remain until her return, and "ate everything on the table, like a good boy, barring the lid oy' the iron pot," and being told the mother's address, cramming several somethings into a wicker-basket, taking a part from one end in order to put them into the other, which was already full, and finally after a soliloquy, such as Judy alone could make, she departed, leaving Henry alone in the house, with a charge to look sharply after every thing.
                  Judy was, in her own phrase, a "lone widdy," and held the lower part of a house which, like a caravansera, was open to all, being let in lodgings up to the very chimneys; and she was almost always by herself except when a woman came in to clean up; for the good Irishwoman was an exception to the general rule—she was "clane;" very decent everything looked in her cheerful little room, one side of which was hidden by a large figured curtain, that concealed her humble bed, the other being taken up with drawers and shelves of crockery.
                  Henry, after a pause, turning from the untasted meat. looked about him. The pious pictures of the "saints" on the walls struck him, and he smiled; but it was a smile of gratification. The polished tin utensils, the old high-backed chair, the bit of carpet, and the cat purring on the rug, all began to interest him.
                  Casting his eyes upon the mantle-shelf, more out of a merely mechanical motion than aught else. From the shining candlestick, and the one or the other little articles, his glance fell upon a pile of silver,—about a pound's worth perhaps,—and there his eyes fixed till they almost gloated with a longing covetous desire.
                  For the first time in his life Henry felt that horrible sensation, which inclines an innocent person to become a robber, creep over him.
                  He stood up, looked about him, took the money in his hand, and counted it over—"two and twenty shillings!" What a treasure. He sat down again with the money in his grasp. When suddenly recollecting himself, he placed it back again on the chimney-piece; and with a sigh of relief, he sank heavily into the chair.
                  He was falling into a reverie, when a heavy hand upon his shoulder startled him. Looking up, he instantly recognized the vulgar, villanous, yet somewhat comical visage of him who had warned Captain Dark of the police beside the church nearly four years ago.
                  "Well, my covey, is this here chamber of the Board of Green Cloth yourn?" was the question. "I thought I see you through the chink. And how is you? and how is your respectable 'pal,' Captain Dark?"
                  Henry briefly replied that the place was Judy Barnes's, and that he did not know Captain Dark in the slightest degree.
                  The seedy vagabond bent a piercing look on Henry as he spoke. "One wouldn't think," he muttered; "that this very verdant fellow had so much pluck in him; but he has. I wonder if he'd mind going in with me?" and he still gazed silently upon the boy; apparently his eyes were more attracted by the food on the table. With the greatest nonchalance, the impudent ragamuffin sat down, and cutting off huge slices of bread and meat, began to gorge himself as if he were accustomed to eat three weeks meal in one.
                  "I say," he began, suddenly placing down a half finished slice, "this here won't make one werry active in cutting away, will it? Now I'll tell you what it is, and what must be done: I'm out of luck, and must mend it. How long'll the old gal be?"
                  "About half-an-hour," replied the boy. "Why do you ask?"
                  In a few minutes the man had put Henry in possession of a plan to rob the orange-seller of some little money he knew she had in her possession.
                  Had this fellow proposed to him that Henry should murder, stab, or poison that good old soul who had befriended him, he could not have been more horrified; and his whole physiognomy betrayed it.
                  "Come now," said the thief, "don't go for to be so werry shocked. What was you a-doing with them shiners just now, eh?" and he pointed to the silver on the chimney-piece.
                  The boy covered his face with his hands, while a great shudder passed over his frame, and the thief at that instant made a rush at the money. One or two of the pieces falling on the ground roused Henry, and he grasped the man by the collar, determined to defend poor Judy's property to the last.
                  At this moment, a neighbor who happened to be in the shop waiting vainly for the old woman to come and serve her, heard the noise within, pushed open the door, and seeing the two struggling, thought they were both engaged in the robbery, and instantly raised the cry of "thieves!" and "police!" which speedily brought in one or two others, and in a short time they were both seized, and prisoners of the police.
                  Had Henry relied upon the stoicism which leads an Indian chanting a war-song to the stake, he could not have been calmer, cooler, more collected. The "law" had marked him evidently. He beheld the huge polypus tentacula stretching and winding through the thousand masses of humanity, and grasping him, him alone of the whole, though he was well aware by this, of the dangerous position in which poverty places a man: he gave up hope—the poor boy!
                  He neither protested his innocence, nor struggled, nor hesitated. To every question he was deaf, till from being curious the crowd became reproachful. The only thing that the boy internally gave thanks for was, that he and his evil genius were taken away before Judy came back. He could not have borne the meeting. He thought of the poor Irishwoman's kindness—he thought how black and hideous his apparent ingratitude must look: but he gave no expression to his feelings—he had vowed not to open his lips.
                  
                  The day of trial came. Judy Barnes protested his innocence, this was contradicted by the evidence of the neighbor who saw the money in his hand,—it was also contradicted by the confession of the thief, who asserted that Henry was his companion, and well known to him, and had, in fact, put him up to it; and policeman Z, together with other witnesses, proved that Henry had been in the police cell, and in the House of Correction.
                  It was sufficient.
                  The magistrate was irritated at the boy's obstinacy, his bold and daring demeanor; for he exhibited no fear. no contrition, which only added to the aggravation of the offence; and taking the whole into consideration, the Judge sentenced Henry to solitary confinement in the Penitentiary for twelve months, as criminal and incorrigible.
                  Henry knew that his poor sick mother was too ill and weak to attend at the trial; and strange as it may seem he was glad that it was so. It would have been impossible for the boy to have borne her tears, her entreaties, and her lamentations. With what seemed an indifferent air, he left the bar, while the actual culprit was discharged with a caution that implied great doubts as to his innocence.
                  Before Henry was sent away, he understood that Judy Barnes and his mother had made application to see him—it was refused; but he drew a good omen from that: the Irishwoman would not allow his mother to starve.
                  When the sentence fell upon his ear, he thought but lightly of it; in fact, if he feared any one thing, it was that of being sent to mingle with those terrible beings, the Calibans of the human race, whom he had formerly met at the treadmill. A few days after beheld him installed in this place of punition.
                  At this time the idea of solitary confinement seemed a fine thing for the 
                        statisticans
                        statisticians
                     , and the fierce orators of the criminal code, to argue about. They took human beings and placed them in the cells to make experiments upon them, as Volta did with frogs, or Parrhasius with his captive, and keenly watched every phase of the prisoner's appreciation of their vigilance and—tenderness.
                  It kept him from evil, from all chances of contamination, said they; and they looked around the world with an air of conscious pride to receive thanks for making men mad, brutish, or idiotic.
                  The boy was now an inmate of a solitary cell, debarred from society and employment, and forbidden to speak; so that very soon the sound of a human voice became a strange, almost a fearful thing to him. On the Sabbath, from another little prison of the chapel, he heard voices in prayer and in praise, but beheld no one. Over his soul there fell a mantle of darkness. The light of heaven seemed to have been extinguished in a final chaos, which once more absorbed everything that was created.
                  In the pleasant summer-time the sunbeams poured through the iron-guarded casement of his cell, and played on the floor: but the heavenly blue of the sky moved him not; for his mind was becoming blank. If a little bird happened to perch before the window, he would gaze upon its movements with an idiotic surprise; but his young heart had ceased to respond to that voiceless eloquence of nature, in the sky, in the breeze, in the still, solemn, shining hour. His eyes brightened no longer with joy; for, one by one, his sensations were becoming extinct,—that God-created soul was fast changing into vacuity—a surface merely—on which no divine writing could be any longer traced.
                  There were a few daily duties that he had to perform, which at the first varied the monotony of his awful solitude; but by degrees this little act of what may be termed physical and mental violation—because his thoughts accompanied his labour—grew dormant. He became machine-like. All interruptions ceased to mark those particular parts of the day which, in giving him something to do, rested his distracted brain.
                  He was in stern hands, under a stony surveillance, that never, by a kind word or act, sought to save or preserve one human emotion from obligation. It was supposed that virtue would be the natural consequence of being forcibly parted from vice, or any vicious inducement, for getting that by suspending the human faculties, the boy became merely an animal—merely a creature of locomotion. The sapient advocates of this fearful scheme forgot that from the mingled good and evil in man, sprang forth those great virtues, those sublime attributes, which in formers times were almost deified. Their motives may have been good, we will charitably suppose so, but their system was horrible. We might, however, suppose the same good motive to have created the Inquisition, but which we know turned men into incarnate demons.
                  Gradually Henry's visions, waking and sleeping, became haunted with shapes which the overstrained imagination, now tainted with insanity, began to exaggerate, and bring around him, in such teeming forms of horror, that shriek upon shriek would escape his lips, till he fainted from exhaustion on the floor of his cell. And in turn came upon him a dull stupor, an utter apathy, which, for a long period of time, enthralled him; and from this he was left to recover as he best might: no aid was given for he was not yet mad.
                  After a while these shapes grew familiar, and he missed them, when at any time one or other the figures he had accustomed his brain to form were absent. They were as companions to him that he dearly loved; and he wept when he could no longer conjure them before him. All this, as may be supposed, terminated in insanity; and he was finally removed from his cell to the asylum set apart for such unhappy creatures, till he recovered.
                  
                  He awoke like one from a dream, and found himself in a little bed, and beheld on either side of him his mother and Judy Barnes.
               
               
                  STAGE IV.
                  THE HULKS—THE ESCAPE.
                  FOR a long time the boy's life had been despaired of; and it is possible that his physical affliction had counteracted his mental infirmity, for he was perfectly sane, though dreadfully shattered in body.
                  During this time the devotion of the good Irishwoman had been unceasing. Out of her little means, and even straining a point beyond them sometimes, she had fed and lodged the poor widow, who was so little able to help herself; and now there was an additional burthen upon Judy's shoulders. She bore it with a Milesian mixture of overflowing good humor, irritability, pious ejaculations, and blundering. But she never for one moment dreamed of thrusting these two, who had fallen upon her hands, into the streets.
                  The boy recovered slowly, though effectually; but the first day he went abroad, he speedily returned homeward, with a pallid face, moist eyes, and something like a savage fire in his brilliant orbs.
                  "What's the matter, Henry?" asked his mother, as he almost staggered into the room.
                  "I am branded, mother—I am that dog to whom they have given an ill name. The boys point after me in the street—they shout and hoot me, some wished me to join them in robbery, others said that I must be their leader; 'for,' said they, 'if you've been to the treadmill and the Penitentiary, you must know something.' Mother," added the boy, with an inexpressible sob of anguish, "I am no thief, I am no felon, and I cannot be one. The remains of my noble and broken hearted father would reproach me from their quiet resting-place. I would I were dead—both of us—you and I, mother; for then we might rest. I am sick of living."
                  Thus had a mass of sinister and singular circumstances taken advantage, as it were, of an iniquitous system of criminal-creating laws, which, instead of preventing or protecting, only hurried on the ruin of their selected victim.
                  Why is it—for this boy, being but a type of a class, which numbers itself in thousands, and is compelled finally to relinquish its honesty and become thief—that the men inflict the punishment of the felon upon the innocent, should not have seen the evils of such a system instead of sanctioning them, and aiding their working still the more?—Why has beggary become criminal, and want of work guilt?—why, but that the system of society is based upon selfishness as a principle, and because man imagines his protection to consist in keeping at a distance from him a moiety of humanity; he leaves them upon the barren highway of the world, to starve—or steal.
                  Henry Rivers and his mother therefore removed to another quarter of the town, where he changed his name, and was no longer known. He hoped that he should be enabled to pick up a livelihood, however miserable, for himself and his parent, whom he loved with a devoted fondness that no words can describe.
                  He obtained a precarious employment as first by turning his talents for engraving to account, and was beginning to make some slight advance from his dire poverty, when he was seized with the influenza, then very prevalent, which for a long time paralysed his employment, and left him the inmate of an hospital.
                  
                  We must now hurry the reader over the space of about six years, in order to introduce some other personages upon the scene
                  In the back parlor of a low tavern situated in Drury Lane, three men were seated one afternoon, holding what might be termed a council of war among themselves. On a table before them lay the remains of a rude repast, and bowls of liquor, together with pipes and tobacco crowned the board, showing that they mingled amusement with business.
                  "It's of no use talking," observed one who appeared to be somewhat perverse; "we can't do nothing until the Bullfinch comes. Wot's the use of our trying these artful tricks, when it's quite out of our line?" and he tossed up what appeared to be a bright crown-piece in the air, catching it dexterously in his hand.
                  "There aint a fellow to be had as can do the trick," observed another lamentingly; "the very last as was left was sent across the water—you knows."
                  "Just let's have a look at that ere," said the next, a thin, thievish-looking fellow, and the very man who had been the cause of Henry's imprisonment in the Penitentiary.
                  "There you is," answered the first speaker, tossing it towards him. "Do as you like, and take your spectacles out too; you can't find more fault about it than I can. It won't do; it's a werry bad 'un. Halloo! here you are at last:" this was added as the speaker, lifting up his head, beheld a tall, athletic, and handsome man enter the chamber. This was the renowned Bullfinch, or Captain Dark as he was termed.
                  Years had wrought their work, however, upon the fine forehead, and the noble face; for there was care, anxiety, restlessness, and dissipation, all by turns written upon his lineaments.
                  Something of the air of a fallen angel also, flung over this man its very questionable lustre, and invested him in the eyes of his associates with attributes akin to heroism. Bold, daring and reckless, he commanded them by his physical capacities; and while they admired, they stood in awe of him.
                  Phillip Warforde, for that was his true name—was a younger son of a good family; but a college education, versus, college dissipation—gaming, drinking, the turf, and all other collateral debaucheries, had ruined his character and utterly him. It was also said that the elder brother had married a young girl to whom he was devotedly attached, and that this had utterly cut the bonds which connected him with the estimable, the respectable, and the well-born.—He was now, thanks to his passion for command in any form, the leader of a fierce and skilful horde of thieves, and they were then engaged in a conversation that turned upon the topic already broached before his entrance.
                  "If this here don't do," pursued the party, who was urging a point with the leader, "we are reg'larly shelved, and had better go into the work'us at once."
                  "Pshaw!" ejaculated the Bullfinch, contemptuously; "your coin is execrably made, and will betray you, on the instant."
                  "Come, I say, cap'en, don't be so very hard about it," interposed another, who was probably jealous of his reputation.
                  "Your shiners are not worth a straw, my lads," retorted the captain. "I have done the trick; and these are the papers, that shall bring us in profits without risk to your jugulars;" and he showed them a couple of country bank-notes.
                  These were handed round and critically examined. Whether the ragged members of this rapacious community had ever been in possession of a bank note in their lives, we cannot say, but each one scrutinized them with the eye of a connoisseur, and gravely announced these to be "the thing."
                  "The thing!" echoed the captain scornfully. "Why, you stupid dogs, d'ye think they're forgeries!"
                  "I say, don't use that word," said one of them, hastily: "it has an ugly sound.— Call it an elegant imitation, or something of that sort;—but if these are not the queer screens that are to set us up again, I should like to know where they are?"
                  "So you shall," replied Bullfinch. "Meet me here in three nights, and you shall all have your share;" and after a little extra conversation, and a little further revelling, they parted.
                  
                  That same morning Henry had received a note through the hands of an engraver for whom he occasionally worked, purporting to be from a gentleman who had observed his skill, and who wished to see him at an hotel the next morning, as he had some very valuable work to entrust him with,—a piece of news which shed the first sunshine of real joy over the arid heart of Henry Rivers, for many a-year now gone.
                  The next morning, therefore, he dressed himself in his shabby clothing, sighing bitterly as he drew his ill-fitting coat across his shirtless breast; but buoyed up with some indefinite hope he tenderly kissed his mother, and sallied forth.
                  He soon reached the hotel, and asking for Mr. Warforde, was ushered into a snug private apartment, and found himself in the presence of a tall, well-dressed, gentlemanly man, in whom he traced the well-remembered features of his former friend, the Bullfinch.
                  Henry was thunderstruck. "There must be some error," thought he.
                  "Sit down," said the man, kindly, while casting a commiserating glance upon the half-famished youth; "sit down—there is at least a good breakfast; begin with that and then we will enter into business. I have something for you to do that may put you beyond want, and make up for all the sufferings you have undergone,"
                  Although Henry felt, by an unconquerable instinct, that there was something sinister in all this, yet he did as he was requested; but, although the poor youth was hungry he could not eat.
                  Little by little did Warforde elicit from him the melancholy story of his life to the present hour; and for a few moments he fell into a gloomy reverie.
                  Whether he felt any compunction at the trap he was laying for Henry or not, he did not hesitate long,
                  "Circumstances have changed with me," he began, "since I saw you last, and my course of life, which was wild enough, has been fortunately changed. I am manager of a country bank, and as I wanted some plates engraved, of which I will show you a specimen, I have been sent up to London in order to find a man who can do them.—I have discovered that you have talent that way; and as it is a profitable thing, I am glad to be able to do you this service. Are you willing to engage with me."
                  There was a pause. Henry was ignorant of forgery except in name, and he thought that referred to writing alone; besides the man's frank speech won upon him; there was truth in his words and manner—he at once agreed to do his bidding.
                  The man then produced a bank-note; and binding the young man over to secrecy, pointed out to him the various portions to which his attention was to be drawn.
                  
                  The plate was engraved; and in two days after the Bullfinch, on receiving it, expressed his satisfaction; and giving him fifty pounds for his work, departed.
                  This was the largest sum of money that Henry had ever received, and he laid out a portion of it in making his poor home comfortable, and in purchasing new clothing for his mother. Neither did the grateful lad forget Judy Barnes; he repaid her for her past trouble and expense.
                  
                  To his horror and astonishment, a short while after he beheld the walls of the town placarded with a paper, headed FORGERY, whereon was detailed a full description of the bank notes in question, which were struck from the very plate he had engraved, concluding with a reward for the apprehension of the as yet unknown forger. It was the most terrible moment of his life.— At last, then, he was guilty, for he had been trapped into it, and made so.
                  He walked home in a stupor; his limbs shook, and his soul sunk within him.—"Surely," he thought, "God must have deserted me, or else, being utterly guiltless, I could not have been doomed in this manner."
                  It must be confessed that in this thought he was wrong; for it is by trial, by endurance, and by great griefs, that the soul of man is purified and becomes great, triumphing over trouble, as the gold is refined in the fire; but Henry was no theologian, and he had read neither Plato nor Seneca.—He was a human being who had suffered much, and had borne it well: even long ago had he forgiven the ruffianly policeman, who had first laid the brand of crime upon him.
                  By the untiring energies of the detective, he was at last discovered and apprehended, and after the first examination before the magistrate, he was remanded till the sessions.
                  His mother was allowed to visit him, and Judy Barnes, still untiring, still noble in her true woman's nature, was also there to sooth, and to hope, and to build up castles for him in the blue air, though she thought, as she expressed it, that "the murtherin' vagabones had smelled the blood-money, and nothin' bud turning everything topsy turvey, the Lord save us! would put honest people straight on their legs again."
                  In the meantime, a struggle was going forward in Henry's mind as to whether he should explain the whole, and thus shift the crime from himself to Warforde; and although he had no doubt that he was betrayed, still he felt a repugnance to resorting to such a measure. He was decided therefore to be dumb; and on the day of his trial he preserved in the same obstinate course of silence, which brought upon him the phillippics of the judge, who sentenced him to transportation, which was commuted to two years at the hulks.
                  
                  If there was horror at the treadmill amid the abandoned and the outcast, and terror in the cell of the Penitentiary, there were these two with most fearful increase at this pandemonium of human fiends. Everything that was revolting in act and speech, polluted the ear and the eye, and the tremendous labor he underwent while 
                        ewaring
                        wearing
                      the galling and degrading chain, was 
                        al-
                        almost
                      beyond credibility.
                  By day they labored on shore under the eye and muskets of the sentinels, and by night they were locked up in their pens like animals destined for the slaughter. The heat and cold of the weather was to be borne alike, and they seemed to be beings for ever shut out from the sunshine of humanity.
                  Henry bore his punishment with a fortitude that was the greater in proportion as his fears were heightened before his apprehension and condemnation. When the evil hour came, he was ready and prepared to meet it. Even while in the court he beheld the face of Warforde among the crowd, yet he did not betray any emotion, and never dreamed of insisting upon his seizure as the master-mover of the whole infamous plot.
                  
                  One evening, when the darkness had fallen and the dusky form of the sentry, and one or two groups of men could 
                        be be
                        be
                      barely seen on the deck of the hulk, Henry was leaning against a projecting beam of the side, when he was roused up by a touch on the arm, and looking round, he perceived a Thames policeman standing beside him.
                  "What is it?" demanded Henry.
                  "It is I, Warforde the Bullfinch," replied the disguised man. "I could not bear to see you endure all this for a pack of rascals such as we are. Do not take any notice—I am going to give you liberty, and we will escape far from this."
                  "To be taken again," replied the convict, "and to endure a worse punishment; or to be implicated with you and to be guilty!— You might have had some mercy on me, too," added he reproachfully.
                  "I do not say a word to excuse myself," answered the man. "I am bad enough but not so bad as to have you bear all the punishment for me. We are like wolves, and must therefore devour and make our prey upon whom or what we can. Come no more words—follow me, as if you were going below;" and Henry mechanically obeyed.
                  They were passing the sentinel, when Bullfinch coolly turned round to him and said—"A good night comrade; it's cold work this of ours."
                  "Very," was the response. "Good night. Where's he going?" added he suddenly, meaning Henry Rivers,
                  "Down below, I've got to see a few of them for a muster in fresh gangs." And passing the sentry, they descended to the lower deck, which they found deserted. A port-hole afforded the means of escape, and a boat alongside received them both, as they noiselessly stepped into it.
               
               
                  
                  STAGE V.
                  THE PENAL SETTLEMENT.
                  As the Bullfinch shot the boat out stealthily from the side of the old hulk, the shadows of night had deepened over the river.—With a strong and skilful hand he skulled the craft to the opposite coast, where amid flags, reeds, and a half-marine vegetation, they landed. Henry, cold and faint, was aided across the swampy flat to a small cottage, into which he was assisted by his deliverer.
                  A cheerful fire was blazing on the hearth, a pot full of edibles was seething over it, spirits were on the table, and there were two or three of the Bullfinch's companions, who hailed Henry gladly, though the proud and spirit-broken boy did not descend to their rude welcome.
                  After a little cursing, and unceremoniously thrusting the vagabonds aside. Captain Dark proceeded to knock off the young convict's fetters, which was soon and dexterously done. He then gave Henry a suit of rude but warm clothing, which after a welcome lavation, he put on, and then sat down silent and moody to eat of the viands placed before him.
                  "I see," began the unscrupulous outlaw, "that you have not forgiven me the trick I played upon you; but what would you have? Some scoundrel or other, with less feeling than I myself, would have used you in like manner; and there was, after all, a chance that you might never have heard another word of the matter, and have been comfortable perhaps with the little capital, which so far as the matter went, you had honestly enough earned. It is intention that creates guilt, and you were innocent."
                  "Tell me of my mother," said Henry, in a voice, that though tremulous with emotion, was still without irritation or bravado.
                  "All in good time, my boy," replied the captain. "I mean to have a long talk with you this evening, as soon as these fellows have made themselves scarce. You shall then know a little more of me; and so eat your fill, and drink a glass of this good stuff"—pointing to a Dutch-built bottle as he spoke. "It will rouse you up; for I hope we shall be able to work together—"
                  "Never!" said Henry.
                  "Indeed! you think not," retorted Capt. Dark. "I have an idea to the contrary, and I've partly made up my mind to it, too; and when that's the case, I am not to be turned from my purpose. However, we'll not argue the case now; eat, drink, and, d'ye hear?" added he, turning to the others, "take your cans with you, and don't come within earshot till I call you;" and without a murmur of dissent, the men did as they were ordered, leaving the two others alone to pursue their colloquy.
                  "Now, tell me news of my mother," began Henry, abruptly; "of the only living being that has kept a single green leaf of life from becoming all sere and withered in my heart."
                  "I will; but curb your impatience," replied the captain. "It is not altogether so short a history. Rascal as I am, I am not altogether lost, and have done as many good deeds in my life as the saintliest in the kingdom; but don't suppose I expect those to palliate the evil I have done also; for I am neither fool nor hypocrite. From the first time I heard your history, I made up my mind that your mother should not starve."
                  Henry started; a burning flush crossed his face; but he only drew his hand over his brow, and was calm again.
                  "When I found that the old Irishwoman' who had a heart as royal as any queen's—befriended her, I did not interfere; but she cannot now do more."
                  "What!" exclaimed the youth, with a convulsive start; "do you tell me—"
                  "She is dead!" As the man concluded the sentence for him, his voice was full of solemnity, and the tones vibrated with the mournful gust without, like the sobbing of a dirge.
                  "Dead!" repeated Henry; "the good, the christian creature! From all the thousands that surrounded me she was the only one that—" Here the tears from his streaming eyes testified the intensity of his feelings.
                  "From that day your mother fell into difficulty," continued the man. "I was not near at the time, but when I returned to London I found her out—and she has since known no want; as little does she know her unknown friend."
                  "You have aided her!—you have saved her!" cried the boy, in mingled astonishment and gratitude; then catching hold of the man's hard hand, he grasped it fervently, murmuring, "God bless you!—God bless you!" bent his head over it a moment, and wept aloud.
                  Warforde permitted his feelings to be vented thus, and after a pause resumed: "Judy Barnes having no friend or relation in the world, left her little stock and shop to your mother; but she was unfortunate; and what throve under the Irishwoman's care failed in other hands. She knows of my intention to give you freedom, and is anxious to see you—so to-morrow—"
                  "Now—now, at once," cried Henry, rising impetuously. "I cannot wait till then;" and he moved to the door.
                  "But you must, 'returned his companion. "To go forth to-night would be to throw yourself into the hands of the police again. By this time they will know of your escape. Come, my lad, don't be down-hearted. If I had allowed myself to be beaten by adverse things, I should have been a beggar starving in the streets, or perhaps in Norfolk Island."
                  Henry sank into his chair with a groan. A cold sweat broke out upon his forehead; his lips became livid, and his cheeks were of a leaden hue.
                  "What's the matter with the lad?" demanded Warforde, as we shall now call him. "Are you mad?"
                  "Mad!" echoed Henry, a gleam of his old insanity shooting forth from his flashing eyes. "I was mad once, and they made me so:" and he shook his arm menacingly in the air. "Tell me," he gasped out, "what will they do to those whom they take after escaping from the hulks?"
                  "Transportation for life is the doom?" was the answer.
                  "Wretch! you have ruined me—you have destroyed me forever!" yelled Henry, as he sprang across the floor, and would have done him a mischief had not Warforde leaped nimbly aside, and by his superior strength compelled the panting youth to keep his seat.
                  "Was it not better to risk something by escaping?" asked he at last, "than be wearing out your life with those pretty bracelets on?" pointing to the broken chains on the ground. "How long do you think, with those thin limbs and attenuated form, you would have lived? Not six months. Better die in struggling for freedom, than meekly surrender the free air, and free sunshine—and your mother's voice and presence: better to die than bow to the accursed rod which they wield over us. Hang, shoot, or drown me," cried the excited man, "but no prison—no fetters—no gaoler—longer than I like!"
                  "They shall never—never take me alive," muttered Henry through his clenched teeth.
                  "Why that's well said," observed the man in a tone of encouragement; and totally changing both his voice and manner, he added—"Now that you see what your notions of honesty has brought you, and know what opinion men and magistrates of the land have of its value—by appearances—and as you have no chance of becoming innocent if you would—because the mark of crime is on you—what say you to join me?"
                  "No—no—I cannot—I can—not!" rejoined the distracted youth averting his eyes. "I know not why or wherefore, but my soul revolts at the idea."
                  "Bah!" ejaculated the man contemptuously, "all this is mere nonsense. "How now," he suddenly added, as he bent his head down to listen—"by heaven! I hear the baying of a dog." And in the intensely exciting pause that ensued, there was heard a barking far in the distance.
                  "That dog is the best sentinel that ever watched over men," muttered the outlaw as he drew a brace of pistols from his breast, and with great coolness began to examine the priming; while Henry with started eyes and parted lips was still listening, fixed as a statue.
                  The barking was prolonged; evidently the intruders upon this neutral ground were coming nearer; and Henry, like one driven to desperation, turned his white face towards the Bullfinch, and said, "Give me one of those," grasping at a pistol in his hands. The man surprised at the act, and not willing to shed blood if it could be avoided, only drew back quickly, at the same time asking, "What do you want with it?"
                  Henry, with his teeth shining ferociously, replied, "To kill!—not to be taken with life!—to kill!" but that moment his resolution changed; and, white as the winter's snow, he staggered back with a faint moan, while letting the weapon fall from his hand. "No—no—no blood," he murmured; "if I am doomed, let it be with clean hands, in the name of God!"
                  Warforde had called in his trembling associates; and the pale wretches held a hurried consultation as to what it were best for them to do—for transportation for life awaited any who might be taken, as having aided the convict to escape.
                  "We must hurry across the marshes," exclaimed the leader; "and we must separate. Every one must look to himself. If you, however," added he, to Henry, "choose to trust yourself with me, I will defend you with my life."
                  "I will see my mother," cried the unhappy youth; "for she has borne great sorrow on my account, and her grey hairs are thinned with agony for me. I thank you for your offer," continued he, addressing Warforde; "but I will bring no man into further danger on my account. Farewell!"
                  In a few minutes longer the fugitives were scattered in all directions. With a bold recklessness, never dreaming that he was rushing into the very jaws of danger, did Henry wend his weary footsteps towards London; and ere the day broke, he was before the door of the humble lodging where his parent dwelt.
                  It was a piteous sight to behold that lone mother, even then seated in an old chair, shivering over the embers of the mean fire, and shaking her aged head as she reflected on the boy who was undergoing the ignominious punishment of a convict at the hulks.
                  Instantly afterwards Henry Rivers was clasping her to his breast, and that embrace repaid the mother for weeks of anguish that she had endured. Her only friend, the kind Judy Barnes, had gone to her quiet resting-place, and no human soul dreamed of the 
                        beraved
                        bereaved
                      mother except one—a robber by profession, and an outlaw by proscription. Warforde had, as he had said, given her the little help he could, without reminding her by his presence how much responsibility lay on him for the evil that had befallen mother and son; and therefore she accepted his help without any bitter feelings being kindled; and as the man had a kind of conscientiousness in his actions which, without standing the test of examination, led him to do occasionally a gratuitous good deed, he was not hardened enough to suppose that this was in any way a mitigation of his conduct, indeed he really confessed so.
                  "Oh! Henry, my son," exclaimed his mother, "you know not with what fear and joy I now behold you! I thought we had parted for the last time and forever; and I had prayed that I might die, for life had grown a load to me."
                  "We have both a bitter load to bear, my mother," was his answer; "but let us forget these things now. All that has happened, dear mother, has only made my love more intense for you. Everything has conspired to destroy our happiness, but all has failed to destroy affection." And kissing her on the forehead, he was beginning to relate the manner of his escape, when a loud knocking without, and the instant opening of the door, once more alarmed them. The police entered.
                  Escape was too late—resistance was out of the question. The residence of the widow had been discovered by the vigilant officers, for they had correctly calculated that Henry would make what speed he could to this place. Thus, for the second time, did they bear away their victim.
                  
                  The result of a judicial re-examination amounted to a sentence of transportation to the Penal Settlements for life. The grave and severe magistrates formally commented upon the ungrateful return the prisoner had made to their kindness by escaping from his last lenient punishment. Their surprise was heightened into a dismay, when the prisoner, with a sort of sovereign contempt, demanded how they could feel astonishment at a man's wishing to escape any punishment deserved or undeserved.
                  With a bitterness of sarcasm, and with a fiery energy and eloquence, did Henry destroy the whole canting nonsense of men who had nothing but an official interest in sitting to pass sentences daily, had exhibited. He was ungrateful, they said, and that was the sign of a perverse and unrepentant man. They had punished him in the most merciful manner they could, in fact, their leniency stared them in the face when they beheld its disheartening results. It was to no purpose that Henry declared they had sentenced him wrongly,—that he was, and had been, an innocent man from his childhood up to that very hour. What! did he know better than his judges? Had they not the evidence of policemen, keepers and others—that he had been at the treadmill—the Penitentiary—and now stood there before them a damning proof of his turpitude in having run away from the Hulks? and would he dare persist in declaring his innocence? What was to be done with such a man, with whom all modes of punishment were unacceptable, who could not be persuaded that it was against the law of God or man to escape whenever he could? The splendid systems of prison discipline were evidently thrown away upon him; the peculiar hardships of the dockyards and the hulks were as little relished. It was an insult they could not endure, that this fellow should disapprove of the fine theories and improvements made session after session by them, and pompously recorded in their books;—while pastoral chaplains wrote occasional letters to say that so and so, a murderer—a burglar—any wretch lost to humanity—had shown a peculiarly evangelical spirit on one or two favored occasions. As we have stated, Henry was transported for life.
                  It is but a repetition of sad news to describe the mother's feeling of anguish on again parting with her boy; for she saw him with the manacles on his hands, and with chains around his body,—and she had heard of the gloomy horrors of the Penal Settlement. When they parted, the lips of both were stone cold, and their voices died in their throats.
                  
                  The convict ship sailed away from the Thames, carrying on board nearly one hundred men doomed to exile,—some for seven, others for life; though one might assert that twenty-one years would never pass over the head of any in that home of horror and desolation whither they were sent. The difference being that those sentenced "for life" were destined to "die daily" in the round of torture they endured, while others, whose labor was lighter, and privileges somewhat more extended, might even go through their term of twenty-one years, or less, and fortune favor their exertions in their latter days, after society had done its best to destroy them utterly in the past.
                  They crossed the immensity of the ocean with varied fair and foul weather; but the sufferings of the unhappy wretches were awful. Like cattle herded in the shambles, they were compelled to remain bound hand and foot, even when tempests seemed to threaten them with destruction; for had the vessel gone to wreck, they would have perished as one man: not a single fetter would have been knocked off to give them a chance for life.
                  Norfolk Island has an area of about thirty miles only, being six and a half miles in length by four in breadth, a miserable mass of basaltic sterility that issues from the depth of the ocean, and which, in fact, is but the summit of the cone of some vast mountain whose arid sides slope away into the fathomless depths below.
                  This human hell,—for it can scarcely be designated by any other name, is inaccessible save at "an opening in a low reef fronting the little bay, and that is the point where the settlement is situated." Around this howls the waste of waters breaking upon the craggy points of iron-like rocks, which, like chevaux de frise, protect it from invasion, and would seem to intimidate all who gazed on the shore from the deck of the passing vessel, from landing in that inhospitable region. Men skilled in human torture found uses for it, however; and it is the boast of our penal code that we have discovered a punishment to which death cannot be compared.
                  Here, then, chained round the waist and the ancles to his gang, and guarded by armed soldiers was Henry Rivers compelled to labor in the stone quarries; and as the convicts are not allowed powder for blasting, while the machinery they are furnished with is rude and imperfect for the express purpose of increasing their difficulty of labor, some faint idea of their stupendous toil and their incredible privation may be formed.
               
               
                  STAGE VI.
                  THE GIBBET.
                  THE reader as a matter of course has seen the name of Phillip Warforde, alias the Bullfinch, alias Captain Dark, in connexion with that of Henry Rivers; and although this pseudo-friendship lasted for years, with long intervals of time between them, still there was little of cordiality in their intercourse at any time.
                  It would not be an uninstructive chapter for the observer of human character to write, if he were to detail those singular acquaintanceships that springs up between strangers under circumstances whose peculiarity are like the wildest rhapsodies of fiction; how a man in a single moment becomes bound in some shape or way, to another for life,—how this first accidental meeting creates for the person a good or an evil genius, as the case may be.
                  Philip Warforde's knowledge therefore of Henry Rivers, began without the latter's agency, so to speak, and was continued without his consent; and though Henry had undoubtedly made great efforts to shake off whatever influence this man had over him, he was always unable to do so. 
                        Bu
                        But
                      it was not so much the fault of the man that Henry became the scape-goat in one or two instances. Something in the stern silence, the noble self-sacrifice of Henry, woke up in Dark's breast a more generous and chivalric feeling, and he was determined to free Henry once more from his exile at the risk of his own life. He purposely committed a crime; but it was not considered heinous enough to merit transportation for life; and he was condemned to the hulks for a severer sentence.
                  This was against every idea that he had formed. Thus signally thwarted in the plans he had resolved upon, he cursed his stupidity in not having committed a crime of greater dye—one that might been capital. It was not for want of either the will or the capability—it was a failure.
                  But the bold man was resolved to give Henry the liberty he had vowed, and by escaping from the hulks he would be, as a matter of course, sentenced to the same fate as Rivers. One night, therefore, he released himself from his chain, broke from his place of confinement, and plunged from the deck of the hulk into the water. The sound alarmed the sentinel, who hailed and fired! The form of a man was seen to spring up from the water, and while uttering a long cry of pain and disappointment, it sank for ever from sight. Such was the end of the "Bullfinch."
                  In the meantime, before this took place, it is but justice to the memory of this man, whose virtues arose from his vices, to state that he had made provision for the lonely widow whose premature decay was advancing rapidly, so that for some time to come she could draw a small weekly sum sufficient for present necessities; and if her life was now passed in apathy or in tears, she was not in fear of dying of starvation some bleak night before a workhouse-door. Her thoughts passed across the sea, and through the tempests to her boy thousands of miles away, classed with beasts of burden, degraded to be a mere animal in creation, because his soul was by this time almost trampled out of him.
                  Return we now to Henry whom we left laboring under every privation, in the wet, in the cold, for twelve hours a-day,—felling timber, and dragging, in the midst of gangs, as if they were horses; never tasting fresh meat, and never having sufficient to eat of any other kind, and even of that, too, his comrades robbed him of, which he endured without a murmur.
                  If there be any feeble ray of human sunshine glimmering in the heart of the most hardened, it is soon extinguished in the darkness of despair, and their lives become one huge blasphemy. What, then, must it have been amid oaths, execrations, and obscenity to Henry Rivers, whose mind, even then was uncontaminated.
                  He brooded over his mother till he almost went mad. In the clouds of evening, when the desolate winds moaned across the surges, his thoughts flew back to her. He beheld her pale, wan, dying of hunger, or perishing in the wintry streets. The yearnings of his heart to behold her increased daily, and the intensity of this delay. He determined to attempt an escape at all hazards but, to pass from an island, bounded by the gigantic waves of the South Pacific,—and at the only point where escape was practicable, he was to elude the vigilence of the watchful sentinels, whose orders were to shoot, at once, any that they discovered making that effort.
                  Without hesitation, however, he confided this intention to two or three others; for it was less possible to do it alone than by several aiding each other. His intention was to reach any part of Australia, or Van Diemen's Land, not thinking of the stupendous nature of his undertaking; and one tempestuous night, when the darkness was almost impervious, and the tremendous sound of the wind and water deadened all other noises, four of them put to sea in a boat they discovered by the shore; and madly onward, over the waves, the slight craft bounded away.
                  Of the famine and the wet, it is not necessary to speak here; suffice it to say, that he was the only survivor left, and was picked up at sea by a passing vessel,—having taken the precaution to cast away all his clothing, lest it should betray him; and thus, with a feigned tale of an emigrant vessel lost, the boat swamping just as he was taken out of her, he received the frank hospitality of the seamen, and after some months landed in England.
                  Few would have known the haggard and gaunt-looking wretch, who crawled about the streets of London, seeking for his poor mother, to be the escaped convict, Henry Rivers. He knew that, if taken, there would be but a short shrift ere the gibbet should claim its unnatural fruit. This consideration was secondary. He hesitated not; and after long and cautious inquiry, at last found his aged mother, lying in an obscure lodging upon her death-bed.
                  He was in time to kiss her brow, to receive her blessing, and to close her eyes; and during the solemn vigils which followed when he sate by the corpse, now growing cold as clay, he thought over his past life, while gazing on the venerable face yet wearing a smile upon its lips; for surely God must have had mercy upon the desolated mother, and in that last moment of her life repaid her for fifteen years of such tremendous anguish which falls, let us hope, but to the lot of few.
                  For nearly a week did the body remain in the room, while Henry, with every energy he could gather, found a little work, which enabled him to pay the last human tribute could to her remains. Her resting-place was humble, but he was not indebted to charity for it; and all this time the youth took no care to hide himself. Life had grown a burthen to him, too heavy to be borne, and what should happen next he grew indifferent to. In fine, he was recognised and seized.
                  It was a crowded court, public curiosity being aroused by the startling facts the prisoner disclosed of his past life, that they beheld a man who had been through every stage of judicial punishment, stand up and make his own defence. He had determinedly pleaded "guilty" to escaping; he had refused the aid of those who are employed for the defence of prisoners of his class; he had rejected all and everything offered, and amid the most intense silence, while anxiety was expressed upon hundreds of human faces, he arose and made the following speech:—
                  "You have made laws of iron for the misjudgment of men that have made them felons, and filled the path of honesty with brambles and thorns. Your code erroneously founded on a principle of mercy, and on a fanciful idea, that you are preserving the spirit of that remarkable sentence uttered by one of our predecessors, 'that it is better to let ninety-nine guilty men escape than that one innocent man should be punished' is falsified. I am that innocent one, standing in the presence of God and man this day to advocate and defend my cause. There is not within this assembly no, not within this vast city—nor in England a man more guiltless than I of every charge which has been made against me, and for which I have been punished.
                  "The brand of crime is widely different from the brand of the criminal; but this difference is not perceptible to the general eye; nor do the features of a man always indicate this difference. Look upon me, and see whether my eye be not firm and unquailing, without either the bravado of false courage or any insolent assumption. Look, I say, upon the face, and through the eyes of an innocent, an honest man—read in his soul the truth of my assertion.
                  "My father was said to be a man of genius. I do no assert it; but I have heard also that genius turns upon her adoring children and rends them. If this be any proof of it, his miserable end must indicate genius of the loftiest order. He was therefore condemned to paint artificial flowers—and to starve.
                  "My mother was one of those meek and patient souls who endure privations in an unmurmuring silence. She neither raved nor tore her hair, when she beheld me, step by step, dragged through every human indignity: when she witnessed the iron hand of power force the horrible draught of the most dreadful human sufferings to my lips, of which cup I have been compelled to drink, and drink deeply; and shortly—I am conscious of it—you, gentlemen, will force me to drain the very dregs on the scaffold which I see dimly louring in the short distance of a few days. Be it so. I am fully prepared;—but I leave you a legacy behind me—a legacy of blood—of cold atrocious murder:—on your heads be the responsibility of my death!"
                  Here the prisoner was warned that he must confine himself to his defence alone, without commenting upon his judges, or casting reflections on the law which was to deprive him of his life. The prisoner then proceeded:—
                  "My first crime against the laws of a country that has been a cruel stepmother to me, was that of being poor. With a small basket of fruit, furnished to me by the charity of a friend, now in heaven, I went forth into the inhospitable streets, leaving at home a mother ill and a sister dying—all are dead now;—but I wander. While seeking to sell my wares, I was ordered by a policeman to remove, and upon remonstrating with him, was taken to the station-house, and found in an outlaw to society, one human being whose milk was not all turned to gall. It was in that den of shame and abomination—when heaven seemed to have frowned upon the child of poverty, that I was made a thief. A watch and some money were found on my person. So abhorrent and so flagrant was the whole nature of my wrongs begun on that night so fatal to me, that I could not find words to justify myself. I suffered accordingly.
                  "Gentlemen, the magistrate who consigned me to the treadmill—to this college of crime—was as cool and collected as if he was not then destining a poor human soul to its future good or evil. He passed from the former flagrant case, when a man of notoriously known bad character was brought before him,—I say he dismissed this man with the same indifference that he decided mine, and went into the next as a part of his day's work—with a remark that my examination had taken up a deal of his time,—and proceeded to the next quite as composedly.
                  "He beheld me destitute and friendless. It was he who should have been my advocate, and not my executioner. It was his duty to have proved me innocent, and not upon circumstantial evidence, and the oath of a policeman, to have condemned me. He said, my case took up a 'deal of time.' The 'majesty of the law' seems to me a very fine phrase, but meaningless to my narrow capacity; the majesty of justice is quite another thing; but this was not supposed to be worthy of a thought. Had he listened to the tale of the poor Irishwoman, whom he disregarded; had he examined the men who were with me in the same cell; had he done as much to prove me innocent as he did to prove me guilty, I should not have stood before you this day awaiting my sentence of death!"
                  After a cause, during which the sound of a pin falling to the ground might have been heard, the prisoner whose pale face was now and then flushed with the emotions his reminiscences brought to him, resumed:
                  "I was driven mad in the Penitentiary, and punished for a theft where no one was robbed. Young and helpless, they inflicted upon me a punishment that my weak imagination could not endure, and which a strong man with physical energies to counteract the effects of his hallucination could alone bear, even if he could. Without employment, forbidden the use of that faculty of speech God had given me to express rightly, right ideas, the creators of this infamous punishment forgot that they were marking their disapprobation of their creator's decree, at the same time they were guilty of an unconscious blasphemy.
                  "My remembrance of that fearful time is a vacuity, and I dare not attempt to enter into any of its details. I therefore pass over to make a few brief remarks on the next dark episode of a doomed and wretched life. While endeavoring to support myself and my mother, whose affection for me no infamy could destroy or weaken, driven from my former mean lodgings by the obloquy that others had heaped upon me while honestly striving to make use of the talent so long idle, and so little encouraged, I was inveigled into a snare, into which a more cautious, or a better informed man might have fallen. I was made a forger without comprehending what forgery meant. I was made a criminal in ignorance of my crime: the very promptings that no man can dare deny were to become my ruin, and which sprung from the most sacred and hallowed motives, dragged me into an abyss that will lead me to the gibbet and plunge me—not wholly unprepared, I humbly trust—into the solemn profundity of another world: and I found myself at the hulks.
                  "Gentlemen, I have been blamed for escaping from that terrible purgatory. Would you blame a man for seeking to fly the claws of a wild beast, or defending himself from the knife of the assassin? It was the indestructible instinct of self-preservation that prompted me to fly. My pursuers took advantage of a virtue, of my filial piety, of which I make no boast, and I was consigned to Norfolk Island.
                  "A man living a stranger among men, I have been excluded from every humanizing contact which I have sought as a child seeks its mother's breast, and have been rudely driven from among them, My heart has had every impulse of affection chilled and blasted; I have experienced neither love nor friendship; and nothing was left me but to drink from the black and bitter waters of hatred, and I have forced my lips from touching that polluted stream so far, that I think with no unkindness of any human being—not of the unjust judge who first condemned me, nor of the keeper who locked me up to shriek in my cell, nor of the man who flogged the flesh off my back at the Penal Settlements:—I am an outcast of the human race; and yet, at perfect peace with the world.
                  "From Norfolk Island, a spot that may indicate the extreme of what earthly desolation can be, after incredible hardships, and undergoing great privations, I escaped, and I now stand—here!
                  
                  "Gentlemen, I have done. I began to defend myself, and now find that, in this brief narrative of my life, defence was unnecessary. My mother is dead! it is my earnest prayer that I may soon join her. The last living link that bound me to life is departed, and my business on this earth is now over. I have nothing more to say, and now await your decision!"
                  This singular mode of defence, so bold, so original, and so graphic, puzzled the judge; but was of no avail, even had the man made any endeavor to avert the fearful sentence about to be uttered against him. Short, and even ungracious comment, was made upon his speech; and the judge, putting on his black cap, sentenced him to be "taken to the place of execution, and there hanged by the neck till he was dead; and the Lord" (a fearful mockery of human words) was prayed "to have mercy upon his soul!"
                  
                  The morning of execution came, and the prisoner, calm, and even happy, walked with a firm step, an unclouded face, and a serene kind of joy shining out of his eyes, to the scaffold. A certain set form of preparation for death had been gone through; but the prisoner had made his peace with heaven, so he said, before then; and the clergyman's prayer and homily, however well meant, fell upon ears indifferent to all that was spoken. Henry Rivers prayed silently, fervently, and made no speech of warning to the vagabond crowd that thronged the space,—among whom were people of birth and fashion; for he had naught to warn them against, except to beware of poverty;—and he was duly hanged according to course of law.
                  We have no moral to point out; the man was sinless. If there be aught to glean from our succinct history, it is for the legislator to draw it.
               
               THE END.
            
            
               
               THE LAPLAND RAT;
               OR, THE LOSS OF THE ROYAL GEORGE.
               
                  CHAPTER I.
                  LATE on a wild night, in the year 1780, the inhabitants of High street, Gosport (Portsmouth), were alarmed by hearing cries of "Help!" and "Murder!" ringing ominously in the streets, added to the sound of oaths, the trampling of feet, and a few moments after of voices shouting—"There he goes!—this way! this way!" "Down with him!—he's bolting!" "He's escaping!" "He has got away!" followed by execrations and blasphemies; and then they heard a rushing as of men in rapid pursuit, when the sounds died away. They only heard, then, the rising of the wind, the roar of the sea-waves in the bay, and the clatter of the descending rain beating on the windows.
                  Those who were thus alarmed out of their sleep, and who went to the windows to see what could be seen, only discerned the outline of several forms scuffling together and hurrying to and fro; and trembling with fear and dread they returned back to their beds, murmuring—
                  "It's the press-gang seizing some poor fellows. Pray God they may escape!"
                  It was during this period, when England was at war with the Continent, pouring out her blood and lavishing her wealth at the altar of Moloch and Conquest, sowing those awful seeds of terror, torture and ghastly death in the bosoms of peaceful communities; changing the finer traits of human nature into the attributes of demons; heaping up an enormous debt which was to lie like a nightmare upon her children in the future, prove a plentiful source of poverty and misery, both of which were to be proved (as we have seen) by the evolution of those terrible poor-laws, which in their operation have been attended with such fearful results and in so many instances,—it was at this period, when men were ruled with an iron despotism in the two services, naval and military, that a continual supply was required for manning the vessels of war then engaged in sea or channel service, that the "press-gang" was called forth, and men were kidnapped in the open streets day and night, time nor place mattered not, and with every sort of brutal violence short of actually killing them or breaking a limb, and thus rendering them useless for service—fathers and sons, husbands and brothers, were torn from their families, dragged on board a "tender," and consigned to the decks of a man-of-war, to be flogged, or shot or mutilated, as chance might decide, but to be from that hour forth a slave to the tyrant of the quarter-deck.
                  There was something 
                        so so
                        so
                      shameless, so impudent about this lawless proceeding, that the blood boils under the influence of a feeling almost ferocious, as we contemplate the results of such an immediate deprivation of his liberty, of everything that to a man was really worth living for. The anxious wife might watch and wait for many a weary hour, until the agony of expectation would become almost too great for the brain to bear, and she would at last come to the maddening conclusion that her husband had been waylaid by the miscreants engaged for the purpose, and be compelled to arrive at the conclusion that she might never, never see him more.
                  Many a home was thus broken up and rendered for ever desolate. Business was necessarily suspended, and next completely ended; for the farmer's or the artizan's wife could not proceed with the 
                        arangements
                        arrangements
                      the husband had commenced. The cool audacity of those in office who beheld all this, who supported the infamous measures which made men actually loath life, appears to us in a form so detestable, that we only wonder the nation was quiet under the repetition of outrages so abominable, upon the liberty of the subject; and but that the whole was under an oligarchy, at whose least nod the military turned out, and pointed their arms upon the people, such would have been ended almost at the very beginning of the measure which filled the land with beggary, and the tears of orphans and bereaved wives.
                  Men who, from the necessities of the case dwelt in sea-port towns, or in the immediate neighborhood of the coast, were not safe for a single day. They walked about in fear and trembling; and the horror felt against the press-gang, was so great that those unfortunate enough to fall into their clutches had only to count upon the most desperate resistance. This was, however, but too often rendered impossible; for the common custom was to knock down a man (from behind) with a bludgeon, and in that senseless state bind him hand and foot, carry him to a boat, pull off to that floating pandemonium, a "tender," from which he was drafted off in a very short time, to fill up a gap made by the cannon of the enemy. And on the night our story opens the press-gang was prowling about the streets of Portsmouth and its neighborhood in search of any they might meet. And now to our tale.
                  In the neighborhood of a pretty little market-town named Havant, which was situated some dozen miles or so from Portsmouth, there lay a snug and thriving farm of several acres in extent, which had been in an old family for many generations, and which was, at the period our tale opens, in the possession of Ambrose Corbyn, a distant relative who had wedded a far-removed cousin, Emily Corbyn, thus uniting the two extreme branches of the family, and transmitting in a direct line (on the female side) the little inheritance, which, small, compact, and snug, always supplied the means of a comfortable subsistence, but without the likelihood of ever making anything like an independence.
                  Ambrose Corbyn was a fine, athletic yeoman, of about thirty years of age (some four years his wife's senior), and was, if no great scholar, as tolerably accomplished as most of his class at that time, which, however, may not be saying much for the intelligence of the farming portion of the community generally. He was the father of three beautiful and healthy children: one, a boy, a mere infant, and two girls, the eldest of whom might be about seven or eight. He loved his wife with that quiet yet calm energy, and with a trusting faith in her virtues personal, domestic and general, which men of quiet and unobtrusive natures, when they do once love, are apt to cherish. It had not the slightest particle of rapture in it; but any one looking upon the brown, healthy, handsome countenances of the two, and seeing the smile that would light up lips and eyes, would understand in the moment the strength of their feeling towards each other.
                  Business of course sometimes connected with the little form of Galeborne drew him occasionally to the towns of the neighborhood, and among others, Portsmouth required his presence. On the morning of the day in question, after having breakfasted fasted and arranged the business of the day for barn, dairy, and field, he announced his intention of going to Portsmouth, on matters that might keep him till the afternoon, when he would return at least before nightfall. He would take his little sure-footed nag, and, armed with a trusty cudgel, he had no fear for any danger the road might offer.
                  No sooner, however, had he mentioned this determination than his wife suddenly turned pale, and became greatly agitated, and her lips quivered as the unbidden tears started into her eyes.
                  "Why, Emily, my dear," said he gaily, pinching her cheeks softly, "what's the matter? Going to be a fine lady, eh! and have the vapors? Come, come, this is something new in you."
                  "Oh, Ambrose," she said hurriedly, "I am very foolish, I know; and for the first time in my life I feel what it is to be really nervous. I know you will laugh at me, but—"
                  "Why, what's the matter?" asked Ambrose, not a little surprised at this unusual burst of emotion on the part of his wife, who was, generally speaking, collected enough on matters of emergency.
                  "It is about your going to Portsmouth," she replied.
                  "About my going to Portsmouth!" he echoed in amazement. "Why, what the deuce, Emmy—you never were particularly anxious about this before—how is it? You can't be well to-day."
                  "Oh! I am quite well," she replied; but added with a shudder, "I've heard them say the press-gang is out, and if they should meet you—"
                  "Tut," he gaily answered, "is this all that's bothering your silly little head? Come, pluck up courage, and give me a kiss, and make yourself perfectly comfortable. I shall be safe enough. I warrant you that not a man will touch me—there's nothing to fear at all."
                  "But you know that old Goody Banks, that was once so comfortable and is now a heart-broken old woman in the workhouse, you know that she lost her son James—he was taken by the press-gang, Ambrose—and they say, too, that he was killed in less than a week after in some of those dreadful actions."
                  "Well," said Ambrose, gravely, "that story is true enough, I believe, but still I have no fear. Ah! it was an ill day for the old woman, truly—"
                  "And oh! Ambrose," cried out his wife in a momentary fit of involuntary fright at the suggestion, "what would become of me and of the children if such were to happen to you?"
                  "Why, Emily, you are frightening yourself with shadows," said Ambrose in a kindly manner, tenderly passing his arm around her waist. "You must not fret yourself with dreaming over things that cannot happen—"
                  "I know all this well enough, Ambrose," answered Emily tearfully, "but I cannot help it, and you must forgive, you—"
                  "Forgive you, my own darling," said Ambrose, "I should think so, indeed. A man must be an utter brute who could be vexed with a woman for being over anxious on his account—and so cheer up. I shall not be in Gosport half-an-hour, and the vagabonds would hardly dare to attack a man in the open street in broad day. At night it may be more dangerous, but then I shall be back before dark, and so once more kiss me, and good bye." He then kissed her, and taking a fond leave of the children, and mounting his pony, which had been brought to the door, he plucked up courage enough to resist the wistful and entreating glances of his wife, and rode away.
                  Emily looked after her husband with something in her face that was very much like to despair. She felt her heart sink within her as she saw his manly form vanish at a turning of the road, and despite all the efforts at firmness which she made, she could not help sinking back into the chair and bursting into tears. This did but little to mend the matter, for the children, seeing their mother cry, "lifted up their voices," and wept also.
                  It was impossible to define the unaccountable terror that she felt: most people have experienced it at some time or other, and many have known it to have the sense of a prophetic foreboding, when such a misgiving was followed by its fulfilment. This was what Emily Corbyn felt. She dared not whisper her fears to herself, but if she had spoken them aloud she would have said that she looked for the last time upon her husband; that he had given his last kiss; and that she should never see him more. This feeling grew at last so dreadfully overpowering that, in sheer self-defence, she at last roused up and began to bustle distractedly about the house.
                  Ambrose reached Gosport in good time, and proceeded to complete his business there, and nothing now remained for him to do but to take some refreshments at the nearest tavern, and then hasten his return. All this time, during the bustle and brightness of the day, not the 
                        slighest
                        slightest
                      suspicion of danger came in any shape to haunt him. He had been so successful in performing the matter that had brought him there, that he was in unusually good spirits, and he sat down in the bar of a little tavern before a noble round of beef, flanked with a loaf and a foaming jug of beer, and ate his meal with a relish, known only to a strong and healthy man in the prime of his animal life.
                  He had cleared his plate, drank off his ale with zest, and was on the point of calling for the amount of his reckoning and taking his departure, when a person entered the room who altered in a moment the intention he had formed.
                  The person in question was a resident of the neighborhood, a man for whom Ambrose had an especial regard; first, because they had known each other from childhood and had been schoolfellows together; and because also they had done for each other such real and actual services as men, that when they met, which was not by any means as often as they desired, they met like old friends after long absence, and always parted with reluctance.
                  Their pleasure at thus unexpectedly meeting therefore, was great and undisguised, and the next moment two rummers of reeking punch were smoking between them, and they were deep in the heart of a conversation which was endless in its topics.
                  One can easily imagine when our two friends had lighted their cheerful pipes, and began to imbibe the grateful and fragrant punch, that with every moment of time they spent thus so cordially together, came a continued and increased dislike for the parting; in fact, the afternoon was by this time fast fading away, when Ambrose started up, and said that he must go—he had promised to be back early.
                  "Why, Ambrose, man," exclaimed his half-surprised and half-vexed friend, "do we meet so often that we must only spend a mere moment or two and a 'how are you,' and then hurry away, that you can't spare me an hour of your company."
                  "I'll say this, Gerald," replied Ambrose, cordially, "that if I had but one more glass to drink in the world, half of it should be with you or for you—"
                  "Sit down then, man; and come, then, hostess, let's have some more punch!" said Gerald, jovially; for he was warming with his liquor,
                  "Nay, but Gerald, my man, fair and softly," cried Ambrose laughing. "It's getting late, and I know that my wife has gotten an uneasy crotchet in her head if I don't hurry."
                  "Tell her thou'st been with me, then," said the sanguine Gerald, with great good humor; "and if she grumbles at that, I'll never drink any of her home-brewed under her roof any more. Why, what the plague makes her more uneasy now than at any other time?"
                  Ambrose was unwilling to acknowledge the source of his wife's fear, lest he should be laughed at; for he had not the moral courage to provoke ridicule, and besides, the entrance of the punch just ordered in a manner resolved him, so he sat down, somewhat what annoyed with himself, and inwardly resolving that this should be his last glass, quieting his conscience with the idea that he was only humoring the whim of an old friend, and could scarcely avoid doing otherwise than as he was.
                  The afternoon wore away cosily enough, and the day, which, by the bye, had been cold and gusty, despite of all prognostics in favor of a fine but windy night, promised to end in a storm; and sure enough the storm at last broke forth in such a torrent of rain and sleet, that this was quite a sufficing reason for Ambrose prolonging his stay, in the hope that it would clear up, while the wind rose into a tempest, and the darkness at last set in, thick as an Egyptian mist.
                  The bright fire roared and sparkled in the grate; the two friends quaffed and chatted, and the one had forgotten his cares, (Gerald was often full of them,) and Ambrose had all but forgotten his wife's apprehensions.—He could not but remember, however, and with a grateful love, that they had arisen from her anxiety for him. Leaving them, therefore, to their punch and their confabulation, the enjoyment of the whole heightened by the sound of the falling rain and the increasing wind, we must introduce a few other characters before the reader, which are necessary for the development of our story.
                  The "Royal George," lying at Spithead, was short-handed, and it was necessary for her to put to sea without loss of time, and, in consequence, the want of men was felt to be of pressing and imminent necessity, and it was intimated that men must be had at any risk and on any condition, by which it was inferred that the duties of the press-gang were to be discharged with such additional rigor, that no delay should take place in obtaining the required number.—This principle, so atrocious in itself, was therefore indispensable.
                  In the bay lay the tender, a "sheer old hulk," that had once served as a gun-brig, and borne the characteristic title of the "Bulldog." From this tender, when the shadows of evening had fallen, and while the rain poured and the wind raged, a well, manned boat, headed by a brutal petty officer, (all the men being armed with cutlasses and bludgeons,) pulled towards the Gosport shore, and stealthily landing, so as to cause neither alarm nor apprehension, word was passed to some few notorious taverns and other infamous dens, where that quintessence of scoundrelism, the "crimp," dwelt, that they were to be on the alert, for that money was to be made, and for every individual thus obtained a handsome douceur was instantly paid; or if not paid down, it was to be got at the government offices.
                  In one of the narrowest and filthiest of those numerous small streets which led up from the water side to the more mysterious intricacies of Gosport, and which are ramified like the veins of a body in such a hopeless maze of entanglement that none but a resident can thread their mazes—in one of these, with one gable fronting the bay, and having a door opening into a sort of "blind alley," was situated a tavern of very indifferent repute, and known as the Flying Fish, and kept by a "crimp," named Moses Flathead, and in whose filthy den the press-gang at times sheltered itself till it turned out to seize its prey, or to where the wily scoundrel decoyed the unsuspecting stranger, and sold him to the gang at so much per head, without the slightest compunction.
                  The men had landed from the boat, which was fastened to the quay, and one being left in it, the party stealthily crossed the street opposite where the Flying Fish stood, and entering one by one through the private door were, in a minute or two, safely housed in the huge old kitchen, where a jovial fire blazed.
                  "This is a reg'lar dirty night," observed one of the men, a large lumbering fellow, "and a can of flip wouldn't do any harm."
                  "Holloa!" shouted their leader, a brawny black-faced ruffian, "Moses! hogshead! bear a hand, you ground tier-butt, bring in some rum first," he added, as the landlord entered, "and then tell us if there's any one to be nabbed." In a minute or two the order was obeyed, and Moses conveyed to them the news required.
                  Now, by some means or other, Moses had obtained information that, at the Falcon tavern, two country farmers were in the "potentiality" of their two or three glasses of punch a-piece, forgetting all the risks and dangers which the streets of Gosport were like to offer.
                  "All right!" said the leader, when the can was passed round and drained; "now you, Rummer, Caboose, Black Dick, and a couple more, with myself, will go to this crib and overhaul it. If so be must board it—"
                  "Board it!" cried one of the gang with a horse laugh, "I'm blowed if the fellows don't run into a net as comfortable as ever a fly ran into a spider's web. Watch them out, and then—"
                  He needed not to conclude his sentence, for the hoarse and sinister laugh that ran round was convincing enough of the execrable intention.
                  "You'll 'members me, if you nabs him," said Moses in his thick, hoarse whisper, forcing his ill-looking face among the men, and laying his finger with a cunning air along his nose. "If any of the long-shore chaps ever comes into the Flying Fish, I allus bones him."
                  "Aye—aye! heave a-head," growled the chief. "Pretty Judas you are, deep seas sink you! and do you fellows remain here; and leave that door open, Moses, in case anybody should happen to mistake this place for something like a cottage in the wood, as the song says. Away there, lads!" he added, "and mind your stretchers don't hit too hard. We musn't take a spoiled hand aboard;" and then, a moment or two after they were as quietly in the street advancing under cover of the darkness towards the Falcon, where our friends still were—but now about to part in earnest; for though the lull in the storm was only slight, Ambrose began to get seriously alarmed at the idea of causing his wife such a terrible anxiety—as he necessarily must—by his continued stay.
                  His friend, somewhat more elevated, had departed a few minutes (fortunately for him) before the ruffians came up, (and halted at some distance, half on each side of the house, and in the narrow entries, that offered easy shelter), and he thus escaped them. Ambrose was settling the reckoning with the landlord, and had buttoned up his coat, grasped his cudgel tightly, and was in the street before he found that his head was not perfectly clear from the effect of his potations. The door of the tavern was locked and bolted, the light vanished from the window, and as Ambrose halted an instant to bethink him how he should turn, to right or left, up or down, to reach the stabling where he had put up his pony, he thought he detected the sound of stealthy feet advancing towards him under cover of the intense darkness which the houses cast below.
                  His suspicions were wakened in a moment but they were not exactly correct in their nature, though they prompted him to the same course of action, namely, the use of his tough and trusty cudgel, which Ambrose knew how to handle with tolerable skill.—He took the person or persons who advanced to be thieves, and thought not of the press gang, which would have disarmed him of almost all his courage and pluck—the horrifying name was such a spell to men at that time. He listened, and the steps came nearer. He peered into the darkness, and stepped briskly on. He fancied that steps were now advancing to meet him. With a beating heart his nervy fingers twined around his cudgel, as, determined to know the worst, he cried out, "Is there anybody there?"
                  "Halloa, messmate!" said a gruff voice, as a man's form ran against him: "what cheer! what cheer? Yo-ho! my hearties!" he added, in a voice completely changed in its accents. "Douse my top-lights! here's your man—lay alongside and grap—" but before he could complete the word a terrific blow, which sounded on the man's cheekbones as though they had been, to use his own expression, "stove in," levelled him to the ground, and with a fury that was fearfully fully effective at the moment. Ambrose wielded his crab-stick right and left with such good effect that another bit the dust, while a third was sent reeling back several paces from a slashing hit on the temple.—Ambrose fought like a lion then, for life—aye, more than life—liberty, wife, children, home! all those (and comprised in that last word we have expressed the great stake for which he now struggled), all those depended upon his prowess at this moment, and the consciousness of it seemed to arm him with an increased strength.
                  The remainder of the gang seeing clearly that this man was likely to escape from them, and not only that, but to leave with one and all an ugly token of their defeat—enraged at this, drew their cutlasses and pressed closer in upon him. These were not more effectual weapons to ward off the rapid shower of blows which the athletic arm of Ambrose bestowed upon them in so plentiful a manner, and one or two of their blades had already snapped. Amid a storm of the vilest oaths, one of the villains from behind had managed to give the now half-exhausted farmer a severe wound in the head, from which the blood was plentifully streaming, and he felt that his strength was fast failing him. The cowardly rascals seeing this, pressed upon him still closer; and Ambrose, though he still desperately warded off the attempts made to cut him down by fighting in a circle, felt that his chances of escape were diminishing every moment. One could not cope with four or five.
                  It was then that those cries of "murder!" and "help!" which had alarmed the sleepers, rose in the streets, as the poor fellow in his despair had recourse to the only means that now seemed left to him. It was useless; weaker and weaker he had become, when gathering all his energies for one desperate rally—his only chance—and reckless now of life, he made a furious dash against two who opposed him, struck one down, and though severely wounded again in the arm by the other, darted away, and to the rage and mortification of the gang, got clear off. Then in turn did the oaths and shouts mingle with the storm, as they set off in pursuit.
                  Ambrose dashed on—on—and began to flatter himself that he might give them the slip. The door of the Flying Fish was then partially open as he passed, panting and 
                        breathlass
                        breathless
                     , and with everything at stake, Ambrose thought that an opportunity like this must not be lost. They would surely shelter him there; and while the cries of the baffled bravos, their raging oaths, and their trampling feet, still reached his ears, he eagerly pushed the door (which was fastened by a chain) as far open as he could, and then tremulously knocked. The landlord, bidding those within to make no noise, came forward and whispered out—
                  "Who's dere? Is you in a hurry, young feller?"
                  "Open, for God's sake!" cried Ambrose. "Save me, and I'll reward you. Open—open—I am escaping from the press-gang; they are after me, and I shall be taken.—Open for the sake of my wife and children!"
                  "It's very dangerous," said the landlord, pondering and playing in a tantalizing manner with the chain of the door.
                  "Oh, do not count the danger," cried poor Ambrose. "I will pay you well for all you risk—anything—everything. Open, or I shall die at the door."
                  "Vot 'ave you got about you?" asked Moses, very cautiously, for a particularly bright thought had struck him.
                  "Some money—a watch," replied Ambrose, in his agitation scarcely knowing what he did.
                  "Just 'and them in, vill you? I may be persecuted by the gov'ment for this, my chicken, any though my 'art's tender, I may get a precious tough piece of leather to chew for it, and so—"
                  "Here, here—take them!" cried Ambrose, hurriedly handing them in between the door, which the astute Moses still jealously kept fastened; for if once the stranger got in, there might be others to share his plunder. He took the gift and said—"Wait a moment:" then entered into the kitchen where the remainder of the press-gang were seated, still as death, listening to the voices without, but unable to distinguish what was said. Moses had secreted the watch and the money in his own breast pocket; and then with an exulting grin upon his cunning face, he said:—
                  "There's a cove there wot's a running away from the press-gang; he's vating at the door. Vouldn't it be a blessed pity not to open it for him, eh? My 'art's a reglar breaking for him."
                  "Why didn't you, curse you," growled one; "he'll be bolting away—get tired of waiting. Open, you swab, and stand by, lads, to seize him at once. When such a job as this is to be done, why the sooner it's over the better. Mum! here he comes."
                  Moses, with his abominably crafty face, was ushering in the unsuspecting stranger, who tottered with weakness. When he entered the kitchen, however, and saw the men, and the menacing attack, a murderous fury possessed him.
                  "Betrayed!" shrieked Ambrose, flinging the first away. "Hell-hound! Judas! take that," he yelled, as with a fearful blow that crashed full on the skull of Moses the "peerless" and pure; and as the latter fell like a slaughtered bullock to the ground, bathed in his own blood, the sweep of a cutlass, well-applied, reduced Ambrose to the same condition.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II
                  THE gray dawn broke over the waters of the Atlantic, and noble and stately craft, large and small, from the waterman's boat to the mighty man-of-war, lay heaving in the bay formed by the peninsulas of Port-sea, Portsmouth, and Gosport; and foremost in the rank of those objects of maritime wonder was one of the oldest line-of-battle ships in the service, the "Royal George," with sails loose, flag and pennant flying, bounding on the crested waves like an anxious courser burning with ardor to start, there she lay waiting for her complement of men.
                  A few words here will give to the reader as much information of the origin and progress of this noble ship as will be necessary for the purposes of our story. Her keel was laid down at the Woolwich dockyard in 1751, which she left in 1755. She carried in all, cannon and carronade, 180 guns of the 
                        heavist
                        heaviest
                      weight of metal originally, that is to say, fifty-two, forty, and twenty-eight pounders. She was commanded in turn by Lord Anson, Admiral Boscawen, Lord Rodney, Lord Howe, and other of our greatest naval heroes, and she played her part in many of those terrible sea-fights where human life was reckoned as so much ship-timber to be "expended"—food for powder merely—fought battles, that caused such a fearful waste of men and money, and rent asunder for ever many a fond family tie.
                  Vast monstrous, and unsympathizing, a huge mountain of wood and iron, cordage and canvass, she might have been likened to some devouring monster—a modern Minotaur, that yearly swallowed within its maw the boldest and bravest of the land, hiding all her grim and ghastly fierceness under an exterior that was at times regal, magnificent and stately. At other times, when her cannon belched fire, and her scuppers ran with blood, her ensanguined and splintered sides, her gaping rents and blood-drunken roar, showed her in another but a truer guise. Then she would reel on the waters with a sort of furious glee; then she would utter forth a defiance to the waves in a voice of storm and thunder; then, indeed, there was no fear whatever of mistaking the warlike character of this monarch of the ocean.
                  On the morning, then, after the capture of Ambrose Corbyn, and after the usual duties of the vessel, the mustering, the holy-stoning, and breakfasting of the men were all over, the watch set, and the monotonous routine of the marine population of the ship had been completed, the men detached themselves into various groups here and there about the deck, the forecastle, the tops; and while others again were engaged below in their various avocations; while the gunner looked to the ordnance, and the boatswain was overhauling his stores; while boats were dotting the waters, and the sound of hammers in the dockyards rang incessantly in the air, while great cannon now and then roared like thunder, saluting some arrival or other; while all these took place, creating a bustle full of picturesque animation, a scene was taking place on board, to which we invite the reader's attention, as another important character is introduced to his notice.
                  Close beside the forecastle the reader is aware that, in the middle of the deck, is a large opening, known as a hatchway, leading by a broad capacious step-ladder to the deck below. This is hidden from the view of the quarter deck by a large building called the "caboose," in which the cook and his mate hold an uninterrupted sway; in which are fixed his boilers, his furnaces, his culinary implements, and all the details required for providing the food of so many hundreds of men.
                  A little before noon, had any one been looking on this particular part of the deck, a head might have been seen projecting itself above the "combings" of this hatchway, and a pair of bright, small, and deep-set eyes gleaming from beneath the shaggy folds of the eyebrows peering anxiously round. The first look would have induced a second, and then the eyes of the spectator would have fastened on this strange head, while a sentiment of astonishment, surprise, and fear would have pervaded the heart of the gazer, who would have been puzzled to make out to what creature this head belonged.
                  It certainly appeared to belong to nothing human; for a more startling apparition with the full functions of life and motion actuating it, was rarely or ever seen. The face was half-hidden by the wild and ragged looking hair that fell in matted masses about his face. The countenance, for the creature had one, was not unlike that of a rat; for while the stubby whiskers, few in number, but long and straight, stuck out like those of the animal we have named, the lower jaw was deficient in its formation, and fell back in precisely the same manner. It was the head and face of a human rat, in fact, on a large scale indeed, but perfect so far as resemblance could go.
                  The head rose higher until almost the whole of the broad, stunted, misshapen, and oddly-clad deformity was apparent. The chest was wide, the breadth of shoulders and the length of arms immense, and indicated great personal strength. The lower limbs looked shambling, withered affairs, and it turned out that this was one of those singular anomalies of nature which appear at times to show, as it were, what a want of harmony there is in form and shape when the usual order of her laws has been broken by some other stronger or exceptive law—probably of discord, of accident, or of necessity.
                  Now it was by no means uncommon for such as these to be seen on board men-of-war, and that for so many different reasons. A negro for the caboose, "a nigger to lark with," a monkey, a goat, a Lascar, a Malay, a dog, a parrot, a porpoise, or a shark, if it were possible. Any of these become absolutely necessary on board ship, in order that the men may have something to exhaust their robust waggery upon—something to make a butt of—something to be absurdly fond of, or to kick or rope's end about the deck. This poor creature was apparently, and so far as any of the hands "for'ad" could make out, created for no other purpose; and it must be confessed that while he did this onerous duty, he had no very easy life of it.
                  At the very moment we described him as gradually emerging out of the hatchway, some rough and practical jest enough was being exercised upon him. All at once his legs were knocked from under him, he fell down the ladder as if it had been broken away, and as his head sounded on the oak deck below, a roar of merriment from a group of jolly and certainly very pitiless Jack-tars greeted him.
                  "Couldn't you say stand from under, without all that lumber of yours slipping out of the slings?" said a fine athletic mischievous seaman, named Trunnion, in appearance the ideal of a British sailor at the "Surrey," ever generous, ever ready to succor the distressed. "Couldn't you bellow 'below!' and be cursed to you," he added with a kick, "'stead o' falling down a sky-light in that fashion?" and the laugh rose louder.
                  "Hurrah! for the Rat—the Lapland Rat!" shouted another. "Where's the dog—where's the cat—turn 'em out! Rat! Rat!"
                  "I say," growled another, whose face was of a savage and morose cast, and who, seated on deck, had grasped the unhappy and half-stunned creature by the collar of a jacket that was half cloth, half bear or fox-skin. "I say, do you call that manners, you beggar?"
                  The "Rat" looked up at him a moment in a bewildered and imploring manner, but the rough seaman, not much accustomed to the expression of sentiment in a countenance, only burst out into a fresh roar of laughter at the almost sublime ugliness of the friendless creature. He made some harsh guttural sounds, which had no assimilation with their language, and from some mal-conformation of the tongue, it was clear that however much he might be master of his own, he could never possess himself of more than a few indistinct words of English.
                  "Here is we," continued the morose seaman, with an air of grave causticity; "here is we, Jack Blogg, Harry Trunnion, Dirk, the Dutchman, there," pointing to a broad built heavy-looking Hollander, "Rummer, Caboose, and others, a taking of our ease, and a drinking of our grog—pass the kid Jack!" (this was parenthetically spoken as a hooped vessel of liquor was handed to him) and a settling of the French fleet, and must go to be disturbed by the spawn of a Lapland witch in this here fashion. Tells you what it is shipmate, we must cob you!"
                  The "Rat" looked entreatingly in the face of the seaman, as if he understood what he was menaced with, but had no power to resist—he looked imploringly for pity, and the seaman at the time looked round for applause.
                  "What do you say, messmates," continued the man; "shall we hold a court-martial on him, and heave ahead?"
                  "Dat pe von pig joke, haw! haw!" wheezed the Dutchman. "I tink, der tyfel! as you as been cort-martial and shuge too, for you cob him vurst and den troy him after; subbose you cobs him too, and—yaw—ve vill look on and count von, dwo, dree, how many? You careen him now—try him tomorrow."
                  The stolid look of the phlegmatic Dutchman, who proposed an amendment, so to speak, provoked fresh mirth among them, while the Laplander was staring from one to the other with a sort of stupid surprise, and now and then wringing his hands.
                  "Capsize him and down he goes," 
                        shoutad
                        shouted
                      Caboose, laughing. "Here's Jack Jigger's fire buckets;" and seizing a pair of "long-shore boots," with his knife he cut them into slips, and handing them round, they began with a violent uproar, in which laughter predominated, to beat them violently on the bare soles of the feet; till the excruciating pain wrung yells and exclamations from him.
                  "Rat! rat!" exclaimed the panting and infuriated Laplander, in a guttural and indistinct voice, while vainly struggling with them, "him eat—eat—troo—troo—aha! eat—hole—right—troo?" and he grinned like a demon, as he kicked to and fro, and only exhausted himself in the vain effort. At last, while the cobbing, or rather bastinadoing went on, he endured all in perfect quiet, only his kindling eyes, his mutterings, and his quivering flesh, showed that he was concentrating his rage and feeding his hate with his dreadful pain.
                  "I say my lads," said an aged looking and weather-beaten seaman, whose powerful frame, bronzed and scarred face, and grey floating locks, gave him a strikingly impressive appearance, "I say, my lads, there's danger in meddling with those children of ice and storm, all have seen gales bought of a Lapland witch, before now, that floundered half a navy; and I have known a breeze given for nothing that sent a slaver into the calm latitudes, where ship and men rotted, and the ocean there away was haunted for many a year after; so take my word for it, if the 'Rat' can work evil, you have richly deserved it. Knock off and let him go, and pray that you don't go to sea on a Friday." The thoughtless seamen who had witnessed this cruel punishment going on, while the soles of the poor fellows's feet was becoming almost raw with the blows he received, suddenly suspended their mischief, while the Laplander crawled away. The allusion to the winds, said to be sold by the witches of that country, the hint regarding the ships sailing on a Friday, and above all, the results of the tempests sold, and the grave solemn manner of the old mariner who was known to be as brave as a lion, and as tough as oak, were sufficient to convince the most sceptical.
                  The morose seaman who had been, as Dirk Haups the Dutchman said, "judge and executioner," shrank away, and the group was about to break up in a manner unusually noisy—oaths and expletives being double shotted and discharged in plenty from a sensation of shame and annoyance, when a turn was given to the business.
                  At the moment the whistle of the boat swain sounded from the upper deck, and the most intense silence fell instantly. Those bold and turbulent spirits whom nothing could quell, not even the roar of a broadside, or the rage of a tempest—became as children at this signal, which, to a landsman would have conveyed nothing, but, which to them was omnipotent.
                  "Below there, d'ye hear?" shouted the boatswain.
                  "Aye, aye," answered all.
                  "Send up Skaggerac; there's the captain called for him three times, and he's now been sent for; I've handed in a rattan according to orders—'cause why—he's disobeyed—and my eye, he'll get it."
                  A murmur rose among the men. The poor wretch was in the act of going on deck to obey the summons, and they had been the means of hindering him. Pity and remorse took place of fun and rude mirth in their rugged breasts, and exclamations of sorrow rose among one and all, from the sincere but thoughtless tars.
                  "May I be keel-hauled," said Rummer, "if I wouldn't rather have taken a dozen on the gratings. This poor devil will get what fairly ought to be shared out among us—"
                  "He shall have my grog for a week," said another.
                  "And mine, and half rations for a month" added a third. "What the devil brought him among us at a moment so mischievous. I say, Skaggerac boy," don't bear malice," added Trunnion, with some show of feeling. "I'm sorry, d'ye see—I am—" and he confirmed this assertion by a tremendous oath.
                  In the meantime, with downcast eyes, and limbs trembling with pain, the Laplander crawled on deck, and was dragged by the boatswain's mates into the cabin of the redoubtable commander.
                  Captain Crank, commanding the ship under the admiral whose flag was hoisted on board (not Admiral Kemperfelt who went down with her), was a regular naval martinet—a sort of salt-water monster—a very fiend afloat, who made the ship a pandemonium with his ungovernable temper. His men one and all, feared him, but they also hated him with a dislike that was worse than mere loathing. Rude, vulgar, profane, and cruel, he did not stand very high in their reputation for courage; and this being a virtue that with seamen will cover a multitude of failings and sins—this crowning the whole, the muttered curses and oaths that were heaped upon his head by the seamen between decks, might have told the listener pretty plainly the terms on which they stood respectively to each other. On this hapless morning his mood was ferocious.
                  Skaggerac, nicknamed the "Rat," from the strange resemblance which his face bore to that destructive animal, was a Laplander, who had been picked up on a block of ice in the Northern Sea by a Greenland whaler, and who had found his way by one of those chapters of accidents which we need not here inquire into on board a man-of-war. Finally, after having been detained some three years or so, we find him on board the Royal George. The Laplander, cowering and timid, spirit-broken and pining for his bleak home, finding neither love nor sympathy among his numerous tyrants, with his poor feet burning like fire, was roughly handed into the cabin of the captain by two of the boatswain's mates, while the boatswain himself stood at the door, and where also a file of marines were drawn up. This at least, heightened the captain's importance.
                  Captain Crank, with a face fiery red, his eyes actually emitting sparks of rage, and whisking furiously the rattan the boatswain had given him, as though he was growing impatient for the coming of the dilatory knave for whom he had called three times, Captain Crank was pacing the floor of his cabin, as the miserable Skaggerac entered. He lifted up his peculiar eyes to the face of the excited commander, and seeing there little or no hope of sympathy or of pity, guessing intuitively from the rattan (a most fearful weapon when skilfully wielded) he gave one piteous shake of the head, let his head fall on his bosom, and apparently resigned himself without resistance to the fate in store for him.
                  "Now, you pagan scoundrel!" roared the captain, in an explosion of startling curses, "how is it that you did not come when I sent for you?"
                  Skaggerac, for reply, only lifted up his head, advanced his hands a little, made a few guttural attempts at speaking, and with a look towards the men which implied that they knew but that he could not tell. As a matter of course they were mute, and the Laplander was mute also; whereupon the captain put his own construction upon the matter.
                  "By heaven, the vagabond refuses to answer!" he exclaimed. "We will see, however, presently about that. Now, sir—"
                  "Please, your honor," said one of the mates, touching his forelock; "the furren lubber can't speak a word of Engllsb."
                  "Mutiny, by George!" cried the captain casting an eye of menace upon the man who was bold enough to proffer an opinion unasked in the cabin of a ship of war, and in the presence of her commander. "Master-at-arms," he added, "take that fellow away—he's drunk! Don't speak, sir, or I'll have you triced up to one of the gun-carriages there and flogged. You're a drunken lubber, sir—away with him."
                  "I haven't tasted, your honor—" began the man.
                  He was interrupted by the master-at-arms who led him away, and between two of the armed marines he was escorted to the main deck, and left there to cool in irons, and get sober if it were possible; for truth to say, he had tasted but half his allowance that morning.
                  "The service is going to the devil," exclaimed the captain, who might with some justice been accused of having "bowsed his jib" pretty well that morning, such being at times a custom with him, "When scoundrels like that," he continued, speaking of the seaman just named, "dare to turn round and be insolent to their superior officers; it's high time to keep a sharp lookout after them. Now, sirrah!" he exclaimed, in a voice of thunder, and turning his unhealthy and irate eyes upon the miserable Laplander.
                  The latter, seeing and hearing himself addressed, roused from his stupor with a start, and looked up at his formidable commander.
                  "I called for you thrice, you rat-faced looking lubber, and I had, by George, to send a boatswain's mate for you. I wanted my buckles polished, my sword trimmed, and my buckskins cleaned;" for in twenty little trifles of this slavish kind. Skaggerac had shown a singular aptitude and neatness.
                  It was of no earthly use for the Laplander to express in his best pantomime that which struggled for utterance at his tongue's end. The infuriated captain would only have been still more furious. As it was, the latter, maddened by the idea that he was not making himself to appear in the most favorable light before the men and petty officers, with a dreadful oath, cried out—
                  "Sullen vagabond! won't you speak? I'll cut the heart out of you;" and carried away by his temper, he raised his cane.
                  As the frightful weapon fell and twisted like a snake round the unprotected body of the persecuted Laplander, the men, bold, hardy, and inured to such sights as they were, each gave a shiver, and through the set teeth their deep breaths were drawn; the frame of the Laplander seemed to collapse, a moan crossed his livid lips, his head fell, and tears trickled down his cheeks; in a silence that was actual despair he waited for the worst.
                  There was an atrocious cowardice in this which revolted the seamen, and a red spot mounted into the cheeks of one and all, while their lips moved as if they were uttering anything but a blessing on his head.—This only made his fury the more ungovernable. Stamping his foot on the cabin floor he bellowed out with a breath of curses,—
                  "Now, then, who speaks among ye? Eh! Let me see the man bold enough to move his lips, his hand, his foot, unless I give him permission, and by heaven, I'll flay his back into a pickle—I'll flay him—I will?" and to this threat succeeded another sequence of oaths; for the gallant commander was one of those who upheld the honor of the British navy by his remarkable facility of expletives; and at that period swearing was much in vogue, and held in honor. He then concluded by administering a few more well adapted blows of his cane on the shoulders of Skaggerac.
                  Faint and sick with what he had already suffered, and writhing under the awful cuts which visited his miserable body, Skaggerac with one fiery glance at the captain, and with a furious clenching of the fists, accompanied by sounds guttural and harsh, he fell to the ground, while the captain turning pale, cried,
                  "Cursed wizard! he's calling for Beelzebub and his imps; remove him and let him be put in irons." The next moment, and in presence of most of the crew, the form of Skaggerac was carried across the deck and taken down below, where the doctor attended him,
                  The news flew like wildfire about the ship. The sense of the outrage committed on the Laplander wakened a stern but silent wrath, all the more terrible and ominous, that they felt they had in some sort provoked it, and really deserved the worst that might happen.
                  Sailors are proverbially really superstitious. They were more so then than now, when the spread of knowledge has dissipated so much of this source of moral cowardice away, and they were filled with distrust and uneasiness.
                  That terrible disease of the imagination which results from ignorance and a "blind belief in divinities," that irrepressible longing which men feel at times, in spite of sense or reason, to read the future, and trace out on the maps of the natural or spiritual world, had created from the earliest ages a class who traded in the credulity of the public, until at last it became a recognized characteristic, and witchcraft flourished. Laplanders being held by seamen, on this score, in especial respect—a mixture of fear and dislike.
                  It existed in England, and was transplanted thence with the first American settlers, where it raged like a fearful epidemic; it existed among us perhaps in its lowest and most degraded form. The Thessalian Witch who by the potency of herbs or spells could make the moon start from her sphere, had something of poetry cast around her. With us the black cat and the broomstick are the agents—a ludicrous countenance, hairy moles, a tottering frame, toothless gums, and a habit of mumbling, such as is common to very old people, were the symbols and absolute signs of this unenviable art. Terrible as have been the results of this infatuation of belief on the one hand, and an absurd competition on the other to become renowned in the art, it has not to this day become obsolete. Skaggerac, the Lapland "Rat," was looked upon as one well versed in the power of the elements. The men believed implicitly in all this, and were accordingly irritated with themselves and the captain.
                  Now, the seamen had no objection to "larking," as they termed it, in their rough way with the Laplander, and occasionally punishing him, as we have seen them do, having as little an idea of his tortures through utter thoughtlessness, than if they had been pelting him with feathers; but they had an insuperable objection to his being abused and beaten by others, even by the captain. He was theirs—their toy, their butt, their plaything; and there was not one of his tormentors, perhaps, that would not have sacrificed his life for the "Rat" if such had been needed. But the news of Skaggerac having cursed the captain, the ship, and the crew, and by the mutterings of some potent spell, of having consigned them all to Davy Jones, provoked a dread, that for the remainder of the day none of them could divest themselves of.
                  Groups of them assembled together here and there to talk the matter over, and to alarm each other the more by stories of shipwreck and death in every ghastly shape.
                  Each one remembered one instance more horrible than the last, how ships had been doomed to storms for months and even for years—how some were even seen with phantom crews ploughing the seas—how others were still in those awful calms which Coleridge in his "Ancient Mariner" describes in such an appalling manner.
                  A spell in fact seemed to have fallen upon the ship already. Men remembered the glances, the mutterings of the tortured man, and these were attributed to his holding some diabolical dialogue, or his invocations to the evil spirits of the air. Old grizzled lion-hearts shook their heads, the younger men were cowed, and a general depression of spirits was felt fore and aft, which made the Laplander for that day a far more important and dreaded person than either Captain Crank, the Port-Admiral, or even Davy Jones.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  WE must for a while return to Ambrose Corbyn, whom we left stunned and bleeding, and who was carried in that state on board the tender, from whence he was to be transferred with other poor maltreated wretches as the naval authorities should see fit. When he awoke from his stupor, his bones and head aching with the brutality with which he had been treated, and his frame faint with exhaustion consequent upon loss of blood, he found himself stowed away in a stifling and poisonous hole, the only light that shed its ghastly glare upon himself and comrades in misfortune (all bound together, like the contents of a slaver's hold) was a feculent iron lamp, in which some coarse fat supplied a flaring wick with the materials of its combustion.
                  Ambrose stared confusedly about him for a time, and amid the grumbling, the curses, and the lamentations of the poor fellows herded together, he began to retrace the incidents of the previous night, and as he gradually traced circumstance after circumstance until he arrived at the conclusion, which to him was full of the greatest horror and woe, he murmured in his agony, "My poor wife! my children—my little ones! what will become of them now that they have lost me?"
                  Two or three ferocious-looking ruffians, armed with bludgeons and cutlasses, stood at the hatchways guarding them, and very often murmurs of supplication for water—for the heat of the horrible den was dreadful—were met with blows and savage oaths. Never were harmless or innocent men put from under the protection of the laws of the land with such a want of principle, with such pitiless and revolting shamelessness—never were they left to such brutal and unfeeling captors. The crew who did this horrid work were fitter for the hulks or gibbet; for it would have been scarcely possible to obtain the assistance of any conscientious and ordinarily disposed men in such an abhorrent piece of work. They did it, too, with a savage relish, as if by it they were rubbing off some debt of hatred which they owed to the world, that for crimes of their own had cast them away like offal, or the spawn of some detested reptile.
                  One can easily enter into the great dismay of the yeoman when he arrived at a full consciousness of his really appalling condition. To know that in the prime of life, with his bright hopes all budding about him, at peace with the world, surrounded by cordial neighbors, and loving the life he led in his peaceful home as one congenial to him in every way, moral and actual; to know, we say, that in this home he left a wife he adored, children that he doated on, who would weep and mourn, and, it may be, die of grief; or, failing that, would fall into poverty, become destitute, beggars on the highway or paupers on the parish, living on the dole given out by a scanty-handed and begrudging charity—the thought was madness, and the man thought he should suffocate under the awful weight of the feelings that then could have no utterance.
                  He knew by report some little of this nefarious system, which had increased to an alarming extent, but like a great number of people who do not think much of distress or sorrow of any kind till such sorrow comes home to them personally, he only looked upon it in the light of a severe calamity, and pitied very sincerely those affected by it, but which was not likely to affect him. He now found himself all at once, not simply in danger of being captured and torn from his home, but actually lodged beyond the possibility of help or escape, in the hold of a vessel of war, and knew that not many hours would elapse before his chance of being far away on the ocean might be more than probable.
                  "Oh! Emily, Emily!" he moaned; "well was your dread founded; and I now know, when it is too late, that heaven does not send us these presentiments of evil for nothing. Woe, woe to the hour that I left you! Woe to the light heart with which I laughed at your fears, my own bereaved darling! for I may never, never see you more; never kiss my pretty little ones again. Oh God! God!" he cried in his agony, "kill me at once, lest I go mad with this frightful thinking—"
                  "Now then!" cried one of the guards, with a horrid curse, "what's all this hullabaloo about? Stow it, and be cursed to you! you snivelling lubber, or I'll make the end of my stretcher feel your skull. I owe you one for last night, too, my man," added the ruffian, with a menace; and poor Ambrose, sick to the soul, held his peace.
                  But was there no hope? Was justice dead, and was equity a meaningless word? Were the commonest rights of men to be trampled under foot with a disregard to every principle, whatever be its nature? These were questions which the almost despairing man kept putting to himself—creating hopes, as it were, out of his very despair, and receiving continued replies in the disheartening negative, because from the very position in which he was at that moment placed, he could only draw the worst conclusions. These men would not have dared to act as they did if authority did not shelter them. They would not have continued their inhuman usage, if custom, and a sort of violent right, did not sanction it. Cold drops of sweat stood on his brow. His heart sunk within him. His lips trembled, and tears filled his eyes, and coursed down his cheeks. The strong, bold man was completely cowed. His throat grew parched with his anguished thirst, and careless of consequences, he faintly cried:
                  "Give me a cup of water for the love of heaven! I—I am—choking!"
                  "Choke and bed—d!" was the laconic and gruff reply.
                  "I am dying!" he said, still more feebly.
                  "Tell you what it is," said his guard, "we didn't go for to bring you on board a hospital full of luxuries. You had better haul in the slack of your jaw, or, sink me! if I don't give you a touch of this timber, that, choke or not, will keep you quiet. Who d'ye think's to be humbugged with a crazy, half-floundered, land-lubber like you?"
                  "Scoundrel!" cried Ambrose, roused to fury: "if I had you alone on the shore to deal with, I'd soon show you what a 'lubber' could do to a highway ruffian like yourself."
                  "Well, s'elp me!" cried the man. "but you do go it. Just take that!" and suiting the action to the word he struck Ambrose with such violence on the side of the head that he fell senseless. "There!" said the fellow, "for a bit we shall have peace."
                  "All hands on deck! Come, my lads, turn up your trumps there, and let's see them; a draft's wanted for the 'Royal George,' and some lucky lad will be walking the main-deck before eight bells." These were the words that, bellowed with the lungs of an ox, came rolling down from the deck just as the outrage we had related had been committed.
                  Orders, in fact, had been sent from the man-of-war to the Bull-dog, the "tender" spoken of, to the effect that whatever men they had been able to pick up should be sent on board by the boats without delay. The admiral was anxious to go to sea; and as there was a French fleet expected in the North Sea, it was necessary that the Royal George should head the squadron which was to meet it, and take or destroy it if possible.
                  It was the forenoon of the day after the flagellation had been inflicted upon the Laplander that the boats were sent and came alongside the Bulldog. The contrast between the two crews was striking enough. Great as was the dislike which the seamen felt against the service, there was a cheerful, jovial, daring about them, a "taut," seaman-like freedom which threw the dingy, gloomy-looking rascals of the "tender," who looked more like convicts than aught else, into the background. The difference of their occupation, too, did not make the man-of-war's men look with any degree of cordiality upon the crew of the tender.
                  In obedience to the summons issued, those who could walk were directed to go up the ladder: others were carried up, Ambrose, still insensible, among the number. The man who had struck him now slunk away, and mingling with the others, was, as he fancied, lost to notice; and even if any questions had been asked about Ambrose's condition, he was not in a state to reply.
                  The officer in charge of the boats had the men ranged upon the quarter-deck in order to make his selection. The scene was more painful than striking. Some sixteen or twenty men forced by the bare cutlasses of the Bulldog's to stand in line, gazed with longing, tearful eyes and wringing hands towards the shore, with that hopeless expression which to men who can really feel, has a power of arousing sensibility beyond words. The lieutenant did feel this. He saw the homeward look of these poor fellows, and he saw lying on the deck some dozen others, the blood clotted on their faces and dress, and senseless either from want of air and water, or from fresh outrage.
                  "For God's sake, sir," cried one, "let me go;" send me home; I have a poor old mother who will die if—"
                  But the lieutenant, with a cold, stern face, belying his heart, which bled within him, shook his head and passed on.
                  "Listen, sir! Oh, listen!" said another—a tall, strong son of the soil. "I have two motherless children at home, who will starve—die—Oh, God!" he cried, stamping his feet on the deck, "if I am taken, my children will die! do you hear?" he added with a wrathful change of tone
                  The lieutenant only shook his head and walked on. He had his abhorrent duty to do, and this he must fulfil at the hazard of life and reputation. The man at the moment too was handcuffed at a nod of the Bulldog's officer, who saw that he meant a desperate resistance, and it was perhaps a mercy, though not meant so
                  "Spare me! oh, spare me! for the love of heaven. Twenty-four hours' absence will be rain to my whole family," cried a tradesman from a neighboring town, who had been unfortunate to have business at Gosport the previous day. "I have to pay some money—it's in my breast here—for God's dear sake—" but the lieutenant, still like a stone—still with a swelling and throbbing heart passed on, marking out those who made their appeal to him.
                  The rest, seeing that all they could say was useless—that to implore was to make refusal still more certain—became now doggedly silent, and the selection went on, the whole being chosen, with one or two exceptions, who were ordered to stand aside. The rest were ordered into one of the boats, and were pulled away.
                  The officer next directed his attention to those who lay or sat on the deck, and inquired into the causes of their condition, which disgusted his conscientiousness; for he was certain that an unnecessary degree of force and violence must have been used.
                  "Oh," said the leader of the gang, "the rascals resisted authority, and fought like fiends. That fellow, there," pointing to the still half stupified Ambrose, whom the officer had not yet seen—"that fellow fought like a devil. A capital chap for a boarding party—"
                  "Good God!" cried the lieutenant "the man is dying! Here, here!—call the doctor, some of you—"
                  "Better give him a panakin of water, with a dash of mahogany in it—" began the petty officer of the tender.
                  "Do as I order you, sir," said the lieutenant sternly; and the doctor was sent for. and with the use of restoratives brought Ambrose partially too; and as he said that there were no bones broken, and no serious injury done—after waiting some time—the rest, with Ambrose, were lowered into the other boat which pulled away, and soon after, they were alongside of the magnificent ship-of-war.
                  A few minutes after, with the aid of a "whip" and chair for those who could not mount, they were all landed on the deck of the Royal George. It afforded no small amusement to the sailors, who had by this time forgotten poor Skaggerac, to see the great "lubberly fellows" hoisted up like so many fine ladies (in fact, there were some few visitors with the admiral's lady promenading the quarter-deck, proud of the homage paid to them, as ruling the rulers of the ocean) to the side, and so delicately handed in. But when they saw the pale and ghastly faces of the poor fellows, their sympathies were directly in their favor.
                  Captain Crank, in "full fig," had ordered the new comers to be put in line for his inspection. This was a grand treat to the captain; for not only could he parade before the ladies the kingly latitude of a naval commander, but he could also strike terror into the heart of some thirty strange, stout, large-limbed men, who could have but little idea of it till then.
                  So, when the men were placed before him, some staggering with faintness, but the weakest somewhat better with the welcome refreshment the kindly-hearted, but apparently unfeeling, lieutenant had ordered to be given them on board the tender, the captain, red and rosy, and inflated with his dignity, began to walk down the line which was drawn up on the quarterdeck.
                  It so happened also that Skaggerac was present; for, just before the ladies came on board, the Laplander had been ordered up to receive his dozen or two of lashes preparatory to a "regular-built" flogging which the captain had promised him; and as he was a generous individual, and generally (in that line) did more than he promised, there was not the slightest doubts in the minds of any but that the miserable Skaggerac would be cut up into ribands. He was on the deck, too, and saw all that went on, but apparently paid no heed to aught; for the captain, from a sublime motive of delicacy, had determined not to flog him that day, because of the presence of the ladies; and here we may add, by way of parenthesis, that we do not know half our obligation to the charming and almost omnipotent sex. Captain Crank, followed by his satellite, the boatswain, marched on with his hands behind his back.
                  The poor fellows were still more cowed by the ferocious look of the naval martinet. If they had reserved for themselves the slightest hope of appealing to a still higher authority than that which reigned in the "tender," they were now perfectly appalled at the stern, silent order, the armed men, the mute, statuesque marines, the formidable batteries on both sides, and the gleaming cutlasses of the seamen which surrounded them. With downcast heads, with eyes dim and blinded by tears of deep and profound sorrow, they heard the coarse, vulgar comment of the salt-water tyrant, who indicated here and there as he asked them questions, into what watch, or what particular duty they were to be put, and the captain's clerk, who also followed, book and pen in hand, entered their names on the irrevocable record.
                  The captain was growing facetious. One or two had, in spite of their fears, ventured to implore a release from this frightful slavery—from this terrifying state of things. They were met by a stern silence, a contemptuous stare, or a ferocious joke. He came finally to our poor friend Ambrose, who was recovered enough to see that if this opportunity was lost to him, his hopes were gone indeed.
                  How the man's heart beat as the portly individual who was the final arbiter of his fate, approached him. He had heard the requests made, and the rude refusals given. He dared scarcely venture to think that he might be more successful; but he also felt that he would be wanting in a direct duty if he omitted to seize any chance, or neglect any means by which he might return to his wife and children. How his heart grieved for them then! Captain Crank finally stopped before him.
                  "Soh!" said the captain, pausing, as he looked upon the form and thews of the farmer, "this is a well-timbered looking fellow, though he has been battered; I suppose he made a cursed obstinate resistance. What's your name, sir?"
                  "Ambrose Corbyn, sir," replied the yeoman.
                  "What are you," demanded the captain.
                  "I was a farmer yesterday," replied the dejected man.
                  "Hah!" roared the commander, "we're witty are we? No matter, salt-water will take that out of you, my fine fellow: no sea-water lawyers on board my ship, sink me!" and then followed a volley of oaths.
                  "Captain!" said Ambrose, desperately.
                  "I believe the rascal speaks to me," said the captain, starting back in the utmost astonishment.
                  "Captain!" cried Ambrose, impatiently, "have pity upon a poor and most unhappy man—pity me as you have the power; be a man and feel for me. I have been torn by ruffians from a home, from my poor wife, from my darling children."
                  "A wife, eh?—children, eh? Why, you luxurious rascal, the captain of a man-of-war can't afford such things."
                  "Oh, sir, be liberal in your act—be just—"
                  "Just! Oh very well, we'll think over your words presently" replied the captain, with such ferocious jocularity, that even the rough boatswain dreaded the results and winked violently at Ambrose (who heeded him not) to forbear speaking further to such little purpose. But Ambrose went on.
                  "Free me and I will bless you; listen to the prayers of a distracted man who has in so fearful a manner lost all he loved: free me, and my wife and little ones shall pray for you."
                  "Is your wife pretty?" asked the captain grinning.
                  "She is very fair," answered Ambrose, innocently, his hopes at the moment actually reviving, "and—"
                  "Fair, is she? egad, that's a blessing for her."
                  "She will break her heart if I return not," continued Ambrose.
                  "Break her heart, you spoon!" roared the captain, with a coarse laugh. "She'll have a dozen sweethearts before a week has been logged off, and I'll make one—"
                  He had better not have spoken. These insulting words were barely out of his mouth, ere with broken teeth and fractured jaw, the gigantic yeoman had sent him across the deck. The blow would have killed another man, but the thickness of the brute's skull, which clattered against a gun-carriage, saved his life, though it spoiled him for ever. It took three men, and they armed with cutlasses, to cut down and handcuff the infuriated man. He was dogged enough now. And though the ladies screamed, and the petty officers bustled about, the lieutenant smiled gravely, and the seamen grinned, and turned their quids with most evident relish. Ambrose was dragged below, and the rest tamely followed.
                  Skaggerac, who had witnessed all this with the most intense eagerness, understanding something of the nature of the scene, and judging from the pantomime of the farmer that he was imploring for something to be refused, as had been the case with him, no sooner saw the captain struck down, than he gave vent to a yell of triumph, of joy, of exultation so great, that it sounded through the ship, and he too, was hurried down.
                  Before the shadow of night fell over them, the mighty man-of-war was ploughing the boiling billows, her majestic bulk heaving on the crests of the rolling waves with a stateliness that men cannot conceive until it is witnessed. Her admiral, her officers, her men, her stores, were all on board, and she went bounding like a huge, living, but most magnificent mountain, her white sails gleaming under the moon, to join the fleet which she was to lead to battle when the expected foe was met. That night Ambrose slept in a torpor that did not permit him to hear the noises around, the rush of the bellowing waters, the boom of the wind, the rattling of spars, the groaning of the great masts, and their stays. It was not, however, long before he knew all these sounds well.
                  The bustle of making sail, the desire to get to sea, and to be as far away from the coast ere the night came on, had been sufficient employ for the seamen, and for the moment they had not time to speak of the strange peasant who had won their love by his daring "pluck." Not a man among them feared death in any shape; yet not one man among them all could have dared to do what the stranger had done. Seamen love courage beyond everything, and this was an act beyond anything they had ever seen.
                  When the watch was settled, however, and most of them descended below, they began to talk eagerly, but in subdued whispers, of the scene that had taken place on the quarter-deck.
                  "He'll be hanged," said one.
                  "It'll be a shame," said another: "a finer fellow never laid foot on rattlin; he'll be an A. B. before the cruize is over."
                  "He'll not live to see it! he'll be shot!"
                  "No, no; he'll be flogged, and—" But here they were interrupted, and in a manner most unpleasant to their feelings.
                  "What day is this, messmate?" asked the old sailor who had interposed on behalf of Skaggerac.
                  "Friday!" said one innocently.
                  There was a start of surprise—a cry almost of terror, that ran like wild-fire among them.
                  "The infernal Laplander has done it," they cried: "we're a doomed crew;" and there was but little sleep among them that night. Yet still on went this mighty ship-of-war over the great waste of waters, bearing such a freight of agony, sorrow, and a general dread among the boldest.
                  For Friday, be it remembered, was the sailors' evil-day.
               
               
                  CHAPTER IV.
                  FOR days, and weeks, and months the gallant man-of-war braved storm and battle on the ocean, and made the thunder of her cannon heard on the coast of other lands; and those who had been torn from their homes and families, with that adaptibility to circumstances which is so singular a part of human nature, began to reconcile themselves to a position over which they had no control, and to turn their hopes and longings homeward, when the prospects of being permitted to return was allowed them.
                  Some few, too, had derived additional consolation from the fact that they had been permitted to write to their wives, families, and friends, informing them of the condition under which they then existed. If any were fortunate enough to have influence in high places, such influence might go so far as to procure a remission of their compulsory servitude; and an order from the government-office, when it reached the captain, was attended with the instant release of party so interceded for. There were, however, so many difficulties in the way of this, that it was an exception in a solitary case here and there; for death, absence and the difficulty of being found with despatches,—involving, too, such a length of mite, when cruising on a foreign shore,—these militated against the 
                        halpless
                        helpless
                      wanderers on the waters, and the voyage once begun was perhaps not ended for years.
                  Still it was a consolation to write, to let those at home know the worst—for this is nothing to the agonies of suspense; and men felt their bosoms lightened to a great weight when this was done. Such a consolation was not allowed to poor Ambrose, who put in chains with his wild-looking companion, the Laplander, was not allowed any such luxury. He fell into a fit of ferocious, dogged stupor. It was not violent in its ebulition, and those who guarded him thought he was a moping fool, who was praying within himself for those he had lost, or perhaps filled with dread at the punishment he might, in all probability, have brought upon himself by his attack upon Captain Crank. This, however, was groundless, for more reasons than one: because the captain had grossly insulted and outraged the man in the presence of numerous witnesses; and because he was actually not his officer at the time; because, also, it might not have gone on so well with him in a "court-martial"—let it be as it might, by some means or other, the penalty of striking him was remitted. A terrible flogging, a long imprisonment below, varied with a hard and detestable drudgery on deck, and a series of petty tyrannies of the most exasperating kind, that made themselves felt daily, took place of the sentence of death, which possibly might have been recorded against him, and thus that passed over. But ever after, while under his command, Ambrose knew that he was governed by a human fiend, by a tyrant in every sense, brutal, merciless, and despotic. He could never forgive the man his disfigured jaw: and any one to have looked at the once gallant Crank, would not have wondered so much at his animosity. The life that the once sturdy, independent yeoman now led, was gradually trampled out of him—honor, self-respect, humanity, and all goodness; but he bore all unmurmuringly.
                  No! Ambrose had nothing to fear from his attack, if indeed he either heeded or dreaded any consequences. His soul was at his quiet home. His yearnings were with his wife and children—by the fire-side of the little farm at Havant. Upon deck some portion of the day, doing the work of a scavenger, and writhing inwardly under the disgrace hourly heaped upon his shoulders, brutally treated, though he now resisted naught, he felt a solemn calm stealing into his soul when below, because then he could brood over his home; and peaceful as all this was, it did not cool his blood—it did not allay his deadly wrath; it brought him no pity—such as he used to feel when a free, fearless man—when he trod with a bounding strength the soil he tilled cheerfully by the sweat of his brow.
                  Alas, no! That he was a mark of every petty, tyrannical officer on board who fawned upon the captain—and there were plenty—he soon found out. He had once thought of applying to the admiral. By breaking through the discipline of a ship—so much more valuable than a man's life or happiness—he might be flogged again, without being heard.
                  We need scarcely inform the reader that the greatest distress and agony was felt at home through his prolonged absence. The night was passed in a state of restless agony by the wife, who thought of her dream, but attached other consequences than that of the literal truth to it. That is to say, she imagined that he had met with friends, got tipsy, and on the road homeward been met by robbers, and so on. From this the active imagination formed other scenes for her still more dismal. The next day she waited until patience was exhausted, and her anguish knew no bounds. Placing her house in charge of the servants, she hastened to Portsmouth, inquired here and there till she ascertained that Ambrose had been with his friend Gerald at the tavern, already mentioned to the reader. She then had to travel some mile or two further to see Gerald, who was overwhelmed with surprise and fear at the news of his friend's absence. He had left him at the tavern; and she then, with Gerald, who was determined to accompany her, returned to the town, sought out the tavern, and learnt from the landlord, that soon after his guest had quitted his house, he had heard a scuffling in the streets, and made no doubt but that it was the "Press-gang"—those accursed and abhorred instruments of politic ministers, who keep their seats by carrying on a war of families—that had seized her husband, and that he was now on board the Royal George, already out at sea, and not likely to return soon.
                  She petitioned, and prayed, and sought for redress for this atrocious robbery of him who was her support and her family's, in vain. She knew the worst at last, but its effects were only beginning to be felt.—She had the patience of mind, energy, and a certain skill for conducting her business—and beyond the daily pain that consumed her, and was fast breaking her heart, she managed, with some tact, to carry on the business of her little farm. This could not last very long, for she had her children to look after; and when she should be at market, she was at home weeping useless—useless tears!
                  To return, however. Such a length of time had elapsed since the sailing of the Royal George, and so many things had occurred in the meantime, that the sailors began to forget the evil omen attendant on their having sailed on a "Friday." It was not until the presence of Skaggerac once more now and then, but rarely, about the deck, and oftener in the mess, going through the monotonous routine of his daily duties, that the seamen had time to think matters over. But no active conclusion could be come to—first, because Skaggerac could not or would not explain to them the mischief they believed he had worked upon them; secondly, when they had time to converse with him below, the poor Laplander, like Ambrose, was confined in the "bilboes."—This was to both a refreshment for their idle hours.
                  Proudly as the Royal George held her gallant height above the waves, she had many bad qualities. She was crank. She strained. She groaned in the storm like a giant in pain. There was from the first something injudicious in her build that did not improve with fighting, use or age. The mariners who had experience of the seas, and knew the sailing quality of floating craft, the thousand-and-one things that go to make a perfect ship, omitted to look at her faultiness of structure; and as an easy solution of their doubts still turned to Skagerac gerac and to the curse with which they believed he had paralyzed her from stem to stern.
                  "I don't know," an old "salt" would say, "what to make of her. A craft what's weathered a gale in the bight of the Garman Ocean as would have strained another on the Goodwins, is not a piece of broad oak to be hove over by the gibberings of a haythen, my lads; but mind you, after all, there's two sorts of luck, and there's a luck that you think no good when it brings bad after."
                  "Well, if she's done that," a younger would observe, "what's the use of getting into the doldrums about her sailing of a Friday? I suppose bad luck follows good luck, like Friday of following Thursday, one astarn of the other. It's nat'ral, can't both go abreast bo' where there's only steerage room and a little wash-water for one.—Sink me! if I care about the croaking—"
                  "Wait," said he, who on two occasions had roused them, we're neither at home nor landed yet." And then the same speechless terror would fall over their bold hearts as before.
                  It was because they could not see the danger that to a man of decision will give a hint as well as confidence.
                  During the time that Skaggerac and Ambrose had been prisoners below, a strange, yet fearful sort of acquaintance had sprung up between them. It generated itself from a profound sense of hatred, a boundless thirst for revenge; and the very air seemed to give form and tangibility to the thoughts of these two men, so "cabbined, cribbed, confined," that they could read each other thoroughly; and though at first they did not comprehend each other while they spoke, this soon gave way under the terrible thirst raging in their souls, till at last the Laplander was able to talk a few broken words of English, but his comprehension of what was said was so perfect that it outran his ability to reply altogether. This he supplied by a most expressive pantomime, which Ambrose soon knew.
                  To give the reader an opinion how these two men were beginning to comprehend each other through the instinct of their separate revenges, we must describe a scene that took place on deck one day, some time after the Royal George had started on her cruize. A few of the men on the main deck, having some idle moments perhaps to spare, were looking out for something which might afford them amusement, when, as the Laplander's unlucky stars would have it, he came in their midst, at the very moment when mischief was at its height.
                  "Hurrah! the rat! the rat!" cried one.
                  "Here's the son of a Lapland witch that sails before us in a sieve when a gale is brewing," shouted another.
                  "Who was it as made the admiral to sail on Friday," exclaimed a voice from among them. The speaker was unseen.
                  An ominous pause fell. The men's brows grew dark; a sense of personal vengeance pervaded them. Then the low murmur began, deepened, and grew more general. It was a medium for the pent-up fury of the seamen, whose superstitious notions, desirous of finding vent, and not being able to express themselves in a manner more rational, by one of those unaccountable paroxysms so incomprehensible to common sense, seized any method that they could, and in the person of the poor Skaggerac beheld the incarnation of their horror and their awe.
                  "The rat! the rat!" was the deepening, gathering murmur.
                  "Fling the wizard to the fishes!"
                  "Throw the Jonah to the waters!"
                  "The rat! the rat! he has sold us to Old Davy! but let's get him to sea in a sieve!"
                  "Let's tie him to a coop and try how he'll float!"
                  These exclamations, mingled with oaths frantic laughter, coarse and ribald jests, but of such a fierce and ferocious character as indicated that their fury was blind, and that a sort of frenzy had seized upon them so utterly as to destroy every vestige of collectedness; the bewildered Laplander, in the gripe of a gigantic seaman, staring first at one and then at the other, partly by intention and partly by his better knowledge of language, which we have stated he had picked up during his companionship with Ambrose, saw in the still more impressive pantomime and in the flashing eyes of the men, that he was even in a greater danger than before.
                  He attempted to speak. Either what he desired to say could not form itself into words, and only ended in his usual indistinct mutterings and guttural exclamations, or else the tumultuous torrent of sounds struggling in his bosom could not find expression. To the seamen, he seemed as before; to be cursing them, invoking spirits, or muttering to the winds, and, with a roar that rang up the hatchway, they cried, "Away with him!"
                  There was no mistaking the movement, and most likely had he hesitated, the first port-hole would have been the way by which his exit would have been made. With a desperate resolve and by a bold act, Skaggerac drew from his shaggy coat-belt his sailor's knife, gave a cut across the hand of the ferocious giant who still held him, but who let him go with most astonishing promptitude, and with a blow that would have felled a bullock (for despair gave him strength) struck down another that barred his way, and, with a piercing cry, bounded like a wild cat up the hatchway, and, gaining the deck, rushed towards the quarterdeck, where the captain and several officers stood, at whose orders the Laplander was instantly seized by the watch on deck and disarmed.
                  The scene was an eminently striking one. The Laplander, with the calmness of a deep and hopeless despair, seeing himself surrounded by soldiers, officers, and scowling seamen—seeing, also, his old and pitiless foe the captain, from whom he could expect no protection, standing before him, stretched out his hand, and, in a voice that rang like a warning and a vaticination through the whole of the mighty man-of-war, spoke some words in his own tongue, of which all felt the import, though none knew the sense, and then, with shaking his clenched hand at them, with a ferocious grin, ended with—
                  "A rat! hah! him eat 'troo—teeth sharp!—sharp!—him eat—and sink the craft—in—sight of—land!" A cry of rage arose from the seamen, the admiral was aroused in his cabin by it, and for a moment his appalled heart thought of mutiny. It was, however, only the Laplander who was being dragged below, and fastened in the bilboes once more beside Ambrose.
                  It required a combination of force and persuasion to sooth the irritated men. The admiral for the first time saw the evil he had committed (so far as the idea went) of having sailed on Friday. On inquiring into the nature of the uproar, he found out that the Laplander, who had once been their plaything, had become their aversion, and he found that from a most trivial circumstance had arisen a series of evils that promised to grow to an alarming magnitude, unless met in a proper spirit and checked with temper and discretion.
                  The hubbub ceased after the Laplander had been taken below, and as it was not intended that he should mingle any more with the crew, the admiral counted that when they ceased to see him they would forget him and the superstitious fears which he reminded them of.
                  In the meantime, foaming and furious, by the light of the dim candle which the parsimony of the purser permitted below, the unhappy wretch was chained alongside of his companion in misfortune, while the petty officer consulted with Captain Crank as to what should be ultimately done with him.
                  Captain Crank, with a volley of ferocious oaths, knew what he would do with him, had it not been for a hint given by the admiral that no punishment should be inflicted upon Skaggerac for what he could not help, and that it was desirable at the same time to keep him out of the way of the crew; so that he must have some duty found our for him below, where there was always something to be done.
                  "Take both the scoundrels," said Captain Crank, meaning Ambrose also, "they'll be company for each other: that's the only luxury we can afford them." And he laughed coarsely. "Here, carpenter! what have you to do below that you can put them to?"
                  "Your honor," replied the carpenter touching his hat, "my mates want help for several things; and there's Needles, the sail-maker, he'll want a hands turn done—"
                  "Give them both something to do in the cabletier, curse them!" growled the captain, "and let me hear no more of them. Work them—work them, sir, and then we shan't have the ship tumbling overboard with this cursed disorderly rabble as we had to-day." And so saying, Captain Crank turned upon his heel and said nothing further on the matter.
                  The petty officer put in charge of the two men, obedient to the letter, had them removed "deeper and deeper still" into the heart of the ship, and while she was ploughing the waters of the Atlantic in a gale of wind, they felt the pitching of the ship and heard her timbers groan, but the tempest was silent to them.
                  At night, therefore, the following dialogue, a more extended and confidential one than had ordinarily taken place between, them, and which was now becoming gradually systematic and organized, arose. In order to make it the plainer to our readers, we shall make no attempt at the Laplander's broken diction, but give it in our language.
                  "Skaggerac, my poor fellow," said Ambrose, in a voice of commiseration, "we are both bad enough off, stowed away in the hold of this doomed craft—for doomed I am sure she is—"
                  "Yes—yes," said Skaggerac, savagely; "doomed—doomed, for is there not a 'rat' on board? It will eat its way through."
                  "I see you are more unfortunate than myself; they have been ill-using you again."
                  "Yes," replied the Laplander, with a sigh, "unkind—unkind all of them. I would have loved them, served them, been their dog—they made me their rat, and sharpened my teeth. I will gnaw, gnaw, and eat them into the deep!" and he clenched his hand with an eager rage that startled Ambrose.
                  "What do you mean?" asked the yeoman, hastily, for the Laplander's anger had aroused his own with a reciprocal sympathy which made him feel his wrongs the deeper; and he, too, was beginning to feel a touch of that sentiment of vengeance which is so often the prelude to the act.
                  "You have been ill-used too," said the Laplander, in continuation.
                  "Ill-used!—aye, torn from my home, my wife, my children—all that is near and dear to me;" and here Ambrose, carried away by his own feelings, forgot all but the craving for some retribution which should wash out his own wrongs, no matter what way. "I have been wronged and injured, and I only hope to repay the injury done."
                  "You would like to be revenged?" asked the Laplander, eagerly bending forward, and speaking in a whisper, as if he feared that a louder tone would pierce the deck above and reach the cabins.
                  "Yes," cried the vindictive Ambrose, "I would. Can you tell me how?"
                  "Would you join me in it if I showed you?" asked Skaggerac.
                  "Yes," answered Ambrose, with fierce delight, "I would if my own life were sacrificed for it."
                  "Would it not be a brave revenge to cut out the bottom of the ship, and sink her, and them, and the brave flogging captain into the ocean?"
                  "My God! Skaggerac, what is that you say?" exclaimed Ambrose, who was startled by the wholesale nature of the retaliation expressed so powerfully by the semi-savage.
                  "The ship is doomed! her crew is doomed, and those who command, or will command her, are doomed also!" said the Laplander, in a tone of such conviction, as sent a cold chill into the blood and marrow of the farmer, who was not prepared for so vast a sacrifice to his wrongs.
                  "This is awful," said Ambrose, after a pause, and shrinking from the close and immediate approximation of such a wholesale execution. "There are hundreds on board who have never injured me—many who are like myself, kidnapped and stolen. I could not wish them evil, whatever I might do to those who commanded and countenanced the inhuman wrong in which I suffer with others."
                  "Bah! your heart is flesh—your blood water: mine is trampled into stone, but my blood is fire!" and the Laplander seemed to dilate with the merciless project which lent him an energy that he appeared to be a stranger to.
                  "You cannot mean what you say. Pooh!" added Ambrose to himself, as he thought of the absurdity of the idea that so helpless a creature could "eat" his way, as he expressed it, through such a mass of wood and iron as that which bore them within its hollow womb. "The poor fellow's ill-treatment has turned his brain; but, by heaven, if I could but strike one blow in revenge on those who have done me so foul and mortal a wrong, I would do it. But this is the mere ravings of a lunatic,"—and he fell into a brooding quietude, whilst the author after a pause, remarked;—
                  "My brother is silent. Will he help me in the mischief?" and he gazed keenly in the face of the other.
                  "I think," said Ambrose, soothingly: "that you are dreaming of a retribution beyond your reach. Besides, I should not like to involve all. I have only beer wronged by a few; why should I desire my revenge to reach the innocent?"
                  "All," said the Laplander, bitterly, "all have injured me, and beaten me, and used me as if I were a ferocious beast; and I would not have hurt a single creature!—They have made me like the fiends that live locked in northern ice, or that leap in the fires of Hecla! Oh! it will be great," he cried exultingly, "to hear them cry in their despair for help and human succor—as they have made me. I shall be then ready to join those from whom I have been torn, as my spirit flies over the clouds—and the ship—goes—down—down into the heart of the sea."
                  He went on, half-raving, half-reasoning, but on the whole, so incoherently, that Ambrose could gather nothing from what he said, but put him down as being light-headed, and in the impotence of a malicious wrath, babbling rather of what he would desire to do in his intense vindictiveness, than of what he could. Soon after he fell asleep. and when he awoke, missed Skaggerac from his side. He dozed again, and to his surprise, saw that he had returned, and was chuckling to himself with a sort of fiendish glee. So passed that and many other nights.
                  In the meantime the weeks sped on, and no change had taken place in the condition of the two prisoners. Captain Crank had, however, been superseded in his command, and another and far different man had taken his place. In fact, at the last station where she had stayed, Admiral Kempenfelt brought his flag on board, and Captain Waghorne had succeeded Crank, of whom we have nothing to relate but that returning one dark night in a boat from a shore-party, where he had got exceedingly intoxicated, he fell over the side and was drowned, without any one being particularly sorry for him.
                  The cruize was continued with varied adventure and success; but the Royal George met with such severe weather, and became so crippled in her sailing qualities from wounds and age, and her structure several times altered of late had not contributed to make her any better, that one day like wildfire the word ran among the crew that there was a lull in the war, and that she was to return home.
                  
                     Home! what a word for men who had been from it for so long.
                  It jarred upon the heart of Ambrose, but upon the Laplander (whom, to the surprise of his companion, he had missed nightly from his place,) it brought a glee that was like the rejoicing of a maniac.
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  THE Royal George was returning; but at this time she was in the broad Atlantic, and one evening as the sun sank redly, angrily into the sea, the sailing-master was heard to observe to the first lieutenant that there was mischief brewing to windward, and that the fresh gale would grow into a storm.
                  "Dirty weather, my lads, over the quarter, gathering way," said an old sailor on the forecastle. "There'll be a blow of wind to-night that will try every yarn and bit of canvas that we have—"
                  "In the sailmaker's room, too, old blowhard?" asked a young daring fellow, impudently.
                  The old tar scowled at the topman, and doubtless poisoned a few fish with the tobacco-juice he spat over the side as he said, "Hold on with your teeth and eyelids, my lad, when you're handing in sail. You may squint and aloft—look how those sheets are stained already. But up you go afore you can say 'luff.' There, what d'ye think of that?"
                  Just then the speaking-trumpet of the officer was heard ordering the men, aloft to "hand in" and make "snug;" and the men, leaping like panthers to the rigging, scampered up, and were soon spread out on the stretching yards, looking like so many pigmies handing in the enormous folds of canvass, till all the upper "duck" was closely furled. They then gathered into the top, waiting for further orders.
                  The long heavy swell of the sea indicated that it was agitated by some vast power in the far distance, and the north-eastern sky gradually became of an inky blackness, though every cloud in it, one shadowing the other, was seen with startling distinctness.
                  "I thinks as now the sea-sarpint is shaking the spray off his tail," observed a foremast-man, as an enormous sea pooped the vast ship and made her quiver in all her huge bulk. The officer had only time to cry "Hold on, all hands!" than it was passed: but some of the poor fellows had been swept away with it.
                  The masts were ordered to be struck as the wind were now heard sounding over the quarter with a deep gathering growl, that spoke of an increase in its volume.—Down came the topmasts, and down came the yard on every truck. They were then fastened still more strongly, and under her enormous courses the man-of-war went on ploughing the deep as if urged on by an animated instinct that warned her to escape from danger.
                  The western horizon had a sinister gleam about it all this time, that 
                        constrasted
                        contrasted
                      with startling effect against the black wall that stretched from the eastern horizon right up to the zenith. Its gloom was appalling, and the 
                        unatural
                        unnatural
                      character of the light that shone balefully beyond that and across to the western heaven seemed as if an awful conflagration of the elements casts its mephitic splendors far above the semi-arch of inky blackness.
                  The captain, surrounded by his officers, was on the quarter-deck, and animated by the sense of personal and general danger, but cool and collected, had given all the orders that seemed to be necessary, and the men from aloft, after having done all that seemed requisite, were called down, and their stations allotted to them. The guns were run in and fastened, the ports shut, the hatchways and openings on the deck were closed, and in silence they now waited for the full bursting of the hurricane. Two men were lashed to the helm, and others with the quarter-master at the "con" were in readiness, and now in the weather rigging stood the captain, with his speaking trumpet, scanning the lurid horizon with his keen observant eyes.
                  His warning cry came clear and shrill above the moan of the rushing storm.—Every man seized hold of something or other, many lashing 
                        themselvs
                        themselves
                      to the bulwarks and other places of shelter and strength. Like a mountain on the weather-quarter, the waters of the ocean began to rise. One vast sea in itself came after with the speed of a race-horse. The appalled seaman on scanning its white crest were compelled to look almost perpendicularly on the black, solid side of the oceanic mass. It roared and seethed on the stern, and like an avalanche that was going to press them down fathoms far away in the deep it broke over them. The thunder of the falling waters on the deck was awful: its weight was terrific. Boats were snapped from the davits. All the wood-work builded on the decks were either smashed into splinters or sent crashing through the lee-bulwarks. While the after-part of the ship was thus for a few moments submerged, her bows seemed to plunge into a yawning gulf leading into the eternal abysses to which she appeared doomed. For a time all was crashing, thundering, and reverberating in their ears. They were nearly suffocated with the huge torrent that fell around and upon them, floating everything moveable; and the horrors of their situation were, for a time, beyond comprehension.
                  It passed away. The ship righted, struggling and groaning, and the sight they beheld about the decks was one of wreck, ruin, and death. Many men were killed or drowned, and the debris of the destruction lay dangerously floating about. All this was cleared, the dead and all the wounded taken below in the momentary lull of the fierce hurricane, and again they waited in expectation that such another sea would be for them the last.
                  "I told you, my lads, how it would be," the sailor who had predicted the storm observed, cool even in the midst of the gathering harvest of death, and making his powerful voice sound with a sang-froid that always characterizes a thorough sailor in the midst of the greatest danger.
                  "Aye, aye; the 'Rats' brought us a cap full with a vengeance," said another, with some touch of a vengeful feeling in his tone. "I knew this would come through him and sailing out of port on a Friday! Homeward bound, eh! Fiddlers' green more likely!" and he laughed.
                  "Well for him that he's below, by all the thunders! said next the grim giant whose hand Skaggerac had cut.
                  "Belay all that, messmate," spoke out the first. "If we are booked for Davy Jones, d'ye see, it's best to be piped aloft with no malice in one's heart. You should have left him alone, and not have worried the poor critter as if he'd been a real rat and you a bulldog, as you are."
                  The rising anger of the giant was mollified by the last indirect expression which he converted, with easy grace, into a compliment.
                  Across the arid wastes of Africa the fell and deadly storm came, laden with horrible heats and blasts that felt as if they were breathed from Tartarean regions. It was an utter madness of the elements—sea and air, roused into fury, fought and struggled with each other, as if they were vast monsters thrown into an arena big as the basin of the sea! The roar of the storm was deafening, and even the peculiar tone of the captain's trumpet was not heard. It was only by the action of his hands, on which every eye was fixed, that he could be comprehended.
                  The admiral, who was a thorough seaman, as the Swedes generally are, stood beside the bulwarks of the quarter deck, near to the captain, who was above him, lashed in the rigging; and from time to time, as he watched the action of the storm, and the manner in which the ship was best adapted to meet one gust more violent than another, gave his orders accordingly, which the captain thundered as he best could to the men at the wheel. Crank and strained as the man-of-war was, she continued to answer her helm most admirably, and on this depends the safety of ship and crew.
                  The thunders then broke above, and the lightnings rent the sable pall of the east, giving glimpses of a blazing space, as tho' the elemental conflagration spoken of was actually to be seen raging over the African continent. It was a phenomenon of nature on a scale of such frightful and awful sublimity as is to be seen nowhere save on the ocean, and that, too, at intervals only; for a storm or a tempest, which may or may not be one and the same thing, is, as compared to a hurricane or a typhoon, things to be seen only in the tropic seas, though they do occasionally visit more northern latitudes, like a fit of anger in a man in contrast to his wrath. Night had set in, and the fury of the elements knew no cessation, yet, black as the skies were on the one side, the unnatural light of the other flung an ominous glitter on its swelling clouds, which actually seemed to clang together as though they were formed of massive sheets of brass.
                  The carpenter had been ordered to sound the well, and, with some difficulty and danger, he did so. The eyes of the officers and men followed him, and their cheeks, stout hearted as they were, bleached when hey beheld the man, with an ashy face, go aft to the captain.
                  She was leaking fearfully, and two minutes afterwards the pumps were ordered to be rigged and manned. In addition, therefore, to the horrors of one of the most violent and appalling tempests that men ever encountered, there was a more insidious and deadly danger to be encountered. It was at the peril of being washed away from the brakes that the men managed to lash themselves together, and to the pumps and mainmast of the ship, and the proofs that the imminence of their utter dissolution was proved, that gang after gang, faint and exhausted, were required to check the rising of the waters in the hold. Nothing but incessant labor could save them from going bodily down into the ocean, and still the terrible raging storm howled in the canopy, tore the seas up into mighty mountain billows about them, and the very "crack of doom" itself seemed to be ushered in by portents more dire than the most experienced seamen on board the Royal George had ever witnessed. "Deep spoke into deep" in verity, and thunders beneath seemed to answer the rocking and ceaseless peals in the skies above, while every now and then, with a blinding glare that made men shrink in pain and with shuddering, the black vault was torn asunder to discharge its sulphuric battery, which closed again as murkily as ever.
                  "The leak gains upon us!" said the carpenter, sounding again, and returning to the captain.
                  At this moment there came another of those awful mountains of ocean waters, rising upward like the crests of living monsters, and then thundering down, swallowing them all up in their horrid jaws; and the warning cry of the captain came too late for many. Those at the pumps suffered most, for some were killed and others badly wounded, and again a clearance of wrecked matter, human bodies, and broken timbers were to be cast overboard into the insatiate sea, that seethed with a growling manner as it rushed past the sides, devouring in sullen satisfaction the prey which had been flung to it, as if for a brief space its ravenous hunger was abated.
                  "The leak gains on us!" said the carpenter to the captain, when he could speak.
                  "No word to the men, sir," replied the other, quick and short; "man the pumps again with fresh gangs, and serve out some grog as you best can," he added to the purser and gun-room steward, and again the men bent with a desperate energy to their task, stimulated by the liberal allowance of spirit given to them.
                  "It will blow its heart out in another hour," said the sailing-master, "if the craft would only—"
                  "The craft would bear it double-strong, master," said the captain hastily, and in a voice of reproof lest what the master said should have been heard by any of the men, and thus, by lessening their hope, drive them to a recklessness and despair, which would at that hour have been fatally decisive.
                  "Just what I say, your honor!" observed the master, touching his hat, etiquette not being even then forgotten, "I think, your honor, that by letting her go a bit from the wind, some of the strain might be taken off—"
                  The captain thought so too, and the ship, obedient to her helm, went on with a velocity in which there was actual safety but for the leak. It was by this time checked, but no serious diminution was felt—only it did not increase.
                  In the meantime, deep in the heart of the noble ship, what was Skaggerac doing.—The reader, who will remember that the naturally kind feeling of the half civilized creature having been so outraged in every form and way by the continued brutality that was on all sides so liberally dealt out to him, had become filled from the crown to the toe "top-full of direst cruelty."—Taking the soubriquet bestowed upon him as a suggestion, the terrible design of sinking the vessel and destroying every one on board, along with himself, had actually come to a most menacing maturity in his mind.
                  Ambrose, down below as usual, long a stranger to day-light, and almost spirit-broke at his weary imprisonment, and deprivation of fresh air, though sunk into a stupor of apathy that began at last to dull the senses, and change him from a thinking man into a brute, still could not be insensible to the dreadful pitching of the ship and the groaning of her strained timbers, and the almost mad fierceness of her motion as she ascended and descended.
                  As usual, he missed the Laplander from his side, but having become used to that, without now giving himself the trouble of thinking where he could have got to, or by what means it was he eluded the vigilance of those who ought to have watched them and did not, his thoughts gradually turned homeward, and in spite of the frightful thundering above his head, he was gradually losing himself in visions of home, when he heard a strange chuckling laugh behind. Turning his head he beheld Skaggerac.
                  The Laplander approached with an exultation so fierce and ferocious in his extraordinary face, that Ambrose felt certain that some portion of a sinister design, long cogitated, had been completed. In fact he already heard the rattling of the pumps and the rush of the pistons, as the strength of half a hundred men directed the mighty brakes, and he was about to ask him the meaning of his peculiar glance, and the sounds he heard, when the Laplander spoke.
                  "It is done. The rat has eaten through at last. You hear the cries—you hear the waters bubbling into the hold—"
                  A seaman rushing suddenly down interrupted Skaggerac. "All idlers on deck!" cried the voice; "all hands to the pumps! Come, my lads, bear-a-hand!" and striking the rings off the yeoman's legs, set him free, and more by instinct than aught else, he mounted up as well as he could.
                  Skaggerac, however, had disappeared again. Ambrose having given a look or two for him, forgot him for the time, as the awful sublimity of the scene on the decks to which he crawled, and along which he staggered, struck upon the eye.
                  For the first time in his life he beheld a storm on the ocean, and such a storm! He saw that there was danger such as made the blood thicken in his veins, and he saw the stupendous effect produced by the rage of aroused elements on a scale that made his stout heart quail with mortal terror.
                  The thunders still roared in the canopy, and the lightning flung such a mass of livid glare on the boiling ocean, that though an intense darkness reigned above, there was 
                        siill
                        still
                      light shining over the sea and about the ship; but to anticipate the total darkness that would follow the battle, lanterns had been lighted, and on these, so long as any broken timbers did not injure them, they could safely count.
                  The incessant labor required at the pumps convinced Ambrose that either accident had farthered the Laplander's desperate purpose, or that he had really succeeded in his design, and the man shrank with an indefinite terror from the thought that he was in some way connected with him in producing the wholesale destruction of life that every moment menaced them.—The idea that at any moment the vast fabric, a master-piece of skill and constructive art, could be carried, with its living contents, down the fathomless gulfs that greedily opened before her, struck him with a mute terror, and he thought once or twice that he owed it as a duty to humanity, to inform the officers of all he knew.
                  But for this he was not allowed the time. Having been at once ordered to work at the pumps, he said to himself, "of what use is it to tell them?" They may not believe me it may be too late;" and so, hour after hour, he labored with the others until, so weakened and exhausted by the frightful labor, they sank upon the decks, and others supplied their places.
                  In about three hours the violence of the hurricane abated, but the leak still demanded continual attention, and one danger only gave place to another. Even the captain began to grow hopeless, but there was no other means of safety at hand, and still the pumps were manned and worked.
                  Had any one followed Skaggerac, however, in his peregrination about the lower part of the ship, he would at once have been made aware of the plan and design with which the desperate and despairing Laplander had in a manner leagued with the elements for the destruction of all on board the ship. He had got, by a way of his own which nobody knew of, the darkling paths being behind bulk-heads, stores, casks, and other huger masses that were stowed away into the hold of the man-of-war, down to her lowest depths, and there secure from all chances of interruption, by means of a "dip" which he had plundered from some place or other, he was busied with an energy and perseverance that spoke everything for his determination, engaged at his fearful work.
                  With a large augur, Skaggerac had actually bored a number of holes through the solid timbers of the man-of-war! These he stopped up again with large plugs which he could take out in a very short time. So that, having made as many holes as he could or deemed it necessary, it required only to take out the stoppages and hasten away, the water not rushing in with sufficient force and quantity to submerge him at the moment, though of course, he had made no provision for his own safety, dooming himself, also with others; and now while the men were on deck pumping for life and death, he was silently and insidiously counteracting all their efforts.
                  It would be impossible to express the savage glee with which this poor creature pursued his task. For some reason or other. after Ambrose had been sent up on deck, the Laplander discontinued his exertions, and refixed several of the plugs he had taken out; and while the storm was dying away, and the leakage was sensibly diminishing under the exertions of the sailors, after a long night of agony and peril, the morning broke gray in the distance, and by about noon they were enabled so far to make for port, that the same afternoon the Royal George rounded the Isle of Wright, and for the present the hearts of the seamen were cheered with thoughts of home and safety, so that they no longer believed that either they or the ship were doomed this cruise; and they laughed at the idea which had made them dread the terrible Friday they had sailed away upon.
                  The Royal George was at anchor at Spithead, and Skaggerac so far recovered his confidence without giving up any one portion of his design, that he was seen about the lower decks as usual, though he kept from mingling among the crew, a thing that caused no surprise, seeing that he had so much reason to avoid them for the many persecutions he had endured at their hands. The men were very willing to have been on good terms with him, being in such good humor themselves; but to their overtures he only turned a deaf and inattentive ear, and there was so much yet of actual duty and work to do, that his morosity ceased to be heeded.
                  The ship was now filled with carpenters and laborers from the dock-yards, and many of the seamen, a few hours after, having given what assistance was necessary, received leave to go on shore, while others again who had been pressed, Ambrose among the number, had here an opportunity afforded them of laying their cases before an admiral who listened with a patient humanity to their sad histories, and many were permitted to go free, Ambrose himself included.
                  The joy of those who thus escaped the detestable slavery of their condition, was, as may be imagined, almost boundless; for many a long and weary day had they been far from home, far from the sound of the loved and loving voices, far from those that were so near and dear to them, and having obtained some little pay which was given to them, not an hour was lost by each in seeking with some misgiving the homes they had at one time never hoped to behold.
                  Ambrose, too, set out on his homeward journey. A vague thrill of fear would come over his heart every now and then, and on the road he stopped more than once to wipe away the cold drops that beaded his forehead, and then stoutly set forth again. He met none who could give any reply to his inquiries, losing himself in conjecture, were they all alive? were they at the farm? or, were they a broken and wandering family, begging bread from door to door? These were bitter questions to ask oneself, and to receive no answer to them.
                  Ambrose Corbyn's little farm, which from a home of happiness and comfort had been changed into a house of mourning; for poverty had ushered in death, and within the next twenty-four hours there would have been no longer any human creature within the walls—the old familiar voices would then have been for ever mute, and the silence of desolation have reigned with a stern solemnity around all.
                  It was past noon, and groups were gathered in the chief room of the house, which now wore so sordid and penurious an aspect as spoke but too plainly for the wretchedness that had come and taken up its abode there. The plain homely furniture, that had once looked as if it grew to the very place, was gone. The little ornaments of the walls and mantel-shelf, which speak so much for the taste and comfort of the inmates, were gone. The walls were bare, and the dying embers of a fire by which a boy was crouching for warmth, made the picture sad enough, but this did not complete its sad aspect.
                  A little coffin, covered with a pall, lay on a table in the centre. A thin, haggard woman, almost blinded by tears, was still weeping and wringing her hands, and mourning for her dead child, and, like Rachael, refusing to be comforted because "it was not."
                  "Ah, well-a-day?" exclaimed an aged neighbor piteously, "this is only one case out of many when the man has been torn away from his home and family by these horrid wars. And what will become of the poor mother and her little ones to-morrow the Lord only knows."
                  "There's the workhouse," growled an old man: "it's all that's left for the poor now, when they can't do anything else—"
                  "And to think that they were so comfortable and happy once. It's enough to break one's heart to think of it." Such exclamations as these, which had little comfort in them, fell upon the bereaved woman's ear; but she seemed too stupefied with her grief to heed them."
                  "They do say," observed another, "that some of the ships of war have returned—that the Royal George is at Spithead."
                  "Yes," interrupted a neighbor, "but don't forget, Goody, that ships of war never bring back all that they take away—"
                  "Ah!" sighed a fourth, "there'll be many a poor mother weeping, and many a wife widowed, many a child left an orphan by the news you now tell—"
                  "Poor soul! poor soul!" murmured another. "One's gone, others will follow.—When children die for want of food, neighbors, it's something that makes one's manhood cowardly like—"
                  "What's that?" suddenly cried some one at the doorway.
                  A loud shout was heard from without.—It was repeated—it increased. It was like a cry of exultation—it had about it a sound of joyous welcome, and the groups suspended their converse in order to learn its cause.
                  "It's Ambrose I—it's Ambrose come home!"
                  The next moment a man in a seaman's dress rushed into the room, but for a moment seemed stunned at the sight which met his gaze.
                  The wife gave a shriek—with a convulsive start she uttered the name of "Ambrose!—my husband!" and fell senseless in his arms.
                  For all that, joy was mingled with mourning in the humble home of the farmer that night.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  LEAVING Ambrose now to recover from the loss that his absence had caused him to sustain both in his family and in his property, and to gird himself up afresh for the struggle that lay before him, but which (when he remembered that his return at all was at one time a probability so remote that he had ceased to entertain it) was to him now a motive to redouble his toil, a fresh incentive to look every difficulty manfully in the face. Leaving him, with the weeping mother, yet joyous wife, to her task of collecting the scattered wreck of their comforts about them once more, let us return to the ship of war, and see how far Skaggerac's prediction came true.
                  The following paragraph, extracted from an account of the loss of the noble ship, will introduce the reader to the catastrophe which was to strike such horror and consternation in the minds of the public, as being, under the circumstance, an event unparalleled in the history of the world:—
                  "The Royal George had just returned from a cruise in which she had more water than usual; and as it did not decrease after she came into harbor, an order was issued on Saturday. August 14, 1782, for her to go into dock; but after a strict survey by the carpenter and others, they found that the leak was not more than two feet below the water mark, and supposing it to have been occasioned by the rubbing off of the copper sheathing, it was resolved, in order to save time. to lay her down at Spithead, by what is called a parliament heel."
                  In consequence of this, the splendid ship was a scene of busy animation, and the sounding of the various implements of artizan industry, as they fell upon iron or wood, and gave them form and stability, filled the air with a kind of pleasing music, as they came over the still waters of the bay.
                  It was high noon, and most of the men were at dinner. There were at this period nearly twelve hundred persons on board, out of which nearly two hundred and fifty were woman, many of whom had with them their children: for an indulgence had been extended to the seamen on account of their late exertions and their being likely to leave port at a very short notice: in fact, while all hands on board and in the dockyard were working night and day, a few hours after her repairs would be completed, she would set sail. This, therefore, accounts for the great number of families that were on board at the time of the catastrophe.
                  She was at this time held by the anchors from the head, swinging with a gentle current, and heaving sluggishly on the waters, that were rippled by a soft breeze from the north-west. This point of the compas is, however, an uncertain one; for it is just the breeze that is known to come in fitful and sudden gusts, like a strong puff, and which even landsmen have sufficient experience of to know. But this breeze and these puffs, so unfrequent as they were, had little effect on the huge bulk of the floating armament, save that the latter, at an 
                        inoppostune
                        inopportune
                      moment, aided the catastrophe.
                  There was many a happy group at this time gathered together here and there, enjoying the relaxation of the hour, and giving loose to the emotions of their hearts, as sweethearts, wives, and families became the subject of thought for discourse. Grim and grizzled seamen, with little innocent children, prattling and playing around their knees, seemed for the moment to have become children too, as they entered into the spirit of their infantine sports: and while the full peel of musical laughter rang about the decks, mingled with the soft cadence of women's voices, the tones of the gruff tars became insensibly changed, and lungs that could make themselves heard in the roar of a tempest were now attuned to a human melody that was almost wondrous in its general effect.
                  Nothing could be more picturesque, more pleasing than the groups, taken as a whole. Some lay between the guns, half dozing.—Others were squatted about the forecastle, or under the shadow of the hammock cloths, while others lay on the folded canvas of the booms. The cook's assistants were carrying the food prepared for the men to the different messes, as required, and not a soul knew or dreamed of the 
                        insiduous
                        insidious
                      influence that even at that very moment of peace and security, was busily at work.
                  We must therefore turn our attention to Skaggerac, the Laplander, who was deep in the interior of the ship working with might and main at the accomplishment of his tremendous vengeance.
                  On the day that Ambrose was to leave the Royal George, he happened to be below, and was just advancing to the companionway, for the purpose of ascending the deck, when glancing towards the dark and dreary spot which had, under the "cordiality" of Captain Crank, been the locality of his imprisonment, he saw Skaggerac, the Laplander sitting with his head between his hands, and evidently in a state of great depression.
                  Feeling towards the spirit-broken creature a sentiment of kindness, heightened by the sense that he was now free, and had nothing more to fear from the tyranny of his former masters, and contrasting his own future, now beginning to look bright and, hopeful once more, despite his own doubts and fears, with that of the Laplander's; knowing there was no sunshine likely to dawn ever on his future, seeing the perpetuated slavery to which he was doomed, and that the same continued course of ill-treatment was all he could expect, he stopped and spoke to him.
                  "Skaggerac," said he, and the uncouth face was lifted up. The melancholy expression of the poor creature's face, and the tears that dimmed his eyes, touched the yeoman to the heart.
                  "I am going away, Skaggerac," said he, "and I want to say "good-bye' to you;" and he held out his hand.
                  The Laplander took it, pressed it, and put it to his lips. Ambrose felt the hot tears falling upon it.
                  "Ah!" he muttered, "if they had all been as kind as you."
                  "Come, come, Skaggerac," said Ambrose, trying to speak cheerfully, "do not be so depressed. This time the crew will have seen how ill they have treated you, and since it was not done in malice, they will be kinder to you. I have heard many of the men say they were sorry for what had occurred."
                  Skaggerac shook his head dejectedly. It was as much as to say that already that had been done which was past recall.
                  "Ah!" continued Ambrose, "on your return from you next cruise you will say so."
                  "Return!—next cruise!" echoed Skaggerac, gloomily.
                  "Yes, to be sure," 
                        aswered
                        answered
                      the other; "and then you must manage to come and see me in my little home, and my wife and children will kindly receive you—"
                  "You are going then?" asked Skaggerac, in a partly absent manner, as if his own thoughts were elsewhere, but also as if in part these thoughts were created by the words of the speaker. Perhaps that poor, lost, and friendless waif, thrown hither and thither on the great sea of humanity, was also thinking of a home he might have known once—a home of love and of beauty, though it might be fixed in the wild and sterile wastes of an inhospitable clime; for it is not furniture nor fine skies that create "home," but a union of hearts knitted to each other, a sense of kindred, that creates love and affection, which kindles up the genial flame, though under the chilly heavens of an Arctic region.
                  "You are going, then, to those that love you?" said Skaggarac,
                  "Yes, and though I leave you behind, my poor friend, I would also leave you one little kindly sentiment which may make you imagine that when tempests blow, some one is offering up a prayer for you—"
                  "It is kind and good of you," said the Laplander, grasping his hand. "Pray, then, for me now, as you go homeward—pray for all."
                  "What mean you?" demanded Ambrose, struck with the solemnity of his tone, and a suspicion flashing across his mind, that either the intellect of Skaggerac had become disordered, or that there was that vague danger he only guessed at without proof. Nor must we omit to state that the vessel having arrived safely, Ambrose forgot all he had dreaded.
                  "You mean," said Ambrose,
                  "I shall never go the ocean more," answered the Laplander sorrowfully, "I mean that she is doomed—crew and ship—crew and ship. The 'rat' has eaten his way through. When he goes, they follow!"
                  "In God's name, what is the mystery?" cried Ambrose in agitation: "but," he added as a thought struck him, "since they are going to examine and repair the ship at once before she goes to sea again, they will see whatever danger there is, and none the sooner for my telling them." Turning to Skaggerac, he added, "This is folly after all. I have heard the seamen say, that because you had been ill-used, and had muttered that which they called a 'spell,' and invoked the spirits of the storm, that they were doomed men. They now laugh at it—"
                  Skaggerac laughed too. But it was a low menacing laugh, "Well," said he carelessly, as though he feared that he might say too much, "if they laugh they have a reason."
                  "Then they said, that because she had sailed out of port on Friday, that she was a lost ship, and yet you see she is not lost—"
                  "No," muttered Skaggerac, apart, "neither is she got into port, and, so they have no reason to laugh yet."
                  "Neither can the crew—at least all of them, be doomed," said Ambrose; "for you see that I am going—"
                  "Go, and go quickly," said Skaggarac hastily, but Ambrose did not hear him; for, grasping his hand, the eager man, with an earnest, "God bless you," bounded up the companion, and leaving the Laplander with his meditation, arrived in due time at his half-wrecked home, as we have related. To return, however—
                  Deep in the heart of the vast ship was Skaggerac with his fatal instruments, the augur and the axe; and while in the almost awful solitude of the profound abyss, the darkness rendered visible by the gleam of the faint light which he had, he looked like some creature of a more portentous and appalling existence. With an energy and a perseverance that savored of insanity, he was engaged in drawing and knocking out the plugs on one side.
                  In the dead silence that reigned around him, broken only by the sounds caused by his exertions, the ominous rush of waters, bubbling, rippling, rushing in, and gathering in volume and, quantity, might have been heard, now growing alarmingly distinct.
                  "Ah!" he muttered, flinging down his axe and augur, as the spouting jets told him that he need do no more. "It is all ready now, and the doom of the fatal Friday will be accomplished; the 'rat,' that was despised and ill-treated, will now be revenged upon them; and there will be wailing and weeping in plenty, for all the bitter tears they have made me shed, which churned my blood into a tide of poison that I could have distilled upon the whole race! Ah!" he added, ferociously clenching his hand and shaking it aloft, "dance on, merry, bubbling waters!—down! and plash, and pour in like snakes, as you seem! Rush in, waters of the hungry sea, that will soon satiate the maw of ruin with such a prey as is rarely flung to it?"
                  He paused and while the waters were still pouring in with a slow, steady, and half-murmuring noise, which was gradually dying away into a silence still more dangerous, the Laplander, folding his arms (like one that had made up his mind to meet his worst fate, and prepared for it in any shape) sat down at the foot of the mast, and in a sullen stupor contemplated the fate that was now gradually and rapidly surrounding so many hundreds of his fellow-creatures.
                  In furtherance of the plan which had been decided upon for the repairing of the man-of-war, she had been careened, or hove over, in such a manner that the caulkers and carpenters could get towards the keel, but they were still some feet from the place that Skaggerac had eaten his way through—as he in his powerful and expressive phrase termed it. In order to assist them in thus heaving the vessel over, the guns from the one side had been removed to the opposite in order to increase the weight—a measure which, in almost any case was highly injudicious, as the result proved, for the lower-deck guns being heaviest, so much increased the preponderating weight that no exertions used could have been sufficient to counteract it.
                  Haste also, and a sense of security had rendered the captain and officers blind to the necessity of closing the deck ports, though it is scarcely necessary to enumerate the causes of the awful accident, since whatever precaution might have been taken, none could have been effective against the machinations of the outraged and revengeful Laplander.
                  The admiral was in his cabin writing some despatches and instructions previous to going to sea; Captain Waghorne was on the deck, and this was the reason that his life was saved. While the dinner of the seamen was going on, and now drawing to a termination, the caulkers were at work, and the sound of their mallets filled the air. From the middle decks, too, there came the blithe tone of a fiddle, playing up with much spirit, as some stirring hornipipe, and the din of the dancers' heels mingled with laughter and encouraging cries, indicated that one group were advancing into a state enjoyment somewhat more uproarious than was general. Still this, under the circumstances, was a thing so usual, that it called forth for no expression of surprise or censure.
                  A number of seamen were gathered together in the forecastle. Some were smoking pipes, others darning their canvass ducks. Most, however, were idly chatting together.
                  "Well, messmates," said an active saucy topsman, who was clasping his sweetheart round the waist, "what do you think now about sailing on a Friday out of port, eh?"
                  "Why, just as much as I does about a bagfull of wind bought from Skaggerac's grandam for a Flemish penny," said another in reply. "It's all a yarn, with just as much gumption in it as one of Bill Twister's facks, as he calls 'em, which means, d'ye see, that they're 'thundering—'"
                  "Hold hard and belay there!" observed an old sailor, with his finger held up warningly; "don't out so fast, ho? What tho'f it happen that the old barky is safe this spell, though she did sail on Friday; there's too many of our messmates lost the number of their mess in the last gale to let the whole go for a mere yarn—"
                  "Well, there's something in that," admitted the first speaker, "and that's gospel; but, d'ye see, in a gale of wind, and 'specially such a vindacious one as we had a spell of a few nights ago, when the wind seemed to have got hold of the craft with its teeth, and was running after it like a dog bolting off with a bone—why (here the speaker paused), why, I should say that there was something in it."
                  "Humph!" grumbled an old "salt," "whosoever goes for to say as how there wa'n't something in it, and something precious strong too, why he'd be no better than a misbelieving nigger! I supposes, 'cause as how there was something more than rum and hot water in the hold we was kept at the pumps; but, d'ye see, I don't go for to say as how Skaggerac had a hand in raising the storm."
                  "The old barky never was in such a gale before," said another with a more mysterious solemnity of tone, "and she never sailed out of port on a Friday before.—What then? Put the case, jine one thing to the t'other, and then you you'll see in the twinkling of a handspike, as one's the effect of the cause, as the chaplain has it."
                  "Well, for my part," observed a boarder, "I only wish this business of being hove over was finished. Without going to the sides, one could see—phew! down straight as a 'dipsey' (deep sea) lead line, and there's every gun on the starboard 
                        side side
                        side
                      cast loose, so that if they want bowsing out in a hurry it would take more time than if the craft was cleared for action. I wishes the women and the young'uns was all safe ashore."
                  "Zounds!" shouted a neighbor, suddenly reeling, "what's the matter with the ship? She heels over like Jack Haulbowline's long-shore castor, that he bought from the Wandering Jew of the Point, and then sat down on before wearing, to make its stowage-room and well-sides more compact—"
                  "Och!—by the elevens!" shouted an Irish 'waister,' "but it's my opinion, honey, that the ships tumbling overboard, and that the deck wants to go below, by the fore-hatchway. Holy St. Kevin! it's a groanin' she is like a crathur wid the colic—"
                  "Hark!" and at this exclamation every man on the deck stood suddenly up, each with blanched faces and livid lips, and eyes in which the gleam of a mortal terror stood. Every limb was rigid with horror, and the sweat of an unspeakable awe stood upon every brow. Each man was a sight that actually might quell his next neighbor.
                  For a sound came out of the deep that froze the blood at their beating hearts, a sound of human voices, uttering in concord one tremendous cry of horror, such as human ears have rarely or ever heard. The united shriek of nearly a thousand people had an effect on those who were on the upper decks that deprived them of all capability for the moment to do aught.
                  The cry came from the lower decks. It rang out from the port-holes. It echoed from the cabins. It increased in its thrilling and appalling intensity with a crescendo so frightful that the very shore seemed to echo back the wild cry, and men on the "hard" that heard it stood as if spellbound, and never forgot to their dying day.
                  With that universal cry there blended a voice of almost unnatural strength and distinctness. It seemed to pierce every deck of the ship. It vibrated with such strength and 
                        elearness
                        clearness
                      that the stout men when the first shock of the panic had passed like an electric shock through them, felt a deeper thrill of fear if possible than had just seized them.
                  "That's the voice of Skaggerac," murmured one, trembling; "and we have never been in port since we sailed on that fatal Friday."
                  There was at the same time a rush of human beings on the upper deck, till the hatchways were choked up, and the scene became one of unutterable horror. Men trampled upon 
                        ehch
                        each
                      other in their haste to escape: and amid oaths, and cries of rage and terror, the sense of self preservation appeared to have obliterated every trace of humanity in them. It was not now a question of the one assisting the other. Every moment threatened them with being engulphed gulphed in the yawning abyss. Suddenly from amid the living torrent one bounded madly forth.
                  It was Skaggerac, who, dripping with water, and with his face covered with the blood flowing from a wound in his head, which he had received in the horrible melee. The men with some instinct fell back from him now, even in stark, wildering awe, and left him intact, as though he had been a supernatural agent.
                  "The rat! the rat!" he screamed, "has eaten through at last!" and with a yell of laughter that pealed like that of a mocking and exulting fiend, he rushed to the side and precipitated himself into the sea that was raging at her side, as if the waters were boiling in some vast cauldron.
                  He had not been seen, however, by any one of the survivors, and though some contradictory stories were afloat of the Laplander's disappearance, none but Ambrose, when he heard the story of Skaggerac's death, and the fate of the gallant ship ever conjectured the truth.
                  All these things occurred in far less time than we have taken in attempting to detail literally the gigantic scenes of ruin and death, in which these poor wretches were now helpless actors.
                  The Royal George was bending over—slowly over on her side. The nature of the danger was clearly visible to all; and though the seamen with the same instinct rushed to the upper side to right the ship, it was a task as useless as ineffectual. The very fact of having piled all the ponderous and solid weight that was moveable above and below the decks, rendered every endeavor impossible.
                  "Beat to quarters!" were the words that now in tones of breathless fear issued from the trumpets of the officers, and instantly the roll of the drums followed, peal upon peal,—but everything they could do was now too late.
                  The Laplander had done his work too effectually! Every sinister circumstance that could aid him did so, and at the very moment that a puff of wind, heavier than ordinary, came, amid one wild and soul-appalling shriek, the ship, with groanings, went down; and presently, in the mad maelstrom that formed itself with frightful velocity above the spot where the engulfed ship lay, appeared floating bodies, drowning men, some clinging to broken spars, or whatever they could catch at; the rest lay shrouded in their last deep sleep in their great and ghastly tomb below!"
                  
                  By this catastrophe some nine hundred persons lost their lives, not more than three hundred being saved. The gloom which this tragedy cast over the public mind may be easily imagined; and the heart-rending scenes that followed are beyond all description!
                  It was many a year after this event that Ambrose Corbyn, then a prosperous and happy man, told what of fact he knew, and by conjecture confirmed by after occurrences, coupled the "Lapland Rat" with the loss of the "Royal George." It is possible, too, that had the odious persecutions and gratuitous brutalities that were permitted in the navy, the worst feature of which was the press-gang, and the wanton atrocities committed by men like Captain Crank upon such unprotected creatures as Skaggerac, not taken place, this version of the history might not have been necessitated.
               
               THE END.
            
         
      
         
         
               
               A NEW NOVEL, EQUAL TO CHARLES O'MALLEY.
               THE BIVOUAC: OR THE RIVAL SUITORS.
               BY WM. H. MAXWELL,
               AUTHOR OF HECTOR O'HALLORAN, STORIES OF WATERLOO, WILD SPORTS OF THE WEST, ETC.
               BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED.—PRICE 50 CENTS.
               THIS Capital Book is of the "Charles O Malley" school—full of dashing adventures, love intrigues, brilliant sketches of battle scenes, in which the inspiring headlong charge and terrible defeat are detailed with all the force of truth. The BIVOUAC belongs, as we have said, to a popular class of books, and we think it decidedly the very best of its class. We have not the space, though we have a strong inclination, to give our readers a taste of its quality—to reprint at length the matchless scene of the lover's meeting the fortune-teller in the gloom of the forest; the appalling interview and the grave-stories in the churchyard at midnight; the droll dialogues of the regimental mess-table; the eloquent description of the encampment of the rival armies; the fearful carnage of the battle-field; the prodigies of valor performed during the mountain combat; the richly humorous "confessions of a gentleman who would have married if he could;" and a dozen other delineations marked in every page by some bold trait of wit or genius. The war-like descriptions will vie with the most animated scenes in Allison or Napier; and the humorous portions of the book have no peers but in the pages of Lever or Lover.—Morning Star.
               
               THE BIVOUAC, OR RIVAL SUITORS, by Col. W. H. Maxwell, is one of those popular romances which are eagerly devoured by readers of fiction, and, in this instance, without the deleterious influence which is too frequently attributed to much of the literature of the day. The "Bivouac" is a spirited, well-conceived and thrilling picture in the O'Malley style. The memoir of a ruined beauty, which occurs in the course of the story, is a touching exhibition of the extreme anguish which flattery and falsehood may inflict. Garrett & Co., New York, have issued it in fair type and with illustrations.—Saturday Courier.

               THIS charming novel is founded on incidents in the history of England during Plantagenet rule, and contains scenes of pathetic interest to which none but a master of romance could do justice. To represent correctly the costumes, character, and language of that early period, is a task of no little difficulty; but our author has evidently studied his subject well, and has sustained himself admirably in this respect throughout.
