            [The Cave and valley of Genreva are situated in Tazewell county,
               Virginia; and, though known by other names (See "History of Tazewell") for a long
               period, have only lately attracted attention, in consequence of their wonderful
               discovery and developments, which are now, for the first time, made

               MY DEAR SIR:
            
            Your character as a friend, a gentleman, and as a lover of literature is such that I
               am fain to express my feelings of respect by dedicating to you the following pages,
               founded upon a reminiscence of your adopted county.
            In thus expressing my regard for you, I feel that I am only giving you a slight
               manifestation of the exalted estimation in which I hold your moral worth.
            That you may long live to grace the circle of society in which you move AN ORNAMENT,
               is the sincere wish of
            
               Your friend and servant,
               G. W. L. BICKLEY.

            PREFACE.
            THIS volume has not been written as tales of its character usually are, viz: to
               enlist merely the baser passions of our natures—but it has been the aim of the author
               to give, in a plain, and, it is hoped, interesting style, a tale of real life, only
               too true to find its way into the world through such a channel.
            Little attempt has been made at beauty of diction or great taste of language, as the
               author was well convinced that the more simplicity and plain narration that was wound
               around the tale, the more likely was it to convey to the mind of the reader the
               truthfulness of the picture which it holds up to view.
            This is the first attempt of the author to throw the mysterious vail of fiction
               around an incident worthy of a place on the pages of history. He has thought proper
               to do so for two reasons: 1. This class of works falls much into the hands of those
               for whom it contains a lesson; and 2. Many of the characters are now alive, and hence
               force the adoption of fictitious names.
            The scene has not been laid in the exact locality that might have been desired; but a
               wish to screen the parties from the public, will be a sufficient apology. At some
               future day the names and locality will alike be known. I would remark, however, that
               the major part of the geographical positions are correct; also a few of the proper
               names.
            
            If I shall have succeeded in conveying the lesson intended to be conveyed, and it
               have the salutary influences I sincerely hope for, I shall feel that I have not
               written in vain. Asking, that the reader may not pass judgment until he has read the
               last chapter, I introduce him at once to the locality from whence a knowledge of the
               incidents was derived.*
               
            
            
               
               *Captain Bell, one of the characters introduced, had commenced this work, but
                  eventually placed his manuscript in the author's hand, and so well has he told
                  the tale that the first few chapters are allowed to remain as he wrote
                  them.

            Adalaska, or, The strange and mysterious family of the Cave of Genreva
            ADALASKA, OR THE MYSTERIOUS FAMILY.
            
               THE VALLEY.
               IT was a bright morning in May 1841, that I mounted my horse, intending to seek
                  out a strange, and, as report said, a wild man, who was frequently seen in the
                  mountain forests of the beautiful county of Tazewell, Virginia.
               Strange stories were related, by the inhabitants, of his appearance, and much
                  stranger of his acts and mysterious movements. Some declared him insane; some that
                  he was not only rational but highly intellectual; while others, less curious and
                  positive, but more sympathizing, applied to him the appellation "poor, strange
                  man!" Some said he was old and decrepid, while others declared him young and
                  robust. So varied and so strange were the accounts given of him, by those who had
                  occasionally seen his flitting form in the forests, that I resolved to seek him
                  out; and as already stated, had mounted my horse, determined, if possible, to
                  learn his history and quell the gossip of the country people, whose curiosity and
                  imaginations had wrought the "poor, strange man" into a fearful monster of the
                  cannibal species, to the no small terror of mothers and maidens, and discomfiture
                  of such faint-hearted lovers, as would not have defended their sweethearts if they
                  had met the "wild man" actually bearing them off.
               I was soon riding leisurely along through the heavy-leafed forests, variegated
                  with flowers and gently fanned with refreshing breezes from the mountain peaks,
                  which towered far above my head. The golden beams of the rising sun were
                     beautifully coloring the speary frost
                  upon the shrubs on the summit of the mountains; and the pearly dewdrops upon the
                  leaves and grass in the valley looked like so many rich diamonds, hung out as
                  decorating ornaments to the fragrant forests. Mellow-throated birds and chattering
                  squirrels were chanting a hymn of praise to the king of the forest tribes, so
                  sweet yet so pensive, that more than once I drew up my rein to contemplate the
                  scene and join my praise with that which was ascending from every part of creation
                  surrounding me.
               Another hour and I found myself on the top of a lofty mountain, overlooking the
                  curious yet beautiful valley in which the "strange man" was said to dwell. If the
                  reader can imagine a level and circular area of land, heavily set with timber, and
                  surrounded by a chain of mountains two thousand feet high (rising abruptly above
                  the mean level of the surrounding mountains, three hundred feet in the air)
                  presenting a perpendicular wall of solid limestone around the entire valley, and
                  with but one narrow and rugged defile, through which the valley could be reached,
                  he will have some idea of the outward appearances of this romantic spot
               From the summit to the base, on the inner side of this circular mountain, the
                  descent was gradual, even more so than is usually seen in mountainous slopes where
                  such immense barriers are presented on either side. To view the valley from the
                  pass in which I sat, it appeared like a mighty basin, the bottom of which sat
                  loosely on the earth. The heavy and even forest with which it was covered
                  resembled somewhat the impenetrable "tie-tie" swamps of the southern
                  savannahs.
               A deep rumbling noise, somewhat resembling the growling threats of dreadful Etna,
                  when she is gathering all her energies, to pour out her destructive wrath upon
                  that devoted land over which she so often casts the gloom of desolation, was
                  slowly ascending amid the boughs of the oaken timbers. I knew not from whence this
                  sound proceeded; but I felt a sense of loneliness stealing over me, as if I was at
                  the mouth of the cavern from which were issuing the groans of those confined in
                  the infernal regions, which Dante and Pollock so forcibly describe.
               A thin column of blue smoke was slowly ascending and imperceptibly losing itself
                  among the few vapory clouds, seen hugging the crest of the mountains on the
                  opposite side of the valley. An eagle of great size was hovering in the still,
                  clear atmosphere, seeming to scrutinize everything which dared to enter the
                  mysterious valley of Genreva. The howl of a wild and ferocious wolf was heard
                  breaking the primeval stillness of that beautiful valley, which as soon as seen
                  impressed me with the premonition that its destiny was, in some manner, linked to
                  the past and the future. The sweet notes of the wild songsters of the woods were
                  resounding among the glens and gorges of the rugged surrounding mountains. The
                  gentle murmur of the morning breeze, singing nature's anthem to the forest trees,
                  and the soft melody of the feathered tribe seemed to speak out the real picture of
                  an oriental luxuriance. How exceedingly romantic was the scene! I shall never
                  forget it!
               I alighted from my horse and ascended the summit of the nearest peak to scan with
                  my glass the mysterious valley of Genreva before I entered the depths of its
                  solitude. But from this little more could be seen than from the pass or defile in
                  which my horse was hitched; for the dense forest completely obscured the surface
                  of the earth.
               Here, thought I, is a wilderness in the midst of civilization. But am I the first
                  to explore it?
               I soon descended from the rocky eminence on which I had been seated, and returned
                  to where my horse stood with his ears pointed forward, as if he too was impressed
                  with the apparent desolation of the place. When I regained my saddle, I took out
                  my glass to examine what seemed an animated object, on the opposite side of the
                  valley. This was the object at which my horse seemed to have been looking, and
                  which proved to be only a large, irregular rock that had broken off from the
                  cliffs near the summit, and rolled partly down the side of the mountain.
               At this moment, however, the thought flashed across my mind, that as there was
                  only the one pass by which the valley could be entered, the strange genius of the
                  place might be so situated as to command
                  a view of it, and having seen me might secrete himself and thus foil any attempt
                  to learn his history.
               My rowels touched my charger's flank and away he went down the mountain side,
                  clearing rocks, logs, and rivulets, till I was near its base.
               Alighting, I hitched him to a bush, concluding to foot the remainder of the way,
                  to where I had seen the smoke rising above the timber, which I supposed was nearly
                  a mile distant.
               I had proceeded about half a mile, looking carefully for the least trace of human
                  existence, and was just turning the sharp angle of a rugged rock, when a hand was
                  laid softly on my arm, and a calm, clear voice said "Stop." I turned to look, and
                  instead of seeing, as I expected, the visage of a demon, I beheld the sweetest
                  face I have ever seen. There was playing upon his countenance that soft and
                  sweetly attractive smile of melancholy, which to be admired and felt, is but to be
                  seen.
               He was about five feet eleven inches high, and was a model of symmetry. His gently
                  tapered fingers would have pointed to Normandy as the home of his ancestors. The
                  extreme softness and healthful hue of his skin; manly bearing; melodious voice;
                  all convinced me that I stood in the presence of one of superiority. His clear
                  blue eye seemed to blaze with intelligence, while his hair, which was a beautiful
                  brown, curled in heavy ringlets over his rich vestments with that feminine
                  delicacy thought to belong exclusively to another part of creation.
               "Stop, my friend," said the strange man; "why, sir, do you come with such speed,
                  or why at all to this valley of sorrow and loneliness?"
               I looked embarrassed into his face; his left hand still upon my arm, and his right
                  upon the handle of a pistol decorated with many jewels and plainly not of American
                  workmanship. But seeing he was about to repeat the interrogation, I answered, with
                  as much kindness in my tone of voice as possible: "I come, my dear sir, with no
                  evil designs, I would only learn the history of a man who has thus sought
                  seclusion from the world in the solitude of these mountain fastnesses."
               "Ah! the mystery of my mode of life has excited your curiosity?"
               I answered "Yes;" that it was the desire to learn his history that had caused me
                  to visit the valley.
               "Then curiosity has prompted you to put your life in my hands—the hands of a man
                  on whom your laws cannot take effect; for shut up as I am in this valley, with but
                  ten men I might defy the power of a thousand. Yes! I am in a fortress as
                  impregnable as the far-famed Gibraltar: even more so, for with a few men to guard
                  you pass through which you have entered, cities might spring up and be densely
                  populated, even though the powers of a State were hurled against me, we have in
                  this valley the means of support. Add to this the work of a few hours, and a
                  sentinel on yon high peak," and he raised his beautiful hand to point out the
                  direction, "and the guard might be dispensed with."
               "For many years," said I, "that would be unnecessary; for as yet, no one lives
                  near the valley, and except you and myself, no man but the lone Indian, in his
                  wild rambles, has entered it. But, sir, in process of time the land will be sold
                  to settlers, and then—"
               "No, sir, this land shall never be sold—it's mine."
               "By what title do you hold possession of this land?" I inquired.
               "I hold it by right of purchase, I hold it by right of entry, I hold it by right
                  of occupation, and I hold it, under God, who is our father, as an asylum for the
                  homeless and the oppressed."
               "From whom did you purchase it?" I again asked.
               "My grandfather purchased it from Lord Thomas Walker, and as his heir, I inherit
                  from him; I have it entered by warrants from the State of Virginia; I have
                  occupied it eleven years, and as one of the human race, it is mine!
                  yes, it is mine!"
               And his bright eyes glistened with animation as he raised them to heaven; viewing,
                  no doubt, with his inner man, the face of God smiling on him.
               "Well, well!" said I, "I did not visit you to inquire into the legality of your
                  title-deeds, for I would not, had I the power, wrest this beautiful possession
                  from you. I would see you enjoy it; your face tells me you are worthy."
               "I may be worthy," he answered, "but I can never enjoy its possession. I may
                  possess and occupy but not enjoy; I need the presence of one to ever enjoy life. But come, sir,
                  let's away to my home—the only place on earth where there is left one tie to bind
                  my heart to this world. That tie is a shadow of my former hopes—hopes on which I
                  had built an ideal heaven. Come, let's away."
               I took his arm and we started; but silence was around us for some distance, for I
                  saw the last few words had touched the tenderest chords of his heart. He trembled
                  and became faint; he stopped, and seating himself by the side of a cold stone, he
                  gave vent to his feelings through a flood of pearly tears which I saw dropping
                  fast from his cheek on the earth.
               "My dear sir," said I, "pardon me if I am the instrument thus to punish you; I
                  would not, I assure you, call up one feeling to imbitter your soul."
               "It's over now; you did not inflict the wound; it was my own act; but it's past. I
                  would not be such a child if I could command my feelings. But as reason did not
                  plant this tenderness in my soul; reason cannot efface it. When you shall have
                  known all you will not believe me a child as I appear.'
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               ADALASKA'S HOME DESCRIBED—A NECESSARY CHAPTER TO THE BOOK.
               "HERE, sir," said he, as we turned an abrupt rocky bluff, "is the home of
                  ADALASKA, THE LORD OF GENREVA."
               I looked around me to discover, if possible, what there was to serve for a house.
                  I saw no hut, no camp, or anything else which looked as though it might be the
                  abiding-place of one who seemed to have been born a prince. We stood in a circular
                  area embracing perhaps two acres of land. It was concealed from view by immense
                  rocks jutting up through the surface, and might have been passed many times by the
                  stranger without detection. In the center of this area, which was covered with a
                  heavy sod of blue-grass and wild flowers, stood what appeared a monument of
                  whitest marble. It was about twelve feet high, surmounted by the figure of a
                  female bending over a sleeping babe. In one hand she held a rosebud, and in the
                  other a jeweled cross. The monument was about four feet square, and on each side
                  were inscriptions in different languages, which being translated, read thus:
               West side—"FORGET NOT A MOTHER'S WRONG."
               North side—"PROTECT THE INNOCENT."
               East side—"DESPAIR IS THE PHŒNIX OF HOPE."
               South side—"REMEMBER THE LIVING—FORGET NOT THE DEAD."
               Under each inscription beautiful designs were cut. On the west side was an angel
                  smiting a man whose dagger was raised to destroy his wife. On the north side was
                  an eagle seizing a serpent from the couch of a child. On the east side was a
                  female scattering the petals of a withered rose. On the south side was a man with
                  a drawn sword bidding defiance to his enemies, who seemed to be forcing a passage
                  to his fireside.
               On each upper corner of the monument was a marble goblet, from which a beautiful
                  blue flame was issuing. The whole structure seemed to be a solid block of marble.
                  Noticing that I looked with great interest on the monument, Adalaska remarked:
               "You would learn the history of that structure?"
               I answered, "Yes, I would gladly know."
               "Not yet! not yet!" he said in his calm, yet decided tone of voice; "you must know
                  much before you can learn that."
               And he took from his bosom a small gold whistle and blew it. In an instant a
                  massive door opened from the apparently solid wall of rocks before us, and out
                  bounded a tall, athletic man. He stopped as suddenly as if he had been confronted
                  by a very demon, when he saw me.
               "All is right Maran," said Adalaska; "I have conducted this stranger hither, and
                  desire him to have every care from your hands. First return and let his presence
                  be known to the inmates of our home, and then proceed to the foot of the mountain
                  near the pass and bring hither our friend's horse and a light rifle which you will
                  find at the large tree near the horse. Come, Maran, away."
               
               Maran must have been upward of six feet in height and was as heavily muscled as a
                  Roman gladiator. His skin was that of a dark brunette, while his hair might rival
                  the shades of midnight. His eyes were small, black, and as brilliant as diamonds,
                  and his dress of heavy substantial cloth of fine texture. He wore a short sword,
                  splendidly jeweled, and in his belt a brace of curiously wrought pistols.
               As he turned into the cavern, to inform its inmates of my presence and to summon
                  them forth to meet me, I began to repent my rashness in placing myself in the
                  power of men, who, from what I could see, might more than likely be a band of
                  robbers. Yet it seemed strange that there should be found at the entrance of their
                  home a monument, the inscriptions on which were so far from leading one to expect
                  such a thing. I was wrapped in such speculations when Maran again came forth and
                  hurried by us without making the least stop. He was on his way for my horse.
               I had turned from the door to look again at the monument, when Adalaska said:
               "Good morning, grandpa, I have found by chance and conducted hither this stranger;
                  I hope the feelings of friendship in his breast will prove a safeguard to my
                  imprudence."
               I was already turned around and was waiting the old man's answer to my
                  introduction, when he replied:
               "'Laska, is he an honest man?"
               "I hope so, grandpa, and as far as my judgment can reach, believe so."
               "Then, stranger, you are welcome to my home and the home of this my family, to its
                  hospitalities and its peace. These you see around me are my children,
                  grand-children, and the children of those who, like me, have drained the dregs
                  from the bitter cup of affliction."
               I bowed and said: "My noble sir, for I feel that you are no common man, I gladly
                  accept the hospitalities of your home, and hope and trust I may not prove myself
                  an unworthy visitor. I too have known affliction and know that here I will at
                  least find sympathizing hearts.
               The whole company came up and shook hands with me and were each introduced by
                  name. And as it will be necessary to introduce them to the reader, in the course
                  of the following narrative, I see no reason why this may not be the time and place
                  to do so.
               The first was Count Rollin, the old gentleman. He seemed to be at least
                  seventy-five, or it might be eighty years of days. His form was somewhat bent with
                  age, yet he gave evident signs of having at one time possessed an iron
                  constitution. His hair was white and silky, while his eyes were blue, and when he
                  spoke, they glowed still with the fire of younger age. His vestments were of the
                  richest kind, and seemed better suited to a palace than a cave.
               The next was Alick, the very image of Maran and dressed almost in the same manner.
                  Maran and Alick looked to be about twenty-six years of age.
               The next to whom I was introduced, were Mattino and Lenna; two girls about
                  eighteen years of age. They appeared evidently to be sisters. It has been seldom
                  in the whole course of my life that I have seen two women possessed of more real
                  beauty. I was struck with amazement at the ease, too, with which they conversed.
                  Every requisite, in the way of a polished education, seemed to have been bestowed
                  upon them. The extreme taste of their dresses and rich jewelry only served to make
                  more deeply mysterious to me the spot on which I stood. And then there was a
                  beautiful girl, of a brunette skin so different from the two older girls, and yet
                  dressed in exactly the same style and apparently as highly polished with education
                  and manners, that I was more than ever puzzled. She was introduced as Massoa, and
                  was about fifteen.
               The next was Gasper, who bore strong marks, in his features, of relationship to
                  the two elder ladies. He was about twenty-one, and as fine a specimen of manhood
                  as is often seen. He was attired much as Maran and Alick.
               The remainder of the company was made up of servants. Bolivar and Tom were two
                  stout good-natured Africans, while Susy and Polly seemed all life and possessed of
                  more than common sense. These were respectively the wives of Bolivar and Tom, who, no doubt, felt as
                  rich in the possession of such treasures as if they had been real queens. Even the
                  servants were remarkable for the neatness of their dresses.
               These composed the whole troupe of Count Rollin's court, if such I may term it,
                  and I have no doubt but more real virtue and worth were to be found in that rude,
                  may I not say primitive home, than in all the courts of Europe, with their wealth,
                  paraphernalia, and high stations.
               The ceremony of introduction being ended, we entered through the heavy, massive
                  door which was immediately closed upon us. We must beg to tire the reader a little
                  longer with description; this done, and I shall again proceed to relate the
                  incidents of that cave, etc.
               Who can imagine my surprise on finding myself in a hall brilliantly lighted with
                  gas and furnished with splendid furniture! In the center of this hall, which might
                  be regarded as an anteroom, a jet of clearest water was thrown from an orifice
                  about an inch in diameter nearly to the ceiling of the room, or about sixteen feet
                  in height.
               We made no stop in this room but were soon ushered into another, which Count
                  Rollin called a court. This was something over a hundred feet square and also
                  lighted with gas. The furniture of this room was also of fine quality. It
                  consisted of a bureau, a large pier-glass, a table in the center, on which set a
                  pitcher and glasses, a few lounges, several old paintings, and a small swivel or
                  cannon, which was so ranged as to command the passage through which we had entered
                  this apartment.
               I looked around, as we entered, and seeing no outlet, had concluded that in it
                     all slept, eat, etc.; but I was altogether mistaken. Making no
                  stop, we were soon upon the opposite side of the hall from which we had entered.
                  There Count Rollin stopped, and Adalaska went to a ring, which was apparently
                  fastened in the wall of solid limestone which then surrounded me, as if to serve
                  for a hammock fastening. Taking hold of it, and without seeming to exert much
                  force, he opened a large door and we passed in silence into another room, which
                  may be designated as the parlor. In it were chairs, sofas, lounges, footstools, center-tables
                     Captain Bell's encounter with Adalaska; page 22.
                  
                   tables, stands, etc. On one side stood a
                  very large bookcase, filled with books, and near it stood another case containing
                  mathematical instruments. Several musical instruments were seen in different parts
                  of the room, and among them a beautiful piano. From the center of the ceiling or
                  top of the room a large chandelier was suspended, which served to light the whole
                  apartment most brilliantly. A rack, on which rested, guns, swords, and pikes, was
                  seen on one side, while just opposite was a small sanctuary containing a massive
                  cross, a symbol of the Virgin Mary, an altar and two large candles. Numerous
                  scriptural paintings were also to be seen in the room.
               The walls had been hewn down and were now papered, while the floor was very smooth
                  and covered with a rich and costly carpet. I will not say that its furniture and
                  appearance were superior to anything I had before seen; but I must acknowledge
                  that there are few parlors in our country so superbly furnished, or that are more
                  pleasant. On a table, which stood before the altar, lay an open bible. To this
                  table the Count led me, and after all the company had assembled in a circle around
                  it, he said:
               "Stranger, dost thou believe in the prophesies of this book?"
               I answered: "I do."
               "Are you willing to yield to its precepts while in this home of mine?"
               "I am;" said I.
               "Then, sir, you are more than welcome to its hospitalities; for though we are now
                  more than three hundred feet below the surface of the earth, in a cave, we have
                  plenty and can make you comfortable. If you promise to be one of us, and that you
                  will give us your aid, should we call for it, you are a welcome visitor."
               "I promise," said I, "that, let come what will, I will still be a man; nor shall
                  you ever regret having made my acquaintance. If I shall, at any time, be enabled
                  to serve you I shall more than willingly do so."
               He took me by the hand and gave it a gentle, yet warm grasp, saying:
               "I feel, stranger, that you are a man—one who knows the worth of manhood. You see
                  that you are in my power, and I respect
                  you the more for having bravery enough to place yourself in such a condition. But
                  tell me, to whom do I speak?"
               "I am Captain Bell, of the regular army," said I; "now on parol to visit my
                  relations in this county. I shall be off duty for two years, unless the country is
                  involved in war, during which time I hope to spend many hours with you, in your
                  retreat from the cares of life."
               A prayer was read before the altar and we were conducted into several other rooms,
                  large and spacious, and fitted up in the most magnificent manner. The ladies'
                  apartments were superbly furnished. As these several rooms were brilliantly
                  lighted with gas, it may be as well to state by what means this was effected.
               The mountains of Virginia present many places where hydrogen gas is found in a
                  natural state. At the Kanawha salines the gas is consumed in the manufacture of
                  salt as well as to light the establishments. The Count had, when he first entered
                  this place, taken a torch to examine it, and all at once found himself surrounded
                  by a flame of fire. Being a man of scientific acquirements, he at once saw how he
                  might use this gas for lighting the place. He found it issuing from a small
                  orifice, and having procured tubes of the proper kind, was thus enabled to conduct
                  it to any part of the caverned palace.
               Soon after we had made a thorough exploration of the various rooms or halls, I was
                  conducted to the parlor or drawing-room where one of the ladies seated herself at
                  the piano; another took a guitar, and another a harp, these were aided by Adalaska
                  on a flute and Alick on a violin. The remainder of those present assisted by
                  singing. They began upon the Marseilles hymn of Liberty, and I am sure that it was
                  never so well performed even in Paris. The character of the place was such as to
                  give the music all its power. As the various doors were thrown open, the notes
                  were heard distinctly echoing through the other rooms till it seemed that even the
                  very walls had joined in the chorus. Several pieces of music of modern style were
                  then performed, each piece only showing how well the lessons of the old masters
                  had been appreciated by this happy family.
               But finally the music ceased, except the violin, now taken in hand by Gasper, and
                  several dances took place. This too showed the same superior skill which had
                  characterized the musical performance.
               When dinner was served at two o'clock, the same fashionable etiquette which had
                  hitherto characterized every movement of my host and his household, was
                  observable. After dinner the Count, myself, and the other gentlemen engaged in a
                  conversation of which the politics of the world was the topic. It was only now I
                  felt the superiority of Count Rollin; he showed himself to be as familiar with the
                  politics and history of nations as I was of my own State. Nor were the other
                  gentlemen in the least at a loss on this subject.
               At six o'clock the ladies again appeared in the parlor and joined in the political
                  discussion, till finally Maran left the room and brought in some bouquets of wild
                  flowers, which he had gathered in the morning while after my horse. These flowers
                  caused the conversation to turn upon botany and natural science. Now on this
                  subject I felt a deep interest, and as I had made botany a study, felt that I
                  should have it in my power to instruct the ladies about the names, classes, and
                  qualities of the various flowers of which the bouquets were composed. But here
                  too, I was much mistaken, for I found that all possessed a most perfect knowledge
                  of botany as a science. In short, there seemed no subject which had escaped their
                  minute observation and attention.
               When we retired, at eleven o'clock, I could hardly persuade myself that all I had
                  seen during the day was not a dream. The room, in which I was lodged, was about
                  twenty-five feet square and richly furnished. I could observe that one of its
                  walls was artificial, a thing I found to occur in the formation of several of the
                  rooms, sometime after.
               I threw myself on the bed, the gas light still burning (for they were never
                  extinguished), and gave my imagination full sway. In vain I tried to satisfy my
                  mind who the lords of the cave were, and why they were there. I thought too, that
                  I should more than willingly become one of its inmates if so allowed to do. Here,
                  I thought, was the perfection of human nature. The hours rolled silently away and
                  there I lay, still indulging my fancy, till finally the clock in my room struck two. I waked next
                  morning refreshed, and as soon as I had dressed, repaired to the parlor, where I
                  found the family engaged in the perusal of some newspapers—where they came from I
                  knew not. I was received cordially, and in a short time we went to a breakfast
                  prepared in the true French style.
               Leaving the internal arrangements of the cave, of which I hope a sufficient
                  description has been given to enable the reader to form a correct idea of its
                  appearance, I proceed to the incidents of the next ten months.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               THE MYSTERY EXPLAINED.
               "BOLIVAR," said Thomas, "what you tink make our young massa 'Laska so much lub to
                  be lone ob late; and where him be gone sometimes for whole week?"
               "Well, I does not know, but I 'spose he be looking arter his 'fairs," said
                  Bolivar, rather indifferently.
               "'Spose he is looking arter his 'fairs—is dat any reason why he should 'pear so
                  unhappy? does ebery man, when he has business, go into de woods and be gone from
                  day to day for two weeks? does ebery man, who has business, talk all night in his
                  sleep, and laugh and sigh from sunset till de morning? No! no! Bolivar, dar's
                  something else de matter wid massa 'Laska."
               "Tom, you are a mi'ty philosophic man, but I guess you no find out massa 'Laska
                  yet—you know him long time, but you no know de man dat's in him yet. I tell you
                  even Maran and Alick no know him, as much as he love dem and much as he tell dem.
                  I'd not be 'sprised if massa 'Laska no tell old Bolivar more now, nor any on 'em.
                  He know me, Tom, he know I be honest and true to him, and dat what he tell me to
                  do, dat I does."
               "Look here, Bolivar, does you mean to say my massa will not trust me far as you?
                  If you does I'll show you some dese days what old Tom is, and dat you is not truer
                  to your massa dan I is."
               "Tom I does not mean dat, but I mean dat you does not know my massa like I does,
                  and he has had no chance to try your arm and heart like he has mine. I know you be
                  not 'fraid ob de bery debil, but massa does not know you like me—but, Tom, de next
                  time chance offers he shall give you work to do."
               Such was the conversation of Tom and Bolivar in the hall, one morning soon after I
                  had arrived at the cave in the Valley of Genreva. I listened to it with some
                  interest and hoped from it to gain some clue to the mysteries which everywhere
                  surrounded me, and might have done so had it not been for the sudden appearance of
                  Suse in the hall to get a pitcher of water. She saw from the looks of Tom that
                  some words of an unpleasant nature must have passed between them, and as peace in
                  the household was one, and in fact almost the only, painted law in
                  the court of Count Rollin, she began to question them upon the nature of their
                  dispute.
               "What you two been 'sputing 'bout now?"
               "Nothing of 'portance to you," said Tom, who could not conceal his chagrin at
                  being thought less worthy than Bolivar by his master, to whom he was firmly
                  attached.
               "You both looks like something's been said dat's not pleasant, for Bolivar looks
                  like he was gwine to join de church to-morrow, and your eyes sparkle like somebody
                  had spit backen juice in 'em; now you must talk widout getting mad. You has neber
                  seen me mad, nor has you eber heard in dis home, for most twelve years, one single
                  harsh word."
               "Susy," said Bolivar, "dare is no danger ob I and Tom habing a quarrel, we was
                  only arguing a little matter."
               A bell rung at this moment, and Susy left the hall with the water. Tom and Bolivar
                  also left for their own rooms. I was engaged in perusing an old volume of French
                  poems, and had thus heard the conversation from the court which joined the hall.
                  As I had read till my eyes were fatigued, I lay down on a sofa that stood on one
                  side of the room, and which was shaded by the altar and the heavy cloak of Count
                  Rollin, which hung on a post between it and the chandelier. I had lain here some
                     twenty minutes, when Adalaska and
                  Lenna entered the court, conversing about something that did not reach my ear for
                  a few minutes. They, however, advanced near the sanctuary and seating themselves
                  on a lounge, continued their conversation, which was now quite audible.
               "Yes, Adalaska, father might object, and I know you love him too much to offend
                  him."
               "So, I admit, aunt," said Adalaska (for though she was his junior, yet she was his
                  aunt); "but which is best of the two extremes, to offend my grandpa, or sacrifice
                  my honor to a maiden whom I love with all my soul, and who, but for circumstances
                  beyond her control, would be mine at any moment!"
               "Had you, my dear Adalaska, conferred with me in the first instance, I might have
                  advised you of a better course; but as it is you have made love to a woman whom
                  you do not know, and have seen but once. Your nature is such, that it is the
                  fewest of women who would make you happy. Though you are wise from books, you know
                  little by experience of the world. When you have traveled, you have entered into
                  female society so little that I fear you are too ignorant of what the females of
                  this day are. That you know what they should be, I do not doubt; but even I, a
                  woman myself, knew but little of them, as a part of the fashionable world, till I
                  was sent to boarding-schools. It is there that we can learn most of them, yet not
                  all; as they grow older the various devices of tradesmen are, I am told, resorted
                  to; and father says it was to protect us from such influences that he has denied
                  himself the pleasures of the world and made his home in this dell."
               "I have no desire," she continued, "to have a happier home, Adalaska, than ours,
                  yet I see that, if we intend to keep ourselves as pure and unsullied as we are
                  now, we must be very cautious in our intercourse with those who are familiar with
                  the upper world of society."
               To this Adalaska replied:
               "My dear aunt Lenna, I fear your opinion of fashionable life is not correct, and
                  that when you were at school you were disgusted with it only because it was new to
                  you. Yet I promise that, hereafter, I shall make no movement in this matter
                  without first consulting you. In the meantime, when you can make it convenient,
                  sound your father upon the subject and see how he would regard my marriage with
                  one who stands high in society. But for heaven's sake do not give any one else the
                  least hint of it."
               "Do not fear but I will keep that to myself," said Lenna, as they rose to leave
                  the Court. I began now to get a hint of what was going on, and therefore felt more
                  easy about the conversation of Bolivar and Tom in the hall.
               Adalaska and Lenna walked to the opposite side of the court or great parlor, when
                  Lenna turned to him and asked some question which caused a renewal of the
                  conversation. The first I heard was this from the young man: a
                  description no doubt of the lady before referred to.
               "She is not, Lenna, what you mignt consider a beautiful woman, yet the grace of
                  her movements, the majesty of her carriage, the amiability of her disposition, her
                  fine sense, and elegant accomplishments are such as to impress the beholder with
                  feelings of admiration from the instant he first beholds her. Her skin is dark for
                  one raised in a northern climate, while her hair and eyes partake of the same
                  quality. The outline of her figure could not be better, while her features, though
                  masculine, still have the blending qualities of female modesty added to decision
                  of character. A few natural defects about the eyes only add interest to the woman
                  whom I have been involuntarily forced to love. I know she is not perfect, but
                  still I believe she would make me happy, and without her, if my present feelings
                  toward her be an index, I can never be happy."
               "But tell me, my dear cousin," said Lenna, "when, where, and under what
                  circumstances you first saw her!"
               He hesitated a moment before he spoke. This was the question which I, too, was
                  anxious to hear answered; for this would perhaps let me into the secret and thus
                  enable me to know how to act.
               "You will not tell me?" said Lenna inquiringly.
               "Yes, aunt, I will tell you the whole of it, if you will wait but a moment. Last
                  summer I was on a visit to Louisville,
                  Kentucky; while there I had occasion to visit a neighboring village to see a
                  college-mate. When I arrived, I found the whole family under serious apprehensions
                  that one of their number was near her mortal end. She was a bright, sweet girl,
                  whom I had known a few years, and I felt some anxiety about her recovery. As the
                  epidemic, which had fastened itself upon her, was doing much mischief, and I could
                  be of no avail to her, I left the village to visit another, some eighteen or
                  twenty miles distant, and there await the issue.
               "A few days passed and I returned. It was twelve o'clock at night when I walked to
                  the door and entered. All was still as death. The lights had grown dim, and beside
                  the bier sat a single watcher. That watcher was Eliza White. I was a stranger to
                  her, yet as the family had collected in other rooms of the mansion to mourn over
                  the loss of one so fair and so young, what could I do but introduce myself and
                  watch with her beside the bier of one, whom if I did not love, I respected. We
                  conversed much during the night, and as I found her so well informed, I was glad
                  to have met her. In the morning I was too well acquainted to need an introduction,
                  yet I received it. As she lived some distance I felt it my duty to see her safe
                  home. During the walk, we conversed much and freely, and before I left her I asked
                  permission to be numbered among her correspondents. To this she gave me her assent
                  and seemed to desire it, for I flatter myself so far as to think she was somewhat
                  pleased with me.
               "The next day I left for this place, from whence I addressed her a letter, soon
                  after my arrival. This she answered, and in the third letter I wrote to her, I
                  avowed my love for her, to which I received such a response as to place the matter
                  beyond doubt that she loved me. We became regular correspondents and are now
                  engaged to be married; and though it was a rash act, before consulting you, I felt
                  it a duty. To-morrow I start to consummate the act and assume my place among those
                  whom I love and respect. You know all; now tell me, aunt, had I better talk to
                  grandpa or not?"
               "Yes, I think, Adalaska, you had better mention to him, as you have to me, the
                  true facts and be governed by his advice; for you know my father does not love me
                  more truly than he does you, and you know his vow. It becomes, therefore, a duty,
                  and the more so, when you consider that it is for you that he is now cut off from
                  his race except our immediate household."
               "Thy will is the law, my dear, sweet aunt," said Adalaska; "what you command that
                  will I do."
               They rose and went into the parlor or drawing-room where Count Rollin was seated
                  in his arm-chair, busy in perusing the second volume of Smollett's History of
                  England. The whole matter was laid open to him; but as it was an important affair,
                  he demanded eighteen days to give an answer. To this Adalaska objected, as it
                  would cause him to falsify his word to Miss White. This he told his grandfather,
                  who assured him no harm should come from the delay, as he would soon show. Such
                  was the stage of affairs when I entered the parlor. The old gentleman looked
                  calmly at me for a few moments and said:
               "Captain, you have promised to do me a favor when it was in your power so to do.
                  Now I have work for you, and its execution would indeed be a favor. Will you
                  perform it?"
               "Most cheerfully," I answered, "demand what you please, I am ready and willing to
                  do you any favor."
               The old gentleman then told me, in substance, what has been given, adding:
               "Now I desire you shall repair to ——, and learn every particular respecting this
                  Miss Eliza White. Get acquainted with her, if possible, and make such observations
                  as may enable you to answer my interrogations when you shall have returned. I wish
                  you to start to-morrow morning, and return in eighteen days. Mail the letter,
                  which Adalaska will give you to-morrow, at the first office you pass, and be
                  prudent in your movements; disclose neither our acquaintance nor our
                  residence."
               "All shall be done," said I.
               The following morning, quite early, Adalaska was by my bedside, requesting me to
                  ask certain questions of the lady to see, if possible, whether she really felt as
                  she wrote. As soon as I had dressed he handed me a purse of gold, saying:
               "Now, captain, follow me; I shall show you another pass by which the valley may be reached. It requires a most
                  intimate knowledge and some bravery, however, to do so. There is a natural tunnel
                  through the base of the mountain, connecting with these caves which we have so
                  neatly fitted up. Make yourself acquainted with it and you are safe from a
                  thousand pursuing enemies."
               Without bidding any one good-bye, I started on my mission of love. Adalaska led
                  the way, and when we had passed the parlor and entered into the great court, he
                  handed me a light bowie-knife and two pistols, saying:
               "You may need these, for we know not what difficulties we may encounter. Your
                  horse is ready near the opening of the tunnel: come, follow me, and notice well
                  the landmarks which I shall point out to you!"
               After we had passed the fountain we turned to the right and went through an open
                  archway. This was the commencement of the subterraneous passage, through which the
                  gas-pipes had been conducted, and was so well lighted that we were enabled to see
                  every part of the passage as we passed along. Coming to an abrupt end, a door,
                  stuccoed and painted so as to resemble the limestone walls on either side, was
                  thrown open by the smallest exertion. Here we stopped for a moment, that I might
                  be taught the utility of that door.
               "Here," said Adalaska, is the key to the entrance of this cave. You will note it
                  well, for we may yet have to use its power in arresting the pursuit of our
                  enemies. This door is the only impediment offered to him who would venture to
                  explore this place; but so well has the door been made to represent a wall of
                  limestone, that few would discover the difference till it had been pointed out.
                  Here, too, is the stop which cuts off the supply of gas that is used to light the
                  passage. This second large pipe, you see, is so arranged as to fill the entire
                  passage with a mass of flame. You will best see its use if I suppose such a case
                  as would render it necessary to use it. If you were followed, say by fifty or even
                  a hundred men, and they were to pursue you so closely as to see you escape through
                  the door I have just shown you, you would, of course, not have time to fasten it.
                  Then you would run to this small light, which burns so dimly, and turn that large
                  stop. The gas would be ignited from the small light and rush out in such a mass
                  that nothing could or would attempt to pass further into this passage.
               "You see at once that it is one of the most powerful obstacles that could be
                  thrown in the way of pursuers. It may be extinguished by a stop near the fount. I
                  hope we may never have occasion to use it; but I think it always best to be
                  prepared; for we know not where danger is, nor how soon we may find ourselves its
                  victims. * * * * * You now know the grand secret by which this passage is
                  guarded."
               We passed on through the tunnel near half a mile, when suddenly I saw a bright
                  white light in the distance. It was daylight, as seen at the opening of the
                  tunnel.
               "Stop, captain, I wish to show you our sentinel at this place. You see that wire,
                  do you not?"
               "No, sir, I see nothing," I replied.
               "Well, give me hold of your hand and you can feel it."
               "Ah! yes, now I see it" said I, as I saw two wires stretched across the
                  passage.
               "Those wires, sir, are attached to bells in my grandfather's room and in the
                  parlor; should they ring at any time, some one is hurried off to inquire the cause
                  of alarm. Those who know the place, always stoop under them and so create no
                  alarm, while a stranger would always run against them, thus giving the necessary
                  warning for us to prepare for defense."
               Passing them, we soon arrived at the opening of the tunnel, where we found Bolivar
                  waiting with my horse. I was surprised also to see him have another, for I could
                  not see the use that could be made of horses by the inhabitants of the cave. I
                  found afterward that they kept four, however, and that they used them to pack what
                  might be needed from the Ohio river after it had been shipped from Cincinnati.
               "Captain Bell," said Adalaska, "I desire you to take Bolivar with you; he is
                  perfectly worthy of your confidence. He will be your servant and will be enabled
                  to learn much which you would not readily observe. Beside I wish him to get familiar with the ground, etc., about
                  the residence of Eliza."
               Bolivar and I mounted our horses (still in the tunnel, which was here quite
                  spacious), while Adalaska went to the opening to see if all was clear and no one
                  in sight. He soon returned, and bidding him adieu, we started. Before we arrived
                  at the opening I saw a large creek broke into the passage, which found its way
                  into the river, at the opening before us. The road led along the bank of the river
                  on the opposite side, and as the creek was quite a large one, no one had ever
                  thought of entering the passage, supposing it to be an orifice made by the creek;
                  a common thing everywhere in that section. After fording the river, which swept by
                  the mouth of the passage, we turned our horses' heads toward the Ohio river. Two
                  days afterward we found ourselves on a steamboat plowing down the pellucid waters
                  of "La belle riviere."*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *Here ends the captain's manuscript narration, and we assume his labors.
               
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               BOLIVAR AND THE CAPTAIN.
               "MASSA cap'in, we be not berry far from de house now, 'cording to what massa
                  'Laska say. Him say de house not be more dan four miles from de riber. I tinks we
                  done come dat much; so de fuss house dat bears de 'scription must be de one."
               "No, Bolivar," answered the captain, "we are not very distant, and I imagine yon
                  large brick mansion is perhaps the one. But let us pass on and put up in the
                  village, the steeples of which I see pointing upward to the skies: there we will
                  stop and I will soon form acquaintances that will put me on the right track. In
                  the meantime, Bolivar, you keep quiet and I imagine we shall find but little
                  difficulty in accomplishing our mission.'
               They drove on (for the captain had hired a buggy in Louisville to go out to the
                  village), neither speaking, for some distance, but an acute observer might have
                  noticed old Bolivar casting his quick glance at a beautiful residence standing on
                  the left-hand side of the road as they entered the village from Louisville.
               There was something strange about the appearance of this negro, for though he was
                  unlettered, no one could fail to see that he was a man of no ordinary mind. His
                  peculiarly bright eye and imperturbable features seemed ever the same. A single
                  passion of his soul never shone out of those eyes or became visible upon his
                  features; but the same unvarying equanimity ever rested there, as if he had been a
                  marble statue. Yet you could not have failed to trace the lines of deep thought on
                  his somber face; thoughts absent from surrounding circumstances, and might best be
                  imagined by supposing him in a reverie.
               It was about twelve o'clock when the captain and Bolivar drove up to the village
                  hotel and ordered dinner. The buggy and horse were put up, and after Bolivar had
                  thoroughly brushed and dusted his master, who retired to a room to dress, he went
                  to the kitchen and took his seat by the side of the door. From the neatness and
                  quality of his dress the servants of the hotel judged him to be a negro of no
                  little importance. But Bolivar was too smart to suffer his appearance to make him
                  act in a cold or reserved manner. He had a work to perform; and though the captain
                  had ordered him to keep quiet, Bolivar determined to disobey orders, and after he
                  had gained his point to inform the captain how matters stood. It was not long
                  before he was in conversation with the servants, who were asking him no small
                  number of questions. These he answered with so much skill that one, who had been
                  standing near, would more than likely have concluded the captain a very prince in
                  wealth and a saint in righteousness.
               He represented the captain as immensely wealthy, and merely looking round for a
                  lady who would make him a good wife. This the servants heard with apparent
                  satisfaction; the women, no doubt, hoping to make a conquest of Bolivar, and
                  perhaps the men thought his purse might furnish them a few unusual luxuries. Be
                  this as it may, it is certain that in the dusk of the evening Bolivar and Jenny,
                  one of the servant-girls, might have been seen standing under the shade of a tree
                  where the following conversation took place:
               
               "You tink den," said Bolivar, "dat Miss 'Liza White be de girl for my massa to
                  marry?"
               "Well, sir, I am sure he can get her; and she is, if I may judge, not only the
                  prettiest girl in all this neighborhood, beside the wealthiest. But as she has
                  many beaux, it may be rather difficult to get the captain properly initiated into
                  her good graces. Though she is very much changed in the last eight months; for she
                  does not visit so much, nor does she look so bright and lively as she formerly
                  did."
               "Wat you 'spose be de cause, Jinny?"
               "There are various opinions; some say she is in love; but I think it more than
                  likely that it is because she is opposed in love, or because her
                  parents have long tried to make her marry a man whom she despises."
               "Wat be dat man's name?"
               The conversation was interrupted by a bell, which rung for Jenny at this moment,
                  and Bolivar returned to the kitchen.
               The captain was pacing his room floor apparently wrapped in deep study. Seating
                  himself by the window, he gazed on the villagers who were passing to and fro, till
                  it was too dark to distinguish either the features or color of the passers. The
                  bells were ringing for church, and though the captain seldom visited such places,
                  he took his hat and went into the street—thence to church.
               In a small village like ——, a stranger was noticed even in the street, and when
                  the captain entered the church all eyes were turned upon him, for he was a
                  fine-looking gentleman. The girls were soon seen asking who he was; but of all
                  that multitude only one seemed to attract his attention. She seemed
                  less curious than the rest, as he had noticed nothing like a disposition, on her
                  part, to know who he was; in fact, she had barely noticed him.
               While the captain was at church Bolivar might have been seen standing near the
                  gate of a fine brick mansion, nearly half a mile from the village hotel, talking
                  to a bright mulatto boy. What he was doing or saying could not be known; but he
                  was seen to put his hand in his pocket and then slip a piece of gold into the hand
                  of the boy, saying, as he turned to leave him:
               "Sam, be de boy ob sense you ort to be, and you make much money out ob me. Does
                  you hear?"
               "Yes, sir, I will be all straight, I'm bound. You shall see Margaret to-morrow
                  night at the hotel."
               And they separated.
               When the captain left the church a picture of the cold, indifferent girl seemed
                  painted on his memory. He went to his room to reflect and there too her image
                  still haunted him. That night the captain's head was full of dreams—the heroines
                  of all being the cold, indifferent girl.
               
               At the breakfast table, next morning, he entered into conversation with the
                  landlord, who, like him, had slept till every one else had gone from the table.
                  The conversation was pleasant to both, and they became at once prepossessed in
                  each other's favor. That day, at ten o'clock, the captain was conducted to the
                  parlor and introduced, by his landlord, to the family of the house, whom he found
                  to be very agreeable people. The captain had resolved to inquire who the girl he
                  had noticed in church was, but as several ladies called, he was compelled to defer
                  it till another time.
               That night Bolivar sat in the kitchen conversing with a servant-girl named
                  Margaret; what that conversation was, could not be heard, as they spoke too low;
                  but from the looks, cast at him by the other girls who belonged to the house, one
                  could see they were already jealous of Margaret, and believed him to be making
                  love to her. So he might have been; but we think Bolivar thought too much about
                  black Susy, whom we left in a certain cave in the Old Dominion, to be making love
                  to a girl in Kentucky.
               About eleven o'clock that night, Bolivar and Margaret left the kitchen of the
                  hotel and started out of the town. It is needless to say that they entered the
                  gate and took up the avenue leading to the brick mansion. As the clock in the
                  village struck twelve he was seen standing near a cedar, talking to a fair lady
                  dressed in a black gown. They spoke too low to furnish any clue to the
                  conversation, but as the clock struck one, she moved off a step, then turning
                  suddenly to him, she handed him a ring set with a rich diamond, and on it were two
                  names.
               The next morning, after breakfast, the captain was seated in the parlor, talking to the lady of the house and her
                  two daughters, when the hall bell rung, and a lady was ushered in.
               "Miss White, let me introduce Captain Bell!" said the lady of the house, after
                  Miss White had spoken to, and kissed the two Misses N——, she bowed and took a
                  seat. In a few moments the ladies and the captain were engaged in a fashionable
                  conversation, but yet any looker-on might have seen that the captain, was very
                  closely observing the lady whom he now knew to be Eliza White.
               
               In the afternoon, as he and the landlord were standing before the door of the
                  hotel, an elderly gentleman, of aristocratic air, alighted from his horse, and
                  hitching him, walked up to the landlord, and after the usual salutation, was
                  introduced to the captain as Major White. The three gentlemen took seats and spent
                  the evening in discussing the politics of the day. The captain and Major White did
                  most of the talking; nor did the latter leave without extracting from the captain
                  a promise to dine with him next day. Suffice it to say, it was complied with, and
                  for the remainder of the time he remained in the village, the brick
                     mansion was a favorite resort.
               Several nights before the captain and Bolivar left for the Valley of Genreva, the
                  latter might have been seen standing near the cedar, talking to a white lady, and
                  the last time, he received from her hands a package. As she turned
                  from him to regain her chamber, the old African fell on his knees and raised his
                  eyes to heaven as if in prayer.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               THE RETURN.
               "'LASKA," said Count Rollin, "I believe this is the eighteenth day since the
                  captain started, is it not?"
               "Yes, sir, and I hope he will soon be here."
               "Well, if he should come and make an ungratifying report, you will have wished him
                  more tardy in his return. But the suspense, 'Laska, in which you are, must be very
                  annoying; it is somewhat so to me," said the Count, as he rung the bell for a
                  servant.
               The servant-girl, Polly, soon made her appearance and asked what "old massa"
                  wanted?
               "I wish you to tell Bolivar to have the bath prepared for me," said the Count,
                  "for I am feverish, and have no doubt but it would do me good."
               Adalaska was pale as death when he heard his grandpa call for Bolivar, for the
                  count did not imagine he had accompanied the captain; but nerving himself, he
                  quickly said:
               "Grandpa, I think, Bolivar is out in the valley forest gathering some flowers; but
                  Tom is here—can he not prepare the bath?"
               "O, yes, yes! either will do."
               The negro, Tom, soon made his appearance, and announced the bath ready for his old
                  master. While he is engaged with the operation of bathing, we will take a peep
                  into another room and listen to the conversation of two sisters and a brother.
               These girls looked so much alike that you would not fail to recognize them as
                     twin sisters. Lenna was all that heart could wish for in the way
                  of amiability, while Mattino possessed a temper, which sometimes broke over the
                  bounds of submission, and she took great pleasure in teasing her sister and
                  Massoa. She was in everybody's way if there was a chance for fun. But lately there
                  was one subject which, if introduced even in her moments of excited merriment,
                  never failed to spread a calm over her turbulent spirits. As they now sat
                  conversing upon this very topic, one could hardly believe that her spirits ever
                  rose to the laughing-point. Lenna looked at Gasper and said:
               "Brother, I suppose you too have learned to love, for I notice, of late, that you
                  take great pleasure in sitting with Massoa?"
               "Yes, sister Lenna, I must admit that I love Massoa, and flatter myself that her
                  young and pure heart beats in unison with my own; for her acts of kindness and the
                  gentleness of her voice, when she speaks to me, are too plain to be mistaken."
               "But," said Mattino, sighing, "why need we love, since father declares no one of
                  us shall marry till Adalaska shall have become master of the cave by becoming the husband of a
                  woman worthy of his hand?"
               "Ah! Mattino," said Lenna, "we only make ourselves more pure by loving. You love
                  Alick and know that he loves you. Why should you wish to be more happy, since you
                  have him ever with you? All feel it to be their duty to see Adalaska first
                  married; and since it is father's will, we should be contented to wait that
                  event."
               "I admit all that," said Gasper; "but I fear 'Laska is so slow in choosing him a
                  wife, that we shall all become impatient for the event of his marriage. As for me
                  and Massoa, however, we are the youngest lovers in the company, and shall, of
                  course, complain less than the rest of you."
               "No, no, brother," said Lenna, "you have never heard me complain of not being
                  allowed by my father to marry, for even if he were to urge it upon me, I should
                  ask to see Adalaska first made happy. You both know that it is through him we
                  possess this home, for long since, father has made him deeds to it upon condition
                  he should marry and use the valley in a certain way. What that is I know not.
                  Maran and I have long loved, and father knows it; yet I have no reason to believe
                  a marriage with him would make me more happy than I now am. He is with me, and
                  since he could be no more were we married, I do not feel anxious to become his;
                  and still I will never belong to any one else."
               In another room Maran, Alick, and Massoa were engaged in the perusal of some old
                  manuscripts. What these were, or of what they treated, could not be seen, as the
                  three sat in a group looking on the papers which were spread on a small
                  center-table, around which they had seated themselves some two hours before.
               "Then, thank God," said Massoa, "we are not so mean of birth as I feared;" and she
                  kissed her two brothers, Maran and Alick. "Yes, brothers," she continued, "the
                  want of this knowledge has robbed me of many hours of quiet rest. But now, thank
                  God, I know we are as noble by birth as any in this home."
               It was plain now, that these papers contained the genealogy of the members of the
                  cave family. But we must return to the parlor in which sat the count, who had
                  finished his ablutions and was reading to Adalaska the eighteenth and nineteenth
                  verses of the fourth chapter of St. Luke's gospel and giving, at the same time,
                  his opinion of its import.
               "There are," said the old man, "few who have yet understood these two verses; or
                  if they understand them, they must certainly pay little attention to the express
                  ordinances of God, if we are to conclude that plain inferences may be ordinances,
                  when drawn from his word. But, my dear 'Laska, the day will come when
                  this valley, now owned by you, shall exemplify the true meaning
                  thereof, especially if you follow the laws which I have given you. These laws, my
                  son, are the same as those which govern John's golden city, as set forth in the
                  book of Revelations."
               At this instant the alarm-bell near the count's head rang. He sprang to his feet,
                  old as he was, and seized a sword. It had not been rung before in seven years, and
                  its peculiar sound fell so unexpectedly on the ears of the inmates of that
                  caverned home, that every one rushed to the parlor to inquire why the bell
                  rung.
               Adalaska and Maran gathered their belts in which were their pistols and swords,
                  and hurried forth to learn the cause of the alarm, and to prevent, if possible,
                  the entry of any but friends into that sacred home. Count Rollin had the swivel
                  heavily charged and ranged so as to sweep the passage. And there too stood those
                  fair girls, each with a light carbine in hand. A heavy piece of ordinance that had
                  been unnoticed by the captain, in his description of the place, was swung round so
                  as to rake the passage from the hall into the court. Another gun, of no small
                  caliber, was rigged and pointed to the passage from the court into the parlor. The
                  whole was arranged, and the anxious little band stood in breathless suspense
                  waiting the return of Adalaska and Maran. It would indeed be a hard task to
                  describe the faces, with their emotioned lineaments, so as to present a picture of
                  the same. In every face there were, however, two characteristics to be seen, viz:
                  absence of fear and resolution.
               A small bell rang, which was hung near the swivel, and a joyous ring of pleasure
                  echoed through the hall, as if such preparations for defense had not been made or
                  thought of. This bell signified "all's right."
               
               The door soon opened, and the captain was ushered in to be greeted by the inmates
                  of the cave. Lenna and the old man both took him by the hand, and perhaps showed
                  greater anxiety to hear his tale than the rest. Bolivar had passed through the
                  room in which they were assembled, and doffing his fine clothes, put on the
                  costume usually worn by him while at home. It is not to be supposed that Susy
                  could withstand the desire to see him when they had been so long separated. She
                  entered Bolivar's apartment and soon gave him such marks of joy as became her, and
                  was turning to gather up the clothes he had taken off, when Bolivar turned to her
                  and said:
               "Susy, take dis package and hide him safe till I call for him; you hear? I does
                  not wish it known dat it is here. It is for my massa 'Laska, so take good care on
                  him; will you Susy?"
               "I will take good care of it," she replied.
               Tom and Alick soon left to take care of the horses, and the captain went to his
                  room to shave and get on other linen. By the time this was arranged the
                  supper-bell was rung, and soon all were seated round the table. Count Rollin had
                  determined to hear the captain's opinion of Miss Eliza White before any one else.
                  So, as soon as supper was over, he asked the captain to walk to his room where
                  they might have a private interview. While they are thus engaged let us look into
                  another part of the cave. In a large room, richly furnished, in an arm chair, sat
                  a young man about twenty-seven years of age, gazing into the face of a swarthy
                  African whose conversation evidently interested him. It was Adalaska listening to
                  the tale of Bolivar; let us too listen and hear what they say.
               "Den, massa, I gin dat yellow boy, Sam, five dollar piece ob gold to bring her
                  chambermaid ober to de hotel, whar I could get a chance to talk to her. Dat night
                  she came ober and I went home wid her. Before I got to de gate, she promised me
                  she would do what I axed her, and we went into de yard. I took my stand by one of
                  dem big cedar trees; and waited 'bout fifteen minutes, when, sure 'nuff, dere was
                  de lady coming round de corner ob de house. She did not hesitate to come up to me.
                  But, massa, I felt feared for her to come, cause, you see, I tought her old fader
                  might come out and see us; den all would be spoiled."
               "But she came up close to you, did she, Bolivar?" asked Adalaska.
               'Yes, sir; she came up, and I told her all about why I was dere. She told me dat I
                  must come ebery night dat she might ax me any questions she tought 'bout in de
                  day. She told me, too, dat she would get acquainted wid de captain next day, so
                  dat he might go home and tell old massa Rollin all 'bout her."
               "God bless her!" said Adalaska; "I knew she was a dear, good, and true woman!"
               "Well, de next day, sure 'nuff, I seed her get out oo ner carriage, before de
                  hotel, and dat night massa captain told me he had seen and been introduced to her,
                  and dat he had got 'quainted wid her 'pa,' Major White and was to
                  take dinner wid him nex day.
               "I went dere, massa, ebery night for de seben days more we staid, and de fust
                  night she gave me dis ring for you, and de last night dis package, which, too, I
                  now deliber into your hands, and may dey both make you more happy!"
               "You are a true man, Bolivar, and so long as I live, I shall not fail to show you
                  that I think so."
               "Well, massa, 'spose you read dat letter out, so dat I may hear what de lady say,
                  and wheder old Bolivar's name be dare or not?"
               "Bolivar, I shall not refuse you a request, when I can so easily comply with
                  it."
               He kissed the ring, and putting it on the third finger of his righthand, opened
                  the letter and read as follows:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "———, KY., May 27th, 1841.
                              "MY DEAR AND DEVOTED ADALASKA:—
                           
                           "How strange are the incidents of life, and how little do we know what
                              a day or an hour may bring forth! Is not life a drama at best, and are
                              not all our cares the quintessence of old Solomon's 'vexation of
                              spirit?' I had anxiously expected your arrival in our village for
                              several days, when suddenly one night, at about eleven o'clock,
                              Margaret, my chambermaid, entered my room and handed me your note,
                              bearing date 12th of May. What passed between me and your servant, Bolivar, you can learn from
                              him. He will deliver you a ring, bearing the coat of arms of my
                              family, and my own, and your name. This I wish you to wear and never
                              suffer it to be taken from your hand by any one but me.
                           "O, my dear Adalaska! could I but picture to you the miseries I am
                              daily suffering, how soon you would be with me! But as you are far
                              from me, and could not perhaps assist me, were you here, I shall be
                              content to bear my crosses, knowing that it is for you I suffer.
                           "Your second letter, as well as the first, was handed to my mother and
                              father, to be perused, as they contained nothing which would lead
                              either to think we had felt the least attachment for each other. When
                              your third came, its nature was such as to induce me to withhold it
                              from the view of every one but my sister, Sarah. I can only wish I had
                              not shown it to her, since she forgot the duty of a sister so far as
                              to inform my parents of its contents. A few days after, my father
                              received your letter, and gave me a severe lecture for allowing you to
                              write to me till I knew more of you.
                           "In your third letter, if you recollect, you gave me to understand
                              that you were a poor man, but yet able to support and care for me.
                              This, my sister was careful to inform my parents of, and which seems
                              to be the only reason they can urge why I should not marry you. I am
                              sorry that they think wealth and love inseparable, or that my sister
                              should so far forget the true nature of woman as to join them in
                              decrying a state into which we are subject to fall. My grandfather was
                              but a poor shoemaker, and how Sarah, with this fact before her, can
                              think herself better than others, who may chance to possess less of
                              the wealth of this world than she does, I am at a loss to perceive.
                              But, dear Adalaska, you do not wish me to furnish you a dissertation
                              upon this subject, at this time, at least. I, therefore, proceed to
                              detail my situation.
                           "Frequently my sister speaks of you before others, and especially
                              before father and mother. It is then that I feel the
                              blood mantling in my face. I love you too well to hear your name
                              decried; though I dare not defend you, for if I attempt it, I am
                              immediately told that I do not know you.
                           "You have a rival, dear Adalaska, and though I have once got on my
                              knees and begged him to cease visiting me, for even if I was forced to
                              marry him, I could never love him; still that insensible man will
                              visit me. How lost I should be were I to marry him, you can readily
                              see.
                           "My mother and father do all they can to make me marry him. If another
                              gentleman calls on me they never leave the parlor; but when he is here
                              they are never in it. On Monday last, I refused to come to the parlor
                              to see him, for which I was fastened in my room and fed on bread and
                              water two days; such treatment only makes me more determined to reject
                              every offer he may make me. I have promised to marry you, and if I am
                              not allowed to do so, I shall never marry any one. I know that I am a
                              pure and true woman. Yes! one of Kentucky's proudest
                                 daughters, and I again reiterate, that so long as there is
                              one pulse beating in my veins, that pulse will beat true to
                                 you!
                           
                           "Oh! that you could this moment be by my side to know all—to be loved
                              as you were never loved before; for though you are comparatively a
                              stranger, I know you are a gentleman, and as such, I have
                              ever spoken plainly to you.
                           "I shall wait in anxious expectation for your arrival. Then I can tell
                              you all—can tell you how my very life is a burden as things now are.
                              If I am not much mistaken my father and mother will relax from their
                              determined opposition when they see you and talk with you. Then might
                              we not be the happiest of earthly souls, and spend a life devoted to
                              the elevation of our race? Should you by accident fail to come within
                              two months, I shall go to a nunnery, for I cannot bear this life
                              longer. No tongue can tell what I pass through. I have seen and felt
                              adversity's heaviest strokes; and were it not for the hope I see in
                              you, I should despair and yield to a cruel fate. The harshness with
                              which I am treated and the coolness shown me by my parents, on your
                              account, have only tended to make me more devotedly attached to you.
                              The great God of nature has planted a congeniality in our souls, which
                              affiliates us, and why should we hesitate as to the course to be
                              pursued? Though the night is dim around us now, the light of hope will
                              break forth, at some future day, and scatter the dark clouds from over
                              us. O! my dear sir, let us earnestly pray for it. God, who is the
                              watcher of all our acts, and knows the motives by which we are
                              impelled, will not suffer us to be cast off altogether. Be true, and I
                              feel persuaded that there will come a time for us. Let
                              friends say what they will, I am determined on my course of action.
                              'What I was yesterday I am to-day.'
                           "If you can possibly do so, visit me immediately and let us talk this
                              matter over. We must be up and doing, and no longer trifle with an
                              affair on which our happiness depends, and on which my earthly
                              existence hangs; for I tell you, in all the candor of my heart, that
                              if I should be forced to
                              marry Mr. Delano I would commit suicide. You may think my woman's
                              nature would revolt at the thought; so it does, but I would not
                              hesitate to plant deep the fatal dagger in my breast if it should be
                              found the only liberator.
                           "If you cannot come, please, write me immediately, as you must know I
                              shall be miserable till I see you.
                           "In conclusion, let me wish you peace of mind, and may God give you
                              health and prosper our cause.
                           
                              "I remain ever affectionately and devotedly
                              "Yours,
                              "ELIZA WHITE."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "Massa 'Laska," said Bolivar, when Adalaska had finished reading the letter, "I
                  tell you dat lady be de one for you. I hope she be my missus yet, and den I will
                  be happy 'nuff."
               "Yes, Bolivar, I too hope she may be your mistress; and more, Bolivar, I shall
                  likely start day after to-morrow to see her, and as I shall take Gasper with me,
                  you will see that two horses are ready for us. I would take you along, but as you
                  are somewhat known there it might not answer so well. I shall not be many days in
                  forming the acquaintance of her family for I have a college-mate living near her—a
                  lawyer of eminence—who will introduce me, and I shall soon arrange the matter
                  either one way or the other."
               At this moment the count and the captain returned to the parlor; and Susy was sent
                  to find Adalaska. He soon stood before his grandfather, who was now seated in the
                  midst of all the members of his household except Bolivar and Tom. They were sent
                  for, and after they had entered the old count addressed them thus:
               "You all know, my children, that the captain has been on a mission of importance
                  to Adalaska and the result will, no doubt, be interesting to you who are so
                  closely bound to him. Miss Eliza White, an American girl of no ordinary mind and
                  no small prospects for a competence, is the lady to whom Adalaska is to be
                  married. Her standing in society is such as to render it necessary to be cautious
                  in our acts. The fate of this family depends upon the choice Adalaska may make in
                  a wife. I am satisfied that he may proceed and marry this lady, for from what the
                  captain says, she cannot be married by any one else.
               "'Laska, you will, therefore, provide yourself with funds and proceed to-morrow on
                  a visit to this lady. Get acquainted with the family and note well the mother, for
                  you will find, in a great majority of instances, that daughters inherit much of
                  their mother's character."
               To this Adalaska replied: "My dear grandpa, I could not feel that I had bestowed
                  the confidence on you that was due from the relation we bear to each other, if I
                  neglected to tell you that I sent Bolivar with the captain, and that he has
                  brought me a letter from Eliza which renders it necessary for me to act with
                  promptness and decision."
               He then related the manner in which old Bolivar had succeeded in getting an
                  interview with Eliza; after which he read the letter as it had been read to
                  Bolivar.
               The old count called up Bolivar, and as he knelt before his master, he uttered a
                  blessing on him for his fidelity. Count Rollin then continued:
               "Now, 'Laska, I think you had better prepare to be off early in the morning. Take
                  Gasper with you, that you may not be alone upon the charity of strangers, should
                  any accident befall you."
               Service was then performed by the count, and it can hardly be supposed, that every
                  heart in that little assembly of kneeling souls, did not offer a prayer for
                  Adalaska's success.
               Early the next morning, Adalaska and Gasper were on the route for Eliza's
                  residence; but they did not take the common route, via the Ohio river, as they
                  found as good time might be made by going across the country, through Cumberland
                  Gap, thence by Frankfort, etc.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               THE VISIT, ETC.
               IT was a pleasant afternoon early in June that a buggy was seen to enter through a
                  gate, before a large brick mansion near the quiet little village of ——,and two
                  gentlemen alighted from it. One of these
                  men looked to be about twenty-seven years of age. His features were regular, and
                  an indescribable sweetness was playing on his face. His dress was plain black
                  cloth, and though he was light and delicately framed, it was plain that he was not
                  an infant even in point of physical strength. His hair was long and curled with
                  much delicacy over his shoulders, while his eyes were of a deep blue and possessed
                  of more than ordinary vivacity. The other was a younger but larger man. His hair
                  was not so black yet it was dark; his skin was apparently as fair and tender as
                  that of a lady; his dress was of superior materials and made "a la mode;" his eyes
                  were also blue, and his fingers and hands so delicate that all might see he had
                  never been accustomed to work. He was manly in his bearing and struck the beholder
                  with feelings of respect from the moment he was first seen. These two men were
                  Adalaska and Gasper.
               They approached the mansion-door and rang the bell. Adalaska handed a card to the
                  servant-girl, requesting to have it given to Miss Eliza White. Soon the girl
                  returned and showed them into the parlor, where, in a moment, Eliza entered, and
                  throwing herself in the arms of Adalaska, wept tears of joy. The feelings of the
                  moment being suppressed, Gasper was introduced; he took up a book and was
                  apparently engaged in its perusal.
               In five minutes more they were on the way from the parlor to the buggy; for they
                  had called only to let Miss White know of their arrival. None of the family were
                  at home save Eliza, so that no embarrassment attended the visit. They put up at
                  the village hotel, and Adalaska was soon seated writing a note to his friend, the
                  college-mate, and now eminent lawyer, who lived also a short distance from the
                  village. When this was finished, he rang for a servant, by whom the note was
                  forwarded to the place of destination. In about two hours the lawyer came in and
                  seemed very glad to see Adalaska. After he was introduced to Gasper and the three
                  sat conversing some twenty minutes, Gasper rose and said he had some business in
                  the village. We shall follow him.
               He entered a bank, and bowing to the gentlemen standing around, asked if he could
                  get a check on the "Northern Bank of Kentucky" cashed.
               "Yes, sir:" said the cashier.
               'At what per cent.?" asked Gasper.
               'One-fourth," said the cashier.
               Gasper opened his pocket-book and drew out the check which he handed to the
                  cashier. The latter started back as if surprised, exclaiming:
               "No, sir, we cannot cash so large a check!"
               "What is the amount of that check?" asked a large gray-haired gentleman.
               "Twenty thousand dollars!" said the cashier, with an air as much as to say, the
                  like of this is seldom seen.
               "But," said Gasper, "I must have money to pay my way while I am stopping in your
                  village; now what is to be done?"
               "Have you no other funds?" asked the old gentleman.
               "Plenty," answered Gasper, "but if you cannot cash that, you will hardly be able
                  to change my bills."
               "O, yes!" said the cashier, "we can change bills of any size."
               By this time all the officers of the bank were gathered around Gasper to listen to
                  the conversation. As Gasper again took out his pocket-book all eyes were turned to
                  it in anxious expectation, for the officers had now begun to feel that possibly
                  they might not be able to even change a bill.
               "Here, sir, are two bills of equal size, you can change either you please; it
                  matters not which, I shall be much obliged."
               "What!" said the cashier, "two bills for twenty thousand pounds; one on the Bank
                  of England, the other of the same value on the Bank of France? No, sir, I tell you
                  we have not that much money in all our vaults, therefore we cannot change
                  them."
               Gasper put up the two notes and check, saying:
               "I am sorry it is so, for I have a friend with me who needs a few hundred dollars,
                  and I had promised to pay him as soon as I should arrive at this village. I know
                  he needs it, for I think, he intends remaining some time; and he had persuaded me
                  to do the same, but in this case, we will be compelled to return."
               "No, no!" said the old gentleman, who, more than likely, was thinking what a
                  clever son-in-law he would make; "you need not think of leaving our village on that account, for
                  more than likely, I can supply you with such money as you may want."
               "I should be obliged to you," said Gasper, "but I must know to whom I am indebted
                  for so much kindness before I can accept the offer."
               "I am James White."
               "Ah! Major White! I think my friend is acquainted with you or some of
                  your family. I am Gasper R——, and will be happy to have you call on me at N——'s
                  hotel, to-morrow morning, at ten o'clock."
               "I will certainly do so," said the major, "and furnish you as much funds as you
                  may need."
               They parted, after walking down the street until opposite the hotel; the major to
                  his "brick mansion," and Gasper to his room, where he found Mr. G——, the lawyer
                  and Adalaska in close conversation. When they had ceased, Gasper detailed his
                  adventure, and gave his reasons for doing so. Said he:
               "I am well enough acquainted with the world to know that money has its influence
                  everywhere, and I was determined to so arrange matters that my society would be
                  sought after, thereby giving Adalaska an opportunity of often seeing and being
                  alone with Eliza, which could not otherwise occur."
               Mr. G—— replied to this, saying: "I think, 'Laska, Gasper is right; and I think it
                  more than likely, you will both dine with the major to-morrow."
               "I hope so," said Adalaska, his face brightening with a smile.
               We will leave Adalaska, Gasper, and the lawyer in conversation, and listen to what
                  is going forward in Major White's mansion.
               Eliza was sitting in an arm-chair, in the parlor, wrapped in a revery of thought.
                  She had been sitting there for two hours, nor did she notice the entrance of her
                  mother and sister, Sarah, who had returned from a visit to one of the wealthy
                  families in the neighborhood.
               "What is the matter, Eliza?" said Mrs. White, after she had taken off her bonnet
                  and handed it to Margaret, Eliza's chambermaid.
               "I do not know, mother, unless I am thinking of the gentlemen who called and left
                  cards for me, this evening;" for Eliza saw the necessity of keeping her affairs to
                  herself in the future, and did not therefore say who visited her.
               "Well, who were they, Eliza?" asked her sister, Sarah, who, it will be
                  recollected, was about twenty-four years of age.
               "One was Adalaska ——, the man whom I love! the other is his friend, I suppose; but
                  I know no more of him."
               About this time Major White entered the parlor when Sarah said:
               "Father, what do you think! that Virginia vagabond, who has been writing to sister
                  for the last eight months, has been here this evening and left his card for Eliza.
                  Impudent fellow!" and she drew herself up indignantly.
               Eliza almost fainted at such harsh words, thrown to one so dear. As soon as she
                  was composed, Major White said:
               "Eliza I must positively forbid that man to enter my house. You shall not marry a
                  man, who says himself that he must depend upon his own exertions to give you food
                  and raiment."
               To this Eliza made no reply, for she was too full to speak. The silent tears,
                  which were falling fast upon her pale cheek told how deeply she felt the force of
                  the stern command of her father.
               "And, father," said Sarah, "there was a man with him—what was his name,
                  Eliza?"
               "There is his card, see for yourselves," said Eliza, as she handed the card to her
                  sister, Sarah, who read 
                     "GASPER R——, "VA."
                  
               
               "What 's that?" said the major. "Gasper R——"
               "Yes, father, that is the name."
               "Well, he is no vagabond, I can tell you," said the
                  major, who then related the adventure at the bank. Eliza's face brightened with
                  pleasurable emotions at the prospect of having the sentence, which had been passed
                  by her father, commuted; while Sarah's face was crimson with shame, for she saw
                  she had said too much.
               The old lady and Sarah were now more than anxious to have the
                     millionaire invited to dine with them on the following day.
               
               "Father," said Sarah, "do go in, early in the morning, and invite him to dine with
                  us."
               "If I should do so, I, of course, would be compelled to invite this Mr. Adalaska
                  also."
               "Well, father," replied Eliza, "why not do so? why should you be prejudiced
                  against a man whom you have never seen, and whose only fault is his poverty?"
               "Upon this condition I will invite him to see you," answered her father, "viz: you
                  are not to engage yourself to him."
               "My heart is his now, father, and I can never give him any farther
                  proofs of my love."
               "Then I shall invite them to-morrow and if you are smart, one of you will make a
                  conquest of Mr. R., for 'tis not often we meet men who carry upon their persons
                  two hundred and twenty thousand dollars."
               Eliza saw in a moment that Sarah would be wholly occupied in trying to get Gasper
                  to make love to her, thus affording herself and Adalaska an opportunity to
                  converse with more ease and not be so closely watched. She therefore resolved to
                  please her sister in not dressing so fine as she usually did, and explain to
                  Adalaska why she did not. For Eliza dressed with more taste and elegance than any
                  of the daughters of her neighbors; nor had this failed to arouse a spirit of
                  dislike in some of her female friends who did not like to be outdone. Her sister,
                  Sarah, had often shown this spirit and derided her sister for her old
                  maidishness.
               The following morning at ten o'clock, Major White called on Gasper and was
                  formally introduced to Adalaska. His eyes could not stand the calm, dignified look
                  of Adalaska, and no doubt, the old fellow would have been glad to have escaped.
                  Adalaska spoke freely and exhibited so much independence, that Gasper feared he
                  was carrying the thing too far. After sitting some half an hour, the old major
                  pulled out his pocket-book to furnish Gasper with what money he might need. As
                  soon as Gasper saw it, he said to him:
               "Major, I am very much obliged to you, but I think it likely my friend has
                     gold enough to answer our purposes while we remain, and of course,
                  I can get from him; but if we should fall short I will then call on you. But
                  believe, sir, that I feel as much obliged as if I needed and had taken the money
                  this morning."
               Major White then gave them a pressing invitation to dine with him at three
                  o'clock, saying he would send his carriage for them. This was, of course,
                  accepted.
               It would be useless to attempt to describe the various stratagems of Sarah White,
                  and her mother and father to rouse up in the bosom of Gasper a spark of love. They
                  had too, to all appearances, succeeded; for Gasper saw how he could serve Adalaska
                  by putting on the appearance of love. Eliza told Sarah that Adalaska had told her
                  how much Gasper thought of her, and that he soon intended to make propositions to
                  her. Sarah communicated this to her parents who spared no pains to throw them
                  together as much as possible. Things passed on thus for some ten days; the
                  gentlemen being often at a distance from home with the ladies. Adalaska had acted
                  so independently that the old people did not know what he meant. Mr. Delano, his
                  rival, had, in the meantime, seen how matters were likely to terminate, and
                  accordingly made proposals of marriage to the father and mother of Eliza. He
                  painted in vivid colors the miseries of poverty, all of which Eliza would have to
                  suffer if she married Adalaska. So well did he argue his point that he gained the
                  consent of the parents to a union with Eliza. The following evening, after Mr.
                  Delano had extracted this promise from the major and his lady, Eliza was walking
                  in the yard when suddenly Mr. Delano appeared before her and told her the decision
                  of her parents.
               "I have," said he, "placed fifty thousand dollars in the hands of your father as
                  the amount I will settle upon you. You can never marry Mr. Adalaska,
                  and if you were to do so, you would soon starve; for he is not worth five hundred
                  dollars."
               "Leave me, sir, this moment," said Eliza indignantly, "for I never will be yours;
                  I belong to another, and if you dare to speak to me again I will make him cut off
                  your ears. If you had the heart of a man in you, you would scorn to attempt to
                  force me into a marriage with you. I have suffered already more at your hands than
                  any woman should bear; so I tell you once more, leave me and never let me behold
                  your face again."
               
               Delano was a powerful man, and from a carriage that stood near the gate, it might
                  have been conceived that he meditated kidnapping her and forcing her to yield to
                  his will. But near Eliza, behind a cedar tree, stood a man—that man was
                  Adalaska—who had heard the conversation. His hand was laid on the handle of a
                  sword as he stood waiting the moment when it would be necessary for him to
                  act.
               To Eliza's rebuke Delano replied:
               "You may talk as you please, but you are mine! as I have your
                  father's receipt for fifty thousand dollars to be returned in case I do not marry
                  you; and as he has already given me up the money without getting his receipt, I
                  will reduce the whole pack of you to beggary, if you dare refuse to marry me!"
               "I do refuse! reduce us to beggary if you like; but I will never
                  marry you while I have it in my power to speak!"
               She had barely finished this sentence, when Delano sprang forward and seized her
                  around the waist. Nor had he more than seized her before the bright
                  blade of a sword fell on his head, and he lay weltering in his own blood
               "Spare him, dear Adalska!" said Eliza, "for I do not wish your hands to be dyed in
                  human blood."
               "Yes, poor wretch, I will spare him, for he is not a man," replied Adalaska, as
                  Delano rose to his feet and hurried out to the carriage which he had prepared to
                  convey Eliza beyond the reach of rescue.
               "Give me your two pistols," said Eliza; "I will go to my room and defy any one to
                  enter it till you are allowed to do so. Margaret, my chambermaid, will watch when
                  I am asleep. Hurry you, to-morrow morning, to make your exit from this place, for
                  Delano will pursue you with the officers of the law, and I know his black heart
                  will know no mercy, should you fall into his hands."
               "Eliza, I shall go to-morrow morning, by day-light, to Louisville and wait for
                  Gasper. Here is a purse containing jewelry and gold to the amount of five thousand
                  dollars; should it be necessary, use it all. On the twentieth of September,
                     at twelve o'clock, I will enter your room and take you to a home of
                  peace. Should
                     Attempted abduction—Rescue by Adalaska; page 62.
                  
                   I not be able to enter your room, or be
                  sick so that I could not come, some of my men will, and you may know
                  them by our watchword, which is Genreva. Whoever uses this word is
                  sure to know all about us, and you need not hesitate to place yourself in their
                  hands."
               Handing her the pistols and purse, Adalaska pressed her to his heart, and printing
                  one deep and burning kiss upon her lips, he left her.
               The next morning Adalaska left the village by daylight for Louisville, where the
                  horses were. About seven o'clock a sheriff made his appearance at the door of the
                  hotel saying, he had a writ for his apprehension. Gasper asked what was his
                  offense; to which the sheriff replied:
               "Why, sir, he assaulted and dreadfully wounded a gentleman on the turnpike last
                  night, and no doubt would have killed him if it had not been for the
                  carriage-driver."
               "Then, by all means, he should be brought to justice," said Gasper, affecting a
                  total indifference in the matter.
               Soon after breakfast, when the sheriff had left, Gasper sent to the livery-stable
                  for a buggy. In a few moments he was on his way to the "brick mansion." When he
                  entered, Miss Sarah was all affability, and from appearances, nothing had occurred
                  to mar her piece of mind. When Gasper had seated himself, he asked after Eliza and
                  expressed a wish to see her. Sarah rang the bell and soon Margaret was in the
                  room.
               "Margaret," said Sarah, "go to sister Eliza's chamber, and say to her that Mr. R——
                  is in the parlor and wishes to see her."
               The girl left, but in a few moments returned with a note to this effect:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "GASPER:
                           
                           "I, by a cruel fate, am compelled to keep my room because I refuse to
                              marry Mr. Delano. Tell Adalaska I shall admit no one to my room but my
                              servant-girl, but I am his,
                           
                              "And his only,
                              "ELIZA WHITE."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Gasper read the note with affected surprise, and put it in his pocket. He then
                  asked Miss Sarah if he could have the pleasure of her father's and mother's
                  company, in the parlor, for a few minutes, as he wished to speak to them on
                  matters of great importance. Sarah, thinking that it was to ask her hand in
                  marriage, told him she would go for them. In a short time Margaret, the
                  chambermaid, stepped in the parlor and Gasper was heard to say:
               "Margaret, tell Eliza to be firm and wait for the day. True hearts
                  and stout arms will set her free in due time." And he gave her a large gold coin,
                  saying: "take this, much more shall be yours if you but be true."
               "You shall see, sir, that I love and will obey my mistress as long as it is in my
                  power to so do. When I can no longer do so, I will let Mr. G—— (the lawyer) know,
                  so that Master Adalaska may be informed how matters stand."
               She had hardly ceased speaking when both Major White and his lady appeared in the
                  parlor, each clothed in the smiles of anticipation; for they supposed Gasper
                  intended to ask for Sarah in marriage. The following conversation took place.
               
                  Gasper.
                  —"Major White I have requested to see you in the parlor because I had an
                     important subject to broach to you."
               
               
                  Mrs. White.
                  —"Ah! Mr. R——, we understand you, and if you really desire to speak to us of
                     the matter now, I think I may tell you, that since I regard you as a gentleman,
                     you shall not have your wishes denied through any caprice of mine."
               
               
                  Major W.
                  —"I presume you would speak to us relative to a marriage with my daughter,
                     Sarah?"
               
               
                  Gasper.
                  —"Yes, sir, and something else, too, before I have done—but perhaps I had
                     better mention the last, first. So tell me, sir, why you desire to marry Eliza
                     to a man whom she must ever despise? and what objection you can have to
                     Adalaska?"
               
               
                  Major W.
                  —"As to the first, I can only say, I have never tried to force my daughter to
                     marry Mr. Delano; for I suppose, you refer to him, and I object to a child of
                     mine marrying a man too poor to support her."
               
               
                  Gasper.
                  —"But, sir, have you not given your daughter to Mr. Delano?"
               
               
                  Major W.
                  —"No, sir, I hope she is old enough to judge for herself and see where her
                     interest lies. I admit I would much prefer to see her united to the wealthy Mr.
                     Delano, than a poor
                     
                     Virginian, who says himself, that he must depend on his own
                     exertions to make her a living."
               
               
                  Gasper.
                  —"Well, Major, I know all about this matter; know that your daughter is in a
                     room from which she will never come alive unless to marry Adalaska. It is true,
                     he is a poor man, but he has talent and a soul which would prove a congenial
                     spirit for Eliza; and I will add, that I shall watch over that girl myself, and
                     if you suffer harm to fall to her you must abide the consequences."
               
               
                  Mrs. White.
                  —"Mr. R——, is this for what we are here?"
               
               
                  Gasper.
                  —"No, madam; I wish to speak of Sarah and myself. I have a proposition to make
                     to you, and since I have learned your estimation of men and wealth I may as
                     well tell you of my proposition. Now, sir, I have gained your daughter's
                     consent to a union and wish to know if you will make her dower large enough to
                     make her my equal, and then give me your consent to her marriage?"
               
               
                  Major W.
                  —"I will give you my consent, but tell me what amount of dower you demand?"
               
               
                  Gasper.
                  —"As we should always marry our equals, both in wealth and standing, I think it
                     but reasonable to demand two hundred thousand dollars!"
               
               
                  Major W.
                  —"I am not worth so much, and since you are rich enough I think you should not
                     demand more than twenty thousand dollars."
               
               
                  Gasper.
                  —"The difference, sir, between my wealth and your daughter's would be far more
                     disproportionate than that between Adalaska's and Eliza's, yet you will not
                     suffer them to marry. Furnish the two hundred thousand and I will marry her;
                     not otherwise will I be your son-in-law."
               
               The major sat down in a chair as quick as if he had been shot; Mrs. White drew
                  some long sighs, and Sarah fairly wrung her hands with despair and disappointment.
                  Gasper took up his hat and started, remarking:
               "But for the estimation in which you hold gold, I should not have demanded so
                  large a sum. I shall wait for your answer at the hotel"
               He well knew no answer could come, as the major was not worth that sum; so he
                  proceeded immediately to Louisville, where he joined Adalaska. The two immediately
                  set off for their home in the valley of Genreva, whither too we will go and look
                  into that quiet home, where peace and tranquillity reign undisturbed.
            
            
               CHAPTER VII.
               THE ARGUMENT AND PROPHESY.
               "Oh, DEAR me!" said Lenna, "I am so impatient for Adalaska and Gasper to return; I
                  can do nothing as I should! why I am so much troubled about their absence I cannot
                  say, but it does seem that some fatality has ever hovered around those of our
                  blood."
               "That may be," said Mattino, "but we are more apt to notice our adversities, from
                  the peculiar circumstances that surround us, than others differently
                  circumstanced. That some fatality has attended our family I will not deny; but at
                  the same time, I am ready to believe that fate is something pretty much in our own
                  hands; and if it so occurs that we invariably make miscarriages in our plans, I am
                  only the more convinced that it was the result of a want of proper energy."
               "Ah, sister!" said Lenna, "you know that misfortune has placed us where we are;
                  and you equally well know that no want of energy has ever exhibited itself in any
                  branch of our family. Indeed nothing but the most persevering and unlimited energy
                  could possibly secure us from those who have ever sought to crush our immortal
                  souls in our mortal bodies—to rob us of our wealth and birthright. Look around
                  you, my dear sister, and ask yourself if you can anywhere, in all this beautiful
                  place, see anything which does not speak out energy of the most exalted character.
                  You know the history of our family, and you know that any but ours must have
                  fallen victims to the caprices and selfishness of those whose interests would be
                  best and most easily secured by our deaths. Do you know that the peace and
                  tranquillity of all Europe depend upon
                  our acts? Yea, I may add even of America—the beautiful land of our adoption! For,
                  but let our existence be known and all Europe would sound the alarm! The tocsin
                  would awake the lethargic nations of Europe, who imagine my father dead, and cause
                  to blaze from the heart of France such a flame as would light up the shores of
                  both continents; that would stop commerce and navigation and bring incalculable
                  misery upon the world! No, no, sister! say not that inergetic blood has ever
                  swelled the ventricles of our hearts—say not that he who could raise himself from
                  obscurity, build his own throne, found his own empire, and make all the monarchs
                  of earth tremble, ever begot a son wanting in energy."
               As Lenna finished speaking, she stood a moment motionless, her proud form speaking
                  a majesty of soul and an independence of mind never to be effaced from the memory,
                  and a demonstrative corroboration of what she had just said. Mattino made no
                  reply, for when Lenna suffered herself to be the victim of her imagination she
                  often seemed possessed of superhuman intelligence and would make such prophesies
                  of things hidden deep in the womb of the future, that every member of the count's
                  household stood in awe of her words when in this state. Unfortunately for Lenna
                  who endeavored to avoid any excitement which might throw her into that state, she
                  had gone past the point of common rationality and now stood viewing, with her
                  internal perception, the chart of the future. She became still, her muscles
                  contracted, her eyes took on that leadenness you see when the soul has flown from
                  the body—she was a living statue. Mattino stood and gazed on her pale face with
                  horror; but a moment before, every lineament of that countenance spoke out
                  intelligence of the highest order, now it semed that death was written in its
                  place. Her lips quivered, her eyes brightened, her muscles partially relaxed, and
                  she spoke. These are the words—mark them well!
               "Who know so well thy ways, O, God, as they who fear and serve thee! Could mankind
                  but see and know, how very different would they act. There, one is plotting for
                  his brother's blood—there another, for his father's purse—there another, for
                  woman's honor! Trick and intrigue are everywhere—even in this land, consecrated by
                  the blood of seven years' revolution, with the name of a Washington, and baptized
                  in the tears of those whose bitter fates have wrung their souls—here, even here!
                  the plotter is at work. But the day is coming, rapidly coming, when the secrets of
                  all hearts shall be made known; then man will rise and swear, by heaven! that
                  religion shall no longer be hidden in the lump of gold and titled scroll. Jesus
                  Christ, the master, will soon be known, not as he has been, the Saviour of the
                  few, but the Saviour of every man. Religion will soon be taught and
                  practiced. Man will affiliate himself to God and the Millennium will be here. The
                  steps are taken, the foundation laid, and its practicability is here demonstrated.
                  Kings have had their day. The blood of my house, though royal itself, must flow in
                  the veins of him who shall rise with the sword of the Lord in his hand, and lead
                  the organized host to the field, not to battle against their brothers and sisters
                  who do the labor of the world, but against the tyrant and his servants who sell
                  their birthright for a mess of pottage. All Europe is trembling at the result, and
                  well she may; for her masses shall rise as one man and destroy the oppressor. Asia
                  is ripe for the law of the Lord as soon as the clouds of mysticism shall be
                  removed and the light of the Master be suffered to shine, in its pristine glory,
                  over the fair gardens of oriental lands. From this home of ours—from this American
                  country, the deliverer must go forth to accomplish what Christopher Columbus began
                  but could not then finish. Universal peace and universal love
                     must prevail; but first the earth must be clothed in red."
               And she sank exhausted upon the floor. In a moment she recovered and was soon
                  herself again.
               "Sister," said she, "have I been asleep? I feel very dull.
               "Yes, dear, you took a short nap," said Mattino, who knew well how much Lenna
                  would hate to know she had been to the spirit land. She could never be made
                  sensible of her condition when awake, but would frequently say she had been
                  dreaming. It was also noticed that when she spoke during these periods of
                  translucency, she seldom could tell anything of her dream; but when she remained
                  silent she would frequently tell what she dreamed, as she styled it, but which was perhaps nothing more
                  than the renewed thoughts of her internal perception.
               It was some moments before either Mattino or Lenna spoke more, each seeming to be
                  wrapped in a revery, little less superhuman than Lenna's psychological lucidity.
                  Nor can it be told how long this revery might have existed on the minds of these
                  sweet girls, if Massoa had not come into the parlor, sobbing as though some one
                  had been scolding her. She walked up to Lenna and Mattino who sat near each other,
                  and throwing her arms around their necks, kissed both again and again.
               "My dear Massoa, why do you weep?" said Lenna.
               "I know not," she replied, "but I am so unhappy since Gasper has been gone."
               She had never been separated so long from him since they had lived in the caverned
                  home, and to her young and devoted heart separation was little better than death.
                  Both Lenna and Mattino kissed her, and told her that he would soon be home again
                  and then she would forget his absence in her joy. At this moment the count and her
                  brothers, Maran and Alick, came in, and soon the captain, with old Bolivar in the
                  rear. Tom was attending to something in the cook-room where Susy and Polly
                  were.
               The conversation soon turned upon Adalaska and Gasper and their mission. It was
                  already time they had returned, and the count said if they did not arrive on the
                  morrow or that evening, Maran and Bolivar or Tom must start to meet them and see
                  if anything was the matter.
               Premising that all is well with them, we shall go back and look after Eliza White
                  and her tormentors.
               
               "You will not suffer me to enter then?" said Major White, as he stood at the door
                  of Eliza's chamber.
               "No, sir," she replied, "I am determined that if you enter this room, that you
                  shall do so to take hence a corpse. You see, sir, in my hands these pistols; I
                  know their use, and I swear, by him I love and by the God who gives me life, to
                  kill either myself or the first human being that enters my room, except Margaret,
                  till I hear a word you cannot utter. If you order me to quit your house, I will do
                  so; but only in the care of one who can and will protect me. If you think I am a
                  burden to you, demand my bill, I can pay for all I get and am willing to do so. To
                  my father and mother, I had hoped to be able to turn in the days of my trouble;
                  but no! my right, as a woman, to choose my own husband, is denied me, and you
                  would force me to marry him whom my soul detests. Hence, father, and let me not
                  see you again, till you can find one little vacant recess in your heart to have
                  infused a single speck of parental love. This may seem, sir, a strange resolve to
                  be made by so young a girl—so it is; but since a life in chains is not preferable
                  to a life in the midst of dungeon halls or in the depths of seclusion, I would not
                  hesitate to act. If therefore you regard your life or mine come not in that door.
                  I shall not trouble you, nor will I suffer myself to be troubled with any
                  one."
               "Eliza," said Major White, in answer to her, "you are acting too rashly."
               "Not so rashly, sir, as you did when you gave my happiness away for fifty thousand
                  dollars."
               "Who told you so?" asked the major.
               "I have it from good authority," she replied.
               "Do you believe this tale, Eliza?"
               "I certainly do, father; and since you have returned to Mr. Delano the money
                  without getting your receipt, and as I will not marry him, I guess you will find
                  yourself fifty thousand dollars worse off than if you had suffered me to marry
                  Adalaska."
               The major fairly bit his lips with rage, yet he knew too well Eliza to venture
                  into her room. He went down and sent up her mother to argue the point with her.
                  She too went back satisfied that nothing could be done with her.
               Day after day the lonely hours rolled off, and no one had dared to enter Eliza's
                  room. At length a light tap at her door caused her to spring forward to her table
                  on which lay her pistols, for she was ever near them and most generally had one of
                  them in her hand. Margaret went to the door and found it was Sarah. This was the
                  first time Sarah had visited Eliza since her seclusion—the cause, more than
                  likely, was her chagrin at being so fairly taken with her own weapons by Gasper.
                  As soon as the door was opened Sarah stepped in, when Eliza raised her pistol,
                  exclaiming:
               
               "Back, wretch, or you die!"
               Sarah gave one convulsive spring backward and was safe. She was a woman of nerve
                  and did not, as might have been expected, run screaming down stairs. Seeing
                  herself safe she thus addressed Eliza:
               "Sister, cousin Robert is in the parlor and desires to see you—what shall be
                  done?"
               "Show him to my door for I wish to see him myself, and desire no one to be present
                  but Margaret."
               Sarah was too proud to come out and tell Robert all about Eliza's confinement,
                  etc., and so conducted him to Eliza's room door. When they arrived at the door
                  Sarah said to her cousin Robert:
               "Cousin, you must stop at the door and talk to Eliza, for if you pass inside you
                  are a dead man."
               Before Robert, who was a stout, able-bodied man, could answer, the door was open
                  and Eliza was before him sitting in an easy-chair with a pistol in each hand.
               "In the name of heaven!" said Robert, "what does this demonstration of war mean,
                  my pretty cousin?"
               "Be silent and you shall know," said Eliza; "but move not nearer me. I have much
                  to say to you, Robert, but I must speak to you alone." Turning to Sarah, she said:
                  "Sister, will you oblige me by leaving myself and Robert alone for a few
                  moments?"
               Sarah made no answer, but hurried down stairs. She had hardly gone when Eliza gave
                  Robert, whom she had not seen for nearly a year, a full history of her treatment
                  since she received the first letter from Adalaska; and concluded by the following
                  request:
               "Now, cousin, you know why I am here, armed to defend myself and destroy my own
                  life—you can judge whether I am right or not? If I am, I desire you to remain in
                  this house till a few weeks shall have passed; I shall then be in this hands of
                  those whose swords will flash in my defense and for those I shall love and
                  commend. I make the request because Mr. Delano—that fiend in human shape—will,
                  more than likely, attempt to kidnap me and force me to marry him. You know, by
                  false witnesses, anything may be done. To save his fifty thousand dollars, my
                  father will, most likely, give him such assistance as he may need, and if I am
                  compelled to keep this eternal watch I may lose my health."
               "Eliza," said the noble Robert, "I swear to you that I will watch over you with a
                  brother's care, and defend you to the last extremity. Command me to do what you
                  will, I will obey."
               Robert, in due time, was informed of Adalaska's contemplated visit, when she
                  expected to be borne off to his home. She told him also of every circumstance
                  connected with Adalaska's last visit and concluded by saying:
               "Watch Delano and do not let Adalaska fall into his hands, for then all would be
                  lost."
               Eliza was more easy now, since she knew her cousin could protect her even from the
                  harshness of a father who had made gold the idol-god of his heart. Delano called
                  several times to see Eliza, but as soon as she knew he was about the house, she
                  invariably sent for Robert, who would come to her door, take a seat, and converse
                  or read for her till he left. Generally he held a long consultation with Major
                  White, and sometimes staid during the greater portion of the day. What these
                  conferences meant Eliza could not divine, unless it was to generate some new plan
                  by which Delano should get possession of her person. Robert became suspicious of
                  these secret conferences and determined to secretly listen to their plans. He did
                  so, and found that the foul deed of seizing Eliza, placing her in a carriage, and
                  conducting her into a neighboring State, where license was to be procured and a
                  marriage was to take place between Delano and a woman bribed for the occasion. The
                  witnesses were to swear that the woman was Eliza White. A looker-on might have
                  seen the manly face of Robert growing red with rage. But he determined to prevent
                  this, if possible, and inflict a sound drubbing upon the body of Delano.
               Robert had visited Major White's family without any preparation; hence his
                  wardrobe was getting short, and as he had also carried with him only what money he
                  needed to defray the expenses of a few days, he could not supply himself. He
                     mentioned the circumstance to Eliza,
                  who immediately handed him her purse and told him to use what he wanted—said
                  she:
               "This money is mine, given me by Adalaska to use as I please, and I know he would
                  be almost angry if I did not offer to so good a friend, as you are to us both, the
                  money you need."
               "I will use," replied Robert, "what I need, for if he is the man I believe he is,
                  he will thank me for serving you even at his expense."
               "Yes, Robert, I 'll venture you could get it if you met him a stranger, for his
                  heart is too good to refuse to any one a favor."
               In a few hours Robert had his wardrobe replenished and was waiting the arrival of
                  night, when Delano's plan was to be put into execution. Night arrived and Eliza
                  was sitting in her chair, reading a poem by Moore, while her pistols lay near.
                  Margaret was asleep, and all was still; yet near her door stood a man concealed in
                  a wardrobe in the passage—that man was Robert J——. Eliza's door was locked and no
                  entrance could be made except through it, for the windows were well fastened,
                  beside a ladder to reach them was not to be had. A tap, at the front door, was
                  answered by Major White in person. It was Delano, who had come to execute his
                  hellish design under the eyes of a parent whose heart was yet blacker than
                  Delano's.
               "Where is that cousin of yours?" asked Delano.
               "In his bed asleep," said Major White; and the two walked stealthily up the steps
                  of the stairway leading to Eliza's door. The major held in his hand a candle,
                  while Delano had a gag, a screwdriver to open the door, etc. They stopped and
                  began the work of opening the door; Robert, in the meantime, standing like a lion
                  ready to pounce on his prey. No sound was heard from within, and they imagined
                  that both Eliza and Margaret had watched themselves asleep.
               The hinge was removed and nothing remained but to shove the door open and step in.
                  The hand of Delano was laid on the pannel to accomplish this last task, when in an
                  instant, the iron grasp of Robert encircled his throat. Old Major White fairly
                  tumbled down stairs, as if he had been met by a specter. Robert did not relax his
                  hold, but leading Delano down stairs to the front door, drew from his pantaloons a
                  horsewhip and genteelly basted that gentleman till he bellowed and begged worse
                  than a school-boy. He ceased, and giving him to understand what would be the
                  result of another attempt of the kind, told him to take himself to some other
                  locality as soon as possible. As soon as Delano was out of Robert's hands, he was
                  seen making rapid headway for home, where in the solitude of his room, he might
                  hide his shame. Robert returned to Eliza's door, and fastening on the hinges,
                  retired to reflect on the incidents of the evening.
               Robert saw nothing of the major for several days, and most likely, would not, had
                  circumstances not conduced to throw them once more together. One morning, soon
                  after Mr. Delano's ejection from the house and the attending demonstrations of
                  ill-treatment, an officer appeared at the door and inquired if Mr. Robert J—— was
                  in the house. The major saw this would be his chance to get clear of Robert, and
                  answered no; but he expected him during the afternoon. As the officer turned from
                  the door, the major hurried up stairs to inform Robert that the sheriff was after
                  him, and that he had sent him away, saying that he would be in again in the
                  afternoon.
               "This," said the major, "I did in order to give you a chance to evade the law. You
                  know Mr. Delano, and must be as well convinced as I am, that he will go to the
                  utmost extent of the law."
               "Yes!" replied Robert, "I do know Mr. Delano, and I know him to be a cowardly
                  scoundrel. If he had possessed the feelings of a man, he would not have dared to
                  act to a lady as he has to Eliza; and let me tell you, major, I am well persuaded
                  that you are little better, for aiding him and fostering such hellish views as you
                  do in regard to Eliza. Send for your officer—I want to have an opportunity of
                  exposing you and your black conduct."
               The major made no reply, but went down stairs crimson with rage. As soon as he had
                  gone, Robert hastened to Eliza's door, and informing her of all that had
                  transpired, he asked her to give him a thousand dollars as he might need it to
                  bail himself from jail. She gave it to him and Robert left her for the parlor;
                     but not before he had extracted a
                  promise that she would be more vigilant, if possible, and hold out a few days
                  more.
               The officer came in during the evening, and Robert was taken before a magistrate
                  to answer the charges; but as Mr. Delano seemed too much indisposed to be conveyed
                  to court, the trial was postponed several days. Robert, in the meantime, was
                  guarded by the sheriff to whom he made all the facts known. Nor did the tale fail
                  to awaken a spirit of sympathy for the poor girl even in the iron bosom of the
                  officer. The trial was to take place on the Thursday following, and when it
                  arrived, Delano came forward and swore that he was peaceably leaving the house of
                  Major White, when he was accosted by Robert J——, who attempted to murder him. To
                  all this Robert made no reply. The magistrate bound Robert in a bond of one
                  thousand dollars to appear at the fall term of the circuit court and answer to the
                  charges, and in default of security being found he was to be committed to jail.
                  Delano had persuaded the major to absent himself, so that Robert could not call on
                  him to bail him, and by knowing no one else, he must go to jail. Robert looked
                  over the crowd in the court room, but not seeing a face he knew, he turned to the
                  magistrate and said:
               "Draw off my bond, sir, I have the guaranty with me. Here are the thousand
                  dollars, for the deposit of which I demand a receipt."
               Delano saw himself foiled, and without more ado, left the house. On his way
                  through the village he picked up a letter directed to Mr. G——, the lawyer. The
                  letter had been read by Mr. G—— and lost from his pocket. Any other man than
                  Delano would have given the letter up to Mr. G——, at once; but he took it to his
                  house where he opened and read to this effect:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              ROCHDALE, Sept. 12th, ——.
                              "DEAR SIR:
                           
                           "I shall be at your house on the night of the 19th Sept. The twentieth
                              I finish my labors in this part of Kentucky. Find out whether Delano
                              has dismissed the prosecution against me or not; and anything you can
                              of Eliza.
                           
                              Yours truly,
                              "ADALASKA."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Delano fairly danced with glee at his good fortune in finding this letter; he held
                  it up again and again, and would occasionally exclaim, "The nineteenth, I will be
                  there, and the twentieth I will finish my labors!" "Will you?" he would continue,
                  "we 'll see whether your labors are not finished to your sorrow. Ah! the villain,
                  I 'll have him at last!"
               Thus we leave the respective parties in Kentucky, and return to the cave in
                  Genreva.
               Adalaska and Gasper had returned the evening we left the family seated in the
                  parlor, after the visional picture of Lenna had been drawn. We must stop here a
                  few moments, and note the preparations which were going forward to the
                  accomplishment of Eliza's release and to render the twentieth of September ever
                  memorable.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               PREPARATIONS AND DEPARTURE.
               IT was the morning of the 12th September, 1842, that a solitary horseman was seen
                  entering through the defile (not the subterraneous passage) of the rocky
                  mountain-barrier surrounding the valley of Genreva. It was Captain Bell, who had
                  left the valley the day before to visit the town of Jeffersonsille—it may be to
                  hear from his own fair choice—or it may be that he had been to procure something
                  for those in the cave. He bore in his hand a canteen—it might be salt or it might
                  be powder—it looked like the latter. Several packages of papers were seen sticking
                  in his coat pockets, while his saddlebags were filled with something very heavy.
                  This was, as we afterward learned, slugs, chains, and lead. He carried also a
                  sword and a pair of Colt's revolving pistols. It would be useless to continue the
                  list of articles he had with him, for among them were several fancy articles for
                  the ladies. He did not now, as on a former occasion, stop to contemplate the scene
                  or listen to the rumbling sound of the subterraneous waterfall, which occasioned
                  the noise mentioned in the first chapter in this book but hurrying on, he was soon
                  at the circular area in which stood the monument before described. Tying his
                     horse, he walked up to one corner of
                  the monument and pressed a secret spring which rang a bell in the count's room.
                  Waiting about three minutes, he blew a small whistle, and the door, through which
                  he had first entered the cave, was opened, and Adalaska met him.
               When the captain arrived he found that the magazine had been thoroughly renovated,
                  the guns all cleaned, and newly charged. The swords, pistols and pikes were placed
                  in the rack, and a deep cave under the parlor floor opened. This cave was
                  connected with the upper one (the parlor) only by a small opening. This had been
                  carefully closed by a trap-door, and the rack containing the arms, placed on it.
                  It had been cleaned out and might be lighted with gas by a tube passing from above
                  into it. A pair of steps enabled one to descend into it; these might be removed by
                  those below, so that it would have been difficult for any one to have descended
                  into it. Here was to be the last retreat of the inmates provided they should be
                  unable to defend the upper rooms. There was, however, but little reason to suppose
                  its occupancy would ever be necessary, for the arrangements above were such as
                  almost to defy successful opposition. It was in this vault, if such it may be
                  termed, that the treasures of the count and his family were kept. The count
                  carried to the cave gold and jewelry to the amount of nearly a million dollars;
                  and by a circumstance, which will be hereafter made known, he had found large
                  quantities of gold in the cave, as one of the rooms was partitioned from another
                  by a rich quartz; and silver, together with precious stones, was found on the
                  margin of the subterranean creek before referred to. Thus was the wealth, and
                  consequently the moral and physical means of Count Rollin, almost unlimited.
               As much confidence as the count and his family had hitherto placed in the captain,
                  they did not till now tell him of the existence of this cave and its valuable
                  contents; but when they saw him entering so heartily into Adalaska's cause, they
                  felt it to be a moral duty.
               The following day had been set for Adalaska's departure, and as it seemed likely
                  to be rather a dangerous adventure the count determined that every male member of
                  his household, except Tom and the captain should accompany him. His list of
                  instructions were given again and again. Lenna in her lucid state had
                  said that war would be brought into their home, and that stout arms alone could
                  prevent pillage; and as what Lenna said was looked on as the law and will of the
                  Generator of all laws, every one was willing to do all in his power
                  to prove himself the possessor of a strong arm.
               The hours of night slowly rolled away and many of them were spent in sleepless
                  contemplation by the little band of adventurers, who were in the morning to sally
                  forth two and two, and travel by different routes till within one hundred miles of
                  Louisville.
               To the ladies, especially, was this a sleepless night—as sleepless perhaps as the
                  night of the 12th of September, 1814, to the people of Baltimore, when the earth
                  still trembled under the heavy tread of the war-horse and the thunder of the guns
                  of North Point and old Fort McHenry. Strange were the dreams that flitted through
                  the anxious yet painfully excited minds of those three fair girls. The men whom
                  they held dearest, and to whose bosoms they could fly for safety in time of
                  danger, were on the eve of starting on a perilous adventure, for they had now
                  begun to suspect that the task would not be an easy one, from the preparations
                  which were being made, as well as that internal intuition which lives alone in the
                  soul of woman. The stillness of the halls served only to make more
                  lasting the imaginary fears which rose before them, like so many midnight
                  phantoms. Many were the times they turned over in their beds, unable to fall into
                  the slumbering embrace of Morpheus, and many were the long sighs which escaped
                  from their lips. But the long looked-for hour, when they were to rise (six
                  o'clock), at length arrived, and the unrested girls were soon in the parlor to
                  satisfy themselves that no terrible thing had yet befallen their manly lovers. By
                  seven, breakfast was ready and the adventurers were soon seated around the
                  table.
               "Girls, why do you not eat?" asked Count Rollin, looking inquiringly into their
                  faces.
               Lenna answered that, for her part, she did not have an appetite which would
                  justify her in eating; there might be a cause for it, but she only knew she
                     had no appetite. Her sister and Massoa dropped their eyes and made no reply. But the old
                  count knew human nature too well to be thus easily put off, and he continued:
               "Ah, well, children! I know your feelings and I do not wish to chide you for what
                  you cannot help. I too was young once, and this heart, now beating in my careworn
                  breast, has felt the counterpart of what you now feel; but cheer up and be
                  happy."
               Massoa was naturally one of the most sensitive of women, and this kind,
                  sympathizing speech of the count completely overcame her. She burst into tears,
                  and rising, threw her arms around the old man's neck and wept as if her heart was
                  breaking.
               "Yes, 'pa,'" for she knew him by no other name, "I am unhappy—I cannot bear for
                  Gasper to leave me, and yet I wish him to go;" said the poor girl amid her sobs,
                  the electric influence of which had already communicated itself to all others
                  seated around the table. That influence cannot be described better than by stating
                  its result, which was to scatter the appetites of even the hungry, like mist
                  before the rising sun.
               The remaining preparations were soon completed, and taking each an affectionate
                  farewell, the four white men and honest old Bolivar were soon on their way to the
                  village of ——. It would be useless and uninteresting to attempt a description of
                  the various emotions of the five, as they saw themselves once on the road; but
                  there was one in that company whose face told no tale—it was blank yet full of
                  meaning, for old Bolivar was ever the same.
               In the meantime, reader, you will remember where we have left Adalaska, Maran,
                  Alick, Gasper, and old Bolivar, and we promise that you shall again be introduced
                  to them at the proper time and place. You must recollect that, in this universal
                  Yankee nation, we do many things done nowhere else, or you will be unable to see
                  how it is that we put you, not on a rainbow or a streak of love, but on a wire,
                  and in the twinkling of the imagination we convey you, soul and body, from the
                  mysterious cave of Genreva to the beautiful and quiet little village of ——, in old
                  Kentucky—the scion of Virginia.
               Delano, seating himself in a large arm chair when he arrived at home, read the
                  letter which had been written to Mr. G——, as before stated. Mr. Delano, for more
                  than an hour after the feelings of exultation caused by the (to him) fortunate
                  discovery of the aforesaid letter, remained in a deep revery.
               "O, man, how sweet is vengeance! but how unfitting to thy nature is its exercise!"
                  is a sentiment known alone to those who have a correct appreciation of man
                     in his manliness. But strange to tell, even in this land of bibles and
                  theology there are many who cannot appreciate that sentiment, and hence suffer the
                  base impulses of the human passions to triumph over the godlike faculties. Of this
                  latter class of beings was Delano, and his soul was now feasting itself upon the
                  prospective pleasure of being enabled to wreak vengeance on Adalaska, whom he had
                  not moral courage to meet and face as a man.
               The sheriff was absent from the county, and when Delano went to his office, near
                  the village, to put him on the track of Adalaska, he, of course could not be
                  found; but his deputy, a man whose nature was but a prototype of Delano's with one
                  addition—destitution of fear—was there and received from Delano a promise of one
                  hundred dollars, as a reward, in case Adalaska was taken and lodged safely in
                  jail. A hundred dollars was a reward sufficient to cause the deputy to use every
                  possible exertion to capture Adalaska. We shall see how well he effected his
                  end.
               It was the night of the nineteenth of September, and five men put up at the
                  village hotel soon after dark. At about ten o'clock two of them walked out of the
                  village—for what purpose may be imagined, for it was Adalaska and Bolivar.
               Bob Martin, the deputy sheriff, and three able-bodied men, stood near the gate of
                  Major White's mansion, ready to intercept Adalaska, whom Delano had reason to
                  suppose would, more than likely, be reconnoitering the residence of Eliza. The
                  night was dark, and the four stood close under the heavy foliage of a
                  tree near to the gate.
               "Martin," said one of the men, "what has this man, that we are about to capture,
                  been doing?"
               "Ask no questions, but seize him when I tell you;" said Martin, in a low and
                  subdued voice.
               "Hush! I hear footsteps," said another of the party, who perhaps did not feel so
                  brave as the rest, and hence was listening more closely to what was going on around them. His companions rose to their
                  feet and were soon convinced that some one was approaching.
               "There's more than one!" said the same cowardly fellow, who was already looking
                  around for a means of escape, should danger present itself.
               Adalaska and Bolivar, little dreaming of the trap which had been set for them by
                  the crafty Delano, walked on till they were within a few feet of the officer and
                  his men.
               Martin laid his hand on Adalaska and ordered him to surrender to the legal
                  authorities. The word had hardly escaped his mouth before he lay sprawling on the
                  ground, for the heavy fist of old Bolivar had been placed, with no kind of care
                  for his proboscis, somewhere in the center of his face.
               Two of Martin's men, however, seized Adalaska and compelled him to submit.
                  Bolivar, seeing no chance to rescue his master just then, thought he might as well
                  get out of the scrape, and accordingly made off at a rapid pace. At the
                  commencement of the scuffle the cowardly fellow, who formed one of Martin's band,
                  had fled toward the village with all speed. Bolivar, running in the same
                  direction, soon came close upon him; and the man, believing himself pursued,
                  exerted every muscle to escape. Bolivar was, however, a swift runner and was soon
                  alongside of the "flying Dutchman" (rather running officer). His first impulse was
                  to serve him somewhat in the manner Martin had been treated; but his quick sense
                  suggested the utility of making a tool of this man to assist in effecting his
                  master's release. Accordingly as soon as he got near enough he seized the man by
                  the collar and forced him to stop and tell not only his own name, but the names of
                  the others, as well as to explain how they came to be waiting on the highway for
                  Adalaska.
               Turning out of the road, they waited till Martin (who soon recovered from the blow
                  dealt him by the old negro) and his men passed on with the prisoner. Bolivar soon
                  satisfied Stubbs that he was on the wrong side of the question, and that, by
                  meeting him the next morning at the door of the hotel in the village at the hour
                  of nine, he might make more for assisting in rescuing the prisoner, than Martin
                  and his men had in taking him. He took a solemn oath to do so, and the two
                  parted—Stubbs toward the village and Bolivar back toward the "brick mansion."
               Eliza White was sitting near her window perusing a book when a shot fell against a
                  window pane; in a moment another struck the glass, then another. This was signal
                  enough, and old Bolivar retired to the spot where he had first met her. He had
                  stood but a moment, when Margaret, the chambermaid, was seen advancing to him as
                  softly as a tiger drawing near his prey. The old man kissed her, and whispering a
                  word in her ear, she was soon gone. In a few moments Eliza was before him, to whom
                  he detailed Adalaska's capture and his adventure with Stubbs, and also told her
                  that his master had made provisions for her release, in case he was captured. "Me
                  and massa Gasper," continued the old negro, "will be what we is now
                  standing, to-morrow night at twelve o'clock 'zactly, missis, and you must come
                  down if you can, and if not, I must come to your room window and put up a ladder
                  for you; and I 'spose, missis, you want to take Margaret?"
               "Yes," replied Eliza, "since she is my servant and is devotedly attached to me, I
                  should not like to leave her behind me."
               "O, well! she can go, missis, for massa Gasper has to bought a hoss fo' you
                  to-morrow mornin', and I'll jus' tell him to buy two, so de gal can ride—so dat 's
                  settled."
               "Well, Bolivar, but how are you to accomplish Adalaska's release?" asked Eliza
                  seriously.
               "Ah, missis, dat be easy, dere's four ob us beside massa 'Laska, and we 'tends to
                  force de jail but a minute 'fore we's on our hosses; den, missis, if dere be any
                  ten men in old Kentuck, who can touch us, I's much 'staken."
               "I can insure you one more to your number," said Eliza; "he is a cousin of mine,
                  and has guarded me for several weeks from falling into the hands of Delano, your
                  master's deadly enemy and persecutor."
               "We be mity glad to have him be one ob us, missis, can you no tell him to call on
                  massa Gasper to-morrow morning, at ten o'clock, at de hotel?"
               "Yes, I will tell him, Bolivar."
               
               After Eliza had been made fully acquainted with the plan of arrangements, she
                  returned to her room and communicated the same to Margaret; while Bolivar returned
                  to the hotel. He went to his comrades' (for they bore that relation to each other)
                  window, and giving a gentle tap, was admitted, when he related the incidents of
                  the night in detail. A feeling of indignation was, in a minute, painted on every
                  face, and on none more than that of Gasper, whose soul was fired at the slightest
                  indignity offered to Adalaska.
               The arrangement for the morrow's action was immediately planned. Gasper was to
                  remain indoors, so as not to be recognized and to make such arrangements as were
                  necessary with Robert, Eliza's cousin. The task of getting two fleet and safe
                  horses for the ladies and another for Robert, should he need one, was committed to
                  Maran and Alick. Bolivar was to get Eliza and Margaret out at night and put them
                  on their horses, while the remainder of the company were to force a passage into
                  the prison and release Adalaska. The plan being understood, the party retired to
                  rest; yet little sleeping was done by any of them.
               Reader, pardon us for digressing from our tale; we do so only to introduce you to
                  some incidents in the life of the captain to whom you are indebted for the
                  foundation of this narrative. We have told you he was a captain (of infantry) in
                  the regular army. Let us describe him for his history will not be altogether
                  uninteresting.
               Captain Bell was about thirty years of age: he had sprung from one of Virginia's
                  proudest families, in whose veins the royal blood of Scotland flowed and which
                  made them somewhat aristocratic. Yet so far was the captain from exhibiting
                  anything of this feeling that you would almost have been persuaded that he had
                  sprung from a very humble position in life. From boyhood he had been a hard
                  student and had thus risen superior to most of his classmates, but without
                  exciting that jealousy so often seen under such circumstances for he possessed a
                  disposition at once amiable and affectionate. Few men possessed higher notions of
                  honor or greater sensibility of feeling. In short, wherever he went he found none
                  but admirers. Nearly a year before the commencement of this tale, he had met, at a
                  fashionable watering-place, a lady in whom he thought he saw the elements of that
                  congeniality of soul necessary to make him happy.
               He was too honest in his own feelings to think for one moment, that the fair lady
                  whom he had singled out, could speak or act otherwise than as she felt. Thus was
                  he at once a fit subject to be the dupe of a coquette. He avowed his love to this
                  lady and in due time became engaged to her. It was now that he thought he saw a
                  bright prospect of happiness beaming upon his path through the distant
                     future—so pregnant with lessons to such a sanguine spirit as the
                  captain's. He made great preparations for marriage, spent much money in visiting
                  the lady, who lived in Georgia, and was, to all appearance, on the eve of the
                  realization of his dreams of happiness, when suddenly all his hopes were blasted
                  by one of those freaks of woman's caprice so common in high life. The lady, Miss
                  Cornelia Marsden, was a good writer, and having learned the art of throwing great
                  stress on her sentences, had induced the captain to believe no woman ever loved
                  man so devotedly as Miss Cornelia loved him. But just before he was to leave home
                  for her residence and to consummate the deed which was to make him forever
                  happy—or at least through life—he received a letter from the lady, saying that an
                  old beau, who had courted her five long years and to whom she was engaged previous
                  to any proposals from him, had suddenly returned, after an absence of many months,
                  with all her former objections to a union with him removed, and now
                  demanded her hand; and said she in her letter:
               
                  "I feel bound by every tie of honor to marry him, even though it is against my
                     will. Now, captain, can you forgive me—will you? Yes, I know
                        you will, when I tell you that, as God is my witness, when I engaged
                     myself to you, I thought I was free—but I was not. If I erred, I did so
                     innocently; and since 'tis human to err, but divine to forgive, will you not
                     pity and forgive me?"
               
               Such an appeal to the feelings of the captain, who believed the lady to be acting
                  under a sense of moral obligation, caused him to sit immediately down and write
                  her that, as sorry as he was that matters stood as they did, he nevertheless felt
                  it a duty to withdraw any claim upon her hand. He continued:
               
               
                  "For though I have loved you tenderly and would have made any sacrifice for
                     you, I feel it my duty, as a man, to yield to circumstances beyond either your
                     or my control. That they could have been otherwise I sincerely wish, but as I
                     have loved you as a man, I will bear my disappointment as a man."
               
               Three days after the reception of her letter of discard, he received another from
                  her, saying:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "MY DEAR CAPTAIN:
                           
                           "I would to God, I could recall the past! Oh, how much misery I must
                              have caused you! But, as I cannot be happy without you and believe you
                              love me as much as woman can be loved, I have determined that, let
                              come what will, I will leave father and mother, friends and home, and
                              fly with you wherever you will. I have told Mr. —— that I cannot marry
                              him and now I can say, in the language of Shakspeare: 
                                 "'Cornelia (not Richard) is herself again!'
                               So, my dear captain, come on and let us be happy, as never
                              mortals were happy in this world!"
                        
                     
                  
               
               It is useless to say that this letter completely repaired the breach, and that the
                  captain thought himself once more on the road to happiness. He soon visited her
                  and the happy day was set. Preparations were going rapidly forward when Miss
                  Cornelia fancied she saw a chance to acquire more money, if not more love, by
                  marrying a young gentleman who had before addressed her, and the first warning the
                  captain had was a note, saying:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "CAPTAIN:
                           
                           "Upon mature consideration, I am persuaded that I have acted hastily,
                              and rashly entered into a promise with you which, I fear, I shall be
                              unable to keep. I do not think we will suit each other, and for that
                              reason, I beg to be released.

               This was the finishing stroke to the captain's blasted hopes. It fell heavy upon
                  his susceptible soul, and he left forever the scene of his miseries; not however
                  till he had written her a long letter, a copy of which we found among his papers
                  and here insert, as a master-effort of his giant intellect. It alone, reader, may
                  be, to you, worth much more than the price of this book, and save you from being
                  duped in the same manner by some speculating coquette. The captain was then
                  stationed at Fort Monroe, as his letter is dated,

                              awaken in the marble bosoms of the sculptured gods of other days,
                              emotions of joyous pleasure, says: 'Lost wealth may be restored by

                              by study; alienated friendship smoothed into forgetfulness—even
                              forfeited reputation won by penitence and virtue. This is true; but,
                              ah, philosophical woman! was a broken and lacerated heart ever healed?
                              were disappointed hopes ever effaced from memory's tablet? did the
                              spark of true and genuine love ever die in the bosom of one of
                                 nature's gentlemen? Ah, no! as well might you try to
                              arrest the ever-flowing current of time, or prevent the rays of the
                              noonday sun from shooting out in the broad expanse of unmeasured
                              space, as to erase from a heart, once true, the burst of
                              pure and genuine love.
                           "I remember well how the blood rushed through my swelling veins, and I
                              sprang from you, as from the poisoning sting of the asp, when I heard
                              you articulate the question: 'Can the poor man love and be happy
                                 in loving?' When I heard this from you, so pure
                              and true that none might question your motives, I felt a dumb
                              dizziness stealing over my brain and desolating in its passage my
                              inmost soul—I could answer only 'yea, my lady, much!' But now, as I
                              sit in my silent room surrounded by an audible stillness, I can answer
                              and give you reasons why he, above all others, can answer the calls of
                              true and genuine affection
                              tion; why he, above all others, loves as is the manner of angels to
                              love; why his heart alone responds to the promptings of the first and
                              best sentiment in man's noble nature. Excuse me, I pray, if I am
                              verbose in stating my reasons for entertaining such views—the
                              importance of the subject demands a fair elucidation.
                           "Let a man be possessed of all the world can bestow, he will be
                              miserable and devoid of true happiness, if he has a miserly,
                                 untutored, and undevout mind, as the rich must have in all
                              cases to retain their substance. You may see him blessed with
                              mansions, manors, and abundance; yet, if he be not a gentleman
                                 of nature, making God his pole-star and eternal justice his
                              standard of action, he will be far from happy. And let another have
                              neither fine palaces, lands, nor plenty, but look only at creation
                              with an enlightened and Christian mind, which can see and adore God in
                              all his works and mingle his spirit with the prayers of the worshiping
                              hosts of heaven—and he will be greater and happier in his poverty than
                              the other in his riches; the one is only a grade above the beasts of
                              the field, while the other is only a grade lower than angels. Now, I
                              ask, which of these can truly love?
                           "No, no, madam! it is a false idea that has crept into the
                              imaginations of the people of this land and age, that wealth and love
                              are inseparable. If you really believe it, be at once undeceived, and
                              know this truth—the true source of misery is that which is brought
                              about by the struggle between pride and poverty. And learn too that
                              the true source of contentment and happiness is the consciousness of
                              moral worth. Pride and poverty are as incompatible as pain and
                              pleasure. In addition to this, you should also remember that the
                                 friendship of the dollar lasts only while you possess
                                 it.
                           
                           "In your intercourse with the world, should you be possessed of
                              wealth, many faces will smile upon you; but smiles sometimes cover
                              frowns. When you shall be overtaken by adversity, as men and women
                              sometimes are, and she casts a pall over your brightest hopes,
                                 then your rich friends will cease to smile and meet
                              you with a frown. Then you will instinctively turn to the face that
                                 loved you, expecting that there, at
                              least, will be found that for which you seek; and 'tis rarely you will
                              fail to find it: for 'tis an old adage, as true as beautiful, that 
                                 "'There is no face so pleasant to behold as the face that loves
                                    us!
                              
                           
                           "If you are not satisfied that I have answered your question
                              respecting the love of the poor man, I will endeavor to give other
                              illustrations in some future letter. No sickly sentimentalism actuates
                              my pen—the day for such a correspondence has forever passed—and
                              sentimentalists of another class and stamp are rising to speak out
                              such a sentimentalism as will effectually, in process of time,
                              completely annihilate those infernal dogmas which have been handed
                              down from feudal ages.
                           "It is not my desire to tire you, madam, with such a logical letter; I
                              write lengthily that you may be made aware of the moral evil you do
                              yourself by acting as you have to me, and to point out some views
                              which may not yet have engaged your attention. I examine, for your
                              benefit, three propositions rather briefly but which I hope you will
                              consider well, as I would not write as I do did I not love you:
                           "1.Females from the ranks of uppertendom are early
                              taught to deceive.
                           "The very fact that thousands find premature graves by engaging in
                              dissipations, the only purpose of which is to elicit the sworn vows of
                              some young blood from the ranks of the elite, whose brain is soon
                              wrought into a machine for the manufacture of dreamy ideas of bliss to
                              be enjoyed in the society of the fair one who suffers him to press her
                              hand and lips till his every passion is fully intoxicated, is proof
                              enough of what the first proposition claims.
                           "2.Truth should be regarded as the pearl of highest
                              value, when associated with woman's affection.
                           "Now if this be true, how exceedingly base must appear that woman who
                              disregards it! Let me define truth—Truth is what is or what has
                                 been; it is eternal and unchanging, and as it emanated from
                              the throne of eternal justice, its presence denotes the proximity of
                              infinitude. Falsehood is produced by any attempt to deceive, and all
                              deception is falsehood. The one is angelical; the other is
                              demoniacal.
                           "3.There is so little real learning among the belles of
                              the age, that without the talents of the true and worthy, to be found
                              only in the middle classes, the world would rapidly sink to a state of
                              semi-barbarism.
                           "This proposition is too true to need argument—a moment's reflection
                              upon the history of the past is sufficient to show that your
                                 elite, BLOODS, have usually done little for mankind,
                              unless it be to trample them in the dust.
                           "I shall close; you will now be prepared to see and feel how I regard
                              a coquette or flirt. Farewell.

               CHAPTER IX.
               THE RELEASE.
               IT was a dark, muggy night—the 19th of September—as a man sat by a bright lamp in
                  a richly-furnished chamber, leaning his head on his hands and his elbows on the
                  table. He was in a deep study. Rising suddenly, he walked to the front door and
                  looked abroad, as if he expected some one. Yet it was late in the night, nearly
                  one o'clock. The man struck his hand against the wainscot as he shut the door, at
                  the same time uttering an oath on all bad luck. He had hardly resumed his seat by
                  the table, however, when a rap on the door he had just left caused him to spring
                  to his feet and start toward it. This man was Delano. When he opened the door he
                  found Martin before him, his face still bloody from having been in collision with
                  Bolivar's fist.
               "Why, Martin, what's the matter?" asked Delano, shrinking back.
               "Oh! there was two of 'em, and one knocked me down. I thought I was dead for a
                  minute, I tell you!" replied Martin, in his long drawling way.
               "But did you let him escape, Martin?"
               "No, we 've got him!"
               "Where?"
               "In jail, chained and all! He's safe now, and for this lick I got, I tell you, I
                  slapped his jaws well; and if I had n't been afeard of leaving bruises on him, for
                  which he might have made me suffer, in case he gets clear, I 'd 'a broke every
                  bone in his body!" said Martin, as he drew himself up to the light.
               "You are a man, Martin, after my own heart; I always knew you were a clever
                  fellow. Now here is a hundred dollars for you, and should I again need your
                  service, you shall be equally as well paid," replied Delano, handing Martin the
                  money; "but be careful," he continued, "that you say you accidentally met him in
                  the street, and having a writ, that you were bound to arrest him."
               "I'll fix that all right," answered Martin.
               That night Adalaska lay in jail under the greatest mental pain, for from the
                  appearance of the dungeon, there seemed no chance of escape. But still he felt,
                  that if any four men could release him, that those, who had accompanied him, were
                  the ones to do so. Leaving him in jail, we must return to the hotel—next morning
                  at ten o'clock.
               Maran and Alick had gone to Louisville to purchase horses for the lady and her
                  maid. They had looked at one in the village which might be purchased for Robert,
                  if he should need one.
               Gasper and old Bolivar were sitting in the room conversing and coming to a mutual
                  understanding about the course to be pursued that night, when a knock at their
                  door put a stop to the conversation. Bolivar opened the door, and Robert J——
                  stepped in and thus introduced himself:
               "You are Gasper R——, I presume?—I am Robert J——, a friend to you and your
                  friends."
               "Yes, sir, answered," Gasper, "that is my name and I suppose you are here to make
                  inquiries about my friend Adalaska?"
               "Yes, sir, and to render such assistance to his cause as may be in my power. It is
                  the will of my cousin, Miss Eliza White, that I do so, and to advise with you on
                  the best means of effecting his release and to convey Eliza beyond the power of
                  her tormentors. Whatever I can do, I am ready—yes, I would even go to Virginia
                  with you, but for the fact that I am now under bonds, with a thousand dollars of
                  Adalaska's money in the hands of the magistrate, as security for my appearance at
                  the fall term of the circuit court; and if I should fail to attend it would be
                  forfeited."
               "The money is no object, sir; we wish you to give us your assistance," replied
                  Gasper.
               In a short time Robert had related to Gasper all that had occurred since he was
                  before at Major White's; and having agreed upon the plan of the coming night's
                  operations, Robert left to report to Eliza what was going forward. Soon after
                  Robert left, Stubbs knocked at the room door and was admitted. Gasper saw, in a
                  few moments, that no confidence could be put in such a man; yet he was convinced
                  that he might be made a tool to subserve certain ends. Accordingly after learning
                  from Stubbs the exact locality in the jail which was occupied by Adalaska, and
                     having hired him to conduct the
                  passage to that room that night, he thought it prudent to make such an arrangement
                  with him as would serve to cover Adalaska's retreat. This was to be done in the
                  following manner: Stubbs was to procure a fleet horse and remain near them,
                  disguised as Adalaska, till his escape was noticed. He was then to make off at
                  full speed, so that the officers, who might pursue, would be led to follow him;
                  and as he was to take a road different from the one taken by the Virginians; time
                  would thus be allowed them to make good their retreat.
               The middle of the day had arrived, and Maran and Alick had just returned with two
                  fresh horses, caparisoned for the road. The hour of dinner having arrived the
                  three white-men sat down and eat and conversed as though they were regular
                  horse-jockeys; and we wish we could say they felt as they appeared; or that Eliza
                  could have so far mastered her feelings as to present the same cold indifference.
                  Poor girl! she was in tears. The thought of leaving forever the home of her birth
                  was serious enough to extend itself to Margaret, who sympathized and endeavored to
                  comfort her mistress. Yet with all these feelings Eliza was prepared and
                  determined to throw herself on Adalaska, who seemed to care so much more for her
                  than her father, whose avarice had blinded every parental impulse. Even that very
                  morning her father had been at her door, persuading her to marry Delano and thus
                  save him from ever renouncing her as a faithless daughter. The major, not knowing
                  how matters stood, of course only acted from policy; for had he known how soon the
                     prison-chamber was to become vacant, it is more than likely that
                  his course of action would have been different. The love Eliza bore Adalaska and
                  her desire to see him released made her very impatient for the midnight hour.
                  Robert had made her fully acquainted with the plan of release, etc., so that there
                  might be no mistake when the time for action arrived. Everything being ready, and
                  the hour yet distant for the release, we will take a moment's look inside the cave
                  in the Valley of Genreva.
               Count Rollin, the captain, and Tom had been busy arranging the engines of war and
                  rendering more secure the various entrances to the cave. The whole internal
                  arrangements seemed to have been altered. The dress of the ladies was also changed
                  from that usually worn by them to a kind that fitted them for discharging duties,
                  which might otherwise have devolved upon the men. With the exception of this
                  change in arrangement the cave family were much as usual. A little impatience
                  might, however, have been seen playing upon the honest faces of that strange
                  family. As we shall not be introduced to them again until they are surrounded by
                  the smoke and din of battle, we would remark that the military knowledge of the
                  captain, who seemed to have entered fully into the fortunes of the strange ones
                  among whom he had thrown himself, was of great importance not only that it enabled
                  him to perform the duties of an experienced hand, but that he made many important
                  suggestions as to the arrangements which were necessary to enable them to
                  successfully resist any force. That the captain was devotedly attached to the
                  family with whom he was dwelling, we want no better proof or more able commentary
                  than his actions a few days after all the arrangements had been completed.
               The village clock had struck eleven, and the winds moaned gently through the heavy
                  foliage as five white-men sat upon their horses, in a dark grove near the jail in
                  the little village of ——. The flashing meteor, blazing near them, might have
                  disclosed the faces of Maran, Alick, Gasper, Robert, and Stubbs. They held a loose
                  horse, as if they expected to be soon joined by another. Not a word was heard
                  among them; for silence was the only chance of success, and even this must be
                  conjoined to prompt and rapid action. At the same time, but nearly half a mile
                  distant, stood three horses under the deep shadow of a huge oak. Two of them were
                  caparisoned for females, the other for a man. A tall, athletic African had just
                  left them and was proceeding to the end of a brick mansion nearly enshrouded in
                  thick foliage. He wore a belt in which were two pistols and a short sword, and
                  though he was nearly fifty years of age, he moved with as much elasticity as if he
                  had not passed the dextile days of youth. It was Bolivar, the giant, for in all
                  his life, he had never seen a man who possessed either the strength or activity of
                  himself. Stopping near a certain large cedar, he knelt down and raised his face to
                  the world of stars above him. Yes, that old negro, ignorant as he was, felt that all good things come from God and
                  that his sanction must be had before we can reasonably expect success. And he knew
                  that it was his duty to beseech Him in the humbleness of his heart to
                  prosper his undertaking. This was the old man's prayer:
               "God ob de mighty heavens! hear poor me and help me; 'member my massa and missis,
                  and send us safe home!"
               Rising he proceeded to the back of the house, and throwing a fine shot against the
                  window, he retired to his place under the tree. In a few moments Eliza and
                  Margaret stood trembling by him. Eliza and Margaret had each a small satchel, and
                  around Eliza's waist was a rich silk scarf in which were to be seen the two
                  pistols that had been so long her dearest companions. They were soon mounted and
                  moving off at a gentle pace toward the grove in which the five sat on their horses
                  waiting for them before any further action could be taken.
               Major White and his lady, as well as Delano and his vassals, little dreamed of
                  what was going on. For though Delano knew that the 20th of September had been set
                  for some decisive action by Adalaska, he supposed that all to be frustrated by the
                  incarceration of Adalaska.
               As soon as faithful old Bolivar had arrived with his charge, the horsemen
                  dismounted and proceeded to the jail, leaving the horses in Bolivar's charge. This
                  was the critical moment; every heart in that little band beat quicker, and every
                  arm grew stronger as they neared the prison-keeper's chamber door. Gasper gave a
                  gentle rap at the door and the jailer, little dreaming of what was going forward,
                  rose, opened it, and stepped out. He had only cleared it when he was seized and
                  held, while two entered the chamber of the frightened prison-keeper where the keys
                  leading to the various cells were soon found, and in five minutes Adalaska was
                  safe on his horse and by the side of Eliza. In a few moments the party were in
                  rapid motion for the distant hills of the Old Dominion. About six miles from the
                  village the roads forked, and at this place Stubbs was left, with orders to take
                  the contrary road from that pursued by the bridal party—for such it might now be
                  regarded.
               The noise, ringing of bells in the village, etc., soon collected the principal
                  personages of the place, who made all possible efforts to send in pursuit a body
                  of men sufficient to retake Adalaska. Among those who assembled were Major White,
                  Delano, and Martin; the latter two of whom, together with fourteen deputized men,
                  were soon in pursuit.
               Delano's loud oaths only showed how much chagrin he felt at being thus foiled in
                  wreaking his revenge on Adalaska, as well as in losing forever the now happy yet
                  anxious Eliza. Major White was pale as death, for he now felt the enormity of a
                  treatment which could induce a timid girl to act as had Eliza. The feelings of
                  Mrs. White and Sarah may be better imagined than described.
               The bridal party had passed the forks of the road only a little way, when the roar
                  and clatter of hoofs were heard upon the turnpike. The party stopped and listened
                  to the sound, wishing to learn if Stubbs played his part well, for much depended
                  thereon. In a few moments the shout of the pursuers gave evidence that Stubbs had
                  been seen and that he was bearing them off on the road desired. The dying sounds
                  of the horses' feet fell weakly on the ears of Adalaska and his companions, and a
                  laugh went through the little band (as if they were in no danger), induced, no
                  doubt, by the contemplation of Delano's chagrin, when he should capture Stubbs.
                  They resumed their journey and by next evening were fifty miles from the village,
                  the citizens of which will not soon forget that 20th of
                  September.
               Delano and his party followed Stubbs till near day before they captured him, and
                  when they did they could learn nothing from him, as he declared he thought it was
                  somebody who intended to rob him that caused him to fly at the rate he had. As a
                  matter of course they were compelled to turn about and retrace their steps to the
                  forks of the road, as there was no cross-road by which they could get on the other
                  turnpike. They had chased Stubbs about eighteen miles, and if they had rode at the
                  same rate back to the forks, Adalaska and his party would thus have had thirty-six
                  miles the start, a distance that could not be so easily gained with tired
                  horses.
               
               
                  
                     The Flight—Death of Margaret—Escape; page 97.
                  
               
               Stubbs returned to the village apparently in a great pet at being frightened as he
                  had been; while Delano and his party took the right road and were soon in full
                  chase.
               The fourth morning, about ten o'clock, Delano hove in sight of his prey; but he
                  was within less than half a mile of the entrance to the cave. The shout was raised
                  and every muscle nerved for the last struggle. Away bounded the half-frightened
                  horses, now growing tired under such vigorous usage. The trembling Eliza and the
                  frightened Margaret following close after Adalaska.
               The pursuers were gaining rapidly on them and were, no doubt, sure of the prize,
                  when the party suddenly left the road and crossed the river. As they were entering
                  the mouth of the passage one of the men, who was ahead of the rest, fired on them;
                  the ball entered Margaret's head and she fell a corpse. Nor had she more than
                  fallen when old Bolivar wheeled his horse about and fired on him. The man reeled
                  and fell struggling in the river. A faint scream escaped from Eliza's lips and she
                  was lifeless. Old Bolivar, seeing her falling, caught her in his arms, and drawing
                  her across his horse, dashed ahead that she might be placed beyond danger. Maran
                  dismounted, put Margaret's body on his horse, and again rushed on after his
                  companions.
               The enraged Delano and his companions goaded their tired steeds and madly rushed
                  on after the now invisible forms of the bridal and funeral party. But
                  could they have only known what deadly meshes every step forward was to be, how
                  rapid would have been their retreat!
               Between the opening of the subterranean cavern, which has been already described,
                  and the door which shut up the passage, was an open cavern in which the horses
                  were usually kept. Into this the party rushed, and alighting, were soon again on
                  the way for the door. The body of Margaret was left lying in a manger till a
                  better opportunity should be offered for decently interring it. Bolivar had
                  already reached the great court with Eliza, who was soon restored. As he had given
                  the alarm when he passed the signal wires, he found the old count and his little
                  band ready to meet the consequences. Seizing a long, double-handed claymore, old
                  Bolivar told the captain and Tom to follow him. So rapid were his movements that he again reached the
                  artificial door or stoppage by the time Adalaska and his men were prepared to meet
                  Delano's party, who had already passed the signal-wires (having previously
                  dismounted) and were fast approaching the gas-pipe which was intended to fill the
                  passage with a mass of flame.
               Adalaska stood by the guard which let on the gas, and was in the act of turning it
                  on, when the heavy hand of Bolivar was laid upon his arm and his wild voice rang
                  out:
               "Massa, let 'em come! and his eyes flashed as one who feels that the day of
                  retribution has come for the destruction of his enemies. "Yes, massa, let 'em come
                  where we can rake 'em!"
               Adalaska stopped a moment to scan the visages of his pursuers, and his noble
                  nature rose triumphant over his anger as the thought of their utter destruction
                  flashed across his mind. The deputy sheriff, Martin, and the man who had killed
                  Margaret, had already passed the gas-pipe, and Adalaska again sprang to the stop
                  or guard to let on the massive flame, when the stout arm of the negro again
                  interposed. Taking his master in his arms, he started hallooing to the captain,
                  who had now joined the brave party, to let on the fire when all had passed. In a
                  moment it was done; the whole archway was a mass of fire. The terrified shrieks of
                  Delano and his companions sounded through the passage only to be hurled back in
                  their ears by old Bolivar, who was bent on their destruction. Seeing themselves
                  thus cut off from retreat, the cowardly Delano began to beg for mercy; but he
                  heard no assurance. The voice of Bolivar rung in his ears:
               "You had mercy on my missis, did n't you?"
               Martin was made of different material from Delano, as were most of those with him,
                  and they resolved to sell their lives as dearly as possible. Forming into a
                  column, they drew their pistols and rushed onward as if mad with excitement. When
                  they were within thirty steps they halted and fired; but no one was hurt, save a
                  flesh-wound on Robert from a pistol-shot fired by Martin. Adalaska was now
                  convinced that a battle was inevitable, and he cried out to his men to
                     follow him. The two parties met and the conflict became desperate;
                  short swords against bowie knives, and pistols to pistols; the clatter of steel
                  and the roar of small arms; the shouts of the men and the groans of the dying
                  added to the gloominess of the place and made the scene really terrific.
               No men fight so well as cowards, when forced to fight; and this fact was well
                  illustrated in the determination with which Delano and his men fought, when all
                  hopes of escape, except by a victory over Adalaska's party, were cut off. Martin,
                  the officer, fought with a determination worthy of the State that gave him birth.
                  He was armed with a heavy bowie-knife, and after the first round was fired, he
                  rushed headlong against the swords of the cave party. Had he been sustained he
                  might have carried his point; but having engaged Maran in single combat, he fell
                  mortally wounded after a few passes. His comrades only grew more enraged and
                  rushed on the little band with such impetuosity, that they were compelled to fall
                  back and enter the large court room. The great gun, as well as another near it,
                  had already been so arranged as to sweep the entrance. To this gun Bolivar rushed
                  and was ready to scatter the pursuers in pieces, when they should enter. Oh! how
                  his eyes glared with a wild joy at a chance to avenge the death of Margaret! As
                  Delano's band darkened the doorway or passage leading into the great hall,
                  Adalaska cried out:
               "Back, men, or by heavens, you die!"
               It had no effect, and they rushed on. Every member of the household, except the
                  girls, had seized a carbine and stood ready to cut the advancing foe to pieces.
                  Old Bolivar stood trembling by the cannon with a heated rod in his hand—he raised
                  it—he touched—and Oh, heavens, the havoc! limbs, mangled bodies, and weapons
                  filled the passage. The noise was as the bursting of a magazine. Of all that body
                  of men only two remained unhurt. One of these was Delano, and the other a young
                  man who resided on his farm. As soon as the smoke had settled and Gasper saw
                  Delano, he sprang forward to engage him in single combat, when Adalaska cried
                  out:
               "Spare him, Gasper, he can do us no harm.'
               Delano had already fallen on his knees and was supplicating for his life. Old
                  Bolivar answered his entreaties by asking:
               "You had mercy on my massa, in jail, did n't you?"
               
               A word from Adalaska and the arms were laid aside; the bodies were cleared out of
                  the passage-way, and the two surviving men of the pursuing party placed in charge
                  of Alick and Tom. Adalaska soon joined Eliza and the other ladies, who, with the
                  count, were in one of the large halls usually occupied by the ladies. It was some
                  hours before Eliza was composed enough to realize the condition of affairs; by the
                  time she was, the great hall had been thoroughly cleansed, the bodies carried out
                  and buried, as also that of Margaret and the man who had been shot at the river.
                  An incense-pot had been fired and again the place was sweet. Delano and the young
                  man had been conducted to the parlor, and were standing in the center of the hall
                  when the whole family was assembled to take counsel in regard to them. When Delano
                  saw Eliza his eyes fell as though the death-penalty had been passed on him. As he
                  stood before her, Adalaska thus addressed him:
               "Mr. Delano, you have done me much harm; you have caused many unhappy moments to
                  this lady, and you have led hither a band of men for whose lives you must account.
                  You are in my power and justly deserve to die; but I shall spare you. You will be
                  conducted to the opening where you entered this place, and if you value your life,
                  never attempt to again visit this place, nor even mention its existence."
               Delano fell on his knees and thanked him; and he swore, by heaven, that he would
                  never visit, or cause to be visited, the mysterious cave. A like oath was made by
                  the young man who accompanied him, and they were led forth to the opening, where
                  they bade a final adieu to Genreva.
               Adalaska immediately sent the captain to Wytheville, Virginia, for licenses for
                  himself, Maran, Alick, and Gasper; also for a priest who could legally unite them.
                  Two days elapsed and they were all married.
               Delano arrived at home in about seven days and for a while confined himself to his
                  house. A paragraph in the papers of the village stated that some young men, who
                  had stoned a minister in church, had suddenly left for Texas regardless of their
                  creditors and to the mortification of their relatives. This, was, no doubt, the
                  work of Delano to account for the disappearance of those who had fallen in
                  assisting him to take Eliza from her chosen lord.
               If we were permitted to here discharge Delano from farther notice, we would
                  willingly do so; but, alas! it is not permitted us. He remained silent for a few
                  months and then sued Major White for the amount he had placed in his hands. As he
                  held the major's receipt for the deposit there was no difficulty in getting
                  judgment. The major's property was sold to raise the amount, and as property of
                  all descriptions was very low, little was left him. His spirits sank in him as he
                  saw the folly with which he had acted; a fever set in and he fell a victim to the
                  desolating besom of insanity. In his wildest moments he would clasp his hands and
                  thank God that Eliza was Adalaska's. Mrs White and Sarah were in the greatest
                  distress, when suddenly Robert J—— entered the invalid apartment of Major White,
                  and seating himself by the couch of the sleeper, he wept over him as would a
                  son—for Robert loved his uncle notwithstanding his faults. The once proud and
                  aristocratic Major White lay, unconscious of external things, till aroused by the
                  sobbings of Robert. He started up but fell back too feeble to rise.
               "Who weeps by my side?" he asked.
               "It is I, uncle, Robert J—— I know your distress and am sent hither by Adalaska to
                  relieve you," replied Robert.
               The old man threw his arm around Robert's neck and wept like a child. In two
                  months Major White, Mrs. White, and Sarah were seated in the parlor or
                  drawing-room of Rollin Court, thoroughly reformed and happy.
               Four years after these transactions, we entered the Valley of Genreva; the forests
                  had disappeared, beautiful cottages were scattered over its surface, and the vast
                  family, now numbering several hundred souls, showed the practicability of a social
                  union of labor and capital in the vocations and prosperity of every branch of
                  industry. Adalaska, Eliza, and their two children, Charles and Mary, had gone to
                  Europe to help in bringing about that state of affairs which had ever been the
                  theme of his brightest hopes. The suffering millions of overgrown and
                  tyrant-ridden Europe flocked around
                  him, whom they regarded as one almost superhuman. They listened to his new plans
                  of government and social policy, with an interest which showed how nearly ripe was
                  the harvest of men of the sickle of liberal reform. Kings and lords turned pale at
                  his teachings, which were but a reiteration of "Mene, Mene, Tekel," etc. Orders
                  were soon given that he must not teach men such ideas, as they were hurtful to
                  peaceful government. When the order was handed to Adalaska he sat conversing with
                  Eliza; he read it and said to her:
               "Yes, Eliza, my views will disturb peaceful government, because it makes man equal
                  to man, and the acceptance of that doctrine, in this land of kings and priests,
                  who prey upon the vitals of humanity, would at once be the overthrow of despotisms
                  and tyrannies. But I remember the words of Lenna, who has said in our happy home,
                  several years ago: 'Before these can take place the earth must be clothed in
                     red.' I now know the import of her words; the masses must rise as one
                  man and swear, by heaven! to be free and to live like brothers. The sword is the
                  text from which my sermons must be preached. But for all this, our colonies in
                  your beautiful country, where man is free, and kingcraft and priestcraft are
                  unknown, must be cherished, and if we shall be unable to effect the work in
                  Europe, we will plant the germ of future government there."
               Several tracts of land were already purchased in Western Virginia, on which to
                  settle such communities as should evince a desire to emigrate. One in Fayette
                  County was already peopled by about five hundred souls, and the Valley of Genreva
                  with as many more. These have already called out public sentiment in favor of
                  social organization in other parts, because its good effects are now
                  demonstrable.
               The cave family and its additions are now as happy as any could wish them, and
                  none more so than Major White, who is no longer ashamed to acknowledge old Bolivar
                  as his equal and Adalaska as his son-in-law. Captain Bell married Sarah when he
                  saw she had been so thoroughly reformed, and in the war with Mexico, won for
                  himself undying laurels by the side of brave Davis of Mississippi. His home is in
                  the valley that we have described, and though no longer a soldier, he is willing
                  to answer the calls of the oppressed in Europe.
            
            
               CONCLUDING CHAPTER.
               EXPLANATIONS—COUNT ROLLIN'S COURT IN EUROPE—ITS DESTRUCTION—THE
                  SETTLEMENT IN AMERICA—ADALASKA'S MISSION.
               COUNT ROLLIN'S European court was held in S——, in the northern part of France,
                  until 1816. He was the only son of one who was, and is even now, regarded as the
                  most remarkable man of the eighteenth century. He married Cathrina Ludovico, only
                  daughter of Don Pelanda of Italy, by whom he had one child; this was Marie
                  Theralia, who at sixteen married Prince Rupert of Saxony. Count Rollin's wife, the
                  duchess Cathrina, died soon after giving birth to Marie Theralia; so great was his
                  grief that his father and friends persuaded him to visit America. Accordingly, in
                  the latter part of 1799, he visited the United States, leaving Marie in charge of
                  a sister on whom he bestowed much affection.
               Returning home, he was accused of favoring a rebellion against the royal dynasty
                  of France, and a guard sent to take charge of his person until a trial could be
                  decreed. The Countess of Wirtemburg, the mother of Prince Rupert, being in Paris
                  attending a royal levee, heard of the charge and immediately sent a private notice
                  to the count, advising him to fly. When the guard arrived they were informed that
                  the count was breathing his last. A butler in his house had just died, and in a
                  few hours his funeral was celebrated with all the pomp and magnificence which
                  would have been seen at the funeral of the count. In two days it had spread
                  through France that Count Rollin was dead. The guard returned to Paris, not
                  doubting the death of Count Rollin.
               In the meantime, suspicion was aroused against the countess and her brother, the
                  Duke of Gascondale. Accordingly Count Rollin, the duke, and the countess secretly quit France for
                  America, leaving Marie Theralia and the young Prince Rupert in charge of Count
                  Rollin's sister, the Countess of Nantilla, whose husband had fallen a victim to
                  disease while with Napoleon in Egypt. Count Rollin, soon after his arrival in
                  America, married the Duchess of Wirtemberg, by whom he had three children, LENNA,
                  MATTINO, and GASPER. About the same time the duke married the only daughter of
                     Lawliwasikaw, the noted prophet of the Shawanoe nation, and
                  brother to Tecumseh, the Tippecannoe warrior. By her the duke had
                  three children, MARAN, ALICK, and MASSOA.
               The count and duke had both settled in Arkansas, and were living in splendid
                  style; for they had brought over with them immense wealth. The seventh year after
                  their settlement in the warm-spring State, both the duke and his wife, as well as
                  the Countess of Wirtemberg, fell victims to a southern fever.
               Marie Theralia had married Prince Rupert in 1816, soon after the departure of
                  their parents for the wilds of America, and were regarded with much distrust by
                  the royal family, who saw the discontent of the nation, and who they imagined
                  would seize upon the critical moment to kindle anew that enthusiasm which had died
                  amid the smoke of Waterloo. The Countess of Nantilla, since the death of her
                  husband, had secluded herself from the world, so that she had attracted no
                  attention; her existence, in fact, was hardly known by the royal spies.
               The suspicions against Marie Theralia and Prince Rupert became so strong that
                  their destruction was resolved on, and the officers sent to effect it. As they lay
                  in bed, on a calm, clear night, the assassins entered and did the foul deed but
                  too well. The nursery maid was in an adjoining room and saw the fatal daggers
                  plunged deep in the hearts of the sleepers. She stood motionless till they had
                  gone, and then fell on her knees and prayed by the couch of a little
                     sleeper—this was ADALASKA, the only son of Marie Theralia and Prince
                  Rupert. She rose from beside that little couch and entered the room of a priest;
                  soon the two stood by the sleeping child. The priest raised his eyes and prayed
                  heaven to protect the innocent babe. In a few moments the sleep ing child was
                  wrapped in a cloak and handed to the faithful priest, who bore it in safety to the
                  residence of the Countess of Nantilla.
               When Count Rollin heard of Marie's death he left the six children, to whom the
                  reader has been introduced, in charge of an old Indian—the half-brother of the
                  Indian woman whom the duke had married, and hurried to France. In a few days after
                  his arrival, the Countess of Nantilla handed him a small jeweled box which had
                  been given her by the priest. It contained Marie's portrait, the portraits of her
                  mother and Prince Rupert. Over this box and by an altar, with each a hand on the
                  Gospel of Nazareth, the old count and his sister took an oath to devote their
                  wealth and their energies to the downfall of the French monarchy. Ten days after,
                  they were on a ship, in the English channel, bound for America, and having with
                  them the child Adalaska. A few days after getting on the broad Atlantic, the
                  countess was taken ill, and calling Count Rollin to her side she thus addressed
                  him:
               "Brother, I am near the end of all my troubles; I desire to live only that I may
                  see this child able to wield a sword over the bodies of his most deadly enemies.
                  Brother, cease not to live or labor till that child is taught his mission, which
                  is none other than to extirpate the royal family of France. Tell him to build up a
                  republic like that to which you are going, where there shall be not one king
                     but millions of kings. Let the germ be planted in France and the light
                  of liberty will diffuse itself into all Europe. Kings and potentates will not be
                  able to sit on their thrones in peace after that sun shall rise which
                  witnesses the unsheathing of Freedom's sword. Build thou a monument and teach that
                  child to worship God at its base. Let him learn to worship none but God—the King
                  of righteousness. Oh, my brother, swear to me that you will do this!"
               The old count knelt by his dying sister and swore, by the love he bore her, to
                  fulfill the duty. In a few days more the countess was deep in the bottom of the
                  sea.
               It is useless to say more respecting the count; the reader has already been
                  informed how well he executed his promise. Adalaska found the spirit of his aunt
                  growing stronger in him after he had
                  brought about the revolution of 1848. He was in correspondence with Louis Kossuth,
                  and when the cry of the millions of Hungary's down-trodden sons reached his ears,
                  he conveyed Eliza—Kentucky's brightest jewel—to Switzerland and went himself to
                  battle for the oppressed. His voice was heard, ringing loudest, amid the din of
                  Hungarian battle. He found, however, insufficient organization of the people to
                  effect their liberties; but still he did not despair, and is now devoting himself,
                  might and main, to bring about universal emancipation from the polluting tyranny
                  of kings and priests.
            
            THE END.
