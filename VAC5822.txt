               IT was always a subject of debate at school, whether Dora Raymond was pretty or
                  not. Little Sammy Earle thought she looked most like a witch of anything that he
                  had ever seen; but Freddie Mills said that she was too dark for a witch; whereupon
                  Sammie informed him, in a mysterious, confidential whisper, that ghosts were
                  always white, but that he had heard of black witches. Sammie said that it was like
                  lightning at midnight to see her black eyes flash, and that he was more afraid of
                  her when she was angry than of anything else in the world.
               "Why, she never says much," replied Freddie.
               "No, but she looks, and that look is worse than thunder. If she would
                  only say, it wouldn't be so bad. I am never afraid of these girls
                  that will talk, for then you know what you've got to bear; but you never know
                  what's coming from Dora Raymond, or what she thinks of you, only that look, which
                  makes one know that there is a hurricane within, and that, if she chose, she could
                  sweep you into Egypt."
               "Well, she is never angry without a cause," argued Freddie. "She never looks so
                  unless somebody does something mean; and you know it was awful mean of you to take
                  little Paul's apples the other day, and then put your hand over his mouth so that
                  we shouldn't hear him scream. I'm real glad that she looked at you so, until you
                  felt no bigger than a sixpence."
               "Why, I only did it to frighten him, for he is so stingy. I meant to give them
                  back to him again."
               "Hush! there is Dora now," said Freddie. "I should think Arthur Elwood thought her handsome, for she
                  is the only girl in the village that he takes the least notice of. See, he is
                  crossing the fields, and will go around through the woods to meet her."
               "I think it very funny for a young man as old as he to pay so much attention to a
                  child," said Sammie; "and it flatters Dora so that she will not look at us. Why,
                  there's Mary Sanford, three years older than Dora, who is glad enough to have me
                  walk home with her, and listens to every word I say with the utmost attention; but
                  the other day I joined Dora and talked my prettiest, but I do not think she heard
                  five words I uttered, for she looked at me so vacantly, and at last said: 'Sammie,
                  I would much rather be alone, or, if you stay, I do wish that you would stop
                  talking, for it annoys me. I want to think; it is so solemn in these deep
                  woods.'"
               "I don't think it queer that Arthur Elwood likes her," said Freddie. "Nor you
                  wouldn't either if you had seen her as I did the other day. I have heard my mother
                  say that she had fine eyes, and would make a handsomer woman than child; but I
                  tell you, sometimes when she is with Arthur Elwood she is
                  beautiful—the most beautiful creature that I ever saw."
               "I told you that she was of the nature of a witch," interrupted the superstitious
                  little Sammie, "and can make herself look mighty different at different
                  times."
               "Well," continued Freddie, "I was going to tell you that I passed them the other
                  day, and Arthur Elwood was holding a bunch of freshly-gathered water-lilies, and
                  she was reaching for them, but looking, I thought, more earnestly into Arthur's
                  eyes than at the flowers. Her red lips were parted in a half smile, and there was
                  such a bright color in her cheeks, and her eyes had no wild-fire in them, but were
                  as soft as my sister Annie's, yet just as brilliant as ever. She looked like a
                  rich sun-set cloud. How I wished that I was a painter!"
               "An artist, you mean," corrected Sammie, in a slightly self-important tone.
               By this time Arthur Elwood had made his circuit through the fields, and was by the
                  side of the little Dora Raymond, the subject of the foregoing remarks. He was a
                  youth of at least eighteen years of age, and a glance sufficed to assure one that
                  "he was gentle, and to the manor born." Tall, slightly built, with straight,
                  delicate features, large, thoughtful, deep blue eyes, complexion fair and soft as
                  an infant's;—such, in appearance, was the son and heir of Mr. Elwood, by far the
                  wealthiest gentleman in the county. A marked contrast he formed to the dark,
                  little being by his side; that "strange little thing," as almost everybody called
                  her, and yet everybody liked Dora, although none professed to understand her. The
                  teachers liked her for the rapid progress that she made in all her studies; the
                  persecuted little ones considered her their greatest friend; the weak and timid
                  sought her, for she was the brave help and bold defender of all such; the gay and
                  the strong, too, liked her, for in generosity she had no rival; her nuts and
                  fruits were scattered among them with a lavish liberality, with never a thought of
                  making any reservation for self. Then, too, she aided them in their sports; for
                  she was wild and fearless in her play, venturing to do and dare what no one else
                  would dream of. Yet though her laugh would ring the clearest, although her
                  footsteps were the fleetest, and her manner the most gay and buoyant when engaged
                  in out of door sports, she was never free of speech. In all that motley array of
                  girls at the district school, Dora Raymond had no confidante. And at the long noon
                  interval of rest and recreation, when, wearied of play, they would gather in
                  groups under the trees and take out their well-filled baskets of refreshments, and
                  begin their private and strictly confidential discourses, Dora was invariably
                  missing. She would stray far off into the woods, and wander there alone until the
                  loud bell of the district school would ring its unwelcome summons. But even that
                  would sometimes fail to rouse her from her musings; and it was often owing to the
                  vigilance Of little Freddie Mills that she bore no punishment for tardiness; for
                  he ever watched her movements, and noted
                  the direction she would take, that he might, in due time, break the spell of her
                  pleasant daydreams.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               IT was neither night nor day; but that sweet hour when both blend into one; like
                  loving hearts that are often sundered, and are bearing varied and widely different
                  experiences, yet meet at intervals, during which each lives only in the other.
                  Nothing definite, or separate, can be distinguished. All of life, past and
                  present, flows in that one full, sweet, sacred hour; when it is past, there
                  is—only night.
               On the summit of a hill-top, on a rustic seat of moss-covered stones, sat Dora and
                  Arthur. Her manner denoted extreme exhaustion; that utter weariness which ever
                  follows passionate grief; and Dora's was not a nature to sorrow calmly and
                  quietly. She had been weeping in all the abandonment of her first great and
                  hopeless grief; while Arthur, with a forethought that would have graced maturer
                  years, forebore to comfort her until the first outburst of violent emotion had
                  subsided. Then he drew her gently towards him, rested her head on his shoulder,
                  and tenderly smoothed back her long, dark tresses. As his soothing touch passed
                  over her throbbing temples, her sobs grew fainter; still she did not raise her
                  head, nor did the expression of hopeless dejection fade from her face.
               Presently, "her white shell trembling amid crimson air, glided the young moon."
                  Then Arthur broke the silence in accents of tender playfulness.
               "Look up, Dora; look up, my Yuca; see—how beautiful!"
               Dora slowly raised her head, glanced at the moon, then looking up at the youth,
                  whose arm was fondly encircling her, she asked:
               "Why do you call me that, Arthur?"
               "Because you are the moon's own flower. The yuca filamentosa is the emblem of pure
                  feminine beauty: it will not make any display in the glaring light of day; its
                  leaves look dull, and the petals of the blossom shrink together. But look at it
                  when the moon arises, and you would readily acknowledge there is no plant that
                  grows more delicately, more purely beautiful. So it is with you, Dora. The moon
                  seems to have a strange influence over you. It arouses you. In our moonlight walks
                  I have known you to be brilliant; your speeches have glistened like silver and
                  diamonds; you have uttered lovely imaginings that I am sure you never could have
                  dreamed of in the sun-light. So look up, my Yuca, that the magic moon may weave
                  her spell around you, that I may behold you once more as I love best to see
                  you."
               "No, no! Arthur," said the child, mournfully, "I can never have that sweet name
                  any more. You are my moon; you are going to leave me; my sky will always be dark.
                  The Yuca will droop; it will never shine again."
               "Nay, Dora, do not say so. You have too much native strength of character to be
                  completely crushed by any grief. We will miss each other sadly; but we can surely
                  be greatly comforted by the thought, that in a few years I shall return and take
                  you to dwell with me forever. We shall never be separated then. There is only one
                  thought that troubles me; perhaps you will not be so ready to come then as now;
                  but even if your affection remains unchanged, if you should still cling as fondly
                  to the friend of your childhood, the delicious freedom with which you manifest it
                  now, will be gone, and I shall grieve to lose it. I may find, instead of my
                  impulsive, passionate Dora, a reserved and dignified maiden."
               Dora's eyes lightened with an expression of almost indignant reproach.
               "You need not look as if I had wronged you, Dora. I have unbounded trust in the
                  depth, the truth, the constancy of your love; but you know, or will know one of
                  these days, that little maidens of twelve will often utter what those of seventeen
                  will strive to conceal. Yet if my Dora is unchanged in feeling when I return, I
                  shall find little difficulty in discovering the truth. I shall soon ascertain
                  whether my Yuca blooms only in the moonlight."
               
               "It would be strange, indeed, dear Arthur, for me ever to seek to hide what I
                  think or feel from you," said the child, nestling closer to him, and resting her
                  head again on his shoulder. "You know that I have nobody in the world but you; not
                  a single being to whom I can talk. I can play with other people; I can help them;
                  I can listen to them, but I cannot talk to them. I have not learned to speak their
                  language yet, and mine they do not understand; but you can understand it all so
                  perfectly, and I have ever talked with you just as I do to the flowers and the
                  stars, with quite as much freedom, and far more happily. Oh, Arthur!" she
                  exclaimed, while her bosom heaved and her frame shook with emotion, as the thought
                  of her great loss again pressed upon her, "Do not, do not leave me! I cannot bear
                  it! I shall die! I want to die!" And again she wept passionately, while Arthur
                  sought to comfort her in those thousand nameless ways that emanate from a
                  love-taught heart, until she again lay quiet and passive in his arms, from utter
                  exhaustion. She lay, with her large eyes fixed upon the moon as it slowly rose
                  above them, until at last she murmured as slowly and dreamily as the moon was
                  moving: "If there was a God—and He was a being something like ourselves, only
                  mightier and more holy, and He could sleep as we do—I should say that He was
                  sleeping now, and that the moon was His dream. The moon never seemed
                     real to me; it never seems awake. It looks as if it was walking in
                  its sleep. It is so high, so grand, so pure, so beautiful, yet so mysterious, it
                  seems just like God's dream. The angels dream only stars; but God
                  dreams the moon. The sun is His thought; a bright,
                  clear, strong, waking thought. Oh, Arthur, there must be a God."
               Arthur was silent. Dora still lay with her eyes never turning from the moon; but
                  their expression varied from mournfulness to a yearning wistfulness; then to deep,
                  earnest thought. Suddenly she rose, and looking up with a gaze of solemn rapture,
                  she said in low but thrilling tones: "There is a God. I believe it. I
                     feel it—I KNOW it. Arthur Elwood, I believe in
                     God."
               "I have no objection, Dora, to your believing in a God; I myself believe in a
                  Great First Cause. I have told you that there was no God, to keep you from
                  embracing the idea to the ridiculous extent that many do; but I have not the
                  slightest objection to your believing in a Creator of all things."
               "And that He is great, and wise, and good," interrupted Dora.
               "We will not argue the point of His goodness just now," replied Arthur. "But, dear
                  Dora, you have touched upon a subject that of late has caused me some anxiety. I
                  am going to leave you. You will be exposed to other influence than mine. That
                  little building yonder, which they dignify by the name of church, and which has
                  been closed ever since my babyhood, is to be re-opened; and what the effect of
                  such a proceeding will be upon this remote little village, that has remained so
                  long unmolested by the tribe of ranters, and the whole host of reverend
                  hypocrites, I cannot tell. They may all run mad at the thought of the brimstone
                  and fire that is to be hailed upon them, and embrace the hateful doctrines taught
                  by a certain class of deluded men, but which man, in his right mind, guided by the
                  pure light of reason, must ever spurn. What the effect will be upon
                     you I cannot tell. You are a child now. Could I remain with you, I
                  would not fear their influence; but the minister and his wife will probably
                  reside, for the first year at least, with your grandfather, and they will spare no
                  pains to fill your mind with all sorts of fanatical notions. So I should not be
                  much surprised to find you, in a few years, quite a saint. But, dear Dora, if you
                  love me, turn a deaf ear to whatever they may tell you. Believe me, it is all
                  delusion—nonsense. They will first try to convince you that you, my
                  pure little Yuca, are the chief of sinners; that you have a heart blacker than old
                  Dinah's face; that you are going straight to a place that they call hell—a lake of
                  burning fire."
               "Oh, Arthur!" said the child, with a shudder, drawing closer to him.
               
               "This is all true, Dora. I am glad that you perceive how ridiculous it is. When
                  they have frightened you half out of your wits with this idea, then they will give
                  you some faint hope of escape. They will tell you that there is a Being named
                  Jesus, the son of this good God, who makes the hell in which to burn
                  the creatures of His work; and that if you will give up every pleasure of life,
                  every single innocent amusement and recreation—never dance, laugh or sing, (unless
                  it may be solemn psalm tunes, that seem more like mournful groans than music,) and
                  do whatever the Son of God tells you to do, no matter what—obey Him in
                  everything—that then you can be saved; you may escape being burned."
               "But where do they say He is? How do they know what He wants them to do?"
               "Now we are coming to the point. This is the snare that will entrap you. This is
                  the rock upon which you will make ship-wreck. I came near being capsized there
                  myself; and had not my preceptor been endowed with extraordinary soundness of
                  mind, clearness of perception, and the power of acute reasoning, I should have
                  been completely overturned. In short, I would have been—a saint! I was saved with
                  difficulty. We often laugh together about it now. You see I got hold of an old
                  Bible. You have never read that book, Dora, and I never want you to; but they will
                  give it to you the first thing; for it is so beautifully written—there are so many
                  true and wise things in it—the whole story seems so plausible, that it is enough
                  to confound and bewilder any young mind. They will tell you that you must read it,
                  in order to know what you must do, as it contains the commands of Jesus."
               "And does it tell how He saves us?"
               "Oh, yes that is the most thrilling part. No one can read it without being
                  touched, even while considering it untrue. I shall never forget the emotions with
                  which I read it the first time, nor could I banish it from my mind. And, as I said
                  before, had I had any other man than Monsieur De Luce for my instructor, I should
                  have been completely captivated vated. It is a book that appeals to the
                  imagination and feelings, to the complete oversight of reason and judgment.
                  Therefore, it would do you much injury. It would affect you much, as it did me;
                  but you would have no watchful, solicitous Mr. De Luce at your elbow, to whose
                  faithfulness I shall be for ever indebted. Now I shall be a man,
                  walking untrameled by notions and creeds, with no false and cramping fears to cast
                  their shadows in my way, guided by the pure light of reason, glorying in the
                  powers of my intellect, I shall aim to be all that man can be."
               "Arthur," said Dora, after a pause, "I should like to read that book."
               "Of course," replied Arthur, playfully. "You are a little Eve; but that is the
                  apple I forbid you to touch. I shall make only one request, Dora," said he,
                  changing his tone to one of earnest gravity, "and I rely upon your love to keep
                  it. You have never yet refused me anything that I have asked; you surely will keep
                  my parting, perhaps my last request.—Do not read the Bible."
               "But, Arthur, what harm can it do any one to believe what it teaches? Are those
                  whom you call saints an unhappy people? Are they worse than others?"
               "Oh, they profess to be wondrous happy, in order to attract and to deceive others;
                  although, to my taste, they are a gloomy, moping set. They also profess to be a
                  little better than anybody else—but few live up to their profession. To speak of
                  them generally, to take them as a class, I know not that they are either better or
                  worse than others; but their efforts to ignore human nature render them
                  repulsive."
               "Arthur," again questioned the child, after a few moments of apparently deep
                  thought, "are you perfectly satisfied?"
               "How, Dora, in what way?"
               "Are you happy? Oh, Arthur! I have not just thought of this; it has been on my
                  mind for a long time, but I feared to tell you lest you might fancy that I loved
                  you less than I do. I used to think that if I had any one in the world to love me
                  as tenderly and completely as you do, that I should want nothing more—that this craving would be fully
                  met. Yet, notwithstanding we love each other so entirely, so perfectly, this
                  yearning in my soul increases daily. Why is this, Arthur? Do you never feel it—is
                  not your soul hungry, too?"
               "You have an inquiring mind, Dora—it is your thirst for knowledge."
               "No, no, Arthur! it is not my mind. It is not a longing to
                     know, but a desire for something to rest upon, to cling to
                  forever. But my words do not explain it. Something that will not change—that will
                  not die. Oh, Arthur, death is horrible! I never, never want to die!"
                  And again the little maiden sobbed piteously.
               "Is God, then, so very good?" questioned Arthur, "to plant this longing in the
                  hearts of his creatures that nothing can ever satisfy? Is He so very good to make
                  us full of life and vigor, to place us in a world of beauty, which we cannot fail
                  to love, only to have our pleasure continually checked by the thought that we must
                  leave it all so soon—that we must lie down in the cold, dark grave—that these fair
                  and perfect bodies must become the food for worms—that we must shrink into
                  nothingness? It is horrible to die. Is God so very good, Dora?"
               "Arthur," said Dora, checking her sobs, and evading a reply, "I read the other
                  day, in a paper, that a little girl wondered, 'if the wrong side of Heaven was so
                  beautiful, what could the right side be?' Perhaps this thinking, longing part—our
                  souls—will be there on 'the right side,' Arthur?"
               "I rather think," said Arthur, with an effort to speak playfully, "that it is like
                  the painted shade at your window, yonder—the pretty colors are placed outward—we
                  see the brightest side. But come, Dora darling, your grandfather will be worried
                  if you stay longer in the evening air, and I desire to speak with him before I
                  leave."
               So the two slowly descended the hill, but lingered at the door of the cottage,
                  that was half buried in a grove of trees, that Arthur Elwood might clasp once more
                  the little maiden to his heart, who was dearer to him than all the world
                  beside.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               SIX years have passed away. Within that time many changes have been wrought within
                  the village of H——. The little cottage still peeps out from amid the elms and
                  maples at the foot of the hill; but the aged man who dwelt there, sleeps in the
                  church-yard at the other end of the village. A country church-yard! where the
                  grey-haired sire, and the youths and maidens, and the little children all sleep
                  together, with no fear of the unhallowed and revolting intrusions that in the city
                  mar even the burial places of the dead.
               But the little cottage is not left desolate; the minister and his wife dwell there
                  with the orphan Dora—the precious charge consigned to them by the one who passed
                  his life beneath its lowly roof.
               For six years the village church has been opened. It had been closed for a long
                  time; and for twenty years before its doors were shut they had been opened once
                  only on the Sabbath, for a cold and indolent preacher to read a sermon; who seemed
                  to think that in so doing he discharged his whole duty. It was not strange that
                  after his death there was no attempt to secure another, particularly as the spirit
                  of infidelity seemed to have been gradually undermining the spiritual condition of
                  the people.
               But now for six years the "glad tidings of salvation" have been faithfully and
                  constantly sounded. Through the sweet morning air steals the music of the
                  Sabbath-bells; while long trains of neatly dressed villagers may be seen hastening
                  to accept the gentle yet urgent invitation. And many a one who had once scoffed at
                  the name of Jesus of Nazareth, rejoices now to worship Him.
               Yes, the little cottage stands there still, and a dark-eyed maiden is sitting in
                  the porch; a maiden of rare and brilliant beauty. Her radiant face, as changeful
                  as the heavens, where smiles and blushes quickly come and go, is turned towards a
                  young man, whom six years of travel and of study have not so changed but that any
                  one can readily recognise Arthur Elwood.
                  He is seated close beside Dora, and has been talking to her long, in low, earnest
                  tones.
               "Yes!" he continued, "nothing has given me such joy since my return as to find you
                  so unchanged."
               A slight shadow fell upon the young girl's face. Soon she said, seriously, "You
                  are mistaken, Arthur; I have not intended to deceive you, but we have had no
                  opportunity, as yet, of talking together just as I could wish. I am greatly
                  changed."
               The feeling of surprise and pain that shot through Arthur's heart revealed itself
                  upon his features, and in the tone of his voice, as he said:
               "How, Dora? What do you mean? Am I to understand—"
               "That I am much happier," she replied.
               Arthur breathed more freely. "Oh!" said he, "I presume you mean you have become
                  infected with the church-going fever, like all the rest of the people here; it is
                  scarcely to be wondered at; I rather expected it, and am prepared for all sorts of
                  confessions on that point; but as you have not forgotten how to laugh, nor lost
                  any of your sweet, wild ways, I grant you absolution beforehand. I will not
                  quarrel with you on account of your opinions, for I flatter myself that they will
                  change in the course of a few years; yet, even if they do not, a little religion
                  will not make you any older or uglier. I find you still quite endurable. I feared
                  that you might be going to name a greater change."
               "A greater?" questioned Dora, for she knew of none that could be greater.
               "Yes; a greater, and to me a sadder one," continued Arthur. "I did not know but
                  the pure little heart that was once all my own, might be playing truant; that you
                  might be intending to place it in the keeping of some saint; instead of Arthur
                  Elwood's.
               Before Dora could reply, a middle-aged lady opened the door, and laying her hand
                  affectionately on Dora's shoulder, said gently—"Daughter, it is time for evening
                  worship." Then turning to Arthur, she said in a tone and manner that lacked
                  nothing of kindness and cordiality, "We would be well pleased to have Mr. Elwood
                  join us."
               Mr. Elwood declined.
               Yet the next day, and the next, saw him at Dora's side; but as his expressions of
                  endearment plainly showed how his attachment was shaping the current of his
                  thoughts, Dora grew more shy and reserved. There was often a look of painful
                  thought upon her face; and her wild, clear laugh, soon ceased to ring through her
                  cottage home; she grew pale and restless; her heart was sadly grieved. She had
                  attempted many times in her conversations with Arthur, to lead him to speak fully
                  and seriously upon the subject of religion. She longed to tell him how she knew by
                  experience that its "ways were ways of pleasantness and all its paths were peace."
                  She longed to reveal to him the everlasting truths upon which her soul was
                  feeding; to tell him how clear the way of salvation appeared to her; for the
                  memory of their parting conversation proved to her how ignorant he was of it. She
                  wanted to assure him that "Love was the fulfilling of the law;" and to tell him
                  how "God could be just, and yet the justifier of the sinner." Yet whenever she
                  would attempt this, Arthur would invariably change the theme of discourse in some
                  light and trifling way; he evidently desired to avoid touching any subject on
                  which they were at variance, but would dwell with delight whenever there was unity
                  of sentiment. He felt that it would be wiser to strengthen every tendril of
                  affection that drew their hearts so closely together; to make Dora feel how much
                  there was of sympathy and appreciation in his soul for her; how much there was of
                  similarity in their natural tastes and feelings, before he risked any open avowal
                  of their differences, which he could not but perceive were far greater than he had
                  at first imagined; he knew her to be actuated by motives to which he was a
                  stranger. And Dora felt this want of harmony—this soul-separation, keenly and
                  sadly. Dear as he was to her, unspeakably dear, yet her most precious thoughts and
                     feelings must be hidden from him; or,
                  if uttered, they were unresponded to. When her whole soul would be glowing with
                  love and gratitude to God, Arthur would speak eloquently and beautifully of
                  nature; but the words seemed cold to Dora, for the Christian heart must ever "look
                  up through nature unto nature's God." While she was striving to consecrate her
                  powers of mind and body to glorify Him who had "purchased her with his own blood,"
                  she would behold Arthur, ever ready to assist her in relieving the poor, generous
                  and tender, from the impulse of a naturally sensitive heart, and for her sake; but
                  never for his Master's.
               One day as Dora was returning from an errand of mercy, twilight and Arthur Elwood
                  overtook her at the same time. Drawing. Dora's arm within his own, and checking
                  her rapid pace, he said in a sorrowful tone: "Dora, you avoid me; you treat me
                  coldly. Are we not friends? Nay, are we not more?"
               "You know it," was Dora's almost inarticulate reply.
               Not another word was spoken until they reached the mossy stones that still formed
                  a rustic seat upon the summit of the hill.
               "Now let us watch for the new moon," said Arthur.
               "You remind me of a custom among the ancient Jews," said Dora. "The Feast of the
                  New Moon. The High Priest and the Sanhedrim used to assemble in their hall in the
                  temple on the evening of the new moon. Men were stationed on all the heights and
                  watch towers, and as soon as they perceived the silver crescent rising, they would
                  hasten to announce it at the Sanhedrim. Then the High Priest would say at once,
                  'The New Moon is hallowed.' The Sanhedrim would reply, 'It is hallowed.'"
               "May this be a hallowed one to us," said Arthur, fervently. "Hallowed by the
                  holiest of all emotions—perfect mutual love. Do you remember, Dora, when we last
                  sat here together?"
               "Perfectly."
               After a little pause she continued—
               "It was just such a night as this. Do you remember, Arthur, that I told you of my
                  dread of death? I have no such fear to tell of now, I have lost it."
               She paused again, as if waiting to be questioned; but he only said:
               "You cannot die yet, Dora, for I cannot spare you."
               "Do you remember, Arthur, that I told you too, that there was a yearning in my
                  soul that nothing could satisfy? It is met now—fully met. Oh! Arthur"—
               "Let me tell you of some of my memories," interrupted he. "Do you
                  remember that I said, many a maiden of twelve would utter freely what in a few
                  years she would seek to hide? Now, by the light of the new moon, I will test my
                  prophecy. Dora, do you love any one better than your old friend Arthur?"
               The tone of his rich voice, and the expression of his countenance, as he put this
                  question, touched Dora deeply. It was a white face that looked up to his, but
                  there was a calm, sweet rapture in the eyes, as she answered clearly—
               "Yes, Arthur, there is One."
               "Dora!"
               "Yes, Arthur," she repeated, "there is One who has ever been more tender to me
                  than you have in your tenderest moments; more forbearing, more forgiving than you
                  know how to be; who has done for me far more than you can conceive, or than I can
                  tell."
               "Surely, Dora, not more than I would be willing to do for you?"
               "Infinitely more. Your love, Arthur, can never equal His."
               "Believe me, Dora, I do not merit a reproach like this; surely my cup is full
                  enough without; and it is unlike you. Have you promised to be his?"
               "I have."
               The cold perspiration started upon Arthur's forehead; the blue veins seemed
                  swollen; his face grew rigid; he attempted several times to speak, but had no
                  power.
               "Arthur," she continued, "will you not love Him, too?"
               
               "Dora," said he, in a choked utterance, "if you are a woman, spare me!—have
                  mercy!"
               "He will be more merciful than I, dear Arthur," she continued, in the same clear,
                  yet tenderly beseeching tone, "'like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord
                  pitieth them that fear Him.'"
               A gleam of light dawned on Arthur's mind; with a sigh of inexpressible relief, he
                  murmured—"Dora!"
               How changed the tone! In a few moments he resumed—
               "I meant, is there any earthly friend, Dora, who is dearer to you than I?"
               Dora's lips quivered, and her voice trembled slightly, but she answered
                  unhesitatingly, "There is none."
               "Then how many new moons from this am I to number before my Yuca will be blooming
                  in my home? My pale, drooping little Yuca! Will you consent to come at once and
                  bide the influence of the moon?"
               Dora was silent.
               "There," continued Arthur, "am I not a true prophet? I have sundry recollections
                  of a little maid who once clung to me and begged me not to leave her, saying that
                  her sky would be dark; that the Yuca would never shine again were the moon
                  withdrawn. Now this same maiden sits in cold, dignified silence, when entreated to
                  dwell in the light of this luminous body; which, I must confess, partakes more of
                  the nature of a comet than of the moon."
               Still Dora was silent. At last, with a great effort, which her singularly
                  expressive face fully revealed, she murmured mournfully—
               "Dear Arthur, do not misunderstand me; do not doubt my affection; but—the Yuca
                  cannot be transplanted yet."
               "When can it be, dear Dora?"
               Again was Dora silent; and this time longer than before. At length she spoke,
                  while a chastened light shone in her eyes—
               "When you love Him whom my soul loveth."
               "Do you expect me to turn Christian first, Dora? Is that what you mean?" asked
                  Arthur, in astonishment.
               "I mean that I shall never marry an unbeliever. I shall never wed one who slights
                  or despises the meek and holy Jesus—my precious, precious Saviour! who left his
                  Father's side, His glorious home—who took upon Him this weak human nature—who
                  wandered here for more than thirty years, a suffering, persecuted being, that I,
                  that you, dear Arthur, might escape a just yet fearful doom. 'For all
                  have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.' 'Yet surely He hath borne our
                  griefs and carried our sorrows. He was wounded for our transgressions, He was
                  bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with
                  His stripes we are healed. All we, like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned
                  every one to his own way, and the Lord hath lain on Him the iniquity of us all.'
                  It is 'through Him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.' 'For it
                  pleased the Father that in Him should all fulness dwell.' I will never wed one who
                  will refuse to kneel before the Crucified One, and pray to Him for strength to
                  keep his marriage vow. Arthur, you have trampled long enough upon His precious
                  blood; you have neglected and despised His holy word, taking for your wisdom and
                  your guide the foolishness of men. Oh, Arthur—dear Arthur! be not
                  angry with me, but your heart is far, very far from the Kingdom of God; and
                  gladly, this night, would I lay my young yet weary head in the cold earth, and
                  never see the sunlight or the flowers again; gladly would I suffer all that any
                  mortal could endure, if I could thus effect your reconciliation with God!"
               "Dora, you are rash, hasty, unreasonable. Do not speak so positively. It may be
                  impossible for me to change. And would you cast me off forever for the sake of
                  what is, after all, a mere matter of opinion?"
               "A mere matter of opinion! Oh, Arthur, 'when the Son of Man shall come in His
                  glory, with the holy angels with Him,' will it be a mere matter of opinion whether
                  you are summoned to His right hand or to His left? Whether He says, 'Come, ye blessed of my Father,' or, 'Depart
                  from me, ye cursed?' Is all the joy and strength of this life, all the blessedness
                  of heaven, all the woe of hell, a mere matter of opinion? Is reality,
                  is truth—and oh, Arthur! you know and feel, in your soul's depths,
                  that there is truth—abiding, eternal truth—that God is true; and when he says that
                  'God so loved the world (so loved it, Arthur) that He gave his only 
                     begotton
                     begotten
                   Son, that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish, but have
                  everlasting life,' it is truth! And dare we stand and say it is a
                  mere matter of opinion? Reject it we may, but doubt it we cannot."
               "Dora, I do not want to argue such matters with you now. Yet I pledge you my word
                  that I will never interfere with your religious belief; and you do not know what
                  an influence you may have, in course of time, over even such a hardened wretch as
                  you seem to consider me."
               "'How knowest thou, oh, wife! that thou canst save thy husband?'" replied
                  Dora.
               Arthur paced up and down the hill-top in front of Dora for a long time, in
                  silence. He knew her nature well; the passionate intensity, the strength, the
                  depth of her affections; he knew that she spoke from firm conviction; he knew,
                  too, that the doctrines she held were hateful to him; but he felt, never more
                  keenly, that the being who held then was intensely dear. "Surely," thought he, "if
                  her love is at all proportionate to mine, it will be impossible for her to turn
                  from me."
               Dora still sat upon her mossy seat, pale and motionless. Arthur approached her,
                  and looking at her with earnest fondness, said, in a gently cadenced tone—
               "Dora, I have no mother; I have no sister; they are dead. My father is a cold,
                  proud man; proud of his wealth, and proud of his son—this seems the only bond
                  between us. His health is now so feeble it is thought necessary for him to travel,
                  and I shall be again compelled to leave my country home. We can start at any
                  moment, but had intended to await your arrangements, knowing that you would be
                  delighted lighted to visit those places where you have, in imagination, so often
                  been. I want to take you to Italy, Dora—to your mother's home. Do you remember how
                  you used to long to go? Have you lost that longing? Will you not come now, Dora?
                  Or can it be that my cherished Yuca no longer needs the moonlight? Will she
                  flourish better if it is withdrawn? Shall I—must I go without you, Dora?"
               He saw the pain he caused; for ever those red lips were colorless, and the
                  attitude of the form spoke volumes.
               "Tell me, Dora, must all the beautiful dreams that I have woven from my boyhood be
                  broken? Do you remember how I used to love to fill these little hands with
                  flowers, and to twine the rose and lily in these rich dark braids, and proudly and
                  fondly call you my queen? Dora, I will gather flowers for you, all my life; the
                  choicest and the fairest. It is all I have to live for. Will you not let me? Can
                  it be that you do not trust me?"
               "Arthur," said she, brokenly, "do not talk so. I cannot bear it. You must go
                  alone."
               Arthur sprung to his feet, exclaiming bitterly, "This is what religion
                  teaches!—that fond hearts are to be rudely severed; that vows are to be lightly
                  broken; that hopes, pure as the heaven you believe in, are to be ruthlessly
                  crushed; that we are privileged, at will, to blast the happiness of others. And
                  this is woman's love! When I have heard men sneer at the constancy of women, I
                  have smiled in my heart, as I thought, 'They know not my pure little Yuca!' When I
                  have read of the intense devotion of woman—of love all sacrifice and suffering,
                  'Such,' I would say, 'is Dora's.' But, behold, your affection cannot even bide the
                  test of a difference in opinion. Dora, you have never loved me. I am
                  satisfied, now, that you have been deceiving yourself; that you have never cared
                  for me as I have for you. Perhaps, when Freddie Mills comes from the seminary, you
                  will find less difficulty in consenting to become a priest's wife. I hope you will
                  be happy, and live in blissful forgetfulness of one who will not trouble you
                  again."
               
               This roused Dora; suddenly rising, she exclaimed—
               "Arthur! you are cruel—unkind—"
               "But you, Dora, you are kind—considerate—to inflict a life long wound upon a
                  loving heart; to bid me go out and drift through the cold world aimless, homeless,
                  friendless! I am all this without you."
               "Do I suffer nothing, Arthur?"
               The face that was lifted up to his was so white with anguish, the tone so deeply
                  stirred with grief, that, for a moment, the young man relented. But presently
                  turning away, he remarked—
               "I do not understand such self-inflicted suffering. You have it in your power this
                  night, Dora, of making a human being, one whom you profess to love, completely
                  happy; and I think I may safely say, of increasing your own happiness; or—of
                  banishing me from your presence forever. I tell you plainly, that I will never be
                  a Christian; that I have no desire to believe as you do. Yet, if you positively
                  refuse to accompany me, if you will not consent to-night to be my wife, I leave
                  this place never to return."
               Silently they descended the hill. At the cottage door they lingered. It is hard
                  for loving hearts to part in tenderness, with the hope of a speedy and happy
                  meeting; but oh! to part in coldness! to have the ties cemented by long years of
                  kindness rudely torn away in the passion of an hour—who can bear it?
               "Dora," said Arthur, with averted head, "your decision?"
               "You must go alone, dear Arthur."
               Not another word was spoken. Had he but touched her hand, her brow; had he but
                  uttered one farewell—had he oven looked upon her, she could have borne it better.
                  But without one caress—one word—one glance—he left her. The new moon shone upon
                  their second parting, but its fair lustre could not brighten the night of sorrow
                  that darkened those young hearts. Yet, "the new moon was hallowed."
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               "SURELY, surely, he will come again!" murmured Dora, as evening after evening
                  passed, but brought no Arthur. Then reports crept slowly through the village that
                  the Elwoods were about leaving the country. As the thought pressed itself upon her
                  that perhaps they were indeed parted forever, it seemed as though her
                  heart would burst with anguish.
               Oh! that she could see him but once more! was her constant sigh. Not that her
                  resolution was shaken, but that he might speak to her once more in kindness; that
                  he might once again say, Dora! At last, unable to endure the watching
                  and the waiting, she stole to her room and wrote, rapidly darkening the paper with
                  words and tears:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              ARTHUR—DEAR ARTHUR:
                           
                           You are angry with your little Dora. You are going far away: we may
                              never meet again. If you ever hear, Arthur, that the Yuca has
                              withered, will you not be sorry that you did not say kindly—Good-bye,
                              little Dora—before you left her? I did not want to reproach you,
                              Arthur, but I do not feel strong enough to bear your coldness—your
                              anger. There is such a crushing weight upon my heart, it seems as if
                              my soul was suffocating. Ah! were it not for Him "who is touched with
                              the feeling of our infirmities"—who says, "I will never
                              leave thee, nor forsake thee"—and that "As our day, so shall our
                              strength be," the Yuca soon would perish.
                           Oh, Arthur! I know that I have wounded you deeply; but are you
                              suffering alone? Alas! in one sense, utterly alone, for you have no
                              Heavenly support—no Comforter, to soothe and strengthen you in this or
                              in any future trial. I forget my own sorrow when I thus think of
                              yours.
                           I remember a little orphan girl who once lived all alone with her aged
                              grandfather. The child inherited her mother's passionate nature: who
                              was a true daughter of Italy. This did not please her grandfather, for
                              he was cold and quiet; so the child was lonely; until one day a youth
                              came with his father to visit them. And while the older ones talked,
                              the children looked into one another's eyes, and understood, and loved
                              each other. The little lonely, orphan heart found at once a home. Her
                              wildest imaginings were comprehended; there was ever a ready sympathy
                              for the passions of grief and joy; no cold or careless word was ever
                              uttered to check the outbursts of feeling that were native to her. And
                              he who was by turns her teacher, play fellow, lover, friend, had the
                              undivided affection of little Dora Raymond. A parting came. It was a
                              sad—sad time! A year went by; a long and lonely year. A strange lady
                              and gentleman had been living with Dora and her grandfather, but the
                              child would have nothing to do with them, for it was the minister and
                              his wife, and Arthur did not love them. Then Dora's grandfather was
                              taken ill; and oh! how kind they were. They read to him, and nursed
                              him, and prayed for him. The seventh night that he was sick he called
                              the child to him and said—"Dora, believe as these good people do;
                              listen to their teaching; receive it; obey it; for they are right."
                              The next morning he was cold and still, and never spoke again. Then
                              the child fell sick; she had
                              been grieving long for Arthur, and now death seemed so strange and
                              dreadful to her, that for weeks she lay in a burning fever, quite
                              delirious, and they thought that she too would die!
                           One day she had been sleeping; when she awoke she knew the kind face
                              that was bending over her; she recognised the minister's wife. She
                              saw, too, a book lying on the little table by her bed side. "What book
                              is that?" she asked. The lady looked pleased to see the child restored
                              to reason, and answered, oh! so sweetly: "The Bible, darling."
                           "Take it away! Take it away! Quick—quick; I will never have it near
                              me; I will never read it—never!" shrieked the child; for she thought
                              of Arthur's parting words—"Dora, do not read the Bible!"
                           The lady quietly removed the book; but the next day, when the child
                              awoke, she sat reading aloud, hidden by a screen. And she read sweet
                              and wondrous words. Oh! it made more music than the singing of the
                              birds. Day after day the lady sat and read, and the child listened
                              with increasing interest, until she could no longer hear of that
                              gracious Saviour asking: "Lovest thou Me?" without responding with
                              Peter: "Lord, thou knowest that I love thee."
                           So when the child grew well, she read the Bible for her Saviour's
                              sake; and kept longing for the time when Arthur should come, that they
                              might sit and read it together.
                           When Arthur came she had learned to love the Holy One more than she
                              did him; and desired to do all things for His glory. And she felt that
                              it could not be for His glory to wed one who loved Him not; for the
                              Bible says: "Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers."
                              "What part hath he that believeth with an infidel? Come out from among
                              them, and be separate, saith the Lord—and I will receive you, and will
                              be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters."
                              Again—"Can two walk together except they be agreed?"
                           Oh, Arthur! this parting is sad! sad! sad! Notwithstanding I am
                              conscious of doing right, my heart is sorely smitten. After looking
                              forward from my earliest years to the time when we should always be
                              together—when we should never, never more be parted—the sudden and
                              painful result of our last conversation almost crushes me.
                           I tell you of all this, dear Arthur, that you may know that I have
                              never forgotten any of your care and tenderness; that I am grateful to
                              you for the gladness you gave me in my childhood; for the love you
                              once bore me; nay! for the affection that you can never wholly stifle,
                              even if you try. And also, that when you think of my sorrow, it may
                              cause you to feel less sternly towards me. No one can ever take your
                              place; and when the spirit of Truth leads you into all Truth, when you
                              have taken my Saviour to be your Saviour, if I should be living, and
                              you should still be caring for your little Dora, she will be ready to
                              go with you anywhere, to work in Our Master's Vineyard; to dwell in
                              our hillside cottage, or far away in a distant land.
                           Arthur, I send you my little Bible. I have nothing more precious to
                              give you. I know that you will read it. Perhaps not right away; but in
                              some lonely hour, when your anger has all passed away, and softer
                              thoughts flow in, you will remember a little loving thing that clung
                              to you, and does still, dear Arthur, and amid the memories of our
                              great love and sorrow that will haunt you then, you will read it for
                              the giver's sake. And I shall pray that as you read, the Spirit of God
                              may make you "behold wondrous things out of his law."
                           Oh, Arthur! marriage is such a solemn, high, mysterious ordinance, So
                              holy—so significant! It is a type of Christ and His church.
                           The heads of a family ought to be the vicegerents of God. Every
                              household is intended to be a royal priesthood. The Father—the High
                              Priest. Who, without the grace of God, is sufficient for all this?
                           Ah! that preparation made by the High Priest before entering into the
                              "Holy of Holies," may well typify what an engagement of marriage
                              should be:—a time set apart for serious thought, and sanctified by
                              mutual prayer, so that we might indeed enter into this sacred relation
                              with reverence; with hearts humbled and purified, that
                              the deep spiritual purpose of wedded life would be answered.
                           Not marriage only, but life itself, dear Arthur, will have a mighty
                              meaning to you; it will be enlarged to new and noble depths, when you
                              have learned to study and to love the Bible. You will find, too, that
                              when you embrace the Saviour here revealed, how he can strengthen the
                              weakest; how he can enable a suffering, lonely, yearning, human heart
                              to endure and to live contentedly, rejoicing to bear, and to do His
                              will.
                           Good night, dear Arthur! May God convince you of your need, and lead
                              you to Himself, blessing you forever, prays
                           
                              DORA RAYMOND.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               A week went by; no answer came. The Elwoods had gone, but the little Bible was not
                  returned.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               TEN years have passed since that sad parting. The village has enlarged and
                  improved, so also has the church; and a pretty new rectory stands by its side.
                  Little Freddie, now the Rev. Mr. Mills dwells there; but he could not prevail upon
                  Dora to share his home, for she still thought ever upon one who was wandering
                  through the world, with his hopes blighted and his heart 
                     dimned
                     dimmed
                  ; so a fair, blue-eyed girl became the young minister's bride. Strangers
                  dwell in Dora's cottage; her faithful friends, the minister and his wife, have now
                  a home in a great city.
               But where is Dora?
               Far away on the shores of India she is telling the story of a Saviour's love to
                  the benighted heathen.
               "Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature"—sounded in her
                  ears. Moved with compassion for perishing souls, "constrained by the love of
                  Christ," Dora yearned to go forth to win souls precious as her own to Him; she
                  longed to reveal a waiting, pardoning, loving Saviour, to those sitting in the
                  "darkness of the shadow of death." But when she made known her desire, the tender
                  opposition, the loving remonstrances with
                  which she met, were hard to withstand; for Dora had become to the minister and his
                  wife as their own daughter; with all a daughter's love, with all a daughter's
                  privileges. Notwithstanding their ardent love for, and constant labor in the one
                  great cause, they were as yet unprepared to make this sacrifice—to give their "one
                  little ewe lamb!"
               How could they part with her? their only one! the developement of whose mind they
                  had watched with unceasing care and delight, for its unfoldings betokened talents
                  of a high order; the pen of the ready writer, and the tongue of the eloquent
                  conversationist. This rare jewel that was sparkling so brightly on the bosom of
                  the cultivated and congenial society by which they were surrounded in their
                  city-home, attracting, by its worth and brilliancy, the admiring gaze of all!
                  Could it be, that this uncommon beauty of personal appearance, these rich mental
                  gifts, were to be laid upon that one altar? Must the strong, peculiar
                  ties of love that bound these three fond hearts together, so soon be severed?
                  What! a delicate maiden, in her youthful beauty, to leave their watchful care and
                  tenderness, to go far away from everything her heart held dear, to dwell amid
                  strangers, surrounded by barbarism, which, to her sensitive nature and refined
                  taste, would be so excessively abhorrent—how could it be? "Ah!" they would whisper
                  sadly to each other, "If she were going forth with a companion; some chosen one to
                  whom she had plighted her young faith, to whom she could look for guidance and
                  protection, we could bear it better!" for they knew so well that woman's life is
                  in her love; such is her nature that she joys to labor and to suffer with the
                  loved one. But no such attraction tempted Dora Raymond; no such alleviation
                  softened her pathway. Yet, with unshaken resolution, she spent two years in
                  careful, thorough preparation for the great work, and, at the age of twenty-two,
                  went forth alone to teach the religion of our Lord Jesus Christ to
                  the benighted heathen in India.
               God only witnessed the struggles of that young spirit when the hour of parting
                  came; the blessed Saviour alone could soothe those intense heart-pangs which were
                  hers, as she bade adieu to her many warm and admiring friends, to the social
                  circle of which she had become the very life; to the faithful pastor whom her
                  heart called "father!" to the lovely being to whom, "with a gush of
                  feeling that no time could tame," she had long since given the holy name of
                     "mother!" to her beloved country, whose green hills she was to
                  tread no more, nor gaze again on its scenes of marvelous beauty— 
                     
                        "The land of her birth!
                        The fairest, the dearest, the brightest on earth!"
                     
                  
               
               Yet Dora knew that the One who had given her power, not merely to break sweet,
                  girlish dreams of ideal bliss, but to restrain the almost irresistible promptings
                  of a love that had grown too deep into her soul ever to be quenched—that first
                  love of her youth! which, in her impassioned nature, "warmed every vein, and beat
                  in every pulse"—He who gave her power to surrender at His word that precious,
                  coveted treasure, that choicest boon, the consummation of her early love—to walk
                  by Arthur's side, to share his life—surely He would not forsake her now! No! she
                  would go forth believing that "as her day so would her strength be:"—"claiming God
                  as her Father, Heaven as her home, and redemption by the blood of the Lamb as her
                  everlasting portion." She went forth alone!—yet "leaning upon the arm
                  of her Beloved!"*
                  —a spectacle for men and angels! an unsullied picture of heroic grandeur!
                  rather, a sublime proof of the strength of Jesus made perfect in weakness: and
                  were there not another such example in the world, it alone would be sufficient to
                  prove the vigor of Christian principle; the power of Gospel-truth upon
                     one mind and heart; and yet more, the perfect sufficiency of
                     Jesus, the believer's portion.
               
                  
                  *Miss THEODOSIA BARKER sailed under similar circumstances as Missionary to
                     China at the early age of seventeen.
               
               There is nothing which so proves the truth of Christianity, which so clearly
                  demonstrates to the world the sincerity of those who have embraced it, the reality
                  of their convictions, and the power of
                  the Gospel over their minds and hearts, as the lives of our
                     Missionaries.
               
               No candid mind can read the life of Henry Martyn, of Judson, of Samuel Mills, or
                  of any other God-directed man, and call their zeal and devotion to the noblest
                  cause in which the energies of man were ever enlisted, mere
                     enthusiasm.
               Truth ever carries with it irresistible conviction. We may struggle to free
                  ourselves from its firm grasp; we may close our eyes to shut out her steadfast,
                  penetrating gaze; we may even encourage our imagination to picture her calm, pure
                  features distorted into the grimaces of Error; but her grasp is too firm to be
                  shaken off, her glance too deep to be forgotten, her features too singularly her
                  own to be mistaken; and every soul will be forced some day to bow
                     publicly at her shrine, and yield (even though it be an unwilling
                  homage) the honor due unto her name.
               And what can so hasten that glorious day as Missionary labor? What so
                  arrest and convince the minds of the careless and unbelieving of our own
                     land as Missionary intelligence? What so stir the hearts of
                     believing ones, urging them to greater diligence, to more earnest
                  effort, than these same "glad tidings?" Or what can make us press more unitedly or
                  more closely in the footprints of the first great Missionary, our gracious
                  Saviour, than to view the bright example of some frail child by whose glowing
                  light we plainly see that He will give to the weakest of us grace and strength to
                  be as He was in this world?
               "God created man in his own image." Never does he seem more God-like
                  than when, in the noble spirit of self-denial, he rises superior to all the
                  allurements of luxury and ease, resisting the inclination of a delicate taste for
                  refined and cultivated society, severing the tenderest yet strongest tie woven
                  around the heart of man, domestic love, resigning all this
                  cheerfully, nay joyfully, at the voice of his Beloved—"Arise, and come away."
               Yet we naturally look to man for great deeds, for noble achievements, whether it
                  be in the physical, intellectual, or moral world: he is fitted to cope with
                  difficulties, and to endure hardships; consequently, whenever we idealize him, we
                  make of him a hero. Therefore, when a young man, in the first flush
                  of vigorous manhood, with the glowing energies and buoyant feelings of youth, just
                  blending with the deepened and more expansive thought of maturer years, with
                  talents that would make him the very life of the social circle, or win for him the
                  plaudits of a multitude who would crown him with the diadem of fame—when such a
                  one comes forward, and lays every gift upon this one altar—at a Saviour's
                  feet—counting it a priceless privilege to forsake all, that he may bear one gleam
                  of light to some far off, darkened land,—although he commands our highest
                  admiration, and deepest sympathy, yet the consecration is not as sublimely
                  touching as when the devotee is a woman!
               
               Delicate, shrinking, dependent woman! formed to be cherished and protected; ever
                  seeking, like the tendrils of some vine, for something to cling to, to lean upon;
                  her heart ever tremulous with 'flushing sympathies' and intense yearnings for
                  affection; trembling with exquisite joy of sorrow, like the petals of some
                  delicate flower at every passing breeze. What a contrast to the high, bold,
                  courageous heart of man! Tell me, what could so nerve that timid heart, or sustain
                  that shrinking spirit, that it could go forth alone, a
                     stranger, to some sin and sorrow-darkened clime, to whisper if it
                  be to but one erring soul—"The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us
                  from all sin." Would you tell me it was enthusiasm, or girlish dreams of romance?
                  There is not a soul in the Universe but what, should it answer true to its own
                  convictions, would say—it is prompted by the Spirit of God, and
                  upheld by the Arm of Omnipotence.
               
               I said ten years had passed since that sad parting. During four of those years
                  Dora had resided in a great city, where the minister and his wife, under God's
                  good Providence, had been called to labor in a wider sphere, and where they are
                  still telling the sweet story of the Cross, "praising God, and having favor with
                  all the people. And the Lord is adding to the Church daily such as shall be
                  saved."
               
               During the four years that Dora remained with them there, she enjoyed great
                  advantages, and gathered rich materials to carry with her to the far-off isles, to
                  aid her in her holy work of love, which she has been diligently pursuing, amid
                  trials and discouragements for nearly five years: yet feeling that her efforts
                  have been more than blessed, as she numbers the little band of redeemed ones,
                  that, through the instrumentality of her faithful teaching and unceasing prayers,
                  and by the light of her beautiful example, have been won to renounce their idols,
                  and to serve the true and living God.
               Ah, Dora! there is a crown awaiting you in glory, radiant with the light reserved
                  for those that "turn many to righteousness," which you may well cast low at the
                  foot of Him who has thus given you grace to conquer. And yet, before you wear that
                  crown, there is an earthly joy in store for you that you dream not of. The prayers
                  that daily and nightly you have offered in Christ's name, for one whose wanderings
                  pierced your young soul with woe unutterable, have been heard and answered.
               For lo! amid a package of letters just received from her loved America, is one
                  that Dora little thought to see. It reads thus:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              DORA:
                           
                           I am coming to labor with you. If the will of God be so, the next
                              steamer will bring me to your side. I have been sick and have suffered
                              much in many ways since last we met. Yet I am richer than when we
                              parted, for I have found the "pearl of great price." From the time
                              that I found this treasure, from the moment that I asked humbly and
                              sincerely, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" my way was clear. I
                              felt it to be my highest privilege to carry light to those who sit in
                              darkness. And I have been preparing, or rather, I trust that the Lord
                              has been preparing me, to be a faithful missionary in a foreign
                              land.
                           Last week I made my way to our village, believing the report that
                              reached me long ago, that you and Freddie Mills were living happily
                              together in the new Rectory; but I longed to see you once again, if
                              only to ask your forgiveness for the pain I once caused you, and to
                              bless you, Dora, for the peace and joy that is now my portion. I then
                              heard for the first time, can I say with what delight? that my Yuca
                              was blooming on a foreign shore.
                           Your little Bible, Dora—your precious gift, has been dearer to me than
                              aught else in the world. I did not read it, nor the letter that
                              accompanied it, for many a long month. I had not the heart to return
                              it, nor did I dare to trust myself to look on words that you had
                              written, for I was trying to steel my heart against you, and
                              endeavoring to believe myself deeply injured; yet I knew that a single
                              word from you would bring me at once to your side; therefore I opened
                              neither.
                           I had said that I would not be a Christian, and oh! how long did I
                              resist the strivings of the Spirit. My early education, under the
                              superintendence of a French infidel, my constant intercourse with him
                              for six years, as my traveling companion, and the sad fact of my
                              having given myself much to the study of strange German philosophies,
                              had well nigh annihilated any feeling of devotion or reverence that I
                              might once have had. I was, as you know, a professed infidel; yet, in
                              heart, I never once doubted the existence of God, nor do I believe
                              there is a living man who does.
                           Dora, when I was last in France, I was summoned to the bed-side of a
                              dying man; it was my tutor, Mr Deluce. What passed is too horrible to
                              relate. Suffice it to say, he sought repentance carefully, but found
                              none. Like Esau, he cried out for a blessing, but he had long since
                              bartered it away.
                           After that I read your Bible; and I found, indeed, that "the word of
                              God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword,
                              piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the
                              joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of
                              the heart."
                           I was convinced of its truth. Your words occurred to me. Doubt I could
                              not, but reject I could, and did.
                           Soon after this my father died, and died believing, through the
                              instrumentality of a converted sailor. He sleeps beneath the blue
                              waves of the Atlantic. Still I refused to yield to that Power which,
                              sooner or later, we must acknowledge Almighty! I wandered about the
                              earth, a miserable, aimless being, wasting the precious time and
                              talents allotted to my keeping. I shudder to recall those misspent
                              years.
                           Then sickness, and a train of painful circumstances overtook me. I
                              awoke once in the middle of the night, and it seemed to me that I
                              heard you say—"Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord
                              pitieth them that fear him." Then again—"God so loved the
                              world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on
                              Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
                           Again I turned to your Bible, and read it as I had not before, with
                              earnest prayer, and my eyes were opened; by its purity, I beheld my
                              exceeding sinfulness: yet at the same time I saw the Saviour, "full of
                              grace and truth"—"altogether lovely!" and understood perfectly, how
                              and why we could be "accepted only in the Beloved." Then how clear and
                              refreshing seemed the truths you uttered on the hill-side, the night
                              of that bitter yet fruitful parting; aye, fruitful! for you convinced
                              me then of the reality of your piety and the preciousness of your
                              Saviour.
                           I then wrote to you immediately, but I suppose the letter never
                              reached you, as I received no answer. And now, that I have come to
                              seek you, I find a lonely village without my Dora; a lonely cottage by
                              the hill-side without my flowering Yuca. But I trust that we will
                              watch together as in years gone by, the new moon of the coming April.
                              May it be indeed a hallowed one! for underneath its mild radiance we
                              will not only renew our vows to each other, but consecrate ourselves,
                              all that we have, and are, to the service of Him whom we will strive
                              yet more earnestly, to "worship in the beauty of holiness." For from
                              henceforth, dear Dora, with the
                              permission that I humbly believe you will not withhold, "Whither thou
                              goest I will go. Where thou lodgest, I will lodge. Thy people shall be
                              my people, und thy God shall be my God. Where thou diest, I will die,
                              and there will I be buried."
                           
                              Your repentant friend,
                              ARTHUR ELWOOD.
