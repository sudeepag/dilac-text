                              To-night the winds begin to rise
                              And roar from yonder dropping day,
                              The last red leaf is whirled away,
                              The rooks are blown about the skies;
                           
                           
                              The forest cracked, the waters curled,
                              The cattle huddled on the lea;
                              And wildly dashed on tower and tree,
                              The sunbeam strikes along the world.

                  FOR three days a north-east storm had desolated the coast of New England. It was late in September, and it seemed as if this cold and dreary rain had utterly beaten out and destroyed the lingering life of the expiring summer. Already the landscape assumed a gray and wintry aspect. The grass parched brown with the heats of August, was now crushed and sodden with the accumulated moisture. So many leaves and branches had been torn from the trees by the violence of the gale, to strew the earth and encumber the way, that the nakedness of late autumn was anticipated, and the pride of the forest was laid low.
                  Along the winding shore the sea swelled in sullen rage, dashing itself with low mutterings into the sheltered bays and coves, and beating with a defiant roar on one bold promontory montory that stood out in the gloomy waters. Here, on a bleak hill side, was a lonely and deserted burial-ground.—Over it the bitter winds swept with a mournful wail, below it the restless waves moaned a ceaseless dirge.
                  Not a single tree sheltered this dismal cemetery from the fury of the elements. It was surrounded only with a dilapidated fence, in some places fallen to decay. The soil, barren and stony, was scarcely concealed by a thin and straggling growth of coarse grass. The close lying graves were heaps of pebbles which the storms of successive winters had in many places washed into unsightly hollows. Most of the monuments were the ancient grey head-piece, rudely sculptured with the melancholy skull and cross-bones, tokens of the inevitable decay over which they kept guard. There was no attempt to enclose the meagre territory into lots; whatever marks of division had once existed were lost in the lapse of time, so that those who had once been enemies or strangers, now slept, peacefully, side by side.
                  The whole aspect of the place was utterly desolate and forsaken, in direct contrast with the lovely village nestling among the hills, the spire of whose church gleamed above the fringe of trees that stretched between the home of the living and the prison of the dead. It seemed strange that such a site should have been chosen for the last resting place of those who in life had been cherished and beloved at happy firesides, but it is said in New England the spirit of economy is so all-pervading that the thrifty farmers choose out fields, too barren to be of any agricultural use, and give these for the gardens of the Lord.
                  On the third afternoon the passion of the storm was past, the tears of heaven no longer fell on the sullen earth, and the winds had subsided to an occasional long-drawn sob.—But the clouds still hung in dark, heavy folds like an impenetrable veil before the face of the sun, the air was chill and damp, and a pallid mist floated on the murky horizon.
                  The burial ground wore an aspect of forlorn despair, as the shadows of the coming twilight crept over it. The water stood in yellow pools on the guttered ground, the gray stones were dripping with chill moisture. A white marble tomb—the only one in the enclosure—looked down wan as a ghost, on an open grave that had been freshly dug beside it.
                  To this spot, in the gathering gloom of the expiring day, came a little band of mourners, and silently took their places around it. At the head of the dark pit stood the pastor, a young man, tall and graceful, in his pure white robes, with a calm sad face, and that look of holy love and tenderness stamped upon the features that we fancy must have beamed out in the God-given beauty of the beloved disciple. Close to him knelt a young girl so draped in her sable weeds as entirely to conceal both face and figure. She had been supported to the place by the clergyman, for he was her cousin, and mourned with her over the grave of her father; but when the service began, she released her hold on his arm and drew back a little, standing alone for a few seconds, and then, with a sob, sinking down on the base of the monument. It rose above her, cold and still, bearing on its front the name "Sandys," and an inscription recording the deaths, for three generations, of the family in whose honor it was reared.
                  No other relatives of this last male of his race, who was now laid to sleep beside his ancestors, were present. The rest of the group who surrounded his daughter were sympathizing neighbors and friends. His widow was not there; but, standing at the head of the grave, almost usurping her place, was a stately and beautiful woman. Her age must have nearly corresponded with that of the stricken wife who mourned at home, though her large black eyes burned with undiminished lustre, and her glossy black hair, unmarked by a single thread of silver, rolled back in luxuriant masses from a broad, clear forehead. At this moment her regular features were sharpened and set into a look of suppressed anguish that occasioned some surprise to those who knew that Mrs. Rockford was no more than an old acquaintance of the man on whose coffin she gazed so despairingly. She leaned on the arm of a handsome, dark-eyed youth, whose likeness to her was so strong that any stranger might have guessed he was her son. He was watching with pitying tenderness the bowed figure of Mabel Sandys, weeping at the foot of her father's tomb. When she sank down, he had started towards her, but feeling how closely his mother clung to his arm, and remarking with alarm her deadly pallor, he had restrained himself, and now stood supporting her with anxious care.
                  The service went on, the clear tones of the young priest's voice falling mournfully on the heavy air. The breeze that came up from the ocean passed across the hill in along whispering sigh; the chime of the waves rung with solemn monotony in the pauses of the prayers.
                  "Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust."
                  The first clods fell with that dull sepulchral sound that strikes such an appalling knell on the heart. An instant after, a short, sharp shriek startled the group. Those nearest her looked towards Mabel Sandys; but it was not her voice; she had only writhed and moaned at that awful echo, and even now did not look up or raise her head.
                  Upon the wet earth, almost across the yawning grave, lay the prostrate form of Mrs. Rockford. At that final moment her overtasked self-control had given way, and with that one cry wrung from her by the sharp grief which would no longer be restrained, she had fallen fainting on the ground.
                  There was a little confusion in the crowd, as her son, with the help of those who were near, raised her and bore her away. Some ladies followed, with offers of assistance, and then all was quiet again around the tomb. The last prayers were repeated, and the final benediction pronounced, with no other interruption than the low sobs of the fatherless girl.
                  As soon as the service was over, the young clergyman went to his cousin, and arousing her with a gentle whisper, led her away from the sad scene. The rest of the group gradually dispersed, speaking in subdued tones of their sympathy with poor Mabel Sandys in her great bereavement, and with wondering conjecture of Mrs. Rockford's extraordinary emotion.
                  Very soon there was no one left in the burial-ground but the workmen who remained to close the grave. Their task was not long in accomplishment, and then they too went off, disturbing for a few moments the sanctity of the spot with their loud laughter and ill-timed jests, then leaving it to utter silence.
                  The shadows of twilight gathered fast on the dark earth, For a short time the west burned with a dull crimson light; then it faded into impenetrable gloom, and night flung her black pall over the lonely hill and its cold sleepers.
                  A great hush succeeded the violence of the storm; the dying wind crept past with a shuddering moan, and the subsiding waters of the unquiet sea whispered a monotonous lament.
               
               
                  CHAPTER II.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "—There dwelleth here
                              Within this castle wall, a ladye fayre,
                              Whose sovraine beautie hath no living pere,
                              Thereto so bounteous and so debonayre,
                              That never any mote with her compare."
                           
                        
                        "FAIRIE QUEEN."—SPENCER.
                     
                  
                  MRS. ROCKFORD had recovered from her swoon almost before her friends reached the carriage. As they placed her on the cushions she opened her eyes and turned them slowly on the groups around her. They were clouded with a look of bewilderment and distress until they rested on the anxious face of her son; then, by an effort, she raised herself, and said, with a faint smile:
                  "It is nothing, do not be alarmed—the ground was very damp, I think it gave me a sudden chill, I had such a sharp pain here."
                  She pressed her hand to her heart with a gesture of suffering, then added, in an earnest whisper to her son, "Don't wait, Vinton, let us go home at once."
                  The young man looked relieved by the suggestion, and thanking their friends cordially for their kind offers, gave his orders to the coachman, and sprang in beside his mother.
                  Mrs. Rockford, who was rapidly gaining strength, looked up once to express her gratitude to the little group for their attentions, and then as the coach descended the hill, out of their sight, she threw herself back and closed her eyes again with a long sigh. At this her son, with fresh alarm, passed his arm around her, exclaiming:
                  "You are worse, mother dear; let me stop the carriage."
                  "No, no! do not on any account, I am only weak; let me lie here quietly a little while, and I shall soon recover," and she rested her head wearily on her son's shoulders.
                  —There is no tie of the heart more beautiful than that between a mother and her grown son. It combines the sympathy thy of friendship, the unselfishness of love, and the purity and sense of protection and support that belongs only to itself. Between these two it had ever been unusually strong; from his earliest infancy all the fondness of Mrs. Rockford's nature had centred itself upon this her only child, and at this moment she seemed to derive more consolation and power to conquer her emotion from his presence than from any restorative that could have been offered.—
                  For a time she remained entirely quiet, except for an occasional deep sigh, but as the carriage plodded slowly over the heavy road, she gradually subdued her agitation, and at last as they entered the village, she raised her head and looked earnestly at her son.
                  "Vinton," she said, "I must beg you not to mention this sudden attack to my husband."
                  "Certainly, mother, if you do not wish it," replied the young man, a little surprised.
                  "I was not well when I left home," she explained hastily. "It was doubtless imprudent for me to make such an effort as this has been, but years ago Mr. Sandys was a very kind—friend of mine, and it seemed but right that I should pay him this final tribute of respect."
                  "I am sorry father's absence obliged you to be out on such a wretched day," replied Vinton, "though I think it was quite right some of us should go to the funeral. I was glad to see such a respectable attendance."
                  "Yes, though I presume most of those present came from regard to Mr. Haughton who is a cousin of the Sandys, you know. But it is pleasant to see such kindness to strangers."
                  "It is a long time since Mr. Sandys lived here, is it not?" asked Vinton.
                  "Twenty years! not since—not since he was married," said Mrs Rockford musingly.
                  "And now Mrs. Sandys and her daughter have returned to his old home."
                  "Yes, and I am very glad to hear it, they will find Herford rather a contrast to Boston, but we must do what we can to make them content. Mrs. Sandys was an old school-mate of mine, and I believe you know them both."
                  "Yes, last term at Harvard. You remember I wrote you about meeting them. Miss Sandys was much admired."
                  "Indeed! is she pretty?"
                  "I think she is very lovely," answered Vinton, with a faint blush, such as crosses the cheeks of ingenuous youth on the mention of a favorite name.
                  His mother did not notice it, they were nearing home, and she was busy in rectifying the slight derangement which her neat costume had suffered during her past excitement. The unusual emotion to which she had yielded was now once more suppressed, and although she still felt weak, she exhibited no external marks of suffering except a certain paleness in lips and cheeks, and an unwonted languor in her lustrous eyes.
                  Herford was a very pretty place, lying in the midst of green meadows and waving woods almost on the margin of the sea. On the broad street up which the carriage was now passing, there was a pleasant assemblage of old fashioned cottages shaded with gnarled cherry and mulberry trees, and modern villas surrounded with ornamental shrubs and flowers. Among these the fairest exponents of the two extremes, were the venerable Sandys house with high gables and wide piazzas, which stood beside the gray church that had been reared by the founder of the family in Herford, and Mr. Rockford's stately mansion situate on a slight hill that rose at the end of the village.
                  It was built of the native brown stone, in that substantial cube that allows the greatest amount of room and comfort attainable in a given space. The stiffness of its outlines was broken by several deep bay windows and the tasteful verandah that ran across the front, so that it was really an elegant and pleasing building. It had moreover the advantage of being shaded by several splendid trees, which are to a house what well arranged masses of hair are to a face, they give a certain softness and harmony to the whole that can never be obtained by mere beauty of proportion. From the foot of these elms down to the base of the hill the grass rolled in one unbroken emerald carpet, the remarkable fineness of this turf had given the place its name of Rockford-lawn, though the groves of elms and chesnuts that swept around it on either side were almost equally deserving of honor. Within the iron railing that surrounded the domain was a hawthorn hedge, and near the house itself there were a few beds of choice flowers, but on the whole the aspect of the place was rather that of solidity and wealth than luxury or taste.
                  The carriage passed over the gravel road and drew up before the broad piazza. Vinton sprang out and carefully helped his mother to alight. Notwithstanding her assurances that she was quite well, he tenderly assisted her up the steps, and she rested upon him as if there were something comforting in his touch; so together they entered the wide hall which was already nearly dark in the overclouded twilight. As they stepped into its shade, there was a soft rustle of silk, and a young lady advanced from one of the parlors.
                  "Well, Aunt, safely home?" she said in a cheery voice. "You did not get wet, I hope."
                  "No, Edith, at least not much," replied Mrs. Rockford, releasing her son's arm, and going towards the stairs.
                  "Let me go up with you?"
                  "No, thank you, it is not worth while," then as she saw that her niece still continued to advance, she added:
                  "Indeed, Edith, I would rather be alone," and to her son, "Don't wait, Vinton, I am very well."
                  She ascended the stairs slowly, but steadily, and the two young people turned away. Vinton went towards the library, and Edith returned to the parlor. She crossed the room to the bay window and passing under the curtain, stood in the space beyond with the crimson light of the dim sunset falling on her face and figure.
                  She was young and beautiful.
                  Ah! what pleasure and power lie in those two words! How all the sunniest memories of a woman's life, cluster in that enchanted period, when both those faerie gifts unite to make their possessor a Queen!
                  "Il ne sert de rien d'être jeune sans être belle, ou d'être belle sans être jeune."
                  How much then is it worth to be both young and beautiful?
                  Edith Rockford was superbly handsome, not with that mere delicate prettiness that we see so often among our fair American women, but with that abounding luxuriant beauty that fairly dazzles and enthralls the most indifferent observer. She was a golden blonde, with pure complexion, marvelously white in the brow, but blooming into roses on the cheeks and chin, and into carnations on the exquisite lips; her eyes were large and sparkling, their hue that translucent hazel, so rare and so brilliant, and her hair! how can I describe the shining net that caught so many hearts? Rich auburn waving in glorious masses around her graceful head, or flowing in tawny curls over her sloping shoulders. In stature she was a little above the middle height, her figure full yet withal not lacking in lightness. With a foot like Catharine de Medici's, and a hand like Anne of Austria's.
                  Edith was Mr. Rockford's orphan niece, the only child of his youngest brother. Her father had left her a small property, which rendered her independent though not wealthy. She had lived since his death, ten years ago, with her uncle, and had been, during the last two seasons, the reigning belle of the city. She was two years younger than her cousin Vinton, being at this time a little over twenty. She was warm-hearted, impulsive and generous, though sometimes almost unconsciously a bit of a flirt, yet with a true and tender woman's nature, amiable to a fault, and with far less of vanity or coquetry than might have been readily excused, as the natural result of the attention and admiration which had been lavished upon her.
                  —I often wonder what would be the effect upon a man's vaunted constancy of such a course of flattery as any average pretty woman is subjected to. Imagine an individual of good sense and calm judgment, surrounded constantly by a set of fascinating ladies, who were only too happy to be his slaves, complimenting him perpetually on his "fine eyes," his "faultless complexion, "and his "superb dancing;" fancy him serenaded at night, visited by day, presented with bouquets, and from time to time receiving an honest offer of marriage from persons whose happiness was but too plainly bound up in a favorable answer. What, I say, would be the probable result of such an intoxicating process on the character of any young man? Would it not render him so utterly conceited and heartless that he would be quite unendurable? Yet the successful belle is blamed for an innocent fondness for gayety and admiration! I do not mean to imply that I think such an ordeal favorable to the development of the best qualities of a woman's nature, but considering that from the necessities of the case, it is utterly impossible for a beauty to avoid this adulation, fair allowance ought to be made for its effects, and credit given for resisting its evil results.—
                  Edith had but shortly returned from Newport, where she had been spending some part of the season with her friends, the Granthams, and she was truly glad to be at home again, and quiet after the whirl and excitement in which the last few weeks had been passed. It was not, however, possible for her to escape from the homage of her adorers; one of them had already followed her to Herford, and under pretense of a visit to a friend, had been for the last week devoting himself to her, while a second, whose home was in the village, had languished like a flower without the sun in her absence, and was at this moment on his way to Rockford lawn.
                  Unconscious or forgetful of those captives their queen stood watching the dull mist that crept over the trees and around the house, with a half sad expression on her lovely face. What could be the thought that clouded it with that shade of tender regret?
                  She was roused from her reverie by the entrance of the servant with lights, and very soon after it was entirely dispelled by his return to announce "Mr. Fay," followed immediately by the entrance of a slender and graceful young man, who would probably have been pronounced "irresistibly handsome," by any sentimentally inclined school-girl. His hair of the fairest flaxen, curled around a small but not ill-shaped head, his eyes of an extremely light blue, were guarded but not shaded by lashes so colorless that they were almost invisible, his features were regular and delicate, and he had very neat teeth. On the whole, his appearance was not unpleasing though decidedly effeminate.
                  At first he did not see Edith where she stood within the shade of the curtain, and as she raised it and came out to meet him, he started and flushed visibly.
                  "Good morning, Miss Edith," he said with a faint lisp, and extending a hand white and soft as a woman's. "Upon my word, you quite startled me."
                  Edith shook hands with him frankly, and asked laughingly, "Am I then so very ghostly?"
                  "No indeed! more like an angel!" This was given with a tinge of enthusiasm and a faultless bow.
                  "Merci!" replied Edith carelessly, as she seated herself on a lounge. Mr. Fay took a chair near, and ventured a remark on the weather.
                  —Now I know that it is generally conceded to be rather stupid and common-place to begin a conversation in this ancient and threadbare style; but after all, scarcely a topic can be suggested of such universal and unfailing interest. All our plans and pursuits are affected by the state of the atmosphere, and the latest news in regard to it is always acceptable. How important a part has the weather played in many of the great events of the world's history. Did not the cloudless glory of the setting sun lose the battle of Poictiers for the dazzled French? and did not the elements fight England's battles against the "Invincible Armada"? Who has forgotten the eager watching of beleaguered Leyden for the East wind that was to bring release? or the fatal mist that snatched victory from our arms at Germantown?
                  Doubtless at this very moment many poor sailors were hoping for the truth of Mr. Fay's first suggestion
                  "I think the storm is over, but what a dismal time we have had, the walking is perfectly atrocious."
                  "I wonder you dared venture out," said Edith, with a mischievous glance at his small and immaculate boots.
                  "I was well protected, besides I would go through any thing for you."
                  "Really? Anything? Even mud?"
                  "Yes, indeed," replied the young man innocently.
                  "That is very kind of you. I am certain after such an assurance one can rely upon you for immense sacrifices," continued Edith with dancing eyes.
                  "You have no idea how much I wanted to come out to-night."
                  "Ah!"
                  "Yes, it is so long since I have seen you."
                  "Is it? three days, I believe." Edith laughed heartily, and then exclaimed with a look of relief, "Ah! here comes Aunt Claudia."
                  Mrs. Rockford entered the room still slightly pale, but looking very handsome in her rich dress of dark silk, and the half cap of delicate lace that shaded her fine hair. Of course her niece knew nothing of her recent indisposition, but her thoughtful eye instantly detected her lack of color and as soon as the first greetings were over, she asked anxiously,
                  "Don't you feel well this evening, Auntie?"
                  "Thank you, Edith, I've a slight headache. That's all."
                  "The weather is enough to give any one the blues," observed Mr. Fay.
                  "I don't mind that," replied Mrs. Rockford, "I rather like a good storm."
                  "Do you? that's odd! I find them terrible bores."
                  "I half agree with you," said Edith. "I do not love clouds. I am a true worshipper of the sun."
                  "Yes, indeed, Edith is a creature of clear skies," assented Mrs. Rockford, looking affectionately at her niece, whose glorious beauty made her seem an incarnation of all brightness. "You know we sometimes call her Sunshine."
                  "Do you? I'm sure that's a very pretty name," lisped Mr. Fay.
                  "May I tell how you got it, Edith?"
                  "As you please," said Edith, rising, "only let me escape for a moment, I want to speak to Vinton."
                  As she went out, Mrs. Rockford turned to Mr. Fay and began her story.
                  "When Edith was about sixteen we gave a children's party for her. As she is not here I may say that she looked like a little faerie in her white dress and long floating curls. Among her young friends, there was one pleasant-faced lad who watched her from the first with undisguised admiration. He did not dance himself, but constantly hovered near her not seeming to care in the least for the other girls. Everyone noticed his devotion and there was a great laugh when at last it found expression. She had been waltzing while he stood watching, as usual; when the music ceased she paused near him radiantly lovely with her golden hair and laughing eyes. 'Oh, Miss Edith,' he exclaimed, enthusiastically, 'I'm so glad you have come back. It's just like Sunshine!'"
                  Meantime the subject of this little history had passed down the hall, and opened the door of the library.
                  "Vinton, are you there?"
                  "Yes, what is it, Edith?"
                  "Florance Fay is in the parlor, and I want you to come in and entertain him."
                  "Help you entertain him! why, I shall only bore you, Edith, I thought you admired him vastly."
                  "So I did at first, but——now Vinton, don't be a tease! he is handsome but then he is so silly and sentimental."
                  "And now that you have captivated him, you are tired of him. Ah! Edith, you're a sad flirt."
                  "No, I'm not," answered Edith quickly. "But how solemn you look, Vinton," then regarding him earnestly she added—"How thoughtless I am! I forgot the funeral, and your dear little friend Mabel; tell me about her? was she there?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Ah, poor thing! how terrible it must have been for her to bury her father among strangers."
                  "Yes, I pitied her from the bottom of my heart," said Vinton, tenderly.
                  "Was she all alone?"
                  "Yes, Mrs. Sandys was too ill to come out, and there was only her cousin, Mr. Haughton, but then you know he had to read service, so that she seemed to have no one to take care of her."
                  "Poor thing! poor thing!" repeated Edith, gently.
                  "Their family connection is small, I believe," continued Vinton, "and it seems it was Mr. Sandy's earnest request that they would lay him here with his parents, but it must be very hard for his wife and daughter to come away from their home and friends now. Ah, Edith! I cannot bear to think how sad Mabel must be, she was so devoted to her father, they were constantly together last winter. Mrs. Sandys went out very little, and he was always her companion."
                  "I am very sorry for her," said Edith, "but then she is young, Vinton, she will recover from this after a while, and I will do all I can to make her happy."
                  "I have no doubt of that, Sunshine," answered Vinton in a more cheerful tone. "But you are forgetting all about your poor adorer who is famishing for your presence."
                  "So I am!" exclaimed Edith starting up—"but come in soon."
                  "I will," promised Vinton, and she hastened back to the parlor, feeling rather guilty for having remained away so long. However, her aunt's first words reassured her:
                  "Our tea is late to-night, Mr. Fay, for I am expecting Mr. Rockford every moment; but I should be happy to have you wait for him."
                  "Thank you, madam," replied Mr. Fay with alacrity, and with a little sigh Edith saw him draw off his remaining glove and prepare for a longer stay. Yet she resigned herself to her fate with cheerfulness, and kept up a conversation of common places with such grace that her companion thought her amused, when in reality she only endured.
                  —How often it is the case that a man mistakes the well-bred attention of an amiable woman for interest! Such is the colossal vanity of the sex, that they sometimes derive encouragement from smiles that are the mere polite accompaniment of profound indifference!—
                  At the end of half an hour there was a sound of carriage-wheels crushing the wet gravel of the road, and Mrs. Rockford rose and left the room.
                  Mr. Thomas Rockford was a wealthy banker. His business no longer required his constant supervision, but still he went frequently to the city even in summer to satisfy himself of its progress by his personal inspection. He had now been absent for several days, and his wife went out to meet him with that punctilious courtesy, by which she endeavored to supply the place of affection. He was her senior by some fifteen years, a tall man with iron gray hair and beard, cold blue eyes, and a face of a stern though acute expression.
                  "How are you, Claudia? all well?" he asked gravely, and he shook hands with his wife coldly, as he might with a friend.
                  This was all, she answered his enquiry, and he went up stairs followed by a servant, while she returned to the parlor. After a while Mr. Rockford joined the party there, greeting Edith with a kiss, shaking hands cordially with Vinton, and welcoming Florance Fay with stately courtesy. His presence seemed to chill every one but his niece. Nothing could check the flow of her innocent gayety. She maintained a sparkling conversation during the formal supper, enlivening the guests with her little sallies, extracting smiles, and even some details of city news from her cold uncle.
                  When the meal was over they returned to the parlor with out him. Mrs. Rockford, who began to look very weary, placed herself half reclining on a lounge, the young people gathered around the piano. For a short time Florance Fay was happy in the undisputed possession of Edith's attentions, but before long his peace of mind was disturbed by the arrival of Mr. Ben Fordyce, an honest, reliable young fellow with bright eyes and an intelligent face, who made no secret of his admiration for her. At his appearance Vinton stole off to his mother's side, and his cousin, thus left to her own resources, took refuge in music as the safest mode of entertaining her rival friends. She began a sparkling waltz, Florance Fay leaned on the piano and turned the leaves of the notes with scrupulous precision. Although Edith assured him it was quite unnecessary, as she knew the piece by heart, he persisted because he fancied it would impress her with his knowledge of music; it was also a good opportunity of displaying his handsome hands. Fordyce, without a particle of jealousy, sat a short distance off, quite content to enjoy this opportunity of feasting his eyes on her beauty unobserved.
                  On the other side of the room Mrs. Rockford leaned languidly back on the cushions of the couch, making no secret of her fatigue to Vinton, until somewhat later her husband entered the room. At his approach she roused herself with an effort to appear alert, but she could not conceal her weariness from his quick eye.
                  "Claudia," he said, as he seated himself near her, "you are pale."
                  "Am I? my head aches badly."
                  He looked at her steadily, and then said slowly, "I understand George Sandys was buried here to-day."
                  "He was," answered Mrs. Rockford, with a slight contraction of the brow, though speaking quite calmly. Her husband watched her narrowly.
                  "Did you go to the funeral?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Alone?"
                  "No, Vinton was with me."
                  "Ah! and Edith?"
                  "No."
                  "Why did not she go?"
                  "I thought it too wet for her to be out."
                  "Yet you went yourself."
                  
                  "Certainly." This was said in a half contemptuous tone, and Mr. Rockford changed the attack.
                  "Sandys died suddenly, did he not?"
                  "I do not know."
                  "How old was he?"
                  For a moment Mrs. Rockford did not reply, this questioning was slow torture. Her husband repeated the enquiry.
                  "How old was he, Claudia?"
                  "Forty-five," and this time her voice did not falter; she returned his gaze with firmness.
                  "So young? I think," he added in a moment, "it was scarcely worth while for you to go out in such weather."
                  At this Vinton, who had looked on with surprise and terror during the short colloquy, interposed—
                  "I beg pardon, sir, but I must say it seemed no more than kind to go. They were such strangers here."
                  "True," replied Mr. Rockford in a softened tone. "After all, it was but a tribute to the dead."
                  He turned away, and after freezing the group at the piano with a few measured compliments, left the room. Vinton lingered at his mother's side, doing his best to make up by his devotion for whatever unknown wounds she might have received. And so the evening wore away.
                  As in duty bound, Florance Fay was the first of Edith's friends to bid adieu. He did so with an airy grace that would have done credit to Lord Chesterfield, and departed to the immense relief of Fordyce, who now had an opportunity for making the request he had been wishing to urge all the evening.
                  "Miss Edith, may I ride with you to-morrow?"
                  "Yes," replied Edith, pleasantly, "if the roads are not too heavy."
                  "What time may I come?"
                  "About four o'clock, if you like."
                  "Thank you. I should be glad to stay longer," he said, as he rose, "but I know I ought to go. Your aunt looks tired."
                  This considerateness on his part was not lost on Edith, and she shook his hand so cordially that he went off supremely happy.
                  In another hour the house was all quiet. Edith was in her own little "Maiden's bower," as pretty a room as any lady might wish, with cool matting on the floor, clear lace curtains around the windows and bed, and that air of purity and sweetness that ever pervades such spots. As she stands before her mirror, loosing her glowing hair from its confinement, her eyes wander carelessly over the numerous cards that adorn the frame, until caught by one in a prominent place, she takes it down, and with a half smile parting her pretty lips, reads the name— 
                        MR. PERCIVAL DENBIGH, New Orleans.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER III.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "This is love, idle love
                              Such as kindle hearts that rove."
                           
                        
                        MOORE'S MELODIES.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Beauty is a witch
                              Against whose charms faith melteth into blood."
                           
                        
                        MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.
                     
                  
                  THE next day proved to be bright and cloudless. There was still a lingering chilliness in the air, a reminder that the softness of summer was indeed gone, but nature smiled with a cheerful aspect and had still much of grace and beauty left. So we often see a life over which the storms of sorrow have swept while it was yet young, when the clouds have passed away calm into tranquil happiness, we know that the freshness of youth is forever fled, but we feel that it may still enjoy the calmness of resignation and be bright with the sunshine of content.
                  Mr. Ben Fordyce was visiting an old classmate who had married and now spent his summers in Herford. In calling to mind Fred Howard's invitation at this particular time, it is probable that he was not wholly actuated by a desire to renew his old friendship though doubtless very glad to have an opportunity of seeing once more his chum and the pretty wife who had changed him from a rollicking bachelor to a quiet domestic man. Ben had met Edith at Newport, and been completely dazzled and captivated by her beauty. Without asking himself how far his heart was really touched he had followed her to her home, having still a fortnight of holiday left before he must return to work. He had been in Herford a week and had improved his opportunities, so far that he was considered as a valued friend by all at Rockford lawn; while every visit he made laid him more entirely and blindly under the spell of Edith's loveliness.
                  Of course in his present state of mind he was eager to seize any possible excuse for being with her. Now he knew that she rode nearly every day either with her uncle or cousin or some chance escort, and as he was a good horseman, and fond of the exercise, it had been the height of his ambition to be able to act as her esquire on such an occasion. Thus far he had been prevented by the difficulty of obtaining a decent mount, the village hacks were really such sorry beasts he had been ashamed to offer the insult of such low-lived companionship, to the high-bred filley that he knew had the honor of carrying Edith. Finally, however, the obstacle was overcome. Fred Howard had succeeded in procuring the steed of a certain Mrs. Marvin, which he represented to Ben as being "quite a fine looking animal and not bad to go." When he saw the creature in question Ben hardly thought it up to what Fred had led him to suppose, however, it was then too late to make a change. Accordingly at four o'clock he appeared at Rockford lawn, bestriding a sleek grey horse, looking a trifle oldish about the head, but on the whole presenting a highly respectable appearance.
                  He had not long to wait in the parlor before Edith appeared, handsome as Artemis in her riding costme. There is no dress more universally becoming to women than this. There is something so captivating in the contrast between the half-masculine attire and the feminine beauty it adorns. Edith wore a habit of dark green cloth which displayed her round figure admirably well, and a broad-leafed black hat with floating feathers that shaded her auburn locks into rich chestnut.
                  A groom lead up her poney, which was a graceful, spirited little creature, with a rich bay coat that shone like burnished gold. Fordyce was allowed to assist her to mount. For an instant that little booted foot rested in his hand, making him feel an intense envy of the horse-block which had the pleasure of supporting that light weight every day.
                  "That's an exceedingly pretty nag of yours, Miss Edith," said Ben, as they trotted down the avenue.
                  "Yes," replied Edith, "Flirt is an especial pet and favorite of mine."
                  "What do you call her?"
                  "Flirt."
                  "I hope she is not named after you, Miss Edith."
                  
                  "No, indeed! Mr. Fordyce; my cousin gave her that title because she carries herself with such dainty, coquetish grace. I think a horse should always be appropriately designated. By the way, you have rather a nice mount; do you know his name?"
                  "Yes," replied Ben, laughing; "it is Bones.'
                  "Bones! what a dreadful idea."
                  "I should judge it was given him as a mockery, on account of his obesity."
                  "It is certainly more suggestive of a Megatharium, or Saurian remain, than a comfortable living creature like this."
                  "Perhaps," suggested Ben, "at some remote period of his existence he was excessively thin, and may then have received this appellation, which the kind care of Mrs. Marvin has since converted into an absurdity."
                  "Oh, it's Mrs. Marvin's pony, is it? Now I recognize him; but I thought they called him Bonny."
                  "That," said Ben, "is a lady-like affectation of which I do not approve. Howard says he has known him about the village for several years as Bones, and while I am here I shall call him by no other name."
                  As he spoke, they were passing through the gate, and the smile with which this last sally was received faded suddenly from Edith's face, leaving it quite colorless and startled, as she caught sight of a gentleman who stood just beyond it. He had evidently been on the point of entering, when he saw the equestrians, and stood aside to allow them to pass.
                  The stranger was an uncommonly handsome man. In age certainly over thirty, perhaps under forty. He was not very tall; his figure good, though not so light as it had once been. His features were regular and clear cut; the mouth shaded by a heavy black moustache; the expression haughty, self-reliant, yet slightly sensual. But his remarkable eyes were his chief beauty—the windows of the busy intellect that plotted in that graceful head. They were such eyes as once seen were never forgotten—black as night, yet sparkling with a light that was almost dazzling. Few women could meet it without flinching. There was a fierce fire in them that not even the shade of the thick curling lashes could soften; they were at once fascinating and repellant—irresistible, unscrupulous, impenetrable. He had fine hair, of a purple blackness, waving in ringlets around the high white forehead that was lightly marked with faint lines of thought, perhaps of passion, but showing a tiny bald spot on the crown when he doffed his hat.
                  "Ah, Mr. Denbigh," said Edith, reining in her horse with a trembling hand, "so you are really here."
                  "Of course I am, Miss Rockford," he said in a low, musical voice, and with a courteous ease of manner in strong contrast with Edith's undisguised embarrassment; "where else should I be but in Herford, where my heart has been ever since we parted. You knew I would come the first moment I could, did you not?"
                  "You said so," faltered Edith.
                  He drew off his glove, and came close to the side of her horse. Fordyce noticing their earnest greetings had ridden on a few steps out of hearing. They were almost alone as Denbigh said,
                  "Have you no welcome for me, Miss Rockford?"
                  "I am very glad to see you," replied Edith, giving him her gauntleted hand; he took it with a pressure that brought back her waning color.
                  "I was on my way to your home, but as you are not there, I have no object in a visit. I will come this evening, if you will let me."
                  "Certainly, Mr. Denbigh, and now I must go. Good bye."
                  Percival Denbigh returned her salute as she hurried away, and then stood watching her with such an expression as a hawk might wear towards the quarry he is pursuing.
                  Quite unconscious of this, Edith rode on at her companion's side; feeling that she owed him some apology for the delay, she made an amiable excuse. Fordyce accepted it politely, but it did not dispel the look of annoyance which had gathered on his face. He had left Newport before the period of Denbigh's attentions to Edith, but he was by no means pleased—as what man would be?—to have his pretty lady betray so much emotion on meeting the handsome stranger. Edith had sufficient penetration and knowledge of the sex to divine this, and partly from a real liking for this honest fellow, partly from an impulse she always felt to make those around her happy, she exerted herself to the utmost to dispel this cloud. She succeeded, for when did Sunshine ever fail to brighten the recipient of its smiles? She was so artlessly gay, so cordially interested in all that concerned him, that Ben had soon forgotten his chagrin, and fallen more hopelessly than ever into the unintentional snare.
                  They continued their way through the woods, choosing a road that led up to a point which commanded a fine view. They had not been going very rapidly, as the way was yet damp from the recent rain, the roads still wet, and the fallen leaves thick on the ground, so that Ben's horse had kept up pretty well with Edith's. She saw that there was not much capacity for speed in the animal, and mercifully forbore to urge a faster pace. Thus leisurely going and pleasantly chatting, they reached their destination, and paused on the brow of the hill to enjoy the scene.
                  On the left the river wound between its wooded banks spanned near its mouth by a bridge, and dotted here and there with the white sails of several small craft that were floating lazily on its tranquil bosom. On the right was the village, half hidden by trees. Its neat white houses grouped around the church, which stood in the midst like a faithful monitress guarding her children, and with the taper finger of its tall spire pointing to those heavens that are a type of our celestial home. Between these two points stretched the meadows, now yellow and tawny after the gathered harvest, and beyond them rolled the sea, all on fire with the burning hues of sunset.
                  Ben Fordyce looked at this fair prospect a little while—then he turned to gaze on the fairer human loveliness beside him. The exercise had given Edith a charming color, her hair slightly disordered by the motion, fell around her sweet face in amber curls, no wonder he could not withdraw his gaze, or that his eyes were eloquent of the admiration he had not yet found courage to express. For a few moments she was unconscious of this, but at last she turned to him and began—
                  "Is not that pretty——"
                  Something in his look made her falter and blush. At this Ben was aware of his rudeness, and greatly afflicted thereat. In his eagerness to apologize, all caution was forgotten.
                  "Forgive me, Miss Edith, I did not intend to annoy you, but how can I help admiring you?"
                  "Don't, Mr. Fordyce," exclaimed Edith, shrinking as does any modest woman from an avowal of feeling she cannot reciprocate. This did not help her, however. Ben was reckless now, and went on desperately.
                  "I know you don't care anything about me, but ever since I first saw you I have loved you with my whole heart—indeed I have!" here catching sight of a mischievous quiver of Edith's lip, he added in an injured tone, "and now you are only laughing at me."
                  "Am I? I beg your pardon," said Edith, but she still smiled. She was re-assured by a sudden conviction that after all not much harm was done. She had had enough experience to be able to tell true love from mere admiration, and at this moment she was certain that this avowal was the result rather of enthusiasm than any deep-felt passion. But Ben did not yet look upon it in this light, and went on desperately.
                  "How can you be so cruel when you know how much I love you?"
                  "No, no, Mr. Fordyce, you don't love me."
                  "Upon my honor I do. Why, I think you are the handsomest woman I ever saw in my life."
                  "Perhaps you do," said Edith, simply, "but that don't prove it. So then, Mr. Fordyce, let's be serious. I like you very much, we will forget what you have just said—"
                  "You may, I shan't," muttered Ben.
                  "Yes you will after a while, but we will always be excellent friends."
                  "I hope so," assented Ben, fervently.
                  "And now, perhaps, we had better go home."
                  "It's very hard, Miss Edith," protested Ben, with a sigh. "But I suppose you know best. Get up, Bones!"
                  —And here let me pause for a word of advice to all possible suitors. Never offer yourself to a lady on horseback unless you are absolutely certain of being accepted—and even then. I think it not a very good occasion for the performance, it is scarcely an elligible position for that "first kiss" with which, according to the best novel authorities, "their mutual vows" should be "sealed." But in case of a reverse there is something terribly awkward in the impossibility possibility of escaping a prolonged tête-à-tête after the fatal leap has been taken. The unhappy rejected is obliged to keep up appearances by riding home with the rejector, while all the time he feels uncomfortably crushed, and is impressed with the belief that she is terribly bored.—
                  Ben looked very rueful; it was perhaps true, as Edith had guessed, that this was not the grand love in which his honest heart was destined to pour out all its floods of tenderness, still he admired her with a respectful fervor that was very sincere, and it was rather a rude termination to his late dreams to have them thus completely destroyed. He felt decidedly melancholy, though his regard for his friend was rather increased than diminished by the frank and sensible manner in which she had received his rash declaration. As they descended the hill, he broke a somewhat awkward silence by saying—
                  "I know I have done a very foolish thing, Miss Edith. I am much obliged to you for your consideration, and I trust you will excuse me."
                  "Pray, don't speak of it, Mr. Fordyce."
                  "You don't like me any the less, I hope," persisted Ben.
                  "No, indeed!"
                  "Thank you, Miss Edith, you are very kind. I suppose I shall get over it when I go away," he added, with a sigh.
                  "Why, Mr. Fordyce, you surely will not leave on this account."
                  "Yes, I think I shall."
                  "Oh! I am very sorry," said Edith, sincerely.
                  "Are you?" asked Ben, brightening. "But you know it will be better for me not to see you for a while. Go on, Bones!"
                  But Bones' capacity or inclination for "going on" seemed to be pretty much exhausted. He maintained a dignified walk, entirely regardless of a severe application of the whip to which Ben resorted. Edith could not help laughing at the stoicism of the horse, as she reined in Flirt beside him. Ben was forced to smile in spite of himself.
                  "Disagreeable old beast!" he exclaimed. "I know you are longing to be rid of me, Miss Edith."
                  "Not at all, Mr. Fordyce, I am very sorry to have you leave Herford on my account."
                  "I had to go soon any-way," replied Ben, pausing in his exercise, "so it does not much matter."
                  "But you will be in New York this winter."
                  "Yes—get up Bones! get up!" frantically, for the horse had come to a dead halt.
                  "Mrs. Marvin cannot be a very fast old lady," said Edith pleasantly to relieve poor Ben's annoyance. A violent blow on the side of the head finally started Bones into his old pace, and Ben quite red in the face with his exertions replied.
                  "She must have exemplary patience or he would drive her crazy." Then resuming the broken thread of their conversation, he said, "I intend to make the city my future home."
                  "Oh! I am glad of that. Then I shall see you there."
                  "If you will let me come."
                  "Certainly, I have so many friends I should like you to know."
                  "You are too good. Go on, Bones."
                  These little asides had become so common, that Edith paid no heed except to keep Flirt back and proceeded, "There is one young lady, I am sure you would admire."
                  "Is she like you?"
                  "Not in appearance. She is very pretty and smart."
                  "Oh, Bones, you brute, go on! go on! Really, Miss Edith, you had better not wait for me; you see this wretched creature has stopped again!"
                  "I'm sorry, Mr. Fordyce, but it's no matter, it is quite light yet."
                  "Ah, if I only had my spurs!" groaned Ben, as he kicked the fat sides of his steed; they gave forth a comfortable solid sound, and Bones in mild surprise trotted on a few steps.
                  "I am sure I should admire any friend of yours," said Ben, somewhat restored to his equanimity.
                  "I hope you will. Why, we are getting on famously!" cried Edith, as they turned down the road home.
                  But Ben was not so certain, he felt the pace of his tormentor gradually slackening, despite all urgings by whip and rein, and in a moment he stopped again.
                  "Get up, Bones, good boy!" but Bones declined being a "good boy," and Ben exclaimed, frantically, "See, Miss Edith, he won't move! Really, I believe I shall have to get off, and drag him home."
                  "Oh no! he'll start in a minute."
                  "Ah, I have an idea! now, Bones!" said Ben, fiendishly.
                  He had been gradually growing desperate: it was such a shocking situation for a man who had just been refused; but the mention of the spur had suggested a thought which had at last taken shape. He now slyly took out his penknife, and while making a show with the whip, to deceive Edith's tender heart, he privately thrust it into his tormentor's sleek flank. At this unexpected and dreadful goad, Bones gave a short plunge forward, and started off at a convulsive canter.
                  "There Miss Edith! I shall beat you yet," cried Ben, all sentiment banished by the excitement of his novel situation. "Two to one on Bones!"
                  Edith put Flirt into a fast trot and rejoined him laughing heartily at this surprising activity. It would seem that Ben had finally found the means of coercing the stout old fellow into speed; for although he rather flagged once or twice a gentle reminder was sufficient to bring him to time again. On the whole, however, it was such a funny performance, that before they reached Rockford lawn, the two young people were both in high spirits. But when Ben jumped from his panting victim and helped Edith to dismount, a little shade came over his face again, and he said with some melancholy.
                  "Miss Edith, I hope you will not regard me as less a friend on account of my folly."
                  "No, indeed, Mr. Fordyce, I shall always value you very highly.
                  "Thank you, with all my heart. I hope you believe that I will do anything in the world for you."
                  —There is one comfort about refusing a man, one can afterwards be as cordial as one pleases towards him, without danger of misconstruction. Edith drew off her glove and shook Ben's hand very warmly as she bade him good-bye, and he remounted poor Bones, who was pretty well blown after his recent tremendous exertion, and rode off, feeling that she would always have a shrine in his heart, but as a goddess to be adored, rather than as a woman to be loved.
                  As for Edith, she entertained a sincere hope that in losing a lover she had gained a friend; and after mentally forming an innocent little plot for his future happiness, dismissed him with her very best wishes. Then she went to dress for the evening, with the pleasant anticipation of her coming visitor filling her thoughts, to the exclusion of everything else.
                  Percival Denbigh was a thorough man of the world, selfish, unscrupulous, gifted with an intellect which, like Lucifer's, seemed bestowed only to increase his capacity for evil, and possessed of a rare fascination of manner to which more than one woman owed a broken heart and a blasted life. His past history contained some dark episodes, but they were entirely unknown to the friends who had introduced him at Newport. His early life had been spent at the South, and his home now was New Orleans; so that only indefinite whispers had followed him to his present sphere. People knew that he had been a widower for ten years. They never asked him how his fair young wife died. They only thought it sad that he should have had so much sorrow when he was so young. He was reputed wealthy, and was certainly agreeable and polished. No wonder that he was considered a pleasant addition to any gay party.
                  He was thoroughly blazèe, and considered that he had exhausted life. He came to Newport this summer merely to kill time, scarcely with the hope of finding a new sensation. To his surprise, in Edith he discovered one. From their first meeting, he found something very piquante in her fresh beauty, her artless manners, so entirely free from the ordinary affectation of city belles, and the atmosphere of purity which surrounded her even in the midst of the artificial life in which she moved. To obtain, by any means, good or bad, power over this innocent being, was at present the first object with this man, who had never yet paused in the pursuit of a woman, for any law, human or divine.
                  Denbigh's first step was to be constantly and pointedly devoted to Edith at Newport. His attentions excited some remark, which he did all in his power to increase. Knowing how easy it is to associate two names, how difficult to separate them when once so coupled, and what significance this connection gives to the slightest act on the lady's part. Of these whispers Edith was entirely unconscious. She regarded Denbigh as the most entertaining man she had ever met. His fine intellect commanded her respect. His brilliant conversation fascinated her. Then, too, he understood very well how to assume that sentimental melancholy which is sure to awaken a tender sympathy in the breast of any amiable woman who believes it to be sincere, and this aroused Edith's gentle pity. So that when she left Newport she parted from him with regret, and since then had found herself thinking of him far oftener than she had ever thought of any other man during his absence.
                  This evening, when she was in the parlor awaiting his coming, she found it a task of some difficulty to sit quietly at her work. When she heard his only too well remembered voice pronouncing her name, her heart beat as it had seldom done before, and she rose to meet him with a fine blush on her lovely face that gave an infinite grace to her first greetings. She had mentioned his arrival and their previous acquaintance to her aunt and uncle; so that they were prepared for the visitor, and the introductions were performed with more cordiality than usually accompanies such formalities.
                  It is rather a trying situation in which to place a man, this of maintaining a conversation with three persons, two of them entire strangers, and the third a woman in whose eyes he wishes to appear to advantage. Mr. Denbigh acquitted himself with admirable self-possession and success. He addressed himself at first rather to the elders, complimenting Mr. Rockford on his fine place, and speaking to Mrs. Rockford of Vinton, who chanced not to be present, saying how highly he had heard him praised by one of the Harvard Professors whom he met at Newport. How far this was a fabrication it would perhaps not have been best to inquire; but at least it succeeded, the mother-heart was won—and when after a while her husband left the room with an excuse of letters, Mrs. Rockford was not long in following him, with the benevolent intention of permitting the agreeable stranger a little uninterrupted chat with her fair niece. As soon as they were alone, Denbigh crossed the room, and placed himself on the sofa where Edith sat demurely with her work.
                  "Ah! Miss Rockford! you don't know how I have longed for this moment." This was a statement to which Edith could scarcely reply, but she listened with heightened color as after a moment he went on. "I have counted the days since we parted, and lived only in the hope of seeing you again. You have not forgotten me?"
                  "No," said Edith, "certainly not." She spoke frankly, at the same time raising her eyes to her companion's; but her own fell quickly under his intense gaze, which seemed to devour her, and she added with a desperate effort at her usual gayety, "I should have a very short memory if I could not recollect you three weeks."
                  "Three weeks," thought Denbigh. "Ah! she remembers the exact time." Then aloud—"I am glad you found a place for me in your heart even for that little time."
                  "Did you leave Newport soon after?" asked Edith, anxious to change the subject.
                  "Yes—the next day. What attractions had it for me when you were gone?"
                  "And where have you been ever since?" said Edith, persistently disregarding the compliment.
                  "In New York most of the time. By the way, when do you return to the city?"
                  "Not before the first of November, I hope."
                  "Ah! then I shall stay here as long as possible."
                  "You will find it pleasant, I dare say."
                  "It cannot be otherwise, that is if you will let me come and see you."
                  "Certainly."
                  There was a pause. Edith took a few enormous stitches in her neat work, and then Denbigh said, "I have a favor to ask, will you grant it?"
                  "If I can. Yes," replied Edith, ceasing her useless industry.
                  "May I call you Miss Edith?"
                  "Of course you may. Every one here does."
                  "Thank you. Shake hands on that?"
                  Edith gave him her hand with a pleasant smile, but with drew it in an instant, firmly resisting the attempt he made to retain it.
                  "Are you really glad to see me?" asked Denbigh, when he had reluctantly released his prize.
                  "Yes, I am always glad to see an old friend."
                  "That assurance makes me very happy, I have thought of you so constantly! Ah! Miss Edith——
                     
                        
                           'Know'st thou how dearly I have dwelt
                           On one long dream of thee?'"
                        
                     
                  
                  He murmured the words in a low soft tone, watching eagerly the effect on his companion. She was half annoyed, half pleased, but on the whole greatly relieved at this critical moment to hear her aunt's approaching steps. Denbigh, on the contrary, could not repress an inward malediction at this ill-timed interruption, even as he turned towards her with a well-bred smile. He resumed a conversation of common-places, which was maintained for a few moments longer, and then he rose to go.
                  "We shall be pleased to see you frequently, Mr. Denbigh," said Mrs. Rockford politely.
                  "Thank you, madam, I shall only be too glad to avail myself of your kind permission; your house contains many attractions for me." He bowed as if the compliment were intended to be general, though his glance directed it especially to Edith.
                  So he withdrew—handsome, fascinating, as the false-hearted Leicester when he wooed the innocent Amy to her ill-starred marriage and final destruction.

                              "Sweet are the uses of adversity;
                              Which like a toad ugly and venomous
                              Wears yet a precious jewel in his head."
                           
                        
                        "AS YOU LIKE IT."
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           "In a word the world itself is a maze, a labyrinth of errors, a desert, a wilderness."
                        
                        BURTON'S "ANATOMY OF MELANCHOLY."
                     
                  
                  VINTON ROCKFORD had graduated at Harvard in the last August. He had been a favorite with his fellow students for his amiable manners and generous disposition. His talents were such as to command respect, and he had that high-toned chivalry of character, which scorns an unmanly act, and feels an honest pride in its own purity, that ever inspires the profoundest trust. He was a fair scholar, and closed his career by taking an appointment, to the great delight of Mr. and Mrs. Rockford who went to Cambridge at the Commencement and had the gratification of seeing him acquit himself with credit and hearing his praise from his numerous friends.
                  Chief among these was Lionel Rohan, a young man some three years Vinton's senior, who had been studying law in Cambridge during the last two years of his course. He was a fine high spirited fellow, more thoroughly congenial than any of his other companions, to Vinton's somewhat fastidious taste. He was of a good city family and their acquaintance had begun long ago in boyhood, so that he was not wholly unknown to Mr. and Mrs. Rockford, who were very glad for his own sake as well as their son's to extend him an invitation to visit them at Herford. He had seen Edith once too, some years before, and since he had known Vinton more intimately they had whiled away many moments by talking of the lovely girl who in the one short evening when Lionel had met her, had made an indelible impression on his memory. He had looked forward to a renewal of their acquaintance at Commencement, but she was not there, having, almost at the last moment somewhat reluctantly, yielded to the urging of the Granthams to come to them at Newport in time for the grand ball at their ocean cottage.
                  After Vinton's return home the question of his future course was much discussed. Mr. Rockford was anxious to have his assistance in his counting house. Vinton himself had no taste for trade and was most desirous of returning to Harvard to study law; his mother too advocated this course and her opinion was entitled to respect. Vinton had been called after her, and as her property had been settled upon herself, she had always insisted upon paying his allowance from her own ample means, and could at any moment make him independent. Mr. Rockford had never quite forgiven his wife's obstinacy on this point, the boy had been born during his temporary absence and without consulting him she had given him simply her own surname; her husband had been at first consoled by the hopes of a second son whom he might call after himself, but as the years passed on without bringing another child, his bitterness on this point grew into a settled discontent. His wife was very submissive in most respects, but when once she chose to oppose his will, he know only too well how obstinate she could be. Taking this into consideration, therefore, together with her determination to increase her son's already very handsome allowance, he consented to a compromise. Vinton was to be released from actual attendance at the Bank, and permitted to pursue his legal studies, but in New York instead of Harvard.
                  Unconsciously to himself perhaps, Vinton was somewhat reconciled to giving up his prospects of returning to Cambridge by the fact that the Sandys were no longer there. From the first moment that he saw Mabel, he had taken a warmer interest in her, than he had ever felt in any other woman, an interest so strong, so deep, so tender, as to surprise himself; her gentle loveliness and admirable devotion to her father, had, it is true, awakened his admiration, but that alone was not enough to account for the yearning affection he could not repress for her, and he was at last forced to acknowledge almost without an emotion that this must be love. Mr. Sandys had been most kind to him, singling him, out from their first introduction by his especial attentions, and when his health failed permitting him to visit him long after he had declined any other calls. Finally as his disease progressed in its fatal course change of air was recommended for the invalid and Vinton with delight heard him express a wish to return to Herford. Orders were at once given to have the old house prepared for his accommodation, and the charge of refurnishing was given to his wife's cousin, the Rev. Paul Haughton. But before the arrangements could be completed, Mr. Sandys grew rapidly worse, and it was considered expedient to take him at once to Nahant. But the sea breezes brought no healing to the dying man, and as the summer faded he too faded away, expressing almost with his last breath, the wish to be buried in his native village from which he had so long been a voluntary exile.
                  All the family at Rockford lawn were most anxious to do what they could to lighten the solitude of this widow and daughter. Mrs. Rockford had known Mrs. Sandys in early life when they were girls together, and taking into consideration this and Vinton's previous acquaintance with them she ventured to appoint an afternoon about a week after the funeral for their first visit.
                  Edith looked forward with eagerness to this introduction to her cousin's friend, she had heard from him so much of the lovely girl. In fact on all points she and Vinton were devoted allies. Near of an age as they were, their interests and sympathies were identical, and between them there was an attachment almost as strong as that between brother and sister.
                  —When this is the case how close and beautiful does such affection make the tie of own cousinship. Divested as it should ever be of all possibility of marriage, it becomes a sacred bond of mutual comfort and reliance, making the family where it exists strong to resist all outward storms.—
                  For her sake Vinton had scanned curiously Edith's new adorer, Percival Denbigh, and been by no means pleased with the result of his scrutiny. Courteous and eloquent as this inscrutable man was, there was yet that about him which inspired him with distrust, and made him doubly anxious to have his favorite friend, whom he secretly designed in despotic man fashion, for his fair cousin, make his appearance on the scene. He was very well pleased, therefore, when a letter was handed him just as he joined his mother and cousin on the afternoon of the visit to the Sandys, to see that it was from his friend. As he followed them to the carriage he broke the seal, and glancing hastily over it, looked up with a joyful exclamation.
                  "Mother! here is good news, Lionel Rohan will be here to-morrow."
                  "Indeed! I'm glad to hear it," replied Mrs. Rockford, absently.
                  "And what have you to say, Sunshine?"
                  "I? why I am very glad too. Only, Vinton, don't you venture to call me Sunshine while he is here."
                  "Why not? don't you think he has forgotten his youthful admiration?"
                  "Perhaps so. But I don't like the risk, so if you value your peace beware!"
                  She raised her finger with a menacing gesture and Vinton smilingly replied—
                  "I'm dreadfully frightened and I'll try to remember, on condition that you are to be very polite to him."
                  "Any friend of yours, you know, Vinton, I shall do my best to entertain."
                  "That's a good girl, and I'm sure you'll like him, he is such a capital fellow."
                  With this compliment, he re-folded the letter and relapsed into silence, which all were too busy with their own thoughts to interrupt.
                  The Sandys' house was a fine old place, with a hall as wide as a modern drawing-room, heavily wain scotted in black walnut, and containing some quaint chairs and tables. The parlor into which the visitors were shown was a large room, octagonal at one end, and well lighted from large windows that were curtained with lace. The walls were covered with a paper painted in a gorgeous pattern of birds and flowers, the furniture was of old oak mounted in blue velvet. The carpet was thick and soft, of a hue that harmonized with the more brilliant tints, and about the room there was scattered that ornamental bijouterie without which no parlor however elegant its appointments is complete. The arrangement of this and the vase of flowers that stood on the centre table, were due to Mabel. She had done what she could to give the house a home aspect, hoping thereby to cheer her mother somewhat and finding in this necessary exertion a partial destraction from her own grief.
                  Yet Mrs. Sandys tried hard to be unselfish in her sorrow, she had already taken her place in the regular routine of domestic cares, and this afternoon when the cards of their visitors were brought to her, she determined for her daughter's sake to overcome her reluctance to seeing strangers, and go to meet those new friends.
                  The Rockfords had not long to wait therefore before Mrs. Sandys entered the room. She was a small woman with light hair thinly sprinkled with grey, and soft, kind eyes. Her face was sweet although prematurely old, and now in her black dress and widow's cap, there was something extremely interesting in her appearance.
                  It was impossible in view of that look of suffering, to retain any trace of resentment, and as Mrs. Rockford rose to meet her all the years since they had met rolled away, and they were once more the Claudia Vinton and Amelia Haughton of old. With a fine instinct of kindness, she addressed her friend simply as when they were girls.
                  "My dear Amelia, let me welcome you to Herford, I hope you will be happy here."
                  The two ladies kissed each other and then Mrs. Rockford presented Edith, and Vinton came forward When she turned to him and remembered with whom it was she had last seen him, Mrs. Sandys eyes filled with tears and it required a strong effort of self-control to acknowledge his greetings calmly, and so let him pass to her daughter,
                  Mabel Sandys stood at her mother's side, stately and fair. Her pale brown hair, rolling back from her pure brow in smooth bands, her large blue eyes calm and innocent as a dove's, and her transparent complexion rendered dazzlingly white by contrast with her plain black dress. There was in her aspect that serene beauty that we image when we dream of the Virgin Madonna.
                  As the two elder ladies seated themselves, Mabel shook hands with Vinton as with an old friend, and received Edith with gentle cordiality. It was easy to see these two felt an instinctive liking for each other.
                  "I have heard my cousin speak of you so often, I scarcely feel as if we were strangers," said Edith.
                  "Mr. Rockford was very kind last winter," said Mabel. Her voice trembled a little, and Edith, who could not bear a cloud, hastened to turn the conversation to such a description of her new home and its environs as she thought might interest her.
                  Meantime Mrs. Rockford and Mrs. Sandys were speaking together of the Past. They had not met since their school days, and all the troubled history of the intermediate time seemed banished by these reminiscences. For awhile Mrs. Sandys made no allusion to her husband; at last in answer to a remark about Herford, she said:
                  "Oh! if George could only have been here this summer!"
                  "I wish he could," replied Mrs. Rockford, and then in a tender voice she added, "My dear Amelia may I tell you how deeply I sympathize with you?"
                  "Thank you, Claudia," answered Mrs. Sandys faintly, struggling to maintain her composure.
                  "I know how much you have lost in losing such a husband."
                  "Ah! I remember, you knew him," cried Mrs. Sandys, with a sudden look of interest.
                  "Yes, before he ever saw you he was my friend."
                  Something in the look and tone that accompanied these words made Mrs. Sandys almost suspect a long-buried secret, yet not with jealousy, the recollection of her husband's affection and devotion was too fresh to be affected by any early interests, and it was only in mild surprise that she exclaimed:
                  "Strange! I wonder if he could have been thinking of you just before he died."
                  "Of me?" faltered Mrs. Rockford, "Of me, Amelia?"
                  "He murmured your name," said Mrs. Sandys; "perhaps some old memory revived, as they are said sometimes to arise most vividly on failing senses."
                  "Will you tell me about it?" asked Mrs. Rockford, in a voice that was pleading in its earnestness.
                  "Yes, if you care to hear."
                  "Certainly I do. You know I have never learned any of the particulars of Mr. Sandys' death, and as he was an old friend I should like exceedingly, if it would not pain you too much, to have you tell me."
                  Mrs. Sandys complied, feeling that sort of morbid consolation which some confiding natures derive in the early days of sorrow from dwelling on the last moments of the lost one. After giving several of the details of his ilness, she thus described the final scene:
                  "He had been in this stupor several hours. We watched him, constantly fearing that at any moment all might be over. It was towards evening. I was alone at his bedside when he opened his eyes; for a moment he did not look at me, but gazing into the air as if he saw some invisible object, he said feebly, but quite distinctly, 'Claudia, forgive me! Claudia, forgive me!' They were the last words he ever spoke, though he soon became conscious of my presence, and his last smile was for me."
                  Mrs. Rockford was completely overcome. She buried her face in her hands and sobbed convulsively. Mrs. Sandys regarded her without surprise; her own tears had been falling fast during this mournful recital, and it was but natural that her friend should weep with her. Strangely enough too, she was the first to revive and soothe her agitated companion—
                  "Let us try to be calm, Claudia. I am very grateful for your sympathy. I am sorry I am still so weak and nervous. When you come again I hope I shall be better."
                  Mrs. Rockford was soon more composed, and rose to go. She feared that both mother and daughter would be wearied with the excitement of this interview.
                  At this moment Edith joined her to say a few words to Mrs. Sandys, and Vinton turned to Mabel and held out his hand for good-bye.
                  "May I tell you, Miss Mabel, how constantly I have thought of you—how much I have longed to be able to lighten your solitude?"
                  "You are very kind," answered Mabel, placing her hand in his with a sad sweet smile. Vinton retained it a moment as he added,
                  "You will let me come to see you? that is, if it will not annoy you."
                  "Oh no. I shall always be glad to see you."
                  Mabel spoke gravely yet sincerely, with no coquetry in her tone, and Vinton prized the permission with all his heart.
                  There was some further interchange of civilities between the ladies, and then the visitors withdrew, feeling the warmest interest in their new neighbors.
                  When the mother and daughter were alone, Mrs. Sandys gave way to that great burst of grief that so inevitably follows the first attempt to meet strangers after some deep affliction. There is something so terrible in the acknowledgment that a new life is begun, an existence in which the lost one has no part, the sense of bereavement is utterly overwhelming, the soul sick and faint with the hunger and thirst of its craving for its dead darling, sinks down crushed under the unendurable burden of sorrow, and for a while refuses to be comforted.
                  Later that same evening Mabel sat alone in the drawing-room, very listless and tired. She had been in constant attendance upon her mother, until worn out with emotion she had sunk into an uneasy slumber, that permitted her at last to leave her bedside. She had come here for a little rest, and as she leaned back her weary head on the cushions of the sofa, she no longer resisted the sad thoughts that crowded on her. To her the loss of her father had been the heaviest blow that could have befallen her; she had loved him with all the intensity of her clinging nature, and now that he was gone it seemed to her as if the unprotected existence that lay before her was too dreary and lonely ever to be endured. How could she ever face its duties, or bear the burden of its responsibilities unassisted? From this despondent reverie she was roused by an approaching step, and a moment after her cousin stood beside her.
                  Rev. Paul Haughton was the church clergyman of Herford. He was Mrs. Sandys' nearest male relative, the son of a very dear cousin; and the confidence he felt in him had been the principal reason why her dying husband had wished his family to move to this village, where they might be under his protection. He was at this time about thirty, grave for his years, a faithful and devoted priest, entirely beloved and respected in his parish.
                  As he came in Mabel looked up with a faint smile.
                  "Ah! Cousin Paul, I am so glad to see you!"
                  "Thank you, Mabel, but you look pale; what has happened?"
                  "Nothing unpleasant, the Rockfords were here, and mama thought it right that we should see them, but it was a great effort."
                  "I am rejoiced that you made it, however; they are nice people, and I'm sure you will like them. Miss Edith especially is an excellent young lady, and does a great deal of good among the poor of the parish."
                  "Yes, she is very lovely, and they are all exceedingly kind; but Oh, Paul! it is so hard to go on without him. I am so lost and unhappy."
                  She sighed heavily, and withdrew her hand from the gentle pressure of his clasping fingers. Mr. Haughton looked a little pained, but he answered, gravely,
                  "You must not despond, Mabel, remember who has sent this heavy blow, and try to be resigned."
                  "I know it, Paul, I know it! If it were not for that belief, I do not think I could bear it at all."
                  "Without the hope that He gives, it would indeed be difficult to endure even the least of our trials here, but with that consolation all is light," said Mr. Haughton, fervently.
                  After a moment's pause Mabel turned to her cousin and asked, "Paul, you don't think that afflictions are sent as punishments, do you?"
                  "As punishments, Mabel? no indeed! Does not He tell us—' Whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth.' What a world of solace is there in that promise—'Whom the Lord loveth!' think of that Mabel, and feel that this mysterious dispensation is a proof of Divine affection."
                  "Then you believe the hard lessons of this world are after all but loving restraints."
                  "Undoubtedly. Our Heavenly Parent knows what discipline is best for our final perfection, and sends those most calculated to wean us from an attachment to this probationary existence. So far from considering great and extraordinary trials as evidences of God's vengeance, I regard them as marks of his yearning desire to appropriate those on whom they fall as his own peculiar children, that they may be tried in the fire of adversity and made pure as refined gold. How else can we account for what we every day see; that persons whose course is notoriously wicked, are permitted to go on in an uninterrupted career of evil, and to die at last unrebuked in their sin, whereas those of blameless and innocent character, are singled out for the most overwhelming sorrows, that cease only when the power of endurance is exhausted, and death translates them to their glorious reward."
                  In the excitement of the moment Mr. Haughton had risen and stood before his cousin, his eyes beaming with a holy light, his whole countenance radiant with inspiration. Mabel caught some of his enthusiasm, the look of sadness left her face, and she exclaimed—
                  "Oh, Paul! how your words cheer me. I can sustain all with fortitude confident in His Goodness."
                  —What, indeed, would this world be to the mourner without this Divine consolation? Or who that looks on the annals of the past can fail to cling to this only hope that can save us from utter despair? In all ages we find cruelty and vice stalking over the ruins of liberty and happiness, everywhere the strong have oppressed the weak, the innocent have suffered, the young have died. How many unresisting victims have perished dumbly in the cells of nameless prisons! It is something to put on the crown of martyrdom as a tiara of glory in the eyes of sympathizing multitudes, but how many obscure saints have endured even to the end, breathing out life in a prayer to the great first Martyr who inspired them with faith for that final hour! How many unrecorded groans have ascended to the Mercy seat from the trembling lips of blameless victims! how many brave hearts have ceased to beat in the carnage of lost battle fields. The vanished sunlight of by-gone centuries has shone on scenes of crime and horror that might have turned its beams to blood! Successive generations have struggled and wept, and then gone down forever into the silent tomb. This world's history is one long series of agony, sin and death. The evil have blasted their souls in the reckless grasping after power; to the good success has come but rarely, and then too late, and the brighter points serve only to render the surrounding gloom more appalling. What a dark chaos it is! until we look above where the starry lustre of the cross sheds its calm light even into the blackest night. In that emblem at once of suffering and triumph is the eternal promise of a sublime consolation for all those sorrows in the infinite cycles of an immortality of bliss!
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "And then that hope, that fairy hope.
                              Oh! she awak'd such happy dreams,
                              And gave my soul such tempting scope,
                              For all its dearest, fondest schemes."
                           
                        
                        MOORE.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        "Man dreams of fame, while woman wakes to love."
                     
                  
                  DURING the past week, Edith had seen Percival Denbigh constantly, and at each interview the danger to her heart became more imminent. He was an uncommonly agreeable man, knowing well how to make each action and tone a mute compliment, how to throw the most profound devotion into every glance and gesture. He read poetry to her, his mellow voice adding new significance to every line, and she could not help yielding to that subtle enchantment; the spell was fast weaving that might yet entangle the wings of Psyche, and leave her helpless.
                  Yet Denbigh himself was by no means satisfied with the progress he made. He was annoyed at the constant interruption either of visitors or some members of the family to which he was subject at Rockford Lawn, and was extremely anxious for some better opportunity of seeing Edith. The same difficulty which Ben Fordyce encountered in obtaining a mount, had thus far prevented him from accompanying her on a ride. Not having the pleasure of Mrs. Marvin's acquaintance, he could not even hope to procure the redoubtable Bones. It was so late in the season, that there were no little parties at which he might meet her; thus, as yet, no plan had suggested itself by which he might obtain a tête-à-tête. Fortune, however, finally favored him with the sought for "golden opportunity."
                  On the evening after their call on the Sandys, Mrs. Rockford kept her room. Her husband was away, and, freed from the restraint of his presence, she was able to yield to the languor and depression which followed the trying interview. She preferred to be quite alone, and would not per mit either her niece or her son to remain with her. Vinton, whose heart was still full of that dove-eyed girl from whom he had so recently parted, bade his mother good night with a kiss, and taking his hat, went off for a walk. Edith was left to the solitude of the drawing-room. She sat at the piano playing to herself, us young ladies are apt to, pieces that accorded with the humor of the moment. To-night there was a sort of delicious mournfulness running through the music, that so far from indicating any real sorrow, seemed rather that luxury of melancholy that Burton so quaintly describes. During this pleasant occupation, she was startled by a voice at her side—
                  "Ah! Miss Edith, this is delightful."
                  She turned hastily towards the speaker, the eloquent blood rushing in floods to her glowing cheeks, as she saw that it was Percival Denbigh. Conscious of that tell-tale color, she returned his salutation with some embarrassment.
                  "Pray go on with your music; that last was charming."
                  Edith sat down again, and resumed the interrupted performance, glad to have a moment to recover herself from this foolish agitation. For a few bars she went on tolerably well; then she became aware of the earnest gaze that was fixed upon her; without looking up, by some mysterious process, she seemed absolutely to feel the light of that magnetic regard, and so far from conquering her blushes, the roses on her sweet face deepened every instant. Still, though with trembling fingers, she persevered to the end of the piece. But, the moment the final note was sounded, she rose from her place.
                  "Pray don't stop, Miss Edith," exclaimed Denbigh, who enjoyed this opportunity of studying her pretty features and exercising the power of his glance.
                  "Yes, indeed," said Edith, "that is quite enough for this evening."
                  As she spoke, she met resolutely the full light of those singular eyes. Her own softened and faltered; she felt the influence that was stealing around her, though she tried to combat it with a smile. As well might Una have raised her delicate mantle as a defence against the lion.
                  On leaving the piano, Edith crossed the room to her favorite seat in the bow-window. Denbigh followed her, and placed himself beside her on the lounge. The white curtains fell in light festoons across the entrance, almost cutting it off from the rest of the room, and the light of the shaded lamp on the table was toned to a soft glow within. The house was very quiet. Denbigh noticed this, and asked—
                  "Where is your aunt?"
                  "She is not well to-night, and remains up stairs."
                  "Ah! I am sorry to hear it."—It might be doubted if this was precisely the remark Mr. Denbigh would have made in the palace of Truth—"Are you quite alone."
                  "Yes, I believe so. Vinton is out."
                  "How fortunate I am! I have wished so much to have a quiet evening with you. I hope no disagreeable people will come to call."
                  "I hardly think any one will be here," said Edith, "so many of our friends have returned to the city."
                  As if to belie her words, just at that instant the bell rang.
                  "There!" exclaimed Denbigh. "Now, there is a visitor, and I shall not be able to see you at all."
                  "Perhaps it is only some one on business."
                  "No, no! I am sure it is some horrid bore who will stay forever. Say you are engaged, Miss Edith, please!"
                  "No, indeed, I cannot, Mr. Denbigh," replied Edith, quickly.
                  "Ah, do, do, please! You know I came here on purpose to see you, and now it is too bad not to give me this one evening."
                  As he spoke he rose, and stood bending over her, looking at her with earnest entreaty. Edith felt more than half inclined to consent, but her sense of propriety was too strong to permit her to yield, and she answered firmly—
                  "Indeed, Mr. Denbigh, it is impossible."
                  As she spoke the servant passed the door, and it was too late. Denbigh reseated himself with a sigh.
                  "You are too cruel, Edith. I beg your pardon, Miss Edith."
                  "Not at all," replied Edith, "and see," she added, as John returned down the hall, carrying a bundle. "Your alarm was groundless, it was only some one with a message, after all."
                  "I am delighted that it is no more formidable interruption tion, but I had rather have owed my happiness to your kindness than to an accident."
                  Denbigh was a good deal vexed at Edith's refusal to grant his somewhat unreasonable request. He was a man who had not often found women firm in their resistance to his pleadings, and there was a lurid light in his bad eyes, as he regarded the delicate profile beside him, and marked the hauteur of the outlines, and the aristocratic purity of the coloring. She was very beautiful! he had not conquered so many to fail here now, when he was most determined upon success—and at that thought he exerted himself to the utmost to captivate her. What could she do, young and innocent girl, against this finished man of the world? She listened with her soul in her eloquent eyes, pleased, amused, and reassured that for a time he avoided any of those direct compliments which she scarcely knew how to parry.
                  —And pray what modest woman ever really enjoyed an open compliment however well turned? I know it is a favorite theory with many men that women love flattery. I beg most emphatically to deny the truth of this proposition. I believe that any lady of true delicacy feels a painful sensation of embarrassment and humiliation at the reception of such base coin of society. Yet what can we do, my good sir? We look pleased, of course we do, a well-bred smile must meet any remark that is not insulting, yet I am sure that in our hearts we have a most uncomfortable sensation of being treated with sugar-plums like great babies. If a woman is handsome she is apt to know it quite well enough, and cares no more to be told so, than that she has on a white or rose-colored dress; if she has not the gift of beauty, probably she is equally well aware of that painful fact, and ten chances to one she thinks you must imagine her to be a fool to care to hear a palpable untruth. I remember a very pleasant Spaniard who had but limited knowledge of English, and who was yet ambitious, as his countrymen ever are, of paying compliments, once at a party met a blooming Miss just out of the school-room; having recently seen her sister, who happened to strike his fancy, he addressed the little damsel thus: "You is pooty, and your seester is pooty, too." Her dismay may be imagined. After all, is most flattery much better?—
                  An hour passed imperceptibly to Edith and Denbigh, in a discussion of various interesting topics—then the conversation turned on Newport and their first meeting.
                  "I was very unhappy when I went there," said Denbigh with a half sigh, and an expression of sadness stealing over his mobile features.
                  "I am sorry to hear you say that," responded Edith with ready sympathy.
                  "Yes, indeed, Miss Edith, I felt that life had no object, I saw all my former friends happy, while I was still a wanderer."
                  "But I am sure you need not be so unless you choose."
                  "You think so? Ah, my dear lady, you are so young and fresh, you know nothing of the loneliness of a man of my age who has no one to love him."
                  "Do not say that, Mr. Denbigh," said Edith earnestly, touched by the melancholy tone of the last words. "I am certain you must have many friends—"
                  "Friends, yes! but not one true heart to love me! Ah, Edith! you pity me, do you not?"
                  He turned towards her, his face full of pleading tenderness, his eyes fixed on hers so wistfully Edith could not resist that appeal to her kindness; she let him take her hand as she answered gently,
                  "Indeed I do!"
                  "And will you comfort me?"
                  "If I can," she replied falteringly, as he drew her trembling fingers tighter within his own. The spell was weaving closer around her now, those subtle glances were reading her blushing face with devouring eagerness.
                  "If you can? Ah, my darling! my darling! Thank you for those words! You can make my life a heaven—will you?"
                  He leaned over her and tried to draw her towards him. Edith, pale, agitated, even in the tumult of the moment, felt alarmed, and started from his proffered embrace, springing up with a sensation of terror at the passion of his voice and gesture. In the instant of silence that followed that sudden movement, she heard with relief the sound of a light foot crushing the gravel outside—Denbigh caught it also.
                  "Pray forgive me, if I have frightened you," he said rapidly, and pressing the hand which he still held to his lips with a force that left the stain of that fierce kiss on the snowy skin, he relinquished it just as the hall door opened.
                  Edith could not reply; she had just time to sink into the nearest chair when Vinton entered the room. He was not very well pleased to see who was with his cousin, though he was too courteous to betray any discontent in his greetings of Denbigh, who rose to meet him him with the most complete self-possession. Edith sat in the shade, so that her paleness escaped Vinton's observation, and indeed she very soon recovered her composure and bore her part with quiet grace in the conversation that ensued. It did not last long; Denbigh very soon rose to go. He shook hands with Vinton first, then turned to Edith—
                  "Good evening, Miss Rockford; I hope I have not tired you too much by my long call."
                  He spoke so earnestly, and looked so contrite and solicitous of a kind word, that Edith could not do less than place her hand in his, though she would not return or notice his parting pressure. Vinton accompanied Denbigh to the door, and Edith took advantage of this to escape to her own room. She longed to be alone to think calmly of the events of the evening; she was frightened even now when she reflected on what she might have said, and truly rejoiced at her cousin's fortunate arrival—yet she could not help thinking with tender pity of Denbigh's well feigned melancholy wishing only too earnestly that she might cheer his interesting gloom.
                  Ah, poor enchanted maiden! where is the "Treu Thomas," who can dispel this dangerous dream and show her how all this fascinating glamour is but "rags and pretence"?
                  The next morning when Edith and Vinton met in the breakfast room, he looked at her comically and asked,
                  "Why did you run away so quickly last night, Coz?"
                  "I was tired," answered Edith with a little consciousness.
                  "So, after all, your visitor did not bore you?"
                  "Not at all," retorted Edith, "but perhaps I was afraid of some body else boring me."
                  Vinton laughed at this thrust, and forebore any further questioning. With that profound ignorance of the female mind, which he shared in common with the most accomplished of his sex, he was baffled by the fair tactictian, and set at rest in the belief of her indifference to his friend's rival.
                  It was a lovely day, golden with the rich sunlight of October, and Vinton very soon disappeared for a drive, Edith declined her Aunt's invitation to join her in a walk, and was again left quite alone. Perhaps she had a half hope that this solitude would soon be interrupted. Returning to the bay window again, she resigned herself to those pleasant dreams that flit through happy young hearts in the careless and untroubled spring of life. The book she had was only half open, and from time to time she glanced out into the gravel walk that led towards the gate, with a look of expectation, or letting her eyes wander over the fringe of trees to the line of rippling sea beyond, she watched idly the passing ships that melted one after the other into the mist on the horizon.
                  It was very tranquil and pleasant there, perhaps Edith's slumbers last night had not been as quiet as usual. Certain it is that as the moments stole past in their noiseless steps, a drowsiness overcame her senses, her eyes closed, and resting her head on the cushions of the lounge she fell asleep.
                  Perhaps half an hour later Vinton drove his poney carriage up to the door, and ushered his long expected friend into the hall.
                  "This way, Lionel," he said, opening the drawing-room door, "Wait here a moment, while I send for mother and Edith."
                  The young man thus unceremoniously left in the parlor, stood for a moment looking vaguely about him in the large empty room, which seemed very dim to him just out of the sunlight, and then crossed over to the bay-window, and raised the curtain. There lay Edith coiled up on the lounge, with one tiny rosetted foot peeping out from her dress. Her golden hair disordered by the careless attitude, escaped from its confinement, and the long curls fell half way over her shoulders. One round white arm exposed by the loose sleeve was flung upon the cushion over her head, the other held the unclosed book. Her morning robe was open at the throat so that the measured breath could be counted by the rise and fall of the lace across her white neck, her cheeks were tinged with a rosy flush, the parted lips were moist with the refreshing dews of sleep.
                  It was a charming picture. Lionel stood motionless for a few moments contemplating it with rapt admiration, then he suddenly dropped upon one knee as if to render the homage so much beauty deserved. But not for that only, audacious fellow! the moment was too precious to be wasted, and with a cautious motion he caught one of the perfumed ringlets and pressed it to his lips.
                  The act, quiet as it was, roused the fair sleeper, he had just time to regain his feet before Edith with a half sigh opened her eyes, their first glance rested on the stranger. He was tall, with a graceful and well poised figure, free from that excessive slenderness that makes most of our young men look like walking shadows; there was strength and power in every limb. His countenance was frank and expressive, adorned by curling chesnut hair and beard, and lighted by a pair of clear grey eyes that sparkled with wit and amiability.
                  "Pardon me," he said in response to her startled look, "I fear my abrupt entrance has disturbed you."
                  Edith sprang up, blushing at having been thus caught by a stranger, and answered in very pretty confusion, "I was very stupid to fall asleep—indeed I am much obliged to you for rousing me." As she spoke she raised her hand to her disordered hair. Perhaps she had some faint suspicion that a slight pull at those shining curls had awakened her.
                  "Oh, here you are, Edith," exclaimed Vinton, appearing at this moment. "I have just sent up stairs for you. This is my friend, Mr. Lionel Rohan, my cousin, Miss Rockford."
                  Edith and Lionel bowed in acknowledgment of this formal introduction, just as Mrs. Rockford, who had but now returned from her walk, entered the room.
                  "Ah, Mr. Rohan!" she exclaimed, "this is delightful. I have been long looking forward to the pleasure of welcoming you to my house."
                  The frank cordiality of her manner set the whole party at their ease, and started an animated conversation that lasted till Vinton carried off his friend.
                  Edith was glad to reach her own room to rearrange her dress, which she imagined must have impressed her new acquaintance with an idea of terrible unneatness. She felt heartily ashamed of herself when she thought of her sleep, and how she had been caught, and perchance to this may be attributed the extra care she bestowed upon her toilet. She wore a dark blue silk, and as if to atone for her former negligence of attire, she closed it at the throat with a narrow collar of lace, and arranged her hair without any ornament. Yet she was very lovely in this simple costume—certainly Lionel thought so, and could scarcely prevent himself from rudely expressing his admiration by a perpetual stare at dinner. This meal had been delayed to await Mr. Rockford's return from the city, so that it was quite late before Lionel and Vinton joined the ladies in the parlor. Vinton seated himself by his mother, and then said,
                  "Edith, the sunset is lovely. You should not be losing it here."
                  "Yes, indeed, Miss Rockford—are you afraid to venture out?"
                  "Not at all," replied Edith, rising, "it seems quite warm this evening."
                  In a few moments Lionel and Edith were on the piazza. The sunset, as Vinton had said, was truly superb. The whole heavens were covered with little clouds like the folds of a gorgeous curtain of purple and gold; towards the West the colors deepened until they melted into orange and crimson fires, that seemed to consume the clouds into their glowing breast. In this magical radiance the earth too shared, the trees near the house were brilliant with scarlet and amber, and the waters of the distant ocean shone like the sea of brass in the Great Temple.
                  Edith herself, as the slanting rays tinged her fair cheeks, flashed from her sunny eyes, and illumined her auburn hair like a crown of glory, seemed the very incarnation of the beautiful light. Lionel looked at her for a moment, then he said,
                  "Miss Rockford, I should not have needed Vinton's introduction this morning to tell me who you were."
                  "No, indeed, Mr. Rohan—we met a good many years ago."
                  "You have not forgotten it then?"
                  "By no means—indeed I have heard my cousin speak of you so often, I could not regard you as a stranger."
                  "Vinton has added another to the many obligations I already ready owe him," cried Lionel—"but even if he had never mentioned you to me, I should have remembered that one short evening when I had the happiness of seeing you."
                  "It was my first party," replied Edith with animation—"I think I have never enjoyed one as much since."
                  "I certainly found it delightful; how could it be otherwise when lighted by the Sunshine of your presence?"
                  "Mr. Rohan!" exclaimed Edith, turning upon him a look of astonishment, and blushing until she seemed to have absorbed the rosy light that was spreading over the more brilliant hues of the sky.
                  "Yes, Miss Rockford, I have a good memory."
                  "Well said," retorted Edith, recovering herself, "but I am sure that Vinton has aided it."
                  "Indeed he has not. I have cherished that remembrance as one of the brightest of my life—indeed it is the only speech I ever made which I have since regarded with honest pride—but I annoy you," he added hastily, noticing the shade of embarrassment on Edith's brow. "Pardon my abruptness."
                  "You overwhelm me, Mr. Rohan," said Edith, laughing again. "If you persist, I must positively return to the parlor."
                  "Ah! don't go in!" pleaded Lionel. "If you are chilly let me bring you a shawl—it is so pleasant here."
                  Edith assented, as the evening was indeed too fine to be wasted in-doors, and the young people sat chatting on the piazza till the fading twilight drove them in. Then there was music. Edith to her delight discovered that Rohan had a good barytone voice. Who does not know how the time steals away when two young people have the gift of song, and can try an infinite number of pieces together?—The evening closed with some College glees, which Vinton and Lionel gave with great force, Edith throwing the silver thread of her soprano into the choruses.
                  Percival Denbigh had not appeared all day. Edith was a little surprised, perhaps a little disappointed at this, and could not help contrasting her yesterday's companion with the new one of the past few hours. Meeting a fresh and youthful spirit like Lionel's after Denbigh's blazèe artificialities, was like a draught of sparkling water after tasting an enervating and intoxicating wine. Which would be the most reliable dependence for life?
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Here some are thinkin' on their sins,

                        "THE KIRK."—BURNS.
                     
                  
                  THE village church in Herford was a venerable structure that had weathered the storms of more than a hundred winters. It was built in the early days of the colonies, when wood was plentiful and easily procured. The great oak beams that supported the framework had been cut from the monarchs of the forest. Trees whose green youth had passed away before ever a white man's foot had pressed the soil that supported them; whose long lives had witnessed the rallyings of the dusky sons of the soil to repel those deadly invaders—had seen their first councils held in the security of strength and the pride of possession, and sheltered the last desperate warriors after their final struggle to defend the hunting grounds of their forefathers; whose old age had beheld the gradual growth of the feeble colonies—heard the repressed sighs of the voluntary exiles as they remembered the homes they would never see again; screened under their wide branches the first lovers who forgot danger and want in each other's smiles, and beheld through the thinning forest how the little cottages clustered together, a goodly company in the midst of the fields of waving green; and whose hearts, when at last they fell before the advancing settlement, were entombed like those of the brave old Crusader Kings, in the walls of the church, where they reposed while the great clock above them struck off the hours of a century, and the bell recorded the joys and sorrows of three generations, tolling its mournfullest notes for the village boys lost in battle, and ringing out its heartiest peal at the news of victory and freedom.
                  
                  This venerable edifice was built simply, as our ancestors could best afford. A plain oblong building painted white, with four long windows on each side shaded by dark green blinds, and a sloping roof of shingles stained black by time. In front an awkward, cumbrous steeple, resembling an irregular pile of boxes, surmounted by a slender spire, bearing aloft the great gilded rooster that looked so often towards the north east that people wondered if it had not rusted fast in that direction, indeed, the whole erection had received such a decided inclination towards the west from the perpetual buffetings of the east wind, that whenever a gale was blowing the school children ran past it with footsteps quickened by the fear lest it should at last succumb to its long time enemy, and falling crush them in its ruins.—Inside there were rows of stiff pews, dreadful to look at much more to sit in, and at the upper end a pulpit like a huge white china vase, set out in front of a narrow chancel, containing an altar like an ironing table, and two straight backed chairs that seemed determined to force the unlucky bishops who should occupy them into maintaining a "perpendicular" rigid as that of "Dean John Auricular." Yet, homely as the church was, the village people regarded it with affectionate reverence, and on this bright Sunday morning there was a goodly show of respectable gray heads, and rosy-cheeked young faces flocking up its narrow aisles.
                  The whole family from Rockford lawn was there. Mr. Rockford at the head of the seat with an aspect of stern decorum, that nevertheless suggested that he might be calculating the profits of the week in the pauses of the responses. Vinton next trying to be entirely attentive to the service, yet stealing every now and then a glance towards the pastor's pew, where Mabel sat alone and closely veiled. Lionel beside Edith, with a look of happiness tempered by proper solemnity on his pleasant face, and Edith herself, with the gay smiles all toned down to reverent attention. Last of all, Mrs. Rockford, very handsome, very pale, very sad, going through the external forms of devotion mechanically, but wearing a look as if, like the German Doëppelganger, her body was present while her spirit was far away in some remote region.
                  —How many secrets one can sometimes read in a careful scrutiny of the faces in church. There you view them unmoved moved by any such excitement as sways them at a place of public amusement, relapsing in the course of those quiet two hours into the natural expression. Now and then it is true you see a countenance transfigured by the aspect of absorbed devotion, but alas! how rarely is that the case! and even in that passing exaltation you catch the true key of the pious character. But beside these what revelations you find. There is the belle of the season a creature all gayety and smiles, now that decency forbids a laugh, what a lurking shadow of ill-temper deforms the mouth, how much of conscious vanity there is in the toss of the pretty head. Again there is that kind Miss Mary, always cheerful, always ready to aid any innocent amusement, wealthy, single, independent. You thought her without a care, now look at her, what unutterable sadness in the deep set eyes, what bravely concealed anguish has cut those sharp wrinkles in the brow of one still young. And there is that entertaining old gentleman that is always so polite, see now how cold a sneer hovers around the thin nostril, what unfeeling selfishness has shielded that handsome head from the storms that would otherwise have whitened it with snow. Study well this inexhaustible book, and you may read the heart almost as well as if gifted with the spear of Ithuriel.
                  A short distance to the right of the Rockfords appeared Mr. Florance Fay in faultless costume, a coat with the faintest shade of blue that contrasted pleasantly with his yellow hair, a blue cravat tied low down so as to display the little coral button that confined his collar, and tawny gloves of exquisite fit. His assumed expression of solemnity, sat as oddly on his insignificant features as on a pretty was doll. He was secretly wondering if Edith did not think him vastly handsome, and whether that curl over the right ear had not been crushed by his hat, though feeling rather uncomfortable when he glanced at the good-looking stranger beside her.
                  Just at the beginning of the Psalter there was a slight rustle cause by the entrance of a late worshipper. It was Percival Denbigh. He had fully intended to reach the church in season, but ten o'clock was an early hour for him to be out under any circumstances, and the yesterday had been devoted to an unwelcome and importunate visitor who did not depart until late in the evening, and whose commu nications had rendered his rest, never very good, more disturbed than usual. His only resource for recruited strength was a morning nap which lasted far longer than he had intended, so that he had been obliged to put himself into a very disagreeable amount of hurry to arrive even at this time. However he came up the aisle with dignified composure, refusing several polite offers of seats until he had passed the Rockford's pew. Edith knew who it was almost without looking up, but it is to be feared she lost a few words of the Psalm in following with her eyes for one instant that singularly graceful figure. Denbigh accepted the hospitable beckoning of a white-haired old church-warden and took his place beside him to the no small excitement of his two blushing daughters. There he stood, stylish, cool, indifferent, making no attempt to follow the services. Glancing over the congregation with a supercilious curiosity, bestowing a few moments' study on Lionel and dismissing him with a mental judgment of "Boy," and then giving himself up to the contemplation of Edith's pure beauty, with an earnestness which he took no pains to conceal. He was not encouraged in this by any responsive look, on the contrary after that one glance Edith permitted no more wandering thoughts, but gave herself with simple earnestness to her prayers.
                  Paul Haughton in his white surplice looked even more like a young saint, than in his ordinary dress, and there were many of the village maidens who regarded him with almost as much awe, as if he had been already canonized. He did full justice to our beautiful liturgy by his admirable reading, and his sermon was such as could scarcely fail to interest and instruct his hearers, full of thought, yet clothed in simple language and delivered with such eloquent power as made every word impressive.
                  When the service was over, after the momentary pause that followed the benediction, Denbigh glided into the aisle so quickly as to be beside Edith when she came out of the pew. He whispered how sorry he was that he could not see her yesterday, and just at the door where he knew that in another instant he must resign her to Lionel, he added, in a low, expressive tone—
                  "I have lived on your last words."
                  Edith started with an uncomfortable recollection of what those words had been, but it was impossible for her to reply except by a bow as Lionel was close beside her, and Denbigh had turned away. Just at the foot of the steps Florance Fay was waiting for a smile, she gave it very pleasantly as she passed him, and he walked off consoled by its cordiality for the disappointment of seeing her escorted home by the good-looking stranger.
                  Vinton, too, lingered after the rest, and he was rewarded; among the last appeared Mabel's shrouded figure. As he caught a glimpse of her, it was touching to see the expression of tender sympathy that crossed his fine face. He hesitated, not wishing to intrude upon her, but when Mabel saw him her eyes lighted up so brightly and she saluted him so cordially, that he advanced at once, while she paused in the door-way.
                  "Good morning, Miss Mabel; are you looking for your cousin?"
                  "No," said Mabel, glancing back into the church. "I see he has stopped to speak to some old gentleman. I left mamma alone. I think I will not wait."
                  "Then may I go with you?"
                  "Certainly, Mr. Rockford," replied Mabel, with that grave calmness that deprived all she said of any suspicion of coquetry. "I hope you understand how welcome you are at our house whenever you like to come."
                  "Thank you, thank you, Miss Mabel, if I may come to see you, and you will only let let me read to you, or entertain you in any way, it will make very happy."
                  So away under the fading trees in alternate sunshine and shadow, walked those two young couples, Mabel and Vinton, Edith and Lionel. Which of them are destined to pass thus side by side down the chequered path of life? How often has inexorable fate separated even betrothed lovers! In the gardens of Hatfield, three hundred years ago, the fascinating Seymour and the youthful Princess Elizabeth walked hand in hand, yet how widely different their destinies, they were torn asunder, and doomed one to a premature death, the other to a long and glorious life—one to the scaffold, the other to a throne!
                  In the course of that long, bright Sunday, Lionel and Edith had improved their acquaintance vastly; they were both blessed with charming light heartedness, so that their conversation bubbled out perpetually into laughter, and they found each other most congenial companions. They had gone to the second service alone together, the elder couple not caring to go out, and Vinton having quite disappeared. Afterwards, just before dark, they had taken a long walk together, and now in the early evening they sat in the bay-window, keeping up an animated conversation. At last Lionel said—
                  "I am so much obliged to you for saying I may call you Miss Edith."
                  "Certainly, Mr. Rohan; I like it much better than Miss Rockford, that is, from my friends."
                  "A thousand thanks for the kind permission to rank myself among your friends," said Lionel, with enthusiasm. "Edith is such a pretty name."
                  "It is good old Saxon," replied the handsome blonde.
                  "Yes, and I like that. Indeed I have become quite a connoisseur in names through the teachings of a friend of mine, who is a bit of an author. By the way, Miss Edith, did you every know any one who wrote books?"
                  "Not intimately," reflected Edith. "I have seen Mr. Irving in New York, and I remember once I was introduced to a woman with long curls and green spectacles, who wore a yellow dress trimmed with black, who, I was told, was connected with the 'Wide Awake;' but she was so insufferably conceited, I did not care to pursue the acquaintance further."
                  "No wonder," laughed Lionel. "However, my friend is not at all like a disagreeable blue stocking; he is really a very clever fellow, and, as I say, his eloquence has converted me to an admiration for euphonious titles. He insists that it is absolutely impossible to write a graceful sentence with an ordinary or unmusical name to mar its harmony. The heroine of his first book was called Rowena Fontleroy. Hew do you like that?"
                  "Rather too sentimental, I think."
                  "I agree with you. But, poor fellow, he thought it beautiful. Oh, Miss Edith, it is easy for us outsiders to laugh at the best fruit of a man's study and patience, but I assure you it is very hard on him, when he has devoted months to the composition of a piece that is read and flung aside in an hour."
                  "You speak feelingly, Mr. Rohan."
                  "I do; for, I assure you, I am interested in the subject. Now, this friend of mine is poor; he writes not merely for amusement, but to aid his widowed mother. Just think how arduous is his task. He is forced to prepare so much matter in a given time, although his head may ache, and his heart be heavy; and worse yet, although he feels that he is incapable of penning anything which will do him credit. Then, when it is finished, comes the inevitable criticism that he lacks variety; or, worse still, if he has ventured to step outside the regular routine story of love and marriage, he is identified with one of the worst characters by the indignant public, who declare it to be a portraiture of himself, as if a man would be either such a fool or such a lunatic as to betray his own vices."
                  "But," urged Edith, "don't you think people generally, almost unconsciously, describe themselves in the hero or heroine?"
                  "No, indeed! that is a modern fancy. Of course, writers often express their own sentiments, when they can be introduced without marring the harmony of the narrative; but quite as often they endeavor to inculcate a lesson, by depicting the evil results of some vice which they abhor. Now, my friend was so unlucky as to make a thief the prominent character in one of his early pieces, and ever since then some people have insisted that it would not be safe to leave him alone with the silver spoons!"
                  "How cruel!" laughed Edith. "Hereafter I shall feel more sympathy for the trials of authors than ever."
                  At this instant there was a little bustle in the hall, announcing the coming of a visitor.
                  "Oh dear!" exclaimed Lionel, forgetting his friend's sorrows in his own; "now there is some one come to see you."
                  "Perhaps not, Mr. Rohan."
                  "But I am sure it is! Miss Edith, it is positively wicked of you to attract people here to spoil my last evening."
                  Edith could not reply, for at this instant Florance Fay entered the room. Emboldened by her pleasant smile in the morning, he had arrayed himself gorgeously, and came to sun himself in the light of her beauty. He advanced gracefully, saluting every one with a series of little bows nicely graded to express respect to Mrs. Rockford, deference to Mr. Rockford, formal condescension to Lionel, and admiration to Edith. This brilliant performance was but just concluded, when Percival Denbigh arrived, eager to lay his homage at the feet of the lovely belle. Her seat was nearly opposite the door, and he advanced directly across the room with his eyes fixed upon her, as if he saw no one else, greeting her with outstretched hand and such evident empressment, as called up a little color into her cheek, and made Florance and Lionel watch him with uneasy surprise.
                  "I am delighted to see you looking so well," he said, and then, as if suddenly becoming aware of the presence of other persons, he bowed distantly to the two young men, and turned towards the sofa. Where Mrs. Rockford sat beside her husband.
                  "I beg your pardon, madam, how are you to-night? Ah! Mr. Rockford! This is most fortunate, I was hoping to find you at home this evening."
                  Now Percival Denbigh had a deeper object than mere gallantry, in this visit to Rockford Lawn, and seating himself beside the banker, he addressed himself to obtaining from him some information which he was extremely desirous to acquire. Yet, from time to time, even in the midst of the most animated discussion of political questions, he would shoot a flashing glance towards Edith, meeting sometimes a timid look in return that assured him he was not forgotten. The conversation gradually turned into the right direction.
                  "After all, then, you consider manufacturing or bank stocks the most desirable investment?"
                  "Yes," replied Mr. Rockford, "that is for men who can attend to it themselves."
                  "I ask," continued Denbigh, "because I have never yet quite satisfied myself as to the safest disposal of the surplus income I sometimes have after a good crop. Everything in this country is so wretchedly uncertain."
                  "It is, undoubtedly," assented Mr. Rockford. "It is very unfortunate that we have no national bank; the failure of our first experiment should not be enough to deter us from establishing an institution of such manifest utility; however, as long as the country is ruled by a set of wretched demagogues, we can scarcely hope for any rational discussion of that or any other public measure."
                  "I quite agree with you, my dear sir," said Denbigh, anxious to recur to the former topic; "but meantime, the question is important, what is the most judicious investment?"
                  "That is an inquiry which puzzles many men," observed Mr. Rockford, sententiously. "Railroad shares are very well for speculators who can watch the markets and devote their time to them—but as I have said, I have a preference for good manufacturing stocks, for myself, they bring in very high interest with comparatively little risk. But for ladies, and perhaps for persons at a distance from the cities, I consider State bonds as safe and reliable, if well chosen—it may be prejudice, but I prefer them to bonds and mortgages. It is true, if the papers are lost, they cannot be replaced; but they are easily convertible into cash, and any ordinary-care will guard against accident. I have preferred placing my niece's small property in that form, and I fancy the vaults of my bank will guard it securely."
                  This was what Denbigh wished to hear. His eyes gleamed as he caught the words eagerly; but he betrayed no other sign of special interest, and continued the conversation with seemingly unflagging enthusiasm until a burst of laughter attracted attention to the bay window.
                  "What is it so funny?" asked Mrs. Rockford, who was tired of listening to the didactic discourse of her husband, and had risen and joined the young people.
                  "Mr. Fay is giving us an account of his trials with a puppy," answered Edith.
                  "Don't let me interrupt you," said Mrs. Rockford, as she took the chair which Lionel offered.
                  "You have no idea what a dreadful time I had," continued Florance, looking at Edith—"Cousin Emma promised it to mother, so I offered to bring it up."
                  "That was very kind, certainly," said Edith good-naturedly. "And how did you carry him.?"
                  "Why you see he was a little black fellow: so I put him in my pocket at first, and thought I should have no trouble, but just after the cars had started he began to cry. It was really astonishing how much noise he made. Everybody looked up surprised. I tried to pretend I did not know anything about it; and then do you know, Mrs. Rockford, positively there was one vulgar wretch there who said he believed I had a baby hidden under the seat!" The solemn abhorrence with which this statement was made was so irresistible that there was another burst of merriment. Fay resented this a little—"You may laugh, but I assure you I felt excessively uncomfortable. Of course I could not stand that accusation; so I took the little creature out, and tied him up in my pocket-handkerchief—but that only made it worse; he struggled frantically, and tore the handkerchief all to pieces—and then yelp, yelp, yelp, louder than before, till the conductor came and said I must go out into the smoking car. You know I never use tobacco—it makes me sick—and there the little brute kept up his cries all the way, so that I was almost crazy."
                  "Did you say it was a puppy?" asked Denbigh, coming up at this moment; "I don't wonder you thought you were beside yourself."
                  Florance perceived the sneer though he did not understand the joke; he was a man wholly without the power of repartee, so he only gave a sulky glance at the offender as he rose to go. Edith saw his annoyance, and with native amiability hastened to dispel it.
                  "Good-night, Mr. Fay—give my love to your mother, and tell her I am coming to see her very soon."
                  That was quite enough. Florance immediately pictured to himself Edith's visit and how he should walk home with her, and went off very happy. As they reseated themselves Denbigh took the vacant place, leaving Lionel to entertain Mrs. Rockford.
                  "You were rather severe on Mr. Fay," said Edith gently: "I am sorry, for he feels a slight very keenly."
                  "Ten thousand pardons," cried Denbigh, drawing his chair nearer and leaning towards her. "You know, Edith, I would not vex you for worlds."
                  The words were spoken in a low tone but they caught Lionel's ear, and made him start and glance quickly at Edith That was the language of something more than friendship, and he noted her blushing cheeks and drooping lids, with a sigh of regret, as he turned away to answer rather vaguely some remark of Mrs. Rockford's. If he had looked one instant longer he would have seen Edith draw back a little, and say with some dignity:
                  "Mr. Denbigh, you forget."
                  "Again forgive me, but you do not know how unhappy I am. I have to leave here to-morrow."
                  "So soon!" exclaimed Edith, startled into a genuine expression of sorrow.
                  "Yes," replied Denbigh, "and worse, I fear I shall have to go South, though be sure I shall return as soon as possible. But I must see you before I go. When may I come?"
                  "To-morrow any time after twelve," said Edith hastily, and as if constrained by a power superior to herself.
                  Denbigh thanked her earnestly for the permission, and then made his adieux. It was quite late, and Edith, who was annoyed and anxious at the turn events had taken, would not see Lionel's endeavors to detain her, but rose in a few moments to bid good-night. He noticed the shade on her beautiful brow, and attributed it, with a feeling of bitter disappointment, to that black-eyed man. When she was gone the parlor had lost its attraction, and Lionel excused himself to Mrs. Rockford, and lighting a cigar went outside, ostensibly to wait for Vinton, but really to pace the terrace that commanded a view of Edith's window, and watch eagerly the shadow that flitted across the curtain. After regarding it for some time, he became convinced from the regularity with which it appeared and disappeared, that Edith was walking up and down her room, and this unusual indication of restlessness increased his uneasiness. His perplexed reveries were at last disturbed by the approach of Vinton. Lionel heard his happy elastic step and went forward to meet him.
                  "Hello, old fellow, where have you been all night?"
                  "Forgive me, Rohan," said Vinton, "I did not intend to have kept you so long, but I met Miss Sandys in her garden and really I had no idea it was so late."
                  "I forgive you, Vinton," laughed Lionel, "but one would think from your wandering into the Sandys' garden in that style, that it was as public as the Bois de Bologne."
                  "You have me there," said Vinton. "I suppose I might as well confess that I was walking by when Miss Mabel asked me in. But really, she is very lovely."
                  Meantime Percival Denbigh had returned to the hotel and sought his chamber. Alone there by the light of a sickly oil lamp he looked old and jaded, and his hand trembled as he opened his portfolio and taking out a sheet of cream colored paper, aristocratically stamped with a crest, proceeded to write in a scrawling, illegible hand, the following letter:

                        RENAUD.
                     
                  
                  THE next morning at breakfast Edith's place was vacant till the meal was half over; then she came in looking a shade paler than usual, and offering a confused apology of "headache," that ready excuse in which ladies take refuge so frequently, and unfortunately, owing to their delicate organization and nervous temperaments, only too often, with far more truth than others are willing to allow. Lionel watched her anxiously, but he was in a measure reassured by the smiles with which she took part in the conversation—smiles which it was difficult to fancy wholly banished from those lovely lips, round which they played as naturally as sunshine over an ever dimpling fountain.
                  "Don't you think a walk in the garden would do you good, Miss Edith?" asked Lionel, as they left the table. He was determined to make the most of the short remaining time before his departure.
                  "Yes," replied Edith, readily, "very likely it would; and besides, I must try to find some flowers for the vases, if they are not all gone."
                  She put on a round hat that was very bewitching, and whether it was the shade of the gay ribbons or the fresh morning air, her cheeks had soon regained their roses. They went down the lawn, chatting pleasantly, into the spacious garden. It was quite a wilderness of flowers, here and there some delicate plants had been touched by the early frost, but the beds were still gay with dahlias, verbenas nas, and the beautiful late roses that give us our last remembrance of June in October. Edith had soon filled the basket which Lionel carried, and proposed returning to the house.
                  "Oh, don't go in yet," pleaded Lionel, rendered desperate by the rapid flight of those past moments, and nerving himself to make an enquiry which lay near his heart, he added, "Miss Edith, may I ask you a question?"
                  "Certainly, Mr. Rohan."
                  "You will not be offended?"
                  "I believe you incapable of asking any question at which I could take offence."
                  "Is Mr. Denbigh an old friend of yours?"
                  The instantaneous flush which swept across Edith's cheeks at this unexpected attack, was a mute answer that Lionel thought more eloquent than many words. What would he have given could his name have summoned up that glow?
                  "I have known him some time," she said, after a moment's pause, and without looking up.
                  —What woman does not recall the horrible sensation of feeling herself blush? To know that the treacherous blood is hanging out false signals which must inevitably deceive the observer; and yet be entirely unable either to master this enemy in the camp, or explain without derogation of dignity that what appears to be the evidence of profound emotion, is in fact only the result of a sensitive complexion and a sudden surprise.—
                  "I beg your pardon," said Lionel, gravely.
                  "There is no need, Mr. Rohan," replied Edith, recovering herself and turning her clear eyes upon him with unmistakable sincerity. "I am not at all angry, but really, we had better go in."
                  Lionel was baffled, but now he fancied he had surprised her secret—as if any man could ever discover what a clever woman wishes to conceal!—and yet at this moment he was no wiser than before. If he could only have been convinced that she was really attached to this stranger, he might, he thought, have schooled himself into regarding his lovely companion with indifference, or at least he could have the strength of mind to remove himself from her too powerful influence. As it was, however, he was puzzled, yet he could not restrain a lingering hope; at worst, there was no reason why he should deny himself the pleasure of seeing her now until the last moment of his brief stay; reaching this satisfactory conclusion, he said, as they entered the house—
                  "You will ride to the station with us, won't you, Miss Edith?"
                  "I don't know; really, I had not thought of it," and catching a glimpse of her cousin coming out of the library, she added, "to tell the truth, Vinton has not invited me."
                  "Haven't I, coz?" exclaimed Vinton, advancing and accepting the challenge. "Then, behold, I do so at once, and in form. Mr. V. Rockford presents his compliments to Miss Rockford, and begs that she will honor him with her company in a drive this morning."
                  "Miss Rockford accepts with pleasure," laughed Edith, desirous of doing all in her power to oblige her cousin's friend—perhaps liking the proposal for his own sake.
                  "How soon must we start?" asked Lionel.
                  At this enquiry Vinton produced a mysterious little pink paper from his pocket, one of those cabalistic documents which people who live in the country and travel much on railroads, always have about them, and which are quite incomprehensible to any one who has not devoted a considerable portion of his existence to their study. Comparing this and his watch, after a moment of profound reflection, he replied,
                  "Your train leaves at eleven fifteen, and it is now a quarter past ten—so we must start in about twenty minutes."
                  "Then I have just time to put my flowers in water before we go," said Edith, turning towards the dining room.
                  Lionel followed her, and did his best to be useful during the arrangement of the bouquets. His services were appreciated, for when he asked for a reward, Edith selected one of the prettiest roses and gave it to him. At that moment Lionel forgot all about the disagreeable Denbigh, and pressed the pretty white bud to his lips in an enthusiasm of admiration; afterwards endeavoring to conceal his honest blush by an awkward attempt to fasten it into his button hole.
                  "It won't stay, Miss Edith," he said ruefully, as he saw that there was danger of losing the precious gift in its precarious place.
                  "Won't you have a pin?" suggested Edith.
                  
                  "I don't know any thing about pins, but if you would be good enough to arrange it for me—won't you, please?"
                  Edith assented. For one moment she stood close beside him; her hands trembled a little, and his heart beat so violently that he wondered she did not notice how it shook his coat
                  "There, now I think it will stay," she said, as she gave the last leaf a little twist.
                  "Thank you, so much, Miss Edith. I shall value it more than I dare to tell you now."
                  "Time to start, if you really must go," said Vinton, looking in at the door, and Edith glided away to arrange her dress for the drive, while Lionel went to bid his host and hostess good bye.
                  A pleasant ten minutes' trot brought them to the station just as the distant rumble of the approaching train began to be audible. Of course there was a little hurry and rush, and Lionel came out of the office, ticket in hand, just as the cars swept up to the platform.
                  "We shall see you in New York, Mr. Rohan," said Edith hurriedly, as she placed her hand in his.
                  "Certainly, Miss Edith. I shall look forward with the greatest eagerness to your coming;" then in a lower tone, he added, "Do not forget me," wrung her hand so hard that her fingers ached with the pressure, and sprang into the car.
                  "Good bye, old fellow!" cried Vinton at his side, and for one moment Lionel stood on the platform waving his hat, and then the ruthless engine whirled him away.
                  "Will you take a drive, coz?" asked Vinton as they walked back to the poney carriage.
                  "No thank you," said Edith, looking at her watch hastily—"I must go home at once."
                  "Very well, but you lose a lovely day."
                  Edith made an indistinct reply as she sprang to her seat, and Vinton continued as he got in beside her,
                  "Rohan is a capital fellow."
                  "Yes, I like him very much," answered Edith, rather abstractedly. Her cousin noticed her preoccupation, and innocently supposing it arose from regret at parting with his friend, forbore to urge her into conversation.
                  On reaching home Edith ran to her room. It was just twelve o'clock, and she hastily rearranged her dress, and then sat down at the window with a book in her hand, ostensibly to read—really to wait and listen, her heart despite all her resolutions beating violently at the thought of the coming interview, vainly endeavoring to decide exactly what she would do and say, striving against the invisible chains that were weaving around her, yet fearing that all her efforts would be vain against the magic of the subtle glances she was so soon to encounter.
                  —I know of few sensations more uncomfortable than that of momentarily expecting a lingering visiter whom you long yet dread to see. These seasons of anxious waiting that occasionally fall to the lot of every woman, are among the most trying of the tests to which their nervous organizations are ever subjected. From the time when in the early sunlight of the golden age, the "beautiful-browed Œnone" looked from the heights of "many-fountained Ida" for the truant Paris, it has been tiresome watching for a laggard lover.
                  It was nearly one o'clock before Edith's solitude was broken by a knock at the door, followed by the announcement, "Mr. Denbigh, Miss Edith."
                  One hasty glance at the mirror, and with fluttering steps she descended to the parlor. Percival Denbigh, who had been pacing uneasily about the room, turned at the sound of her approach, and banishing the harassing thoughts that had clouded his brow, came forward to meet her all radiant with smiles.
                  "At last!" he exclaimed, as he held out both hands, and tried to clasp hers within them.
                  Edith drew back, persistently ignoring the motion, merely bowing gravely. Denbigh was not to be put off.
                  "Are you not glad to see me?"
                  "Yes, certainly."
                  "Then why will you not shake hands?"
                  Edith at this rested her fingers in his for an instant, and then, as she seated herself in an isolated arm chair, she asked—
                  "Do you really go to-day?"
                  "Yes, at two o'clock."
                  "So soon? then you will lunch here first, will you not? Let me call my aunt."
                  "Ah! pray do not, Miss Edith. I must beg you to present sent my farewell compliments to her, for really I want to see you so very much this morning, that I had rather you would not send for her, and I do not care for any lunch—to tell the truth, I forgot all about it. What time do you have it?"
                  "At one o'clock."
                  "And it is nearly that now?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Then my time is even shorter than I thought."
                  "You need not hasten on that account," said Edith, politely.
                  "Yes I must, for you will be sent for, or some one will come, and I have so much to say to you alone." He had remained standing during this short conversation; he now drew a chair near her, and seated himself so that he was quite close beside her. "Miss Edith, you will not refuse me one last request?"
                  "What is it, Mr. Denbigh?"
                  "I am going away, this is our last meeting. I may be detained at the South for two or three months, but you will not forget me, will you?—and you will let me write to you?"
                  "Indeed, Mr. Denbigh, I don't think I ought," exclaimed Edith, startled.
                  "Ah, you cannot be so cruel as to deny me a pleasure which will cost you so little, and be of such value to me.—Think how solitary I shall be on my lonely plantation, and how a letter from you will cheer my drooping spirits, and I will send you such nice long answers. Ah, please do not refuse me!"
                  Edith was touched; she hesitated; after all there could be no harm in a mere friendly correspondence. Her next remonstrance was fainter.
                  "It is quite against my rules—"
                  "To other people, of course, but surely you do not regard me as you would a stranger. You know how much I love you"—Edith looked alarmed—"Nay, I will not frighten you again as I did the other evening, but remember the promise you then made me; there was surely no harm in that. You said you would do what you could to make me happy; this is certainly not too much to ask. Please say you will."
                  Those fascinating eyes were dazzling her with their light, those persuading tones lulled her suspicions, and that handsome face, full of imploring eagerness, bent over her, holding her with the charm of its influence.
                  "I consent," she said at last, "but you will not find me a very frequent correspondent."
                  "One word from you will be more precious than all the world beside. How can I thank you enough, oh my beautiful angel—"
                  At this moment the bell for lunch rang—its silvery tinkle, tinkle, was as unwelcome to Denbigh as is the mellow music of the huntsman's recall to the hound that is close on the track of his panting victim. Edith roused by the sound, rose as she said,
                  "You had better come and take something before you start on your journey."
                  "No," cried Denbigh, hastily. "It is impossible; I have not time, nor am I in spirits to face indifferent eyes. I must go now. Oh, Edith, you are sorry that we have to part?"
                  She was sorry, very sorry; warm-hearted, impulsive, generous, she saw no evil in this man, and while shrinking with instinctive delicacy from his open avowals, she yet felt for him sufficient interest to make the prospect of a long separation very painful.
                  "You will return soon," she faltered with softened eyes, and paling cheeks.
                  "Indeed I will, my darling! Every moment away from you will be a blank. And now, Good-bye! good-bye!"
                  There were footsteps in the hall; but he seized both her hands in his, and touched his lips lightly to her forehead. He was gone before the audacity could be resisted. And after all, what harm? Was the Grecian Athene less pure because the incense of a false worship swept across her beautiful brow?
                  Thus in one day Edith parted with her two lovers and was left to the tranquil course of her home life with no more moving excitement to break its routine than an occasional visit from Mr. Florance Fay. Perhaps at first she found the time rather long, perhaps she sent a few sighs to the memory of the past and could not help anticipating with eagerness her removal to the city and the return of the absent. But hers was too sunny a nature to be long overclouded, and she found so much to occupy her in her own happy home that she had not many moments to give to useless regrets.
                  A few days after Percival Denbigh's departure, there came a magnificent basket of flowers to her, accompanied by a letter from him, informing her that he was on the eve of his departure from New York for the south, and sending his earnest adieu. The reply to this note cost Edith considerably more thought than the fair sage of Alexandria would have bestowed upon the solution of a most complicated proposition; and it was only after much deliberation that this harmless result was finally achieved.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "MY DEAR FRIEND:
                              
                              "Thank you for the flowers, which came safely, and are deliciously fresh and beautiful. We have been as quiet as possible since you left, and I have often thought of the pleasant past summer. I hope you will have a safe and agreeable journey, and return before very long.
                              
                                 "Yours truly,
                                 EDITH ROCKFORD."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  That same afternoon, by way of dissipating all useless sentiment, she consoled herself by going to see Mabel, and the two young ladies were so mutually well pleased with each other that they sat chatting together regardless of the flight of time, until the twilight stole in upon them and reminded Edith that evening was approaching. Just as she rose to go they were interrupted by the arrival of Vinton, who had discovered his cousin's whereabouts and obligingly came to offer his escort home, as it was nearly dark.
                  "Very good of you, Vinton, really," said Edith comically as they went down the gravel path together, after bidding Mabel good night. "But I wonder now if I had been calling on Mrs. Marvin if you would have thought it too late for me to come home alone.
                  "Pray don't be severe, Coz," said Vinton deprecatingly.
                  "Not for worlds," replied Edith growing earnest, "she is very charming, Vinton, and I am quite willing that whenever I go there you shall find excuse for coming for me."
                  This was the beginning of a great deal of pleasant intercourse between the two girls. Edith found in the endeavor to dissipate Mabel's sadness an occupation and a cure for her own less real melancholy—and Mabel looked for her bright smiles as the sunshine of her days; thus the intimacy between them rapidly ripened into a firm friendship. Of course in the numerous walks and drives and other schemes of distraction which his cousin devised to cheer the gentle recluse, Vinton was often permitted to take part, and at each interview his tender admiration deepened and strengthened. Nor was Mrs. Rockford less forward in doing her part towards making Herford a pleasant home to the strangers. She went frequently to see Mrs. Sandys, and even seemed to promote her son's devotion to her daughter. She had also exerted herself to induce the most desirable of the small circle of agreeable residents, to call upon the ladies, and thus contributed all in her power to make them feel less lonely. So the last weeks of October passed swiftly away, and the visits of the younger Rockfords grew more frequent as the time for their departure for the city drew near. During these numerous interviews it occasionally happened that they met Paul Haughton, he was often at the Sandys; and on more than one occasion joined them in their walks or drives, and thus their acquaintance with him, which had been until this time rather distant and formal, strengthened into a real esteem. There was something so lovely in his character, so truly and piously earnest in his east of mind, that Edith came to regard him with a reverent admiration which might have turned the head of one less simple and unaffected, and Vinton found in him at once an agreeable companion, and a friend upon whom he might rely. When he went to bid him good bye a day or two before the removal, he urged Mr. Haughton to visit him in New York whenever it should be convenient to him to leave the parish. The young clergyman finally consented, exacting in return a promise from Vinton that in case he was obliged to come to Herford in the course of the winter he would make the Rectory his home.
                  "It would be real charity to look in upon my solitude," he said, as a final argument.
                  "Never fear," replied Vinton, "I should be delighted to remain here all winter if I could, and I have no doubt my studies would be pursued to better advantage here than in the city, if I could only persuade my parents of it. However I dare say you will see me some day when you least expect it."
                  "You will be most welcome at any time," replied the pastor earnestly, and so they parted.
                  It was the night before the semi-annual migration, and Rockford lawn had been in a state of confusion for three days. A certain degree of order was finally attained and the whole family assembled in the library after tea. There was a cheerful fire there, and before it a large rug was spread on the inlaid floor which began to look chilly in its polished smoothness. One or two of the most valuable pictures had been taken down, and in one corner there was a ghostly object which might have startled one in the twilight, but which was in reality nothing more than a tall stand of bijouterie covered with a sheet. On the whole, however, the aspect of the room was comfortable, and Mr. Rockford sat reading his paper at the table with his usual serenity. Vinton was occupied with a book, his mother reclined near him in an arm-chair, and Edith was coiled upon a sofa with an aspect of huge fatigue. Indeed her exertions had been considerable that day, as about trifles she was what ladies would call a "bit of an old maid," and liked to have all her own affairs arranged by herself and to her own satisfaction.
                  "Tired, cousin?" asked Vinton looking up, as she heaved a portentously audible sigh.
                  "Yes, very," answered Edith, "but you need not look disappointed, I will go to the Sandys all the same."
                  "Are you going to bid them good-bye this evening?" enquired Mrs. Rockford rousing herself.
                  "Yes mama, won't you go too?"
                  "I think I will, thank you, I had intended calling before, but I have been so busy."
                  "Where did you say you were going, Claudia?" said Mr. Rockford looking up from his paper.
                  "To bid Mrs. Sandys good-bye."
                  "Mrs. George Sandys? I will go with you," he continued slowly, regarding his wife with a singular expression.
                  "You are very kind," she answered gently—"Shall we start now? I think it is time."
                  Vinton and Edith heard with wonder. Such a thing had never been known before as Mr. Rockford's voluntarily proposing to call upon what he would have designated as "a parcel of women." However, they did not betray any surprise, and on their walk neither of them made any reference to their unusual companion. Vinton's eagerness and Edith's restlessness made them adopt a pace so much more rapid than that of the elder couple, that they soon passed them and reached the Sandys house a considerable distance in advance. It was a pleasant evening, a young moon shedding faint rays of silver through the ragged branches of the half stripped trees, and a light wind making rustling sport in the fallen leaves. Mabel sitting at the window of the unlighted drawing-room, caught a glimpse of Edith's light figure as she entered the gate and came out to the door to meet her.
                  "Here's a glance of sunshine," she said cheerfully, "and the last for some time, I fear."
                  "Yes, dear, I suppose so; but you know I shall write."
                  "Yes, Miss Mabel," added Vinton, "and you must be sure to answer her letter punctually, or we shall all be in despair."
                  "How is Mrs. Sandys?" asked Edith, as they entered the parlor. "Aunt Claudia and uncle Rockford are close behind us."
                  "Here I am, my dear," the lady answered for herself, rising from the sofa where she had been sitting in shadow. "Mabel, ring for lights."
                  "The twilight is very pleasant, I am sure," said Edith, and the arrival at this moment of her aunt, Mrs. Rockford, prevented the immediate execution of the order.
                  This was not the first interview between Mrs. Sandys and Mr. Rockford, but their acquaintance had been limited to a formal introduction and a few set phrases of compliment; so that there was a certain awkwardness in this meeting of comparative strangers in a half dark room. Mr. Rockford fell over an invisible chair in his advance to Mrs. Sandys, and then groped blindly about, vainly endeavoring to find a seat.
                  "Come into the other room," said Mrs. Sandys, noticing his embarrassment. "We have a fire there, and it is far pleasanter. Won't you come too, Edith."
                  "No, thank you," replied Edith gayly, "it is much nicer here in this lovely moonlight. We cannot be so unsentimental as to leave it."
                  
                  "Romance for the young," retorted Mrs. Sandys; "but I think we shall prefer warmth and light," and she led the way into the library.
                  It was a small room, scarcely deserving any more dignified title than that of boudoir; though the well-stocked book-shelves claimed for it its ordinary designation. They covered the whole wall, except at the large window and across the chimney-piece. A bright wood fire burned on the hearth; there were candles on the mantel, and above them, full in their light, hung a single picture.
                  It was a portrait of a strikingly handsome young man; dark hair, arranged in the short, crisp curls so much worn thirty years ago; small side whiskers, of a lighter shade of chestnut, and large grey eyes, in whose depths you seemed to read a strange sadness that was also indicated by the faint line on the intellectual brow, and the almost imperceptible shade around the amiable mouth.
                  It chanced that Mrs. Rockford had never been in this room before, and on entering, she had taken a seat by the fire so near the mantel that she could not, without an effort, see the picture, which, therefore, escaped her observation. Her husband, however, was directly opposite to it; so that his first glance around the room encountered the portrait. He started a little, but made no reference to it then, only from time to time looking earnestly at it. After half an hour's conversation, Edith, actuated by the benevolent intention of permitting her cousin a short tête-à-tête with her friend, made an excuse for joining the elders in the library. Her arrival suggested to Mrs. Rockford one of the objects of the present visit. Turning to her hostess, she said—
                  "Amelia, I have a favor to ask of you."
                  "Indeed! Anything I can do to oblige you will give me great pleasure."
                  "Will you let Mabel come and spend Christmas with us?"
                  "Yes, do—please, Mrs. Sandys," pleaded Edith, "we shall not be at all gay then, and I should like it so much."
                  "You are very kind," answered Mrs. Sandys frankly, "and I shall be delighted to have her go. Her winter will be very dull here, I fear, and at that time I shall have a friend with me; so that I can spare her very well."
                  "Oh, thank you, thank you!" cried Edith earnestly, "how pleasant it will be!"
                  Meantime her innocent little stratagem for Vinton's benefit had not succeeded as well as she had hoped. It is true, he had availed himself of these few moments to tell Mabel how much he regretted the parting; but before he could say half what he wished, she became uneasy at the absence of her friend, and rose, saying—
                  "I think we had better join Edith."
                  "So soon, Miss Mabel? You know this is my last evening."
                  "Yes, and I am very, very sorry," she replied truthfully; "but I really think we should go to the library."
                  "You are right, as you always are, Miss Mabel, and I submit. But if I can aid you in any way in the city, promise me you will call upon me."
                  "I will, certainly."
                  "And oh! Miss Mabel," added Vinton, as they crossed the room, "do not forget me."
                  —How stereotyped are the phrases of affection. Since the days when the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair, how many lovers have said, "Think of me, and do not forget."—
                  "Mabel," said Edith, as her friend entered to the library, "you are to visit us at Christmas—isn't it nice?"
                  "Yes, if mama likes."
                  "Certainly, my dear; I think it will be very pleasant for you."
                  "I shall want to see you all very much by that time," continued Mabel. "And I shall be most glad to think that we are to meet so soon."
                  "And I shall have something to look forward to," added Vinton, as his mother made a movement to leave.
                  Mr. Rockford rose, too. "Mrs. Sandys," he said, with stately politeness, "I also owe you my thanks for your kind permission to your daughter to visit us."
                  "You are most kind to wish it," answered Mrs. Sandys courteously.
                  His eyes were upon his wife, who had advanced one pace from her seat, and stood talking to Mabel—"You have a lovely home here," he went on; "I am sure it will be cheerful even in the depths of winter."
                  
                  "Yes, it is a most comfortable and convenient house."
                  His wife had turned now, thinking it was quite time for their departure; she advanced another step, and was nearly in the middle of the room.
                  "This is a most delightful apartment," he persisted.
                  "Yes, it is very pleasant."
                  His wife was surprised at this prolongation of unusual compliment. Leaving the young people, she approached another pace towards Mrs. Sandys, and was directly in front of the mantel; then he turned towards her, his cold blue eyes emitting a gleam like that which starts from a polished steel blade when poised for a blow—
                  "Claudia," he said carelessly, "have you noticed that remarkably fine picture?"
                  At this his wife looked up at the youthful portrait, carelessly at first, then with wild staring bewilderment, her distracted gaze meeting the melancholy earnestness of those beautiful eyes. For one instant she stood as if spell-bound, then she gasped out,
                  "Oh, my God, George!"
                  The last word was almost inaudible, as she sank pale and trembling into a seat.
                  The stab was a cruel one, but she was not the only sufferer. At this cold allusion to the sacred image of the lost, Mrs. Sandys started as if she had been struck, and turned suddenly upon the imperturbable man, who stood indifferently scanning the picture as if wholly unconscious of the effect of his words—
                  "It was my husband!" she exclaimed, and then the tears which his rudeness had called up gathered and dimmed her sight.
                  Mr. Rockford had been unmoved by his wife's agitation, but he responded instantly to this appeal,
                  "Pardon me, my dear madam, I am profoundly grieved at my inadvertence."
                  "Forgive my weakness," said Mrs. Sandys in a choking voice, and striving to restrain her emotion.
                  "Claudia, if you are ready, perhaps we had better not trespass longer on Mrs. Sandys' time," he said to his wife, darting upon her convulsed features one cutting glance, and then turning again to his hostess he added with courteous earnestness—"I know not how sufficiently to express my regret for for the pain I have caused you."
                  Mrs. Rockford responded to her husband's order; in the course of these few sentences with her friend she had been able to recover from the first shock, and though still white to the very lips she rose calm and controlled. For an instant she did not trust herself to speak; but when her husband paused a reply, she said steadily though with a certain hoarseness of tone—
                  "You are most fortunate, my dear Amelia, in possessing so admirable a likeness."
                  "Yes, I prize it even more than a miniature I have of later date," answered Mrs. Sandys with recovered composure.
                  "May I ask when it was taken?" Mr. Rockford said, deferentially.
                  "Twenty years ago, before we were married."
                  "Indeed, so long!" Another curious look at his wife, and Mr. Rockford turned away—"Come, Edith, if you have finished your last words, it is growing late."
                  The young people who had been chatting just within the parlor door and had heard nothing of the past conversation, were roused by this summons and began their farewells. There were two or three enthusiastic kisses between the girls, and a fervent pressure of the hand between Mabel and Vinton, while the elders performed a more stately leave-taking.
                  "Good-by until Christmas," cried Edith lingering at the door an instant after the others, and then the friends had separated with the warmest and best wishes for their future meeting.
                  The next morning a grand cavalcade of trunks and boxes proceeded from Rockford lawn to the station. Mr. Florance Fay was there to receive them, and also to hand Edith out of the family carriage that closed the procession. He wore on this interesting occasion a turned-down collar, which he considered typical of his despair at the approaching departure, and occupied himself until the cars came, in heaving little sighs and exclaiming at intervals,
                  "Really, Mith Edith, I thall mith you dreadfully!"
                  Edith was so entertained at this amusing exhibition of woe, that she could not help laughing even at the afflicting ing moment of parting, nor was her cruel heart in the least touched by the tender and graceful flutter of the white handkerchief that he waved as a last signal of distress, when the train bore her away.
                  From that crowded car, as the engine sped on, one person looked longingly back to the village they had left, and that was Mrs. Rockford, who with lingering eagerness turned the last glance of her sad eyes towards the pale monument, on the deserted hill, over the melancholy sea.

                        LUCRETIUS.
                     
                  
                  THE first month after the Rockford's return to the city passed pleasantly, and in a measure uneventfully away. Vinton was fully established in the office of the Hon. James Seaton, and was pursuing his legal studies with diligence and interest. He worked steadily on with little to vary the routine of his days except the arrival of a letter from Mabel to his cousin, which on two occasions he had been so fortunate as to find in their box at the post-office, and the concocting a note that might be slipped into Edith's answer, without offence to the recipient. He had never cared much for society, he took less interest in it than ever now, and preferred spending his evenings in reading to wasting his time at any of the hundred places of amusement that are so alluring in the city. Yet he was very happy, often afterwards he looked back to this as perhaps the most entirely happy period of his whole existence, he had no present cares, he had the consciousness of doing his duty honorably and honestly in the exertions of every day, and above all and over all, the light of a hope that might make the future bright threw its rosy glow, as the enchanted lustre of Hassam Alhabbel's diamond illumined his narrow cottage with wondrous effulgence.
                  —Ah, youth, youth! golden time of hope and love! how sad to think how swiftly its halcyon moments dance away, how soon the relentless storms of sorrow sweep over it and wash out its beauty forever!—
                  Edith, too, had found but little variety in the weeks. At first, there was the usual round of visits to make and receive, and then the winter purchases to be effected, and the winter wardrobe to be prepared. This kept her pretty busy in an unmeaning, tiresome sort of way, so she was glad when it was over and she could return to her books and her music, her favorite occupations in leisure moments. She had heard from Percival Denbigh three times, and answered his letters, which were long and affectionate by short and rather formal notes, giving him the news of the day and her opinion as to the last opera singers. Although he had done all in his power to keep himself in her remembrance by replying to the discouraging epistles at once with all the eloquence of which he was master, yet as was quite natural, she found herself daily becoming better reconciled to his absence, though still looking forward with a certain half pleasurable excitement to his return. Lionel Rohan she had seen several times; he had dined with them by formal invitation some after their return, and since then had fallen into a way of coming up town with Vinton unexpectedly about once a week, and staying to dinner, which led to his being welcome to a seat in their box at the opera, and a general feeling of entire friendliness towards him. Edith liked him very much indeed, better, she thought, than any one she had ever seen before, and he was so frankly and openly devoted to her that she innocently concluded that there was only a very firm friendship between them, nothing more. His appearance never set her heart beating or frightened her as Denbigh's did, so that, of course, it was quite safe and all right. Ben Fordyce she had not yet seen, she knew that he was in town, Vinton had been at his counting-house, but he had not, it seemed, sufficiently recovered from his recollection of their ride to call upon her; however, she was resolved to draw him out of his seclusion, and already had a plan to that effect which she was determined should succeed. Florance Fay had not, so far, appeared in the city, so that Lionel had at present no rival in Edith's regard to contend with, except the half-dozen young men who were always her special admirers, and whom Vinton styled her court. At the head of this band was a certain Mr. McDnff, a wealthy, precise bachelor of forty, whose presence, it must be confessed, never caused Lionel any very severe pangs.
                  One morning Edith sat reading in her little boudoir, which is so pretty a room that before I relate what pleasant arrival there disturbed her, I hope I shall be pardoned a few words in its description. It adjoined the bed-chamber and was therefore sacred from the intrusion of any but the favored few whom she chose to have admitted within its exclusive precincts. It was a small room with only one large window looking on the avenue, this was draped with a heavy blue damask curtain over a lighter muslin one, under which was a buff shade so that even on the dullest day by drawing it down the light was like that of soft sunshine. A canary in a gilded cage hung before the window, and requited the loving care of his mistress with perpetual songs in her honor. The furniture consisted of a suggestively comfortable couch and the most charming of all seats a squab chair, both also covered with blue. A small book case containing Edith's favorite authors, some light chairs suitable for Vinton and the other rarely admitted male visitors, and a table containing in "admired disorder," a writing-desk, work-basket, the latest periodicals and a green-house bouquet. The carpet was a mixture of blue and fawn, and the wall-paper had a white ground with wreaths of gold and blue convolvolus. There were also several pictures. One was a sweet summer scene, where you saw a group of young girls sitting beneath the trees beside a stream that lapsed away under overarching branches through a long vista of shimmering light and shade. Another represented a boat floating away on a tranquil sea into endless depths of radiance,—at its prow a youth and a maiden side by side, with clasped hands, their eyes turned upon each other in the calm happiness of entire content. Then for portraits there were the sad sweet face of the beautiful Mary of Scotland, that martyr queen whose memory is so dear to the hearts of loving girlhood. And Sir Philip Sydney the pure and chivalrous knight.
                  —I have been thus minute in my description of this room, because I think that the appointments of an apartment where the owner has been free to carry out his taste, and which is designed for his own habitation is a very good indioation of character. Do we not judge from the gaudy elaboration of the adornments of the Alhambra what must have been the effeminate luxury of those for whose pleasure they were designed, while in the severe arches of the Gothic castles we read the simple habits and devout aspirations of that true-hearted race. On a lesser scale in Edith's boudoir a glance would have detected the delicacy and refinement that had directed its furnishings.—
                  The arrival which interrupted Edith's reading that morning was that of Fanny Grantham, a lively and dashing brunette who had been since school-days her most intimate friend. Her tap it was that aroused Edith from her book and made her spring to the door, crying as she opened it:
                  "Oh Fanny, I am glad to see you, I knew it was your knock."
                  "Yes," replied Fanny kissing her warmly, "I determined I would come this morning in spite of everything, so I started from lunch and walked fast and me voici."
                  "Capital!" said Edith, "take off your things," and having assisted Fanny to divest herself of hat and furs, she carried them off to her room.
                  "What a time it is, ma chere, since we have had a real nice talk!" exclaimed Fanny, as she threw herself down on the couch while Edith took the arm-chair beside her.
                  "Yes, ever so long," replied Edith, "but it's all your fault for letting that horrid Sedley dangle after you so forever."
                  "Que voulez-vous?" retorted Fanny with a shrug. "One must have some sort of a male creature to carry one's muff, and send one flowers, and really he's not so bad."
                  "Bad! I think him dreadful. What eyes the man has. Why! he's a fright!"
                  "He is not handsome, certainly."
                  "And then, what waistcoats and cravats he wears! If you will have him, Fanny, you certainly might tone down his dress a little. Tell him you don't think orange and red are becoming to his style of beauty."
                  Fanny laughed. "I acknowledge he is a little 'flamboyant' in his taste, but then he is decidedly smart, and he entertains me."
                  "La reine s'amuse. Fanny, you are an outrageous flirt. I suppose it's no matter how badly he feels when you get tired of him, as you will, of course, or, I beg your pardon, perhaps you mean to take him."
                  "Edith! What an idea! Take him? Why he is as old as Time in the Primer, and besides, he don't know who his grandfather was."
                  "Don't he?" asked Edith simply. "Has he forgotten?"
                  "Vive l'innocence!" cried Fanny, laughing heartily, "he wants to forget if he has not."
                  "How stupid I am!" exclaimed Edith, joining in her friend's merriment. "I understand—vulgar, of course."
                  "Yes," returned Fanny, when she had exhausted her laughter. "His origin, like that of Romulus, is lost in obscurity; but as in the case of the hero of Rome, we have a hint of a probable wolf and a possible God, so with Mr. Sedly we have a suspicion of a probable ox and a certain Bowery boy."
                  "Not a butcher!" said Edith, with aristocratic horror.
                  "No my dear, certainly not a butcher; how can you use such coarse words? A meat-merchant."
                  Edith laughed, but then said earnestly, "Then of course you can't marry him, but that only makes it the worse for you to flirt with him."
                  "This from you!" cried Fanny, with mock reproach.—"Really, my love, you are as unlike the Prince of Darkness as possible, but pray did you ever hear how he once preached a sermon against sin?"
                  "Why, Fanny, I never flirt!"
                  "Oh, no! not at all! What did you do to Graham, and Lawrence, and Dana? and a dozen others I can't remember, say? Where now are those victims of tes beaux yeux?"
                  "Now that is too bad, Fanny, you know I could not help it, besides they didn't care."
                  "Oh, no! of course not; we know what eels finally became accustomed to. It can't be a pleasant process, however. Apropos, (shall I add des moutons?) what has become of Florance Fay? was he as devoted as ever after your return?"
                  "I think not," replied Edith; "at least I did not see so much of him. By the way, he is to be here soon."
                  "Indeed! I shall welcome the charming creature, and let me see," she added musingly, "who else was there? Oh, Percival Denbigh, you have never told me anything about him. Did he go to Herford?"
                  
                  "Yes," said Edith with a faint blush. Fanny did not notice it as she went on—
                  "And where is he now? Did you ship him too? or what has become of him?"
                  "He has gone south."
                  "Has he? well I'm glad of it, I never liked him, he was not half nice enough for you. I hope he never will come back."
                  The conversation was becoming embarassing to Edith, and she was glad that it was interrepted at this point by a knock at the door.
                  "May I come in, coz?"
                  "It's Vinton!" cried Edith, looking pleased, "may he, Fanny?"
                  "Yes, with all my heart," replied Fanny, starting up into a more dignified attitude, "you know he's one of my pets."
                  "Come in, then," said Edith, admitting Vinton, who bowed low as he spoke—
                  "Pardon the intrusion of your humble servant, but the sound of your laughter was too alluring, I could not pass the shrine without paying my homage to the divinities it contained."
                  "We forgive you," smiled Fanny, who was on those terms with her friend's cousin that permitted her to call him Vinton, while he always adhered to Miss Fanny. They mutually felt a sincere regard that was so calm as to preclude the possibility of love.
                  "Only," added Edith, gayly, "as a punishment for your presumption, you must listen patiently to all our gossip, and not make any invidious and mannish remarks."
                  "I submit," replied Vinton, seating himself, "when one is admitted to so sacred a spot one can but hear in admiring silence all the mysteries which may be unfolded."
                  "Now then, Fanny," said Edith, turning to her friend, "you know our first reception is next Tuesday."
                  "Is it?"
                  "Yes, and you must be sure to come."
                  "Of course I will."
                  "And dance with me," put in Vinton.
                  "Don't look at him, Fanny!" cried Edith, with mock indignation.
                  "I won't," answered Fanny, regarding the wall with eyes sparkling with fun. "It wouldn't be any use if I did. However, perhaps I will dance with him."
                  "Imagine the thanks which I dare not utter," said Vinton, with assumed humility.
                  "As he is silent," continued Fanny, glancing merrily towards Vinton, "what are you going to wear?"
                  "Blue, I think."
                  "Blue, of course! I needn't have asked, you always wear blue."
                  "But what can I do? my dear. Blue is the only color that looks well with red hair."
                  "Red hair, profane one! how can you call those ambrosial locks red?"
                  "What are they, then?"
                  "Auburn," suggested Vinton.
                  "Golden amber," said Fanny.
                  "Well, disguise the fact by whatever magniloquent phrases you please," assented Edith. "But blue is my color, and I have a new blue silk with flounces that I think very pretty, and by the by, isn't it too bad? I have left my point appliquée cape which I meant to wear with it, at Herford."
                  "Why, how came that? you are always so careful."
                  "It was put away in a box by itself on the top shelf of my closet, and I very stupidly forgot it."
                  "How provoking? Can't you send for it?"
                  "No, there's no one there who could find it for me."
                  "May I speak?" asked Vinton.
                  "May he, Fanny?"
                  "Say on!" said Fanny, tragically.
                  "I'll get it for you, coz."
                  "You, Vinton!"
                  "Yes, let me go to Herford. I think I could find it."
                  "How good of you!" cried Edith, "but really, it's not worth while."
                  "Yes, it is, if you want it, coz; besides, I should quite like to go to Herford."
                  "Oh, je comprends!" said Edith, with a look of sudden intelligence. "You are the best of cousins, and I'll give you a kiss for the thought."
                  She leaned over and pressed her rosy lips lightly to his cheek.
                  "That's reward enough," said Vinton, looking at her af fectionately. Then turning to Fanny, he added, gayly, "Can't I find you a cape, too?"
                  "Méchant, no!" retorted Fanny.
                  "But say, Fanny," suggested Edith, "you have not told me what you will wear."
                  "I don't know, really," mused Fanny—"I had not thought. Let me see—I've a new black silk, with plaid flounces, that might be effective."
                  "Capital!" cried Edith. "Wear that, and some gay ribbons in your hair; I know you will look well; and by the way, I want you to be particularly charming, for I've such a nice man to present to you."
                  "Vanitas vanitatum," groaned Vinton. "How many more victims?"
                  "No, this is to be no victim," asserted Edith quickly. "If Fanny don't like him, she shan't see him any more; he's too good to be victimized."
                  "Che sara sara," sighed Fanny, rising; "I must go."
                  "Ah, not yet!"
                  "Yes, I know, by Vinton's arrival, that it is nearly dinner time. So I must go for my hat."
                  The two friends dismissed Vinton, and retired to Edith's room, whence, Fanny having donned hat and furs, they re-appeared after a ten minutes' chat.
                  "By the way," said Fanny, as they went down stairs, "my cousin, Adrienne Clifford, is expected to-morrow. You must come to see her."
                  "Certainly," replied Edith. "Is she nice."
                  "You must judge for yourself," answered Fanny, with an almost imperceptible shrug, "she was handsome once, but ill health has made sad havoc with her face and figure, and she is no longer young. She lives in New Orleans, you know, but she fancies a northern winter will benefit her. So she is to spend a month or two with us."
                  "I will call some time before the reception, of course."
                  In the hall stood Vinton, hat in hand.
                  "May I guard you through the perils of Fifth Avenue, Miss Fanny?"
                  "Thank you, Vinton, you may, if you like. Good-bye, Edith."
                  "Good-bye."
                  And Vinton and Fanny went off laughingly, while Edith ran back to her boudoir.

                  VINTON was well pleased to have a good excuse for going to Herford. His heart had been there this month past, but he scarcely liked to return to it without a pretext that might silence all objections. At first Edith had felt as if it were very selfish to permit him to take the trip solely for her benefit, but catching suddenly the idea of the real object of the journey, she ceased to protest against it, and seconded him ably in combating Mr. Rockford's scruples about permitting an unnecessary break in his studies.
                  "I shall work the harder for a short holiday," urged Vinton, and finally Mr. Rockford consented; his mother, of course, made no opposition, she rarely objected to anything her darling boy wished. So the day after the conversation between the two young ladies, although it was snowing fast, and he was assailed with various gloomy predictions regarding the probable obstruction of the track, Vinton took that afternoon train for Herford.
                  The storm did indeed prove a severe one. The flakes fell thick and fast over the quiet country, and the engine with difficulty made its way through the rapidly increasing drifts. However, the cars were but half an hour behind time at Herford, and it was yet daylight when Vinton left them at the deserted station. There was no one there to drive him to his destination, so he started, bag in hand, to make his way as he might to the Rectory, where he proposed staying
                  The village had been choked up and hushed to sleep by the snow and the wind hours ago; no creature seemed to think of venturing out of doors. The school children had been brought home in a half frozen state in the morning, and had been kept by the fireside ever since. The soft flakes soon obliterated the traces of their footsteps, and went on piling up in white masses that lay like a neatly spread table cloth from side to side of the wide street. The cottage roofs were heaped up with snow that bulged down over the eaves in long ghostly festoons. The trees stood up barren and gaunt through the light wreaths and tufts with which they were decorated, like awkward groomsmen in bridal favors. The fences were turned into white walls, the gate posts resembled huge pillows set on end, the yards were as trackless as if it were a city of the dead. Everywhere, everything was rounded off into graceful curves, no straight lines or sharp corners were visible, the beautiful mantle of snow had fallen over the bare earth concealing its defects as lovingly as the robe of Andromache covered the war-worn frame of her dead hero.
                  Paul Haughton sat in his study, his books lay neglected on the table by his side, the evening light had warned him to close them while it yet seemed too early for candles. He dropped his head wearily back in his chair, gazing idly at the flickering flames of the wood fire. The icy flakes dashed with a sharp rattle on the window, and the wind howled mournfully down the wide chimney. He drew a long sigh which seemed laden with the word "Mabel," and was rapidly falling off into one of the long reveries in which he had of late found himself too prone to indulge, when he was roused by a knocking at the front door. "It must be urgent business that brings any one out on such a day," he thought, starting up, and ever prompt to attend to the comfort of others, even in minor matters, he went out himself to open the door, that his visitor might not be kept waiting in the cold.
                  There was a snow man awaiting him on the steps. Snow on his hat in a conical peak, snow in epaulets on his shoulders, snow filling his pockets and fringing his coat, and snow even clustering on his dark moustache. Yet it needed only one glance from his bright black eyes to make Mr. Haughton exclaim:
                  "Why Vinton, my dear fellow! how are you? Come in! How good of you to come and see me on this dismal day! This way, come in here by the fire."
                  Thus pouring out his hearty welcome he would have hurried his friend into the library, without any regard to the detriment his carpet might sustain from the introduction of such a mass of moisture, had not Vinton remonstrated and insisted upon divesting himself of the wetter portions of his garments in the hall.
                  "How capitally you are looking!" continued the clergyman when they were at last seated by the fire, as he regarded with admiration his friend's glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes. "City life agrees with you."
                  "Yes," replied Vinton, "at least I am very well. How are all here?"
                  "Nicely so far, it has been a healthy Autumn; fewer colds than usual. Though some of the old people begin to feel the severe weather," answered Mr. Haughton innocently.
                  "Yes," said Vinton, whose benevolence had not been so general as to include the entire parish. "But how are your aunt and cousin?"
                  Paul darted a sudden glance at him. "Thank you, Mrs. Sandys is better, I hope her spirits are recovering their tone; she has a friend Miss Mary Payne, an excellent woman staying with her, and her cheerful society, I think, has benefitted her. Mabel is quite well."
                  "I should like to go and see them bye-and-bye," suggested Vinton.
                  "If you like, of course, but you are rash to think of braving the storm again to-night."
                  "Oh! I don't mind that, besides I've a note from Edith to Miss Mabel."
                  "Well, after tea, then," acquiesced Mr. Haughton, and the talk fell off to other topics.
                  At six o'clock the respectable old woman who took charge of the clergyman's household, summoned the two young men to tea. They found a tolerably substantial repast awaiting them in the small but comfortable dining-room. As they took their seats, and Paul placed himself behind the tea-urn, Vinton said playfully—
                  "Haughton, you ought to have a lady there, the parsonage needs a mistress."
                  "Yes," replied Paul a faint blush passing across his high, white forehead. "I know it, I wish I had a wife."
                  
                  "I should fancy it would not be very difficult for you to find one," laughed Vinton.
                  Paul smiled too. "Not the right one, perhaps," said he with something that sounded like a sigh.
                  Vinton checked the jesting reply that was on his lips, seeing that his friend took it so seriously, and wondered silently if he too had an unavowed attachment.
                  "You smoke, don't you, Vinton?" asked Paul as they returned to the library after tea.
                  "Yes moderately, don't you?"
                  "Rarely," replied Mr. Haughton. "Smoking is a treat I do not often allow myself, and the least over indulgence completely upsets me, although I enjoy it exceedingly."
                  "Will you try a cigar now," asked Vinton, presenting his case.
                  "Thank you, I believe I will, I shall not attempt a sermon, so it's of no consequence to-night if my head is not as clear as usual."
                  The two young men sat smoking and chatting for sometime. It was very pleasant and cosey there by the fire with the storm howling so wildly outside, but at last Vinton began to be uneasy and finally looked at his watch.
                  "It's eight o'clock" he said flinging away the stump of his cigar, "I think I will start for your aunt's now."
                  "Had you not better put it off till morning?" Paul walked to the window as he spoke. "It's an awful night, I don't like the idea of your going out"
                  "No indeed, my good fellow, you are very careful of me, but I don't mind the weather in the least."
                  "Well, if you insist we will get ready."
                  "But you need not go," exclaimed Vinton, "Pray don't come out on my account."
                  "I had rather go with you," replied Paul, smiling, "I don't like to lose any part of your short visit."
                  Vinton attempted again to dissuade him, but the clergyman was firm, and he finally ceased to object. After guarding themselves as well as possible against the weather, they started, Paul bearing a lantern and marching ahead to show the way. Fortunately it was not very far, and they reached the Sandys house without any worse mishap than a few tumbles in the snow.
                  "Come in," said Paul opening the door, "we can brush off the snow in the hall before they know that we are here. We shall find the ladies in the library, I am sure."
                  By means of considerable shaking and stamping and the free use of a broom which Paul, who was acquainted with the hiding places of the house, produced from a side closet, they made themselves presentable. Vinton's heart beat and his face flushed with pleasurable excitement as he followed the clergyman to the room which contained his lovely friend.
                  The three ladies who were sitting with their work around the library table looked up as Mr. Haughton opened the door, and Mabel who was nearest began with a quiet smile:
                  "Ah! cousin Paul, we thought it was you——"
                  She stopped suddenly; her glance passing her cousin had encountered the bright dark eyes that were looking towards her so wistfully, and she started up pale with delightful surprise. In an instant her hand was in Vinton's, and they were greeting each other warmly, with momentary forgetfulness of every one else in the room. They did not see with what a despairing gaze the young clergyman regarded them, nor how the color faded slowly out of his face, not only out of his cheeks but out of his very lips and eyes, so that he looked as if stricken with a sudden blight. It all passed very quickly he had recovered himself, by the time that Vinton had dropped Mabel's hand and turned with a fine blush to her mother.
                  "Excuse me, Mrs. Sandys, but I only saw Miss Mabel. I hope you are quite well."
                  "Quite well, thank you, and very glad to see you in Herford again." Then, turning to the plain, amiable looking lady beside her she said, "Mary, this is Mr. Vinton Rockford, Miss Payne."
                  The demure brown eyes gave him a frank earnest glance, as if Miss Payne had some curiosity to see him; apparently the scrutiny was satisfactory for she had held out her hand in a sincere fashion, and they all dropped into their places, Vinton was between Mabel and her mother, Paul quietly seating himself near Miss Mary.
                  "What brought you up in the storm?" asked Mrs. Sandys.
                  "I came," answered Vinton, "first, because I could not keep away any longer," and he glanced with undisguised affection at Mabel,—"and then I had an excellent excuse. Edith forgot some sort of a lace cape that she wants to wear to a party, and I promised to hunt it up."
                  "And did she consider you competent to so important a commission?" enquired Mabel, smilingly.
                  "She had no one else to send, and she was forced to trust me, but I confess I shall feel somewhat puzzled to-morrow when I undertake to discover it. Let me see, it is in the second box on the right hand side of the third shelf of the large closet, or there! I believe I have forgotten already! Perhaps it was the third box on the second shelf."
                  "Edith would much better have written to me," said Mabel, laughing at his look of bewilderment. "I would have got it for her easily."
                  "You are very kind, and I have no doubt you would find it much sooner than I, but she did not want to trouble you about it."
                  "It would have been no trouble, and if I can help you now, I shall be very glad."
                  "Don't make rash promises, Miss Mabel, I may take you at your word. By the way, here is a note from Edith, which may contain some hints."
                  He gave her the letter, and while she read it turned to Mrs. Sandys—
                  "Always knitting something new," he said looking at the brilliant worsteds which filled the basket beside her. "What is it now?"
                  "This is an Afghan," replied Mrs. Sandys—"a work which takes considerable time and patience, but which I think will be very pretty when it is done."
                  "I've no doubt it will, if you make it."
                  "Ah!" cried Mabel, looking up from the note. "See here, Edith tells me all about the cape. I know where to look for it better than you. Shall I read what she says?"
                  "Yes, if you please."
                  "She is very disrespectful."
                  "Oh, I'm used to that from her."
                  "Men are so stupid," read Mabel, "I am sure he will forget the directions. So you must remind him—it is in the box with a red cover, on the left hand side of the top shelf of the large closet."
                  "Oh dear! I never can remember all that."
                  "Could not you get it then, my dear?" suggested Mrs. Sandys.
                  "Oh, if you only would, Miss Mabel!" exclaimed Vinton, delightedly; "but I am afraid the house would be so cold and damp."
                  "I shall not mind that for the few moments I shall be there, if it would really help you to have me go."
                  So after some further consultation it was finally settled, that Vinton should come for Mabel in the morning, and they should go together to search for the cape. With that to look forward to, he felt that he could afford to shorten his visit, and at the end of half an hour he rose to go. Paul, who had been carrying on rather a languid conversation with Miss Payne, obeyed the summons with alacrity. Despite his best efforts the talk would flag, and he seemed to hear with unnatural distinctness every word that passed between Vinton and Mabel. The kind-hearted lady beside him, who had a quiet way of seeing a great deal with her small brown eyes, noticed his abstraction, and with a sigh of sympathy guessed at the cause. Enlightened by that despairing gaze which she alone had noticed, she too had been watching the two young people with much interest, and she was still studying Vinton's face when he rose to go.
                  It chanced that at that moment he stood a few paces before the fire directly under the portrait that had already caused such agitation to his mother. Miss Mary's look, which had been at first merely curious, suddenly deepened in intensity, as her glance passed from the picture to the living face beneath it. She was so entirely absorbed in a wondering scrutiny and comparison of the two unlike yet strangely harmonious sets of features, that she started as if roused from a dream when Mr. Haughton bade her good night, and Vinton, bowing for the last time, followed him out of the room.
                  "What's the matter, Cousin Mary?" asked Mabel, laughing; "you look as if you had seen a ghost."
                  "Do I?" said Miss Payne, passing her hand across her brow, as if struggling with some far-off remembrance. "Amelia, is that young Mr. Rockford any relation of George's?"
                  "Vinton? No, indeed. Why do you ask?"
                  
                  "Because it struck me that he bears a wonderful likeness to that picture; but perhaps it was only fancy."
                  Meantime, the two young men were ploughing their way back to the Rectory, noticing as they went that there was already a change for the better in the weather. The snow had ceased falling, and although it was still impenetrably dark, Mr. Haughton, with the keen sense of a sea-side resident, observed that the wind had shifted, and he thought it would clear before morning. When they were once more seated by the fire in the study, Vinton noticed for the first time the change which had passed over his friend's face.
                  "Does anything trouble you, Haughton?" he asked anxiously. "You look pale."
                  "Do I?" said Paul, with a sad smile, "I don't feel quite well."
                  "I am afraid it was that cigar. How foolish I was to make you smoke."
                  "I don't think it was that, my dear Vinton; but don't concern yourself, it is nothing serious."
                  —Nothing serious? Ah me! with what hollow words do we disguise our deepest feelings! There was no intentional falsity in that phrase, yet of all the disappointments of this sorrowful world there are few more serious than the utter destruction of what has been for months the cherished dream of the heart—And this was what Paul had just suffered. He knew that his affection for Mabel which began long ago almost in his childhood, had of late increased and strengthened, until the longing to claim her for his own had become the craving hunger of his soul. Yet with that timidity which love gives, he had hesitated to startle her by an imprudent avowal, which, after all, might not be received as he sometimes dared to hope. He knew that she was attached to him, only in a quiet, cousinoly fashion, perhaps, yet surely in time this feeling would deepen, such devotion as his must certainly at last meet with a return; it could not always be unrequited; the very ardor of his passion must awake a response. Ah! how many hearts have trusted to this fallacious hope! It seems so impossible to believe that one can love so much and yet in vain. So he went on dreaming and lavishing all the affection of his tender nature on Mabel, cheerful, if not confident, until this evening, when he had seen with sudden anguish how she had looked at Vinton as she had never looked at him; how entirely and joyously content she was in his presence, while he was forgotten. In an instant he comprehended all. No fitter match could have been selected for his cousin than his highminded, generous friend. What right had he, then, to murmur? She would have a richer, perhaps a happier home, than any he could offer her; and after all, perhaps, this discipline was what he needed; at least it came from the Father's hand, and he must try to resign his earthly desires, and be more than ever absorbed in his higher duties. Such a struggle as this it was through which the young clergyman passed during the short visit at the Sandys' house. No wonder his face was grey and worn, and there was the sad, stricken look in his blue eyes that had startled his friend.
                  Innocently satisfied with attributing the change to the unwonted cigar, Vinton would not smoke again, lest he should increase Paul's indisposition. So the two young men sat in silence for a few minutes, until, following out a train of thought which the homeward walk had suggested, Vinton looked up and said—
                  "I think I was scarcely ever out in such an impenetrably dark night."
                  "The clouds were very heavy," replied Mr. Haughton, rousing himself. "But you are accustomed to the lighted city streets, so that it seemed the darker here by contrast."
                  "It may have been partly that, but it certainly seemed uncommonly gloomy. Do you know I was thinking, as we walked along, how impossible it was to realize that behind that black vault the eternal stars were shining as brightly as on a summer night."
                  "Yes," said Paul, with more animation, "it is so difficult to believe in the unchangeableness of the divine laws. Just so, if the clouds of sorrow overshadow us, we are prone to forget that beyond them and above them the light of heaven and truth shines ever the same. We are so apt to think that that the universe is a waste, because our path is dark."
                  "I do not know," answered Vinton, thoughtfully. "I have never had any very deep trials, but I can imagine there are some which must require great faith to be triumphantly resisted."
                  "Yes, and there is no doubt a vast difference in the various afflictions which we may suffer. The death of friends, I think, generally rather strengthens the tie with the unseen world, because the only solace the mourner can have is looking to a happy re-union hereafter."
                  "It seems to me," continued Vinton, "that dreadful as the loss of those we love must be, it could be endured with more resignation than some other griefs. I am sure I could bear anything better than undeserved disgrace."
                  "I don't quite understand you. What sort of disgrace?"
                  "To have an indelible stigma affixed to one's name by the crime of another. For instance, a stain on the birth.—Perhaps if one began life with such a consciousness one could become accustomed to it, but I think to come suddenly to such a knowledge would tempt one into frantic rebellion against everything human or divine."
                  "It would be very hard to resist, no doubt," assented Mr. Haughton. "Still, in such a case no blame would attach to one individually. Therefore I think it is even worse to suffer under the invidious detraction of slanderous tongues, to be conscious of your own innocence, yet be unable to prove it even to those whose good opinion you are most desirous to preserve."
                  "But," asked Vinton, with the confidence of the young in the ultimate justification of the right, "do you not think that in every instance of really unmerited censure, time will dissipate the falsehood?"
                  "Sometimes, but unfortunately not always. How often do we see a man struggling through life against injurious insinuations, and dying at last, leaving to be sure, many friends ready to defend his conduct, but alas! many enemies also ready to blacken his memory."
                  "I admit such things have been, yet perhaps, if the whole truth were known we should always find that there were great errors of judgment, if not actual wrong."
                  "Perhaps so, but are errors of judgment, or even real imprudences to be punished as sins?" asked the clergyman, with some excitement. "Ah, my dear Vinton! when you have lived as long as I have, and seen as much of human suffering as it has fallen to my lot to observe, you will realize how much charity we ought to have for others—how crushing a blight a mere thoughtless sneer may cast on another's life."
                  "I have never thought of it in that light before," said Vinton, whose straight-forward character had little patience with weakness, none with crime. "I have often felt how it must blast a man's happiness to have the fault of another cast obloquy on his name, but perhaps I have been too prone to believe that where there was an imputation of evil there was generally foundation in fact."
                  "History should teach us more lenience," urged Mr. Haughton, earnestly. "We there so often find how envy and malevolence have thrown detraction on the purest characters. Let me recall to your memory a living instance.—You surely remember Lord Cochran's story, and how his whole life has been clouded by a false accusation to which accident and the vigilance of enemies gave the semblance of truth."
                  "Yes," responded Vinton, with enthusiasm, "and for years that brave heart and proud spirit was tortured by the reiteration of the vilest slanders. Ah! Haughton, I understand you better now, and I can readily feel how difficult it would be for a man so situated to remember that God is both merciful and just."
                  "There must be an awful temptation to despair, and I do not wonder that so many have yielded to it, and like the noble Clive been stung to the madness of self-destruction. What a sad world this would be," added Paul with a long-drawn sigh, "if there were no brighter and better one beyond."
                  "It would, indeed," said Vinton; "yet I have often pleased myself with fancying that even here there was a sort of compensation, not always within the few years of one life, but in the after fame. Let me explain:—Perhaps no man ever died feeling himself more utterly ruined and wretched than Sir Walter Raleigh; yet when all that generation had passed away, the clouds that hung round his name were gone too, and there remained only the remembrance of his courage and chivalry. When Magellan was foully murdered on that savage island, probably his dying moments were embittered with the thought that he had failed—that after all his years of wandering they were to terminate with the goal unwon, in that unknown grave. Yet what immortal honor awaited him. Surely his utmost ambition could have desired nothing more than the glory which will forever surround the memory of the great navigator."
                  
                  "It is sometimes so," replied Mr. Haughton, checking Vinton's enthusiasm with his sad smile. "But think my friend, of all those humble martyrs who suffer as keenly in obscurity, and go down into unmarked tombs with no future celebrity to atone for the disasters of their lives. After all there is no certain reliance but in the blessings of that better land where we may all at last find rest."
                  "You are right," answered Vinton reverently. "God grant us strength to reach it."
                  It was already late, and after a moments' pause, the clergyman took up his prayer-book. He read the evening service, and then the two friends parted for the night.
                  The next morning Vinton's first waking thought was of the proposed expedition with Mabel. He went to the window and looked out. The sun was shining brightly, and the village snow-plough was already making its difficult way down the street. There is nothing more delightful than this beginning the day with an anticipation of pleasure, and Vinton went down to his breakfast with his eyes sparkling with happiness. Paul had no responsive gladness in his eyes, the first night of wrestling with such a sorrow as his, brings little refreshment with it, and he looked even paler than before. Vinton was full of earnest solicitude about his health, but Paul evaded his enquiries, and at last seeing that they seemed to annoy him, he urged him no more. Changing the conversation by asking if he thought he could get a sleigh at Turner's—the village livery-stable.
                  "Yes," said Mr. Haughton, "I dare say; what do you want it for?"
                  "To take your cousin to the house, you know she offered to go with me last night, to find Edith's cape, and of course, I can't let her walk."
                  "I had forgotten," said Paul, faintly. He was resolutely determined he would harbor no such unworthy feeling as jealousy, yet he could not help one sharp pang at the thought of that proposed drive.
                  As soon as breakfast was over, Vinton went off to Turner's, and succeeded in obtaining a neat looking cutter, which was well filled with warm robes. It was drawn by rather a sorry beast, to be sure, but he wore plenty of bells, and Vinton was very happy as he trotted him up to the Sandys house. Mabel was ready to meet him in a moment. How lovely she looked in her grey hood and fur-trimmed cloak.
                  "Ah!" she cried as they came to the door, "You brought a sleigh."
                  "Yes, I couldn't allow you to walk, of course."
                  "That is delightful!" she exclaimed, with honest youthful pleasure, and Vinton helped her up and took his place beside her in a frame of mind a king might have envied. How delicious it was to tuck the robes around her, to see her large soft eyes bright with animation, her cheeks glowing with excitement and the kiss of the pure wintry air. It was a dazzling morning, the sky of that clear pale blue that seems so transparent that you fancy you can almost see the heaven above, great masses of fleecy clouds like snow-drifts, piled on the horizon, and all things so clear and fresh, the icicles flashing like diamonds in the pure sunshine, the evergreens laden with white wreaths, as if they had burst into profuse flowering, and over all the ground, the bright beautiful snow, rounding up in huge masses on each side the glittering path, spreading away in a sparkling carpet over the untrodden fields.
                  It was too lovely a scene to be soon deserted. Vinton easily obtained Mabel's consent to prolonging the drive, and they went dashing away over the recently broken road, the musical bells ringing out a merry accompaniment to their light laughter and gay talk. Since the very beginning of their acquaintance there had been between them a feeling of quiet unconstrained happiness when they were together, so now the conversation flowed on with little of that embarrassment that so often makes up half the charm of a lover's tête-à-tête. At last it was time to think of returning, and with some regret Vinton turned his horse and drove to Rockford lawn. A peremptory summons on the disused bell, brought out the gardener, who took charge of the house in the winter. His wife appearing a moment after, Vinton handed Mabel over to her charge, waiting below while she invaded Edith's room, returning in a few moments in triumph, with a box containing the cape. It was now nearly time for the train which Vinton expected to take back to the city, so when Mabel was once more seated in the sleigh, he drove her home.
                  "How I wish I could stay here," he said, as they stopped before the door.
                  
                  "You would not be contented in this village."
                  "Yes I should, Miss Mabel, if you were here."
                  Mabel blushed a little. "I am sorry you have to go," she said gently, then added, looking frankly at him, "It is but a fortnight before Christmas—I shall see you soon again."
                  "I know it, I shall count the days until you come. Goodbye."
                  They were on the steps. Mabel pulled off the warm mitten which protected her hand and placed it in his.
                  "Good-bye, dear Mabel," he said, looking at her with tender affection. The clear eyes met his without confusion, and she made no resistance when he pressed the rosy fingers to his lips.
                  Mr. Haughton saw the flush of hope on Vinton's face when he returned. He had been sitting alone in his study while they two had been so happy. He had been praying—struggling with the weak human feeling that threatened to master him completely. He rose now with his agitation subdued, and when he met his friend he tried to wish with his whole heart that he might be successful in his wooing.
                  "I have no time to spare," said Vinton; "I meant to have been back sooner, but it was so pleasant."
                  "Never mind, my dear fellow," interrupted Paul, with a sickly smile, "you were enjoying yourself. I am glad of it." How bravely he strove to make those words sincere.
                  "I can't bear to leave you looking so badly," protested Vinton. "You really must take care of yourself, Haughton, you study too hard."
                  "No, I think not; but come, I will not detain you. Let me drive up to the station with you. I'll take the sleigh to Turner's afterwards."
                  As they drove away Vinton again urged Paul to be careful of his health, and begged him to come to the city for awhile whenever he could.
                  When the train came in sight, while they stood together on the platform, Paul took Vinton's hand for the last time. "I am truly grateful to you for this visit," he said, with great earnestness of manner. "Good-bye, Vinton, and God bless you." His face was calm now, though very pale, and as Vinton met the look of those sad, mild eyes, he felt that from such a friend these ordinary words were indeed a benediction.
               
               
                  CHAPTER III.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Her lovely looks a sprightly mind disclose,
                              Quick as her eyes, and as unfixed as those;
                              Favors to none, to all she smiles extends,
                              Oft she rejects, but never once offends.
                              Bright as the sun her eyes the gazers strike,
                              And like the sun, they shine on all alike."
                           
                        
                        POPE'S "RAPE OF THE LOCK."
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Come, thou goddess fair and free,
                              In Heaven yclep'd Euphrosyne,
                              And by men heart-easing Mirth."
                           
                        
                        "L' ALLEGRO."
                     
                  
                  TUESDAY evening proved to be a fine one. A clear, cold night, with the stars shining as brightly outside as the diamonds within. The large parlors at the Rockford's were brilliantly lighted, and opened for the anticipated guests. As it was their first reception that season, they expected a larger number than usual, and the arrangements for their entertainment were more elaborate than on an ordinary occasion. A small band was in attendance for dancing, and a standing supper was prepared in the dining-room.
                  Mrs. Rockford was regally handsome in a rich purple silk, exquisite lace covering her thick black hair, through which here and there, a thread of silver began to show itself. She leaned languidly in a large arm-chair, watching with a smile of pleased admiration her beautiful niece. Edith was lovely as a dream in the blue silk aforementioned. The cape which Vinton had brought shaded without concealing her beautiful neck, but her arms were entirely bare—round, white, delicious, with slender wrists, and soft, rose-tipped fingers—Her hair twined in golden coils around her graceful head, with no adornment except two ornamental blue pins that served to keep the rich mass in place.
                  "Your dress is very pretty," said Mrs. Rockford—"ah, Sunshine, I wish I had your light-heartedness."
                  "Dear aunt, nothing troubles you, I hope," exclaimed Edith, tenderly.
                  
                  "No, my dear; only, at forty, one cannot be so gay as at twenty," replied Mrs. Rockford with a sigh.
                  "There's the bell," cried Edith, beginning to draw on her gloves. "Why, it's early yet!"
                  The first arrival proved to be Lionel Rohan, who entered a moment after, looking very bright and handsome, and carrying a small but well chosen bouquet.
                  "Will you take it, Miss Edith," he said, presenting it as soon as he had greeted Mrs. Rockford. "I had it made up while I waited, on my way here. So it is very fresh."
                  "I don't know," hesitated Edith, pointing to a large bunch of brilliant flowers that stood on the table beside her. "Mr. McDuff sent me that this morning, and if I carry any, it ought to be his."
                  "Ah! but that is too large; besides, it doesn't suit your dress. But all mine I chose on purpose." It was formed of the white Cape Jessamine, Heliotrope, and Violets, and around the edge there was a blue fringe.
                  "It is lovely," said Edith, touched by the delicacy of the compliment. "But how did you know I was going to wear blue?"
                  "Intuition, perhaps," laughed Lionel. "Come, do take it."
                  The temptation was not to be resisted. Edith took it. "How delicious!" she cried, inhaling the sweet perfume. "Mr. Rohan, you have admirable taste, and I am very much obliged to you for your thoughtfulness."
                  "I am more than rewarded if they give you pleasure." And Lionel looked as happy as possible.
                  "How are you, Rohan?" said Vinton, entering at this moment. "Why, Sunshine, what lovely flowers! I declare they are quite bridal."
                  Edith blushed to her very forehead. Lionel blushed too, but he seemed delighted notwithstanding. "Mr. Rohan brought them," she said, without raising her eyes.
                  "Ah, here's an old friend!" cried Vinton, smiling at their embarrassment, and willing to relieve it. They looked up and beheld Ben Fordyce. He paid his respects to Mrs. Rockford, and then advanced towards Edith with slightly heightened color, but she received him with such hearty cordiality, while Lionel and Vinton were so laughingly enthusiastic thusiastic in their greetings, that he felt at ease in a moment.
                  "I'm so glad you came to-night," said Edith. "I intend to make you very useful. You dance, don't you?"
                  "Only a little, Miss Edith. I sometimes attempt a quadrille or the Lancers, but I'm too heavy a weight for fancy dances."
                  A stream of arrivals interrupted the conversation here. Edith was summoned to her aunt's side, where she was kept in close attendance for the next half hour. Here she was still standing when her friend, Fanny Grantham, arrived. She was as handsome as a Bayadere, in her plaid dress and ribbons. Mr. Sedley, who was a tall and rather fine looking man, despite a certain suspicion of mauvais ton in his appearance, walked at her side, and resting on his arm was her cousin, Adrienne Clifford.
                  This lady deserves a few words of description. She was about thirty-five, though she looked even older. Her face was thin, sallow and haggard, with hard lines about the mouth that suggested a vague distrust. She had still good teeth, brilliant black eyes, and abundant straight black hair. Her figure, which in her youth had been round and pretty, retained a certain grace of outline, though thin to attenuation. She wore a dark silk, stylishly though plainly made, and carried a scarlet shawl on her arm. On the whole, her appearance was that of the faded beauty, and passée belle, and it was evident that ill health and reckless dissipation had been potent influences in aiding the ravages that time had made in her once handsome person. In truth, Adrienne Clifford had enjoyed the unenviable reputation of being the fastest woman in New Orleans, until illness had compelled her to retire somewhat from society.
                  Fanny presented her cousin to Mrs. Rockford, who had not seen her before, and Edith hastened forward to welcome her. She met them both with a thorough assurance of manner that indicated the woman of the world; speaking with an affected drawl, and in a high, almost shrill tone.
                  "I am so glad you felt able to come to-night," said Edith kindly.
                  "Thank you. I'm afraid it was imprudent. You know I'm a dreadful sufferer. But Fanny urged me soearnestly nestly, and I really longed to see one of your beautiful receptions, of which I had heard so much."
                  Here she was addressed by Mrs. Rockford, who introduced Vinton. Adrienne received him with great empressment, and rolled her fine eyes at him in a style that must have been quite effective ten years ago.
                  "Miss Clifford would like a seat perhaps," suggested Mrs. Rockford.
                  Adrienne dropped her hold on Sedley's arm, and of course Vinton offered her his. "Let me find you one on the sofa, near the fire," he said politely.
                  "How kind you are!" she drawled. "Will you take my shawl? Ah, thank you," and she clasped her hands over his arm, leaning heavily upon it as they crossed the room.
                  Seeing her cousin disposed of, Fanny glided to Edith's side for a moment.
                  "So you got your bouquet."
                  "Ah! now I know," cried Edith. "It was you told him I was to wear blue."
                  Fanny laughingly laid her finger on her lips, and then said, "But what will McDuff say?"
                  "I don't know," replied Edith. "It will be all your fault if he quarrels with me."
                  "Parlez du diable," whispered Fanny. "Here he comes—I leave you to your fate."
                  She took Sedley's arm, and turned off just as a tall, gaunt though gentlemanly looking man, of unmistakably Scotch aspect, made his way to her side.
                  "Good evening, Miss Rockford—I need not ask how you are—those roses speak for themselves." He talked very slowly, finishing with an awkward bow—and then turning his head slightly on one side to catch her reply. He was a little deaf of the right ear, though he flattered himself no one knew it. (Edith long ago discovered it, and always amiably manœuvred to stand on his left hand.)
                  "Good evening, Mr. McDuff. I am very much obliged to you for those beautiful flowers."
                  "Not at all, Miss Rockford. I only regret that you would not honor me by carrying them. I had hoped to see them in your fair hand, but I perceive some one else is preferred."
                  He looked pained, and Edith hastened to say,
                  "Honestly, Mr. McDuff, these flowers suited my dress better: but yours are very beautiful, and I have put them in my prettiest vase. Will you come and see?"
                  "No matter, Miss Rockford. I bow to your taste, and accept the secondary place you are pleased to accord me"
                  Edith was distressed at the sorrowful tone with which these last words were pronounced. "Indeed," she said earnestly, "you must not think I neglected them from mere caprice. I assure you I prize them very much. Do come and look at them."
                  There was not a spark of coquetry in her heart at that moment, yet she was doing all she could to render this man as confident as ever of her regard, when perhaps it would have been kinder to open his eyes at once. She slid her hand through his arm, and led him to the table, expatiating on the beauties of his bouquet until his light blue eyes lit up with pleasure.
                  "I shall put it in my boudoir to-morrow," she added, innocently delighted that he was once more smiling.
                  "I shall envy them their position in that shrine. Oh, if I could but follow my flowers!"
                  These words startled Edith to a consciousness of his possible intentions, and at the same moment Fanny Grantham passed, whispering as she gave her arm a little pinch—
                  "Oh you flirt!"
                  Edith was not a flirt, and she felt indignant at the insinnation, but before she could reply, Fanny was out of reach. However, she avoided giving a direct answer to Mr. McDuff's last speech by saying that she thought it time to return to her aunt, thus putting an end to the conversation without rudeness. When she reached Mrs. Rockford, she found Florance Fay talking with her, and being really glad to see him, and wholly forgetful of Fanny's warning, she greeted him with such evident pleasure as threw his silly little heart into a flutter.
                  "When did you arrive in town?"
                  "Only to-day, but I knew you would be at home this evening."
                  "I'm so glad you came! I am just going to get up a dance, and you are the very person to help me."
                  Of course Fay was delighted, and gave her his arm to make the tour of the rooms, feeling quite confident that he was her favorite, and wondering if it was the fancy tucks in his new shirt front that had so taken her eye. They had not gone far when Ben Fordyce made his way through the crowd to Edith's side, looking quite breathless and excited.
                  "Oh, Miss Edith, please tell me who that young lady is, with such bright black eyes, and ribbons in her hair."
                  "That is Miss Fanny Grantham," said Edith, smiling gayly. "You know you missed her at Newport. She is a great friend of mine. Come, and let me present you to her."
                  Ben, who had been greatly struck with the gay brunette, walked beside her, quite forgetful of all former love affairs. Fanny was soon found, and Edith performed the introduction with as little formality as possible, addressing a few words to Mr. Sedley, while Ben ran through the commonplaces of a first interview.
                  "I wonder where Vinton is," said Edith, after a pause.—"I want to get up a dance."
                  "What is it to be, Miss Edith?" asked Ben.
                  "A quadrille."
                  "Miss Grantham, may I have the pleasure?"
                  "I'm engaged to Vinton," hesitated Fanny, "but he is not here."
                  "Oh, never mind him," said Edith. "Besides, I don't want him to dance this time."
                  "Very well, then, Mr. Fordyce," and Fanny was just about to take his arm, when she exclaimed, "Edith, there is Vinton, with Adrienne."
                  "It's no matter, then," said Edith, politely.
                  "Yes it is, too," continued Fanny in a lower tone. "He looks dreadfully bored. I will send Sedley to her, and then he can come away." She turned to the tall man who was watching her only half pleased at the alacrity with which she had accepted Ben's offer. "Won't you go and take care of Adrienne awhile?" she asked, coaxingly, "It will only be till the next dance, you know."
                  I am afraid Fanny was a sad flirt; that last sparkling glance spoke volumes of promise and entreaty—certainly Sedley smiled very tenderly as he walked up to Vinton's rescue. While the moment he was out of sight, she turned with a pretty air of relief to Ben.
                  "What a capital girl Edith is to get me off from my engagement to Vinton."
                  "She's lovely," echoed Ben enthusiastically, "and although I am no dancer, I hope you won't repent the change."
                  "No danger," began Fanny, gayly, "Vinton don't care a straw for me, and—"
                  She stopped short, conscious of the inference which Ben was not slow to draw.
                  "And I do, Miss Fanny?" he asked, laughing, and feeling somehow as if he had known her all his life. "I am glad you think so, for upon my word I do."
                  For once, Fanny was a little embarrassed. She tried to be angry, but she could only say, after a moment, with a smile breaking over her lips,
                  "Well then, it's all the better. Now we must dance."
                  Meantime Edith had completed the tour of the rooms, sent McDuff for the music, introduced Florance Fay to a lively little partner, and finally found herself standing at the head of the room with Lionel, who had followed her like her shadow, and joined her the moment she was at liberty. She glanced over the well-arranged couples with the expression of a general who has satisfactorily marshalled his forces for a battle—and then as they began to dance, she said,
                  "I believe my duty is done for the present."
                  "Then let us find a quiet seat in the library."
                  "Very well." She took his arm, and they made their way to the door.
                  "Anything I can do for you, coz?" asked Vinton, meeting them there.
                  "No, thank you, I am going to rest for a while, but had you not better go back to Miss Clifford now?"
                  "No, indeed, Edith," exclaimed Vinton, with a frown, "I'll do what politeness requires, but I will not go near her alone again."
                  "Why not?" asked Edith, surprised at his vehemence.
                  "Because she is a horrid woman! She has been talking French to me, and—" he paused, then added with a smile, "But I am forgetting myself, however, I don't mind Lionel, only Edith, don't have any more to do with her than courtesy to a guest requires. She is a sort of woman I especially dislike, and I am sorry she is staying with Fanny."
                  "I am sorry, too, if she is not nice; but I piticd her, she looks so ill."
                  
                  Vinton shrugged his shoulders contemptuously. "Perhaps," he said, "but it's very stupid of me to detain you so long, so I'm off."
                  "Stay a moment," cried Lionel. "Vinton, could not you keep McDuff off a while?"
                  "I'll try," laughed Vinton, going away.
                  "You don't care about seeing him, do you, Miss Edith?" asked Lionel, as he led her away to the library.
                  "No, I had much rather talk to you," answered Edith, honestly.
                  "Thank you, Miss Edith, you know I am happier with you than with any one else in the world."
                  This was one of those little speeches which Lionel was in the habit of making to Edith whenever he had an opportunity, and which she fancied she took as a matter of course yet perhaps if she had been deprived of them she would have missed them more than she now suspected.
                  Vinton was as good as his word, he seduced McDuff into the supper room to take a glass of real Scotch whiskey with him, and then made a violent attack upon British management and mismanagement, that led to a discussion which he adroitly prolonged till the dance was over, so that his friend and cousin had a quarter of an hour's uninterrupted chat.
                  "Oh, dear!" exclaimed Lionel as the music ceased, "now there will be quantities of people coming to talk to you."
                  "I'm afraid so," said Edith, rising. "At least, I must not stay here any longer."
                  "But you will dance with me the first time?"
                  "Yes, but it is not worth while for you to wait for that, I may not dance at all until quite late in the evening."
                  "I don't mind, I shall not take any partners, I only care to dance with you."
                  The last words were uttered in a half whisper, just as several gentlemen approached, with one of these Edith returned to the parlor, and was soon absorbed in the numerous duties of hostess and belle.
                  Fanny and Ben Fordyce had been getting on capitally. After the dance Ben asked her to go to the refreshment room.
                  "No, thank you, not now," replied Fanny, "I must go and see about my cousin, Miss Clifford."
                  "Who?" asked Ben, not catching the name and title, in the confusion of voices around him.
                  "Miss Clifford, she is a great invalid, but I persuaded her to come with me to night. I must see how she is getting on."
                  "Let me go, too?"
                  "Very well, if you like I will present you."
                  "Any friend of yours; besides I don't want to leave you."
                  They crossed the room to where Adrienne sat with Mr. Sedley; she looked up as her handsome laughing cousin approached, and there was a glance of malignant envy in the dark eyes that was scarcely concealed by the false smile that displayed her glittering teeth.
                  "Mr. Fordyce, Miss Clifford. I hope you are not tired," she added kindly.
                  "No," replied Adrienne, acknowledging Ben's salutation by a languid bend. "Mr. Sedley has been so entertaining I have not thought of fatigue."
                  Sedley bowed low as he responded; "If you have found me so, attribute it to your own fascinations, which would inspire the dullest." This was said half aside and received with a glance of intelligence. Evidently Mr. Sedley thought he had better have Adrienne Clifford for a friend than an enemy.
                  Ben, who knew that he ought to address some remark to his new acquaintance, now adventured the highly original one that he believed it was a fine night, then catching Fanny's merry look, he perceived that what he had said was excessively flat, and fancied that she would think him a fool. At this moment too, still further to increase his chagrin, the music struck up a redowa, and Sedley exclaimed:
                  "This is my dance, Miss Fanny."
                  "Yes," replied Fanny, accepting his proffered hand with a pleased smile, and in an instant they were whirling down the room together. Ben mechanically took his place by Adrienne, but his eyes were following that graceful figure, whose sparkling eyes and glowing cheeks with that gay dress and the tiny glancing feet that scarcely touched the floor, was fair as Terpsichore herself. Her partner was a good dancer, which was one of his chief attractions in Fanny's eyes, and they looked admirably on the floor together. Ben did not at all like the thorough enjoyment with which she abandoned herself to the tall man's embrace, and while mentally smiling at his folly, he yet could not take off his facinated gaze.
                  "Don't you dance, Mr. Fordyce?" asked Adrienne, when she had watched him long enough to read his thoughts almost as well as if they had been literally written in his eyes.
                  "No," replied Ben, turning towards her with a start, "I wish I did, but I am too heavy."
                  Adrienne glanced admiringly at the well knit frame, and said: "With such a figure as yours, you ought to do anything well."
                  Ben regarded her with amazement, he was unused to such direct flattery, and he answered bluntly: "I don't know about my figure, I only know I can't dance anymore than an elephant. But—" he added, as Fanny swept past buoyant and graceful as a sylph, "your niece dances beautifully."
                  "My niece!" thought Adrience indignantly. "So he thinks I look old enough to be her aunt!" At first she was ready indignantly to deny the imputation, but a second thought checked the words on her lips, and she merely glared angrily at Ben, who innocently unconscious of his mistake, and fancying he had displayed great penetration in discovering their relationship, imagined that her silence arose from a dislike to talk, and so sat quietly beside her, until Fanny and her partner having made the circuit of the room, again whirled by them, when following out his own thought, he asked wonderingly—
                  "Doesn't it ever make her giddy?"
                  "She is giddy enough at all times," replied Adriance with a sour smile. "But I think her head is less affected by it than her heart."
                  "But Miss Clifford," urged simple Ben, deprecatingly, "you know she is young. Did not you use to dance once?"
                  "A little," retorted Adrienne with an unmistakable sneer. She had been the best dancer in New Orleans ten years ago, and that last remark was rather too much for her patience.
                  There is no knowing how much deeper Ben might have plunged into her disfavor, but luckily at this moment Fanny paused beside them, flushed and panting. Ben started up to give her a seat.
                  "No, thank you, Mr. Fordyce. Dear me, how warm it is!"
                  "Let me fan you," said Sedley, quietly taking the fan out of her hand, and waving it scientifically before her.
                  "Confound his impudence!" reflected Ben. "I should never have thought of doing that."
                  "Thank you, that's so nice!" exclaimed Fanny, as the cool air blew back her ribbons.
                  "I shall count this the happiest moment of the evening," responded Sedley, gallantly.
                  "Why so?"
                  "Because I have contributed to your comfort."
                  Fanny blushed a little, and Ben again felt himself distanced. At this moment Adrienne dropped her handkerchief; Sedley saw it, and giving Fanny her fan, he stooped to pick it up.
                  "Merci, Monsieur, now could you be so good as to help me put on my shawl? I have not been dancing you know, and I feel chilly."
                  Of course Sedley complied, and although really annoyed, rendered the service with a grace that satisfied even Adrienne. Ben was delighted.
                  "Perhaps you would find it cooler in the hall, Miss Grantham."
                  Fanny hesitated, looked wickedly at Sedley, who was bending over Adrienne, and then took Ben's offered arm, "I cannot stay long, though," she said as they went out.
                  "Oh yes, you can, your friend will take care of your aunt."
                  "Who," cried Fanny, amazed.
                  "Your aunt, Miss Clifford."
                  "My aunt!" exclaimed Fanny with horror. "Why, Adrienne is not my aunt, she is my cousin. I hope you did not let her know you thought that."
                  "Yes, I did," confessed Ben, "I did not hear what you called her, and so I spoke of you as her niece, but she never told me."
                  "Oh dear," groaned Fanny, "now you have made an enemy!"
                  "I'm very sorry," said Ben, meekly, "but I am always so stupid."
                  
                  Fanny laughed again, "Well I will try to explain it, but I ought to go back now."
                  "Oh no! not yet, wait here a while."
                  "What for? it's no cooler here than inside."
                  "Yes it is, besides if you will stay I will fan you. May I?"
                  They paused half way down the hall under the sweep of the stairs. There were a few others promenading slowly, but they did not pass very near them. Fanny gave Ben her fan, and he began to flutter it rather awkwardly.
                  "Oh, that's not the way!" Fanny said at last. Ben colored and tried again, Fanny amused herself for a few moments with his unsuccessful efforts to please her and then said,
                  "Let me show you."
                  "Forgive my awkwardness," plead Ben, "but I never fanned a lady before in my life."
                  "Didn't you? that is delightful!" exclaimed Fanny, who enjoyed this unsophisticated homage. "Well, I will give you a lesson. You must always keep the edge of the fan towards the person you wish to benefit; see. There, that is better."
                  Ben profitted by the instruction, and was soon performing his part as well as Sedley. There were some promenaders approaching their retreat, but Ben never saw them, he stood working away diligently and oblivious of everything else, looking at Fanny with smiling earnestness until she asked,
                  "What are you thinking of?"
                  "I was thinking how handsome you are." This was given as if it were the most natural and indeed inevitable answer to make.
                  Fanny blushed: "Mr. Fordyce I did not think you were a flatterer."
                  A couple walking faster than the other promenaders, were close beside them.
                  "I am not," protested Ben, "I never paid a compliment in my life, but you know that is true. I do think you handsome, why should I not say so?"
                  At this moment Ben became for the first time conscious that some persons were trying to pass him; he turned and his first glance met the laughing light of Edith's sunny eyes. She happened to be going with Vinton to give an order, and although she tried hard to look innocent, Ben knew in an instant that she had heard his last words. He colored to his very hair while Fanny exclaimed,
                  "Oh Edith, you know Mr. Fordyce; now, is not he a flatterer?"
                  "Sometimes I am afraid he is," said Edith, struggling to look oblivious.
                  Another couple walking slowly had unperceived by any of the group approached the spot.
                  Ben stood completely confused, blushing and incapable of utterance, but Vinton came to his rescue.
                  "At least I believe your heart is always right, eh, Fordyce?"
                  This was worse yet, with those mild hazel eyes upon him, Ben could only mutter inaudibly while Fanny cried,
                  "Ah! ah! Convicted!"
                  Edith was touched by Ben's confusion. "Not at all, Fanny," she said, earnestly; "I advise you to trust in all he says, for I believe he is reliable."
                  The couple had paused behind them, and Fanny was making signs of distress to Vinton. Ben recovered a little.
                  "Notwithstanding Bones?" he asked aside, with comical ruefulness.
                  It was now Edith's turn to blush—"That is forgotten," she said quickly; and then she caught Fanny's signal and looked around. Adrienne Clifford was behind them with Sedley. She had heard all of the last few sentences, she had guessed at once at the cause of Ben's embarrassment, and her eyes gleamed with a baleful light as she thought of the possible use she might make of her discovery—"Ah! Miss Clifford," exclaimed Edith, easily and without betraying surprise, "an old friend of yours was just inquiring for you; pray come with me, and let me find him again."
                  "Who is it?"
                  "Mr. Benton; don't you remember him?"
                  "Ah, yes; I met him a few years ago at the Virginia Springs—a charming fellow."
                  Edith did not think the last words peculiarly applicable to the rather seedy old bachelor; however, she did not know that Adrienne's "few years" meant full a decade and a half, which had naturally enough effected a considerable change in the quondam beau as well as the once dashing belle. Assisted by Edith's reintroduction, these two relics of the past recognized each other, and while each reflected what a sad wreck Time had made of the other, they never-theless enjoyed a resurrection of the joys and the ghosts of other days, which kept them occupied for the next hour.
                  Meantime Fanny, who had been found still lingering in the hall by her next partner, had been rapidly whirling through a succession of dances with a succession of the best waltzers in the rooms. Yet even while apparently absorbed in the music and the motion, she had been very pleasantly conscious of the admiring gaze of Ben's honest blue eyes that followed her wherever she went, and when at last quite tired out she paused from her labors, she adroitly contrived that it should be he who led her out for some refreshment. In the supper room they again encountered Edith, who had consented at last to take an ice with Lionel.
                  "How do you like him, Fanny?" whispered Edith, as Ben left them for a moment side by side.
                  "Oh, I think he is splendid!"
                  "I knew you would," cried Edith, triumphantly.
                  "Yes, he is delightfully unsophisticated."
                  "Now, Fanny, don't you flirt with him."
                  "Not, if I can help it," laughed Fanny. "So he is your friend that I was to dress for."
                  "Yes, he is a favorite of mine, so honest and reliable. He is an elegible, too—small property and good business."
                  "Tant mieux—however, he is not so rich as Sedley."
                  "For shame, Fanny! he is worth a dozen of him!"
                  "Peutêtre! Though seriously, Edith, you know I don't care a straw for the money. But here they come."
                  Lionel and Ben joined them, and the four chatted away merrily until Edith, goaded by that sense of duty which Fanny declared always oppressed her when she had a party to that degree that she looked as if she had the fate of a nation on her shoulders, took Lionel away to get up another dance, in which she finally consented to take her place with him.
                  —The scene in these handsome parlors was a very gay one. In the front room, the young people were dancing merrily, while in the other the elder portion of the company formed a brilliant group around Mrs. Rockford, who looked, as indeed she was the queen of the evening, while even her husband's iron brow relaxed somewhat from its graveness. Yet there is ever something very sad in even so careless a crowd as this. These lips are laughing now, these eyes are bright—but what lies beneath? The flowers wave, and the sun shines over the fields of Solferino, yet below the brown earth is scarred deep with graves. What envy, what jealousy, what caprice is hidden by the mask of smiles! On the faces of the old we see the wrinkles that sorrow and disappointment have traced with relentless fingers of steel. On the brows of the young broods the vague shadow of the unknown future. They laugh now—but for how long? Their hearts are light now—how soon will they be heavy with care, or, perhaps, cease to beat forever! Ah! who can tell what coming doom is even now threatening these thoughtless dancers! At the gorgeous wedding of the noble Henry of Navarre and the peerless Marguerite de Voloisthe chivalry and beauty of France united in the splendid festival, yet even then, St. Bartholomew's eve was close at hand, and many of the happiest revelers there were already doomed to the agony of a terrible death.—

                  MRS. ROCKFORD'S reception was the first of a series of gay entertainments that kept Edith and Fanny and their respective courts of admirers very busy. There were half a dozen weddings in the next fortnight, several dinners, Fanny gave a small party in honor of her cousin, and the Rockfords had a second reception, which, however, as it took place on a stormy evening, and gave rise to no adventures whatever, scarcely deserves to be chronicled. All this jollity, pleasant as it was, brought considerable distress of mind to two of our friends. These were Lionel Rowan and Ben Fordyce. The former found it much less easy to see Edith now that she had so many engagements. He met her constantly, it is true, but she was always so surrounded that he could with difficulty find an opportunity for any uninterrupted conversation with her. Even his enjoyment of his visits to the house was marred by the intrusion of other adorers. First among these, and most to his annoyance was Florance Fay. This exquisite young gentleman was so flattered by Edith's kindness, that he considered his presence indispensible to her happiness, and as he had nothing whatever to do, he devoted himself to her with a persistent assiduity which, while it bored her hugely, amused the family not a little, and gained for him from the witty Fanny, the soubriquet of the "inevitable Fay." Sometimes Lionel was absolutely a little jealous of the effeminate beauty, even though his own good sense assured him that it was impossible a woman like Edith could fancy so weak a person. He yet could not tell why she received his attentions with such unfailing good-nature, and completely puzzled, he scarcely knew what course to pursue. He was thoroughly aware of his own strong, deep attachment to the lovely belle, and a hundred times he would have avowed it, could he have found a favorable opportunity. So the days slipped away. and time was lost whose importance he never understood till too late.
                  As for Ben, he discovered to his horror that he was fast becoming what he had always despised, "a society man."—His acquaintance with the Rockfords had procured him several eligable invitations, and these he recklessly accepted, because he knew that at the festive scenes to which they led he should see Fanny, who had made so deep an impression upon his susceptible heart that he began to find a meeting with her indispensible to the happiness of his days.—Edith had taken him to call at the Grantham's, and he had been invited to their party, so that he had the entrée of their house. But his comfort, like Lionel's, was disturbed by the "green eyed monster." Whenever he saw Fanny there also was Sedley—always with something complimentary to say, or a good story to tell—and before his glib conversation Ben found his own straight forward speech very common-place, never dreaming that Fanny liked it better than all the polished nonsense in the world.
                  During this time Adrienne Clifford, destined to be a powerful disturbing element wherever she appeared, watched and waited, studying the people around her, looking for an occasion to forward her own ends or mar those of others—Shrewd and wary, lying in wait like a deadly serpent, ready to spring when she could be sure of stinging some one who possessed the two lost gifts of youth and beauty. A new interest had lately taken possession of her. Thoroughly blazée as she was, she had yet room for a certain false sentiment in her bad heart, and without any wish on his part, this had been roused and excited by Lionel Rowan. He was not presented to her till several days after the first reception, on the evening of Fanny's party. Then she was greatly struck with his fine, well-knit figure, his handsome face, and clear healthy complexion. Her sensual eyes dwelt admiringly on him as a splendid specimen of his sex, and she determined at once to secure his attentious. Putting on an air of intense languor, she succeeded in convincing him that she was very faint, and with gentlemanly kindness he offered her his arm and led her into another room. This was one of his unhappy evenings, for Edith had come to the party with Florance Fay, and as there was no chance of his speaking to her at this time, he was the more ready to devote vote himself to any one else. Adrienne, with that tact which she had acquired by long contact with the world, gave a tolerably shrewd guess at Lionel's character, and thought she had discovered how he was to be won. She exerted herself to the utmost to be entertaining, and she could be very agreeable when she pleased. He was amused and fascinated, and forgetful of Vinton's warning, when she threw into her conversation a pensive shade of regret at the want of health which necessitated her banishment from her own home and family, he was full of sympathy and offers of friendship. Quite willingly he lingered by her side, her talk interested him and filled up the time more agreeably than it was usually passed away from Edith; but for all that, she was not forgotten, and when at the end of an hour she entered the room, he became suddenly so oblivious of everything but her presence, that Adrienne had little trouble in reading his thoughts. This discovery by no means increased her kindness towards Edith, and she vowed renewed hostility even while with well assumed smiles, she said:
                  "Ah, there is your lovely friend. I see your are impatient to be gone. Now don't mind me, but go at once."
                  Edith's sunny eyes held him like a spell. To tell the truth, she had been wondering where he could be, and a desire to discover his whereabouts had been uppermost in her heart when she accepted Mr. McDuff's arm to make the tour of the rooms. She did not at all like the companionship in which she found him, and she threw more encouragement into her glances than she would have done, had he been with any one else. Lionel could not resist that look; he rose and walked across the room to her side. Adrienne followed admiringly his graceful figure, and drew a sigh through her set teeth as she turned to welcome Mr. Benton, who, to Lionel's relief, at the moment joined her.
                  McDuff began to fancy that he was always destined to be distanced by this handsome youth, for, after a moment, Edith dropped his arm and took Lionel's, asking, as she turned away from the discomfited Scotchman—
                  "Have you been here long?"
                  "Yes; I came before you did."
                  "Indeed! I did not see you."
                  "No, you seemed, as usual, too busy to care for me, and I have been devoting myself to Miss Clifford. She is a very fascinating woman."
                  "Is she?"
                  "Yes, don't you think so?"
                  "She certainly talks well," replied Edith, evasively.
                  "Yes, very well, indeed;" and Lionel went on to expatiate on her accomplishments, and his regret for her ill health. He never suspected that Edith could be jealous; nor was she, but she did not at all like his admiration for a woman whom she could not esteem, and whom she feared was false and unprincipled. Yet she did not feel warranted in telling him so; and he, never suspecting her disapproval, or doubting the sincerity of one who seemed so frank as Adrienne, went on spending more time with her than was at all desirable. Whenever they were in company together, if he could not be with Edith, he was at Adrienne's side, until his attentions, which were often paid in a strangely public manner, began to occasion remark, and this was exactly what the wily woman wished.
                  Meantime Vinton knew nothing of all this, and quite unmoved by these various developments kept himself persistently out of society, devoting himself with untiring assiduity to his studies, looking forward hopefully to Mabel's arrival. The time was short, it is true, between his visit to Herford, and the happy day, and when it came, he felt rewarded for his application by the consciousness which he had that he could now honestly enjoy a holiday. She was expected by the four o'clock train, and he joined his cousin in time to go with her to meet their welcome guest. She did not disappoint them. Among the crowd of people at the station, it was easy to distinguish that graceful figure draped in black, and they hurried to meet her—Edith, with enthusiastic kisses and eager words; Vinton, with a radiant look and a fervent pressure of the hand, that were eloquent of the happiness that filled her heart.
                  When they were fairly seated in the carriage, Edith broke out afresh with joyous welcome—
                  "How glad I am you have come, dear Mabel. How charmingly you look. Your cheeks are so rosy. You are like a breath of country air."
                  "I'm sure you are bright enough yourself, Sunshine," responded Mabel, affectionately.
                  
                  "I don't know," sighed Edith; I am dreadfully tried; I have been out every night for a week; but now that you have come, I am going to be very quiet, and have such a nice time!"
                  "Pray don't stay at home on my account, Edith."
                  "I am sure, Miss Mabel," said Vinton, "I shall be thankful if anything will keep her still for awhile; she has rushed about more like lightning than sunshine lately."
                  "Hush now, Vinton: I really shall not go out much now. Christmas week is always devoted to children's parties, you know. But we have lots of pleasant things to do. We are to go to High Bridge, if there's sleighing. Then there are some pictures you would like to see; and we must go to the opera. You would not mind that, would you? Our box is quite private, and Salvi is so splendid!"
                  Thus chatting, they drove to the house, where Mrs. Rockford had a warm welcome for Mabel, who already felt herself cheered by the pleasant atmosphere around her. Mr. Rockford relaxed in a very unusual manner from his ordinary coldness, and greeted her with marked cordiality, so that she felt at ease at once. After dinner, Vinton, for the first time in several weeks, joined the circle in the parlor, instead of going off to his study; taking his place, as a matter of course, at Mabel's side, never obtrusive in his attentions, but in a thousand little ways showing the deep, strong affection which he felt for their fair guest. They were both of them very happy, so entirely conscious of each other's interest, that it seemed as if there were little need of an avowal to make it more sure, and with a mutual trust and confidence that was very beautiful.
                  It was not long before they were invaded by visitors. First came the inevitable Florance Fay, who knew Mabel, and who ostensibly called to pay his respects to her, but whom Edith charitably took to herself, so as to leave her friend and cousin an opportunity for further chat. Well pleased with this arrangement, Florance laid himself out to be peculiarly agreeable.
                  "You say I always know the news," he lisped, "and now I have something quite new to tell you."
                  "Indeed! I hope it is interesting."
                  "Oh, very, the Stuyvesant Percys are going to give a fancy party."
                  "Are they?—when?"
                  "I don't know how soon. But you'll go, won't you?"
                  "I think not. You know we never visited there till this fall; but they were so very polite to me at Newport, last summer, that aunt thought it right to call."
                  "But it is to be very select."
                  "Select! at their house! Who will make the selection?"
                  "Oh, I don't know; but I suppose it will be all right. I hear they are in quite good society now."
                  Here the discussion of the claims of the nouveau riche to recognition was interrupted by the arrival of Fanny Grantham, who came attended by the delighted Ben to welcome Edith's friend. The necessary introductions brought about a change of place, and when they were reseated, it happened that Mabel and Vinton were side by side on a large sofa; Fanny in an arm-chair, between Mabel and Edith; the two young men opposite. After the first common-places, Fanny started the same subject that Fay had just broached.
                  "Only think, Edith, they say the Stuyvesant Percys are going to give a fancy party."
                  "So I hear."
                  "I wonder if it is really true."
                  "Yes," said Florance, solemnly, "I had it from the best authority."
                  "Who's that, Mr. Fay? your tailor?" asked Fanny, innocently.
                  "No, indeed, Miss Grantham, I was told by Tom Livingston, he knows everybody, and he says it is so."
                  "Then it must be true," observed Fanny, with an air of conviction.
                  "You ought to know, Miss Fanny," said Vinton, mischievously, "they are such friends of yours."
                  "No, they are not," repudiated Fanny. "They were so polite at Newport we could not cut them. I am glad we did not now, for I mean to go to their party, it will be such fun. You will go, won't you, Edith?"
                  "I think not," replied Edith, glancing at Mabel. "I am going to be very quiet, you know."
                  "Oh, don't stay at home on my account," said Mabel, earnestly, "You know you will not start till my bed time, and I should like so much to see you dressed."
                  
                  "Well, we will see about it," hesitated Edith, "perhaps I will go, but I really know them so little."
                  "Yes," said Vinton. "Before you urge her to go, Miss Fanny, do tell us something about them?"
                  "It's a long story, but I can tell you the whole if you like," replied Fanny.
                  "Oh, by all means."
                  "To begin at the beginning, then, Mr. Percy is a New England man, in no way connected with the Long Island Percys, though he claims relationship. His father who was a very plain person, did him the justice to give him a good education and sent him to college. They say that he was entered as Matthew Percy; the second year he was Matthew Stuyvesant Percy, and he graduated Stuyvesant Percy which he has ever since remained. He married a pretty, weak woman, with some fortune; by good management he has increased it so that they are now quite wealthy; he has done well in his profession too, he is no doubt a smart man, and I hear he is talked of for Judge, he has pushed his way very cleverly thus far, cutting his own family and doing his best to get into society; they are getting on well, and I dare say their party will be a success. I insist that Edith shall go; mother will be be her chaperone, and I have such a lovely idea for her dress."
                  "She must go by all means," urged Mabel, "so tell us what your idea is."
                  "She must appear as 'Sunshine,'" announced Fanny, oracularly.
                  This proposition was received with enthusiasm, and gave rise to a discussion of costume, that soon became very animated, and in which all joined but Ben, who merely listened with evident interest and an unfailing smile on his honest face. Noticing his silence, Fanny at last attacked him—
                  "What are you going to wear, Mr. Fordyce?"
                  "I? really, Miss Fanny," replied Ben, starting at the sudden question. "I don't suppose I shall go."
                  "Oh yes, you will. I'll get you an invite."
                  "But indeed, I never shall know what to wear or how to get a costume."
                  "Oh, come as a pilgrim, that is so easy to arrange."
                  "But I don't think it would be appropriate."
                  "Yes it would," said Vinton, "eminently so."
                  "Why?"
                  "Because you 
                        
                           "'Kneel at many a shrine,
                           And lay the heart on none.'
                        
                     
                  
                  "Is not that so? Eh, Ben?"
                  Ben blushed, looking confusedly from Edith to Fanny who oddly enough reflected his color, and Edith hastened to break the awkward pause by asking,
                  "Is Mr. Sedley going, Fanny? what will he wear?"
                  "I don't know whether he will be there; if he is, I think he will appear as the Giant Despair, who you know frightened the pilgrims so dreadfully."
                  This sally created a general laugh, amid which Ben observed triumphantly,
                  "But they vanquished him at last."
                  "Yes," said Vinton, "but not till he had kept them a long time in Doubting Castle."
                  Fanny could not help joining in the renewed merriment which followed this rather particular speech, and she was glad when Florance Fay who only half understood, appealed to her—
                  "You are so good in choosing costumes, Miss Grantham please give me one?"
                  "You? Oh, you, Mr. Fay, had better come as a sigh."
                  Thus the lively brunnette having recovered from her embarrassment, kept up a flow of fun that amused Mabel and entertained them all, which was hardly interrupted when Mrs. Rockford joined the party, and took part in the debate, and was continued with animation till Fanny broke it up by exclaiming—
                  "But I really must go, it is late, and I left Adrienne alone."
                  As they all rose, Vinton and Mabel remained for a moment side by side. Fanny was in the midst of a voluble description of Edith's dress to Mrs. Rockford, when she suddenly paused, and stood for an instant looking from one to the other.
                  "Pardon me," she exclaimed. "But it just struck me so strangely, what a strong likeness there is between Vinton and Miss Sandys."
                  To her continued wonder, Mrs. Rockford turned very pale, as she spoke and answered hastily, almost angrily, "It must be a fancy, Fanny, Mabel is a blonde, and Vinton has dark hair and eyes."
                  "I know it," replied Fanny, looking bewildered. "But still there is a strong resemblance, in expression or features. They are not related are they?"
                  For a moment Mrs. Rockford did not reply, then she answered, "No," abruptly, and with an effort. Fanny saw that there was something painful in the subject, and turned away to make her adieux.
                  
                  But meanwhile her cousin Adrienne had not been as she thought alone, she had been enjoying a long uninterrupted tête-à-tête with Lionel Rohan. He had not called at the Grantham's since their party, and this evening, as he was at leisure and knew that he had no reasonable excuse for going to the Rockford's, he determined to make the visit which had already been put off too long. Truth to tell, he was very much pleased on being ushered into the parlor, to find Adrienne alone, though at first somewhat disconcerted by the intense enthusiasm of her greeting.
                  "Ah! Mr. Rohan! I am so glad to see you; how kind of you to come in when Fanny was out."
                  "Not at all, Miss Clifford, I intended my visit principally for you."
                  "Did you? how very good of you! Come then, sit by me here, and we will have such a nice long talk."
                  Lionel accepted the proffered seat on a not very extensive sofa, saying politely,
                  "This is an unexpected pleasure, and I assure you a very great one, Miss Clifford."
                  "It makes me very happy," sighed his delighted companion. "But don't call me Miss Clifford, it's so formal, I like Addie so much better."
                  "Then I am to say Miss Addie?"
                  "No, Addie, without any Miss at all. There are so few people here who care for me, that I long to hear my old home name from your lips."
                  "Certainly Addie, I shall remember your kind permission, and value it highly."
                  "And I may call you Lionel?"
                  "Of course. I shall like that very much."
                  "Thank you. Now I shall feel as if we were really friends, dear Lionel," and she slid her hand in his as she spoke, fixing her admiring eyes full on his handsome face in a style that called up a slight color. "How splendid he is," thought Adrienne, and she contracted her eyes for an instant, and let them fall in a manner only too eloquent. Lionel felt himself in a false position, he hastened to extricate himself—releasing her hand with a gentle pressure, he exclaimed,
                  "But I had nearly forgotten my commission; see, Addie, I remember your wishes when I am away," and he produced a fancy box, which he opened and presented to her.
                  "Ah! mes bon-bons!" exclaimed Adrienne, taking them gratefully and biting one with her white teeth. She had a southern fondness for candy, and when she afterwards displayed this to Fanny, she carefully omitted to mention that they had been brought in obedience to a direct request.
                  "I am so much obliged to you; how thoughtful you are, dear Lionel," she went on, determined not to be baffled. "How can I prove how grateful I am? Do you know what I should do if you were my cousin?"
                  "No!" answered Lionel promptly, and in some surprise. For he could not help guessing when he encountered the languishing look of those black eyes, and felt her thin, trembling hand on his arm. But it was not a very handsome face that leaned so near his, and he was not much tempted to answer otherwise than "No."
                  Adrienne did not feel encouraged to go on. There was a certain amiable dignity about this young man that, after all, awed her, and she threw herself back on the sofa, saying, with a forced laugh, "I shall not tell you." But, perhaps, for all that, more desirous than before of obtaining some real hold on him.
                  Lionel had an uncomfortable consciousness that he had been, perhaps, unnecessarily cold, and he made an effort to be peculiarly entertaining. Adrienne soon recovered from the rebuff, and dashed off into a sparkling conversation that, sometimes hovering on the uttermost verge of propriety, had yet a fascination in its very abandon. Lionel did not again check her; and when later in the evening she served up an eloquent description of her own life, which had even less claims than "Les historois de Dumas" to being "founded in fact," but which he, of course, credited entirely, by an appeal peal to his friendship, he was very warm in his assurances of regard.
                  "Then you will let me say anything to you, Lionel?"
                  "Anything, Addie."
                  "Even if I speak against a person whom you now think lovely, but whom I know to be deceiving you?"
                  "Who do you mean?" asked Lionel, uneasily.
                  "I cannot tell you now. There is the bell. Fanny is coming home. Only promise not to be vexed."
                  "I do promise, Addie, for I believe you are a friend."
                  "Indeed I am, Lionel, a better friend than I can tell you now," said Adrienne, with another pressure of the hand, and then a sudden start and change of position, as Fanny entered, that, to say the least, looked rather oddly.
                  Lionel did not mind that. He scarcely even noticed it, he was so busily thinking of the strange insinuation he had just heard. It lingered in his memory, and troubled him after he had gone away to his own rooms, and although he scarcely attached sufficient importance to it to permit it to interfere with his studies, yet it haunted him in every leisure moment. He was very busy just at this time. Through the influence of his family he had been fortunate enough to be taken at once into partnership with the Hon. Pierrepont Banks, a lawyer in large practice, whose reputation at the time was such as to render his position at once a brilliant one. Lionel felt this deeply, and, with honest pride, determined to prove himself equal to the situation. He worked early and late with all the more assiduity lately, because he had allowed himself to mingle much in society, and Mr. Banks already found him a valuable assistant. During the two following days he was unusually occupied. An important case came on for trial, and he found himself so absorbed in it that he had no opportunity for meeting Edith, one glance of whose sunny eyes would surely dispel these mists of distrust.
                  In uttering that vague insinuation Adrienne Clifford had no definite plan. She was thoroughly resolved to destroy Lionel's admiration for Edith, to sap his confidence in her, if possible, to make an open and irreconcilable rupture between them. She knew that this task would be no easy one, she felt that his fancy—love she would not permit herself to call it—was perhaps a strong one, her own weapons she as yet scarcely knew where to find, but wary and unscrupulous hesitating at no means, however crooked, for accomplishing her end, she waited watchful and silent to gather up every incident however trifling that might be turned to advantage, dangerous as that witch hag of wild Welsh fancy who lurks in mist and shadow to entangle unwary travellers in her spells and lure them to destruction.
                  As it sometimes happens, just when she was most anxious, willful fate threw in her way a powerful coadjutor.
                  One morning not many days after her interview with Lionel, Adrienne and Fanny sallied forth to make around of fashionable calls.
                  —What a strange institution of society are these performances! Every one who has ever made one of these solemn stupid progresses remembers only too well what an immense bore they are, and yet we go on indefinitely repeating them. In the first place the trouble of dressing, to one to whom dress is not the first object of existence, then the crushing into a carriage and the monotonous drive. How fervently you hope at each house that the people will be out; if they are not what a trial it is to you to see them, and them to see you. What little mild platitudes you mentally indulge in; not even knowing each other well enough for a comfortable bit of gossip, you deal in small common places that are safe and proper, but oh, so intensely wearisome. Then, after five minutes of mutual fatigue you make an elabrate adieu and once more squeeze into the carriage and proceed ad infinitum, till exhausted strength gives way, and hungry and tired you return home thankful that the dreaded ceremony is over, though the performance only ensures you relief for a very short time. I suppose it is a necessary elaboration of civilized life, but if so, why not perform Kow-tow at once and without objection?—
                  It chanced this morning that the young ladies were fortunate, they found several of their "friends" out, and arrived about noon at the Beverleigh House, where Adrienne proposed to be left, she would "like so much to run in for a moment to see dear Mrs. Marion," a Southern lady with whom she professed some intimacy, and Fanny of course agreed, saying that she would take the opportunity of paying one or two visits in Washington Square, though it was not "Friday."
                  Having handed her card to the waiter Adrienne glided into one of the public parlors. They seemed quite deserted and while awaiting a reply to the enquiry she walked slowly from one to the other, partly from an idle curiosity, partly to see how her new hat looked in the mirror. The reflection was not very gratifying; the bonnet was pretty enough but the face it shaded looked worn and sallow in contrast with the pink roses that adorned it, and she turned away impatiently then for the first time noticing a gentleman who stood in the window, under the shade of a curtain looking carelessly out on the busy whirl of Broadway.
                  The moment she saw him her appearance changed; he was some one for whom to look well, and she bit her lips to give them a good color and crossed the room with graceful ease, as if she had but that moment entered; her approach roused him, he started and turned towards her. Their eyes met with a mutual cry of recognition and astonishment; for a moment he stood, his features convulsed with a passing struggle, then with a gesture half defiant, half deprecatory he advanced to meet her.
                  "Adrienne!"
                  At first she recoiled a pace, gazing at him bewildered, terrified with a wild stare, but meeting the resolute regard of those flashing eyes a thousand memories of her lost youth returned with overwhelming force, her glances fell before his, and in a broken voice she uttered his name—
                  "Percival."
                  "This is a strange meeting, Adrienne," he said, holding out his hand. "I hope you are well." There was a half tender humility in his courteous manner. She placed her fingers in his, but withdrew them instantly, still looking confused, and asked abruptly—
                  "What brought you here?"
                  "Business or pleasure, which you choose," he responded.
                  "But see, there is some one whom, I think, is looking for you."
                  "Yes," said Adrienne, with recovered composure, "I came to call on some friends."
                  "Mrs. Marion is not at home," said the waiter, approaching.
                  "Very well, be sure you give her my card;" and as the man went out, she turned again towards Percival Denbigh, who, well preserved, handsome as ever, stood, with rapid glances, studying the form he had once known so well—noting, with a half suppressed sigh, how the years since they had parted had robbed it of its beauty; thinking, with a concealed smile, of his own better escape from the touch of time. Perhaps Adrienne half guessed his thoughts, for a faint flush crossed her sallow cheek, as their eyes met, and she said—
                  "How long it is since I saw you last?"
                  "A long and weary time, Adrienne," he replied, gently.
                  "But as your friend is not in, can you not spare me a few moments, to tell me all I wish so much to know?"
                  Adrienne consented. Fanny was to send up for her when she returned. She had yet some moments to wait, and she took the proffered place on the sofa at Denbigh's side.
                  "Now, let me return your question. What brought you here?"
                  "I am spending a few weeks with my cousins the Granthams."
                  "What! Fanny Grantham?"
                  "Yes; do you know her?"
                  "Yes; I met them at Newport, last summer," After a moment, he asked, "And how do you amuse yourself? Do you know many people?"
                  "Yes, a great many. The Granthams have a large circle of acquaintance."
                  There was a pause. Denbigh seemed thinking intensely. Adrienne sat regarding that handsome averted face with a glance in which lurked a strange mixture of hate and sadness. Presently he looked up, and her eyes fell before his as he said—
                  "Adrienne, I am going to be here for some time. We shall probably meet constantly. It is useless to try to ignore the past"—and his voice softened, his eyes grew tender; while a faint color rose to Adrienne's cheek, as he spoke: "We can, doubtless, either of us injure the other deeply, if we choose. Let us decide at once, then; shall we meet as friends, or as enemies? It is for you to say."
                  There was a moment of silence. Adrienne glanced furtively towards him, with an evil flash in her bad eyes. There was, evidently great capability for mischief in this woman, and Denbigh felt how dangerous she could be. It was time to turn the scale.
                  "Adrienne," he asked, quietly, "Are you as fond of jewelry as ever?"
                  "Yes," she replied, with a sudden glance of intelligence, and almost immediately added—"as friends."
                  "You have made the wiser decision," he said, coldly. "The time for sentiment between us is past," Adrienne winced. "But I had much rather have you as a coadjutor, than be obliged, in self-defence, to turn against you."
                  "Certainly, Percival, we had far better be friends." And having thus agreed to bury the past, she resumed the old affectation that for once had been lost in the agitation of the interview, and rolled her eyes with some of the old trick, as she asked—"And now tell me, what are your plans?"
                  "I hardly know whether to make you my confidante," he replied, regarding her distrustfully.
                  "Ah! yes, do!"
                  "Honestly, then, Adrienne, you will gain much by assisting me. I need a friend. You have not forgotten that I can prove my—" he hesitated—" my regard, or my gratitude, substantially.
                  "N'importe," said Adrienne, gaily, "only go on."
                  "Of course, then, all that I say is safe."
                  "Oh certainly."
                  "First, then, I want you to tell me about the people you know. Who are the belles?"
                  "Fanny, I suppose, and Edith Rockford."
                  "Ah! you know her?" asked Denbigh, with interest.
                  "Yes!" exclaimed Adrienne, turning suddenly towards him in manifest excitement. "Do you knew her? is she your present pursuit? Oh! I hope so! Tell me, is she your object?"
                  "Yes," replied Denbigh, "I will admit that she is—but why do you care?"
                  "Because I hate her!" and Adrienne threw such an intensity of force into the words as left no doubt of her sincerity.
                  Denbigh smiled at the insinuation. "And because you hate her, you are glad that I should like to win her. Is my preference then so terrible?"
                  "You know, Percival!" Adrienne almost groaned again, losing all her composure. "You know! but I forget that the past is buried—yet you surely know that no worse fate can befalla woman than to be either your mistress or your wife," and there was such a meaning in her words that even Denbigh quailed.
                  "Let that pass, Adrienne," he said angrily. "I mean to marry Edith Rockford if I can—we are half engaged already."
                  "Are you?" said Adrienne, joyfully, with an abrupt transition. "Are you? That is delightful. But you know you have a rival."
                  "A dozen, I dare say. But whom do you mean?"
                  "Lionel Rohan."
                  "Rohan? Ah, yes, I remember—but he is a mere boy."
                  "He is twenty-five at least—a very suitable age for her," retorted Adrienne. "She likes him, and you may find him dangerous."
                  "Well?"
                  "But I think we can get him out of your way. I have my own reasons for wishing to detach him from her."
                  Denbigh suppressed the sneering surprise he felt at the idea of this woman's attempting to rival the peerless young beauty he admired, and quietly acquiesced in the proposition. It was now quite evident that they had a common interest, and the few remaining moments before Fanny sent up for Adrienne were devoted to the formation of a plan by which they could communicate with each other unsuspected. Denbigh had his own reasons for not wishing to appear at present, and Adrienne felt that the game was in her own hands—so they parted with no affectation of regard, secretly detesting each other, yet for the present united by the ties of mutual interest.
                  Denbigh understood well the woman with whom he had to deal. That same evening a box was left at the Grantham's "for Miss Clifford." It contained a superb gold bracelet. Adrienne's eyes sparkled greedily as she caught its glitter. She felt all that the gift implied, even while she assured Fanny with apparent wonder, that
                  "It is so strange, such a lovely anonymous present. I wonder who could have sent it. Ah! my friends are so kind!"
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER V.
                  
                     
                        "Verily my sin hath found me out."
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           "La Peine suit la crime elle arrive à pas lents."
                        
                        VOLTAIRE.
                     
                  
                  CHRISTMAS passed very quietly at the Rockfords. The eve was spent at home. Edith declined several invitations; but, perhaps, after all, enjoyed herself more than if she had accepted them, for Lionel Rohan found time at last to see her once more, and an exceedingly jolly game of whist, in which he was her partner against Mabel and Vinton, whiled away the hours very pleasantly, though it permitted no opportunity for conversation.
                  Looking once again on that clear brow and those innocent eyes, Lionel wondered how he could ever for a moment have doubted their sincerity; and though far from suspecting Adrienne, concluded that her warning must have referred to some unknown enemy. Edith's frankly joyous welcome reassured his faltering hopes and emboldened him to be more openly devoted in his attentions than before. Perhaps this complaisance arose in part from the fact that it was a very long time since she had heard from Percival Denbigh, whose strange fascination time and absence had done much to weaken. It was three weeks since the receipt of his last letter, and she began to think, with a feeling of absolute relief, that he might have forgotten her. Be this as it might—and who can account for the wiles of a lady's heart?—Edith certainly received Lionel's very pointed attentions with a pleasing confidence that indicated a deeper feeling than she had yet acknowledged. Vinton watched them with mischievous delight, and Mabel's mild dove-eyes were full of kind approval. They, too, were so happy in their own unavowed affection, that they rejoiced that those so dear to them were equally content.
                  There was some discussion of the approaching fancy party, in the course of the evening. The invitations were out, and Lionel announced himself as among the favored few.
                  "I can't think how they came to ask me," he said; "I do not know them."
                  "You owe your card to Fanny Grantham, I rather think," observed Edith. "I understand they submitted their list to her."
                  "Are 
                        gou
                        you
                      going, Miss Edith?"
                  "Yes, I believe so."
                  "And what are you going to wear?"
                  "They want me to appear as Sunshine," said Edith, with down cast eyes.
                  "Capital! you will be superb. I think I shall go as a sunflower."
                  They all laughed; and Vinton, who had been vainly endeavoring to attract his friends attention to the game, said, despairingly—
                  "That will do, Lionel. Now, will you please to play?"
                  "Oh, is it my turn?" asked Lionel, innocently.
                  "To be sure it is, and has been any time these last ten minutes."
                  "I beg pardon; but really I've forgotten what's trumps."
                  "Hearts."
                  "That's all right. But now, Miss Edith, is it any matter about my dress? and may I go with you?"
                  "No; I don't think you can. You may meet us there, if you choose; but Fanny is to appear as Starlight, and we are to enter the room together. But, after that—"
                  "I understand," said Lionel, with a pleased smile, "I shall be in attendance."
                  "Just look what the man is playing," groaned Vinton; "he has put the ace of hearts on my king, when I know he has a spade."
                  "Did spades lead? You must excuse me, I really did not notice. Of course I have seven unlucky spades in my hand."
                  "That is rather running it into the ground," grumbled Vinton.
                  "Atrocious!" exclaimed Lionel.
                  "Whist! whist!" cried Edith.
                  So the game proceeded, slowly, amid great merriment It was late before the rubber was played out, although the last round was assisted by some excellent mulled wine, and Lionel took his departure, without further opportunity for talk. Vinton went out with him to the door, and as soon as the two young men were gone, Mabel came to Edith and held out her hand for good night.
                  "Won't you wait till Vinton comes back?" asked Edith, detaining her.
                  "No, thank you, dear," replied Mabel, her mild eyes clouding with unshed tears, "I had rather go directly. Please don't stop me."
                  "How thoughtless we have been," cried Edith, kissing her warmly; "do let me go with you."
                  "No, indeed, I had rather be alone. I really have enjoyed the evening, but I must be sad sometimes—" and as she heard the sound of Vinton's approach, she hastened away to conceal an outburst of grief, which she felt to be weak. It was not that she did not like her friend's merry society; but who that has suffered does not know how, after any season of unusual forgetfulness, the old grief returns with renewed poignancy!
                  "She has gone," Edith said to her cousin, in reply to his inquiring glance, "I think she was tired; and although I am sure our gayety is beneficial to her, yet I know she often is very sad after it is over."
                  "No wonder, poor thing!" responded Vinton, tenderly, "is she not lovely, Edith?"
                  "Indeed she is, dear Vinton, and I long to welcome her as a sister."
                  "To tell the truth, Sunshine, it is very hard for me to keep from telling how much I love her, but I don't think I ought to as long as she is here."
                  "Of course not; but, when she goes home, you can visit her."
                  "Yes, and then I hope, Edith, there will be two weddings in the family before long."
                  "Speak for yourself, sir," returned Edith, blushing.
                  "Lionel is a capital fellow."
                  "Yes. Good night."
                  "Stay a moment, Edith," urged Vinton, reverting to his own hopes. "Do you think Mabel knows how much I care for her?"
                  "Yes, I think she cannot help seeing it."
                  "You do not know—I do not believe you can guess, Edith," Vinton went on earnestly, "how much, how very much I love her; and yet I am sometimes surprised at myself,—my affection is so calm, so assured. I do not feel at all as I did when I had that desperate fancy for Augusta Jenkins."
                  "But you were a boy then."
                  "I know that; but I used to flush and tremble when I met her, and be half sick with hope and fear. My feelings then, though it was so trifling an affair, were more as I imagined love to be, and as it is painted by poets, than they are now. Yet I am sure I love Mabel with all my heart, though the sentiment is so pure and calm, it seems to unite that which I might have towards a sister with that which I should owe to a wife." Vinton had continued speaking in the half soliloquy he often adopted in his confidences with his cousin. She listened with unfailing interest, and when he paused a reply, she said—
                  "Your manner indicates exactly what you describe, but I think Mabel likes it far better than more impassioned lovemaking. I have no doubt you are destined for each other. You actually look alike already."
                  "Do we?" asked Vinton, surprised; "you flatter me."
                  "Yes; you know the saying is that married people always resemble each other after awhile; but you have anticipated that. There certainly is a likeness, subtle but quite perceptible, between you."
                  "That's odd. I never suspected it. I suppose I may accept it as a good omen. But I am keeping you up too long. Good night, and a bountiful Santa Claus to you."
                  Whether this parting wish brought about its own fulfillment, or not, it is certain that the beneficent saint of Christmas was very liberal to all in the Rockford mansion the next day, especially to the fair Edith. On entering her boudoir in the morning, she found quite a wealth of presents. There was a lovely set of topaz from her aunt, selected, she knew at once, in preparation for her fancy dress; a solid roll of gold from her uncle, who always gave a substantial donation of that sort; from Vinton, the Abbotsford edition of her favorite author, the enchanting Sir Walter; and some delicate embroidery from Mabel. In the course of the morning numerous other gifts were left at the door, from divers lady friends and gentlemen adorers. These latter prudently shrouded themselves in mystery, except McDuff, who sent a heavy gold chain, with his compliments. Edith declined wearing his fetters, and the present was returned to the provoked Scotchman, with a polite note setting forth that Miss Rockford regretted that she could not accept it. Of course there were plenty of flowers, but, among them all, Edith gave the preference to a pure white boquet tied with blue.
                  Christmas day was celebrated as it had always been at the Rockfords, from time immemorial, by a family dinner party—very formal, very dull, intensely proper. On this occasion, as on every similar festival for the past twenty years, Mr. Rockford's brother and his wife, from Brooklyn, and Mrs. Rockford's two maiden aunts, the Misses Vinton, were assembled together. They were incongruous elements always. Mr. Timothy Rockford was a sad, quiet man, whose life had been clouded by the loss of his children. His wife, "Aunt Agatha," was a pale, patient woman, a great invalid, inclined to look always on the gloomy side of the world: while Miss Clarissa and Miss Cecilia Vinton were fussy, gossiping persons, priding themselves on knowing everybody, and hearing the last news; always well dressed; their hair in crisp curls, as they had worn it in youth. Edith was fond of her quiet uncle, and for his sake devoted herself to rousing his wife into cheerfulness; while Vinton assiduously played the agreeable to his mother's friends. Mabel, on this day, assisted Edith. There was something about Mrs. Timothy Rockford that resembled her own mother, and she did her best to serve and entertain her. So the dinner passed off, stately, stiff, and tedious, and the ladies assembled in the parlor, leaving the brothers to discuss family affairs over their wine.
                  "My dear Mrs. Rockford," said Miss Clarissa, bustling up to pale Aunt Agatha, "you really look wretchedly. I am afraid you do not exert yourself enough."
                  "I cannot walk at all," replied Mrs. Rockford, feebly. "I suffer so much with my back."
                  "Ah! do you? Now that is very sad. Pray, did you every try 'Rawlin's Rejuvenator?' They say it is excellent. Mrs. Gouverneur Weston used it, and found it very beneficial cial. I suppose you heard about her. You know, Claudia, she"—and here the conversation became sepulchral, and Edith and Mabel moved away with Miss Cecilia, who still considered herself young, would not allow herself to be called aunt, and was gushingly enthusiastic on all subjects.
                  "Oh! Edith, do you know I went last Sunday to hear the Rev. Henry Guard Wrecker."
                  "Did you? Why Cecilia, how could you?"
                  "Oh, I know Dr. Silvertongue would not like it, but I was so curious, and so Mr. Benton went with me; and oh! Edith, you don't know what a lovely man he is."
                  "Who? Mr. Benton?"
                  "Oh, dear, no! he's well enough," added Miss Cecilia, who carried on an antediluvian flirtation with the fossil beau, "I mean Mr. Wrecker, of course. If Brooklyn were not so far off, I think I should go every Sunday; only it's so vulgar. He wears such beautiful long hair, and all clean shaved—I suppose, to look like an apostle—and he tells such funny stories. Really, I was charmed. You must take Miss Sandys to hear him, by all means."
                  "I do not believe she would go; would you, Mabel?"
                  "I think not," replied High Church Mabel. "He may be very eloquent, but I do not think I should like to hear him."
                  "I suppose it was wicked—Clarissa thought it was awful," said Miss Cecilia, enjoying the idea of her innocent impropriety. "After all, there was nobody there I knew—a dreadfully second class set, I assure you. Mr. Benton said he should not want to go to heaven with such a lot of snobs; but, then, he is a shockingly wicked man: and I certainly saw some very pretty bonnets there, one that I am sure was a Lawson."
                  "That must have been a comfort," said Edith, slyly; and so the conversation flowed peacefully on in no very exciting strain, even after the gentlemen came in. The party broke up early. Mr. and Mrs. Timothy Rockford had a long way to go, and departed first. The Misses Vinton lingered to give some suggestions about Edith's costume, and finally they went off, attended by Mr. Rockford, who always made it a point to accompany them, though, in truth, they would have preferred the escort of their handsome nephew. He, however, was very well pleased to be left to have a little quiet talk with Mabel.
                  "I am afraid you have had a very stupid day," he said, seating himself by her on the sofa, in the deserted front parlor.
                  "I am a little tired," replied truthful Mabel, "but your friends are very kind, Mr. Rockford."
                  "Always Mr. Rockford! Why will you not call me Vinton, dear Miss Mabel?"
                  "I will, if you like, Vinton," said Mabel, a faint color rising to her pure check as she uttered the name; "I feel as if I had always known you, and I am sure there can be no harm in dropping these useless formalities."
                  She was so fair and lovely, her heavy black dress so adorned the beauty of her pearley complexion, her pale hair, and the mild lustre of her large sad eyes, that Vinton said, as he gazed admiringly on her delicate charms,
                  "Do you know, if I had the naming of you, Mabel, I should call you Moonlight, as we call Edith Sunshine;" and at that moment, as the radiant belle passed them, robed in blue, with her golden hair, glancing eyes, and glowing color, the contrast between the two friends was like that between the flashing splendor of the sunbeams that dash across the azure summer sky, and the pure still light of the silver moon in its canopy of darkness.
                  Edith was too considerate to linger near her friends, but gliding away, after a moment, sought out her aunt, who sat in the library gazing with dreamy eyes into the fire, her handsome head thrown wearily back, with an expression of almost hopelessness on her regular features.
                  "You are tired, dear aunt."
                  "I believe I am, Edith," said Mrs. Rockford, rousing herself with an effort; "I am glad it is over."
                  "Yes," replied Edith, suppressing a yawn, "I was so delighted that Uncle Rockford went home with the Vintons."
                  "Of course, he always does."
                  "I know it; but I was so afraid they might take off Vinton—and he has had so little chance with Mabel to-day."
                  "They are together now, I suppose."
                  "Yes; oh! Aunt Claudia," cried Edith, enthusiastically, "won't it be a nice match?"
                  "What!" asked Mrs. Rockford, starting as if a blow had been dealt her, from the languid position into which she had again sunk, "What, Edith!"
                  "Why, of course, I thought you had noticed it," said Edith, surprised at her excitement.
                  "Noticed what?" almost gasped Mrs. Rockford, as if yet refusing to comprehend a painful thought.
                  "Why, the love affair between Mabel and Vinton."
                  "A love affair between Mabel and Vinton," repeated Mrs. Rockford, growing pale with the conviction she could no longer resist.
                  "Certainly, dear aunt," said Edith, attributing Mrs. Rockford's emotion to surprise, and not dreaming of opposition to her favorite scheme; "I think they are very much attached to each other. You, surely, would not object."
                  "You must be mistaken, Edith; it is impossible; he likes her very much I know; but he does not, he cannot love her."
                  "Why not, aunt?" asked Edith, growing more and more amazed, "I thought you would like to see them married."
                  "Married! It is impossible. Oh, my God! I never thought of this!" exclaimed Mrs. Rockford.
                  "She is very lovely. I am sure he could not find a sweeter wife," urged Edith, hoping by her words to calm her aunt's agitation, but they only served to increase it."
                  "His wife! Edith! She will never be his wife! No, no; it is monstrous, it is impossible! You have fancied that a mere brotherly regard was a stronger feeling."
                  "Indeed, I don't think I have, Aunt Claudia," said Edith, distressed and pained at the effect of her words, but feeling that she ought to take her cousin's part. "I am sure, from what Vinton has told me, that he is desirous of marrying her, and that he has never thought of your having a wish opposed to it."
                  "It can never, never be!" cried Mrs. Rockford, struggling vainly with her emotion. "Edith, you do not know what you are talking about. Oh, my God! it is too terrible!" and overcome with the violence of her feelings, she sank back so white and stricken that Edith exclaimed, in alarm—
                  "Oh, aunt, dear aunt!" you are ill; let me call some one," and she pulled the bell, and then turned towards the door.
                  "Stop, stop! Edith," gasped Mrs. Rockford, with a gesture ture so imploring, that her niece hastened back to her side.
                  "Do not call any one. Tell John to bring me a glass of wine, but do not call Vinton."
                  Edith gently put her arms around her aunt, and rested her weary head on her shoulder, soothing her, as well as she was able, with kind words. The wine assisted Mrs. Rockford in recovering her composure, and she soon sat up and looked at her niece—
                  "I will not try to conceal from you, Edith, that I am pained and shocked at what you have just told me; I had not thought of Vinton's leaving me," she faltered. A lie was always repugnant to her, and this she knew, only too well, was not the true reason.
                  "I am sure he loves you too much to do anything opposed to your wishes, dear aunt; but I am very sorry you do not like it. We both thought you would approve, certainly."
                  "No, Edith, I can never consent to such a marriage. I cannot tell you my reasons now. Do not speak of what has passed, even to Vinton. After all, perhaps, you are mistaken. I will not interfere at present."
                  "They are so happy," continued Edith, pleadingly.
                  "Well, let it last a little while; at least until she goes home." Then, as there was a sound of some one at the front door, she started up with a look of undisguised terror. "There is your uncle. Good night, dear Edith, and remember."
                  With hasty steps she escaped from the room and fled up stairs to her own boudoir, leaving Edith bewildered and distressed by what had just passed—more sorrowful than she ever recollected to have been before. As she left the room, she met her uncle in the hall, and, with relief, saw him go into the library and take up a book. She had an intuitive consciousness that from him her aunt could hope for no sympathy in her sorrow, whatever it was, and was glad that she could be sure of a period of undisturbed solitude.
                  Turning away, after leaving him thus safely disposed of, Edith entered the sitting room, which opened with folding doors into the parlor, where Vinton and Mabel still sat together. They were too absorbed to notice her entrance, and throwing herself into a large arm chair, she abandoned herself to puzzled speculation as to what could be the cause of her aunt's unexpected opposition to this apparently most fitting union. It had been a cherished scheme with her for months. She was tenderly attached to both her cousin and her friend. They seemed in every way suited to each other, and her kind heart was deeply grieved at the unhappiness she saw threatening them. She knew how strong was Vinton's love for his mother, and dreaded the struggle there would be between his duty to her, and his attachment to Mabel. From her knowledge of her aunt's character, she had but little hope of any change of sentiment on her part. Mrs. Rockford was generally good natured, indulgent to the young people about her, languidly acquiescent in her husband's wishes; but, for all that, her own views and prejudices were strong and unshaken. An immovable fidelity of purpose was concealed under her gentle manners, and Edith remembered one or two instances where she had carried her point by a certain quiet persistence which no one seemed to realize, except by its results. Realizing this, it was with a sigh of relief that she recalled her aunt's parting injunction. It enabled her to allow her friends yet a few more days of happiness, and in that time she could not but venture a hope that affairs might take a turn favorable to their wishes, although she felt that, dreading as she did the storm that threatened, her own enjoyment of their pleasure would be wholly destroyed. So she sat absorbed in painful reverie, till she was roused by a light touch on the shoulder.
                  "Why so pensive, lady fair?"
                  Looking up at the sweet, peaceful face that bent over her, and then glancing at the proud happiness that shone in Vinton's sparkling eyes, her own were so sad that the smiles faded from his lips, and he asked, in haste—
                  "What's the matter, Sunshine?"
                  "I am tired, I believe, Vinton," replied Edith, with an effort throwing off her pre-occupation.
                  "And I have thoughtlessly kept you up all this time," said Mabel, reproachfully. "I had no idea it was so late," she added, with a bright blush, as the clock on the mantel struck twelve.
                  "Very well then, atone for your misdeeds by vanishing at once;" and Edith, with a reassuring smile, led her friend away.
                  If the past hour had been a sad one to Edith, how infinitely agonizing had it been to Mrs. Rockford, struggling as one always will struggle against the first dreadful conviction of all the inevitable sorrow that follows an unexpected and overwhelming shock! Strange as it may seem, until the moment when Edith had suggested it to her she had never thought of the possibility of an attachment arising between Vinton and Mabel. She had looked upon them in such a totally different light. She was so glad, for reasons of her own, to see them together. She had been so secure in the absurdity, the impossibility of such an idea, that she was wholly unprepared for what might otherwise have seemed a very natural conclusion. In one instant she comprehended the horrors of her situation; with all her might she must oppose this mad, this horrible fancy, yet she never before had thwarted any wish of that son who was the idol of her heart; and now, must it be her hand that should shatter the first bright dream of his youth?
                  Unutterably wretched and bewildered, the unhappy woman, after locking herself securely within her boudoir, had thrown herself upon the couch, recklessly crushing her rich dress and elegant lace, as she tossed from side to side, goaded by the stings of an unavailing grief and remorse. Her luxuriant hair, escaped from its confinement, fell on her shoulders in a careless disarray that showed how fast the silver of age or anxiety was encroaching upon its raven beauty. Her face was pale and wrinkled, as it might be ten years hence. Her black eyes gleamed like burning coals; and through her parched and pallid lips her labored breath came in fitful gasps. After awhile, she started up as if inspired by a sudden purpose. With stealthy steps she glided to the doors, and gently tried them, to see that they were securely fastened. Satisfied of this, yet still with many a glance of apprehension, she took a key from its hiding place in the desk, and with it unlocked an inlaid cabinet that stood on the table. On opening, it appeared to contain only letters; but, pushing these aside with trembling fingers, she touched a secret spring, and a little drawer flew out. It contained only a folded paper. Reverently, and now wholly absorbed, she raised this and took from its hiding-place a thick curl of golden brown hair. Slowly, as she gazed upon it, her eyes filled with tears, she sank on her knees, pressing it with passionate fondness to her lips, and, so forgetful getful of all else, abandoned herself to a passion of weeping over the dear memorial of lost happiness and youth.
                  Such vigils as these leave strong deep marks on heart and face. The next morning, Mrs. Rockford took her accustomed place at the breakfast table, looking so wan and aged that all the family were startled. Her husband remarked the change with a shrewd surprise, running hastily over the incidents of yesterday, in a vain endeavor to discern the cause: finally noting the fact in his memory, to be explained at some future time. Vinton was eager in his inquiries, and not easily satisfied; begging his mother to allow him to send for a physician, and lingering near her, even, as she noticed with a sharp pang of exultation, to the neglect of Mabel. Edith alone forbore to distress her aunt with questions, only testifying, in a hundred little ways, her tender solicitude.
                  Yielding to her persuasions, Mrs. Rockford, when her husband and son were gone, consented to retire once more to her room, in a useless endeavor to find refreshment. The hours of solitude, which were not repose, were of little benefit, and she rose at night so weak and ill, that her elaborate toilette could not conceal the ravages of the past day of suffering. Despite her utmost efforts, and the rallying to her assistance of all her indomitable fortitude, she could not regain her usual spirits. She felt that her cheerfulness was gone forever. She had received a crushing blow, and she sometimes thought, almost joyfully, that perhaps it was her death wound. Life had been very dark to her for these many long years. Its only light had been the affection of her son; and if that were to be lost or alienated, what further care had she?
                  Edith, too, could not conceal that she was sad and dispirited. Thus a cloud seemed to have crept over the little circle, a short time ago so bright. Subtle and intangible, each one realized the nameless shadow, whose cause only one person could guess. Even Mabel and Vinton felt the depressing influence, which came like a warning, vague yet certain as that strange oppression that lurked in the heavy air of beautiful Pompeii, the premonition of the terrible disaster that overwhelmed its careless thousands in an awful destruction.
                  Yet Edith did not readily yield to the annihilation of her darling project, though she watched her aunt closely, noting with dismay and anxiety the hollow circles around her burning eyes that spoke of sleepless nights, and the feverish look of her parched lips. Hoping that, perhaps, her gentle words might be of some avail in dispelling this mysterious sadness, and advancing her cousin's wishes, she ventured one day to urge her to look upon his attachment in a different light. At first Mrs. Rockford listened patiently and acquiescently to her pleadings in Mabel's behalf, but when she went on to say that her happiness lay in this ill starred union, she became violently agitated, and so earnestly entreated Edith to forbear her useless importunities, that she felt there was no course left but acquiescence in the dark future she saw threatening those so dear to her.
                  Thus the days passed on. Mabel and Vinton, though conscious of a lurking sadness that sometimes obscured even the smiles of Sunshine, were yet so happy together that they often forgot everything but each other, like careless children sporting on the brink of a flower-wreathed precipice, their present enjoyment made them blind to the destruction that threatened so near, else they would surely have seen something more than illness in the searching glances and restless discontent of Mrs. Rockford's manner. It is true, no word of love had ever passed between them, yet they felt as confident in each other's affection as if the strongest oaths had bound them. Mabel, gentle and tender in her disposition, cared little for society, and was quite content to have Vinton for her unfailing escort, never thinking of exerting herself to attract the attention of the numerous other young men who visited at the house. It was taken for granted by all who saw them, that they were engaged, and it was well that Mrs. Rockford had the first intimation of the true state of affairs from Edith, as it enabled her to encounter the insinuations or congratulations of her friends with a well-bred denial that betrayed no emotion, if it failed to carry conviction. So, sadly and with an increasing foreboding, she watched the happy lovers, reading only too plainly in every look and word the strong affection that she felt must be destroyed, though its destruction should crush out their young lives.
               
               
                  CHAPTER VI.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Too much, Alexis, I have heard;
                              But you shall promise ne'er again
                              To breathe your vows, or speak your pain."
                           
                        
                        PRIOR.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           "I would that I were dreaming
                           Where the long green grass is streaming,
                           And the little flowers are gleaming.
                           O'er the gone! forever gone!"
                        
                     
                  
                  ON the Monday after New-Year's, the day before the long talked of fancy party, the proposed drive to High Bridge took place. There was no sleighing, but several days of hard frost had made the roads uncommonly good, and soon after one, on a bright, clear afternoon, the party started. It consisted of Mabel and Vinton, Edith, and Florance Fay. This last young gentleman was simperingly happy at his good fortune, which he fancied was owing to the preference of the fascinating beauty he adored; whereas, in reality, she would probably never have thought of him if it had not been for Vinton's suggestion, who, knowing that Lionel was too much occupied to leave his business at that early hour, had proposed the inoffensive but inevitable Fay.
                  "Do let me ask him, Edith," he said; "he has been terribly blue lately, and I dare say the drive will do him good. I don't know but it is a secret, but it is so funny, I must tell you what new cause of trouble he has. He want's to appear at the Stuyvesant Percy's in a Scotch dress which belongs to an uncle of his. It is very complete and handsome; but his life is a burden, because he is afraid he shall not get it, and it is now too late to order anything else."
                  "Very well, let him come, by all means; and I will do my best to enliven him," replied good-natured Edith. So he had joined them at lunch, and afterwards taken his place complacently with Edith, on the back seat of Vinton's pretty phæton, Mabel willingly accepting a position beside the driver.
                  
                  The day was mild for the season. The still air, pure and fresh, was just sufficiently bracing to be exhilarating; and as they left behind them the bustle and turmoil of the city, and came out into the pleasant country, even Edith felt as if a weight were lifted from her, and her spirits rose almost in their usual gayety. They bowled along over a capital road past the brown fields and bare trees that had yet a charm of their own; for what can be more graceful than the delicate tracery of the leafless branches of an oak or elm? How exquisitely against the wintry sky the slender boughs, even down to the minutest twigs, are drawn, feathery and faultless as fairie pencillings! In looking at these forest queens, one recalls the old tradition of Daphne. Are not the upraised limbs and waving brown sprigs suggestive of the suppliant arms and flowing hair of the flying nymph? Even the gnarled apple tree has a certain homely grace as if some household divinity, with tangled locks and large, strong hands, had found a chaste shelter in its rugged bark; and the mournful willow trails its drooping tresses as if it enshrined the weeping Artemesia.
                  Our friends reached High Bridge in very good season, and having admired and criticised the noble arches as they deserved, set forth on their homeward drive. Then, for the first time, Edith noticed a certain pensive depression in the manner of the faultless dandy beside her. In truth, his little heart was full of an avowal he had been long seeking an opportunity for making. To-day, Edith's kindness in selecting him for her escort flattered him into thinking the time for it had arrived. Anticipating this event, he had arrayed himself with unusual care; the blue and black scarf which encircled his slender throat was, he fancied, typical of his state of mind, fluctuating between hope and fear, though inclining largely to hope. Innocently unconscious of this, and supposing that his thoughts must have reverted to the longed for dress, Edith at last asked, frankly—
                  "What is the matter, Mr. Fay? You seem quite melancholy."
                  "Ah! Miss Edith," lisped the youth, faltering and blushing, now that he felt the awful moment had arrived," I do not know how to tell you."
                  "I should like to hear very well," said Edith, wholly at fault; "but I do not see that you have any cause for trouble."
                  "N—no, not exactly trouble; but I can't help worrying about it."
                  That is hardly worth while," replied Edith, desiring to save herself the bore of a long account of his dress, and thinking to give him a hint that she had already heard the story, "I am sure it will be all right."
                  "Then you know all about it?" cried Fay, looking relieved, and reflecting that it was very good of her to meet him half way, only he had always thought she was in love with him.
                  "Yes," replied the unconscious Edith, "and I really can see no reason why you should let such a matter pray upon your spirits."
                  "How kind you are, Miss Edith. I did not venture to hope that you took so much interest in me."
                  "Oh, as to that," laughed Edith, "it is a mutual affair; you know we all feel concerned in it."
                  "I am very happy, I am sure," stammered Fay, half afraid with all this help to go on, "I am very glad you are pleased."
                  "Oh, certainly, I think it is an excellent idea."
                  "And you think your family will all of them approve?"
                  "My family?" asked Edith, wondering what they had to do with the arrangements of his dress; "Why, I don't think they will trouble themselves about it."
                  "Oh, ah; yes, I know you are your own mistress, but I am sure I am delighted that they won't care. My mother has set her heart on it; so it will be all right. I always thought you loved me," and here feeling that the moment for action had arrived, he tried to slide his little gloved hand into her muff.
                  "Mr. Fay, what are you talking about?" exclaimed Edith, drawing back in utter amaze, and turning upon him her clear eyes with so searching a look that he turned scarlet, and had scarcely strength to falter—
                  "I thought you understood—I am sure you ought to know—that we were to—that is that you—I mean I—were—were to be engaged."
                  "Here is some strange mistake," said Edith, severely. "I believe I have never given you any reason to think I could entertain such an idle thought. If I have, I regret it extremely, as it is impossible."
                  "Oh, Miss Edith!" cried Fay, for the first time feeling a cold pang of despair, "I thought you knew what I meant; I am sure you said you thought it would be a good idea."
                  "I was speaking of your dress, Mr. Fay. It seems a strange misunderstanding. I hope we shall always be friends, but I assure you we can never be more. We will forget this conversation, if you please."
                  But although she said this, it was not so easily done. Florance Fay's face became a pale blue; his eyes grew dull. To do him justice, he had as much lukewarm love for Edith as he was capable of feeling, and now that he knew from her manner its utter hopelessness, he seemed to grow limp and wilted. He had not the nobility to rise above his embarrassing situation, but sat by her side in such sullen silence that Edith began to fear she had lost a friend; she never suspected that she had gained an enemy, and one who could be malignant too. Fay's strongest feeling was vanity, and this had been wounded in its tenderest point. The more he reflected on the past, the more injured he felt, and he sulked like a child who has lost its plaything. The cloudless sunset that faded away with a yellow metallic lustre like pale gold, was so pleasant to our friends on the front seat, that Vinton had allowed his horses to fall into a slow trot. Edith noticed this with annoyance, and finally, unable any longer to endure the stupidity of her pouting companion, she leaned forward, and with an urgent reminder of dinner and an appealing look, persuaded her cousin to put his ponies to their best speed.
                  Notwithstanding this, they did not reach home until after the usual dinner hour, and thus it happened that Mr. and Mrs. Rockford had enjoyed or endured an unusual tête-à-tête.
                  
                  There was no point upon which Mr. Rockford was more particular than punctuality in his meals. He was, therefore, by no means pleased, when, at six o'clock, he entered the parlor dressed with scrupulous neatness, and with the appetite of a man who has taken nothing since a light lunch at one, to find the dining-room doors still closed, and his wife alone in readiness for him. She, however, laid aside the book which she had been listlessly reading for the past half hour, and looked up with a well-bred expression of welcome. Mr. Rockford answered shortly, and, after consulting his watch, asked impatiently—
                  "What delays dinner?"
                  "The young people went out for a drive to High Bridge, and have not yet returned."
                  "Who do you mean by the young people?"
                  "Edith and Mabel, and Vinton and Florance Fay were the party."
                  "What time did they start?"
                  "Soon after one, I should think."
                  "They should be back by this time. How did they go?"
                  "In Vinton's pony phæton."
                  "Well, Claudia," said Mr. Rockford, seating himself near his wife, with an expression intended to be amiable, but which on his rigid countenance was like a sunbeam on a prison door, serving only to show its inflexible grimness, "I suppose we must excuse him for being late, if Miss Sandys is with him."
                  "She is a very agreeable girl," replied Mrs. Rockford, evasively.
                  "He seems greatly taken with her," proceeded her husband,"and I am pleased to see it. The match will have my entire approval. I suppose she will have a clear half a million."
                  "Indeed!"
                  "Yes. Old Sandys must have died quite wealthy, from all I hear. He has real estate in Boston that must be worth a good three hundred thousand. I consider it very fortunate that my son should have so proper a fancy. I take it for granted you are as much pleased as I am."
                  "As to that," replied Mrs. Rockford, with an indolent carelessness that completely concealed her real interest, "I admire Mabel very much, but I do not believe that she will ever be Vinton's wife."
                  "Why not?" demanded Mr. Rockford, in a tone of unmixed astonishment.
                  "Simply because I do not believe he ever thought of such a thing."
                  Mrs. Rockford dreaded the storm which she knew her words would arouse. Her heart grew sick and faint as she thought of all that was before her; but she knew the man with whom she had to deal too well, to permit him to perceive cieve her excitement, and she met the questioning glance of his cold steel-grey eyes with a calm look of well-assumed indifference.
                  "What do you mean, Claudia? It is impossible you can have failed to notice Vinton's very marked attentions to Miss Sandys."
                  "Oh, he is very young, you know. It is hardly worth while to attach any importance to them."
                  "But I do, I shall!" said Mr. Rockford, chafed at his wife's immobility. "Indeed it is idle to attempt to ignore their object; he has made no secret of his views."
                  "What!" cried Mrs. Rockford, startled for a moment out of her assumed calmness, "has he told you he wished to marry her?"
                  "Very nearly that," replied Mr. Rockford, delighted at the effect of his words. "I shall give a glad consent, and expect yours as a matter of course."
                  Mrs. Rockford made no reply. She had again assumed the languid attitude habitual to her, and sat idly playing with her fan.
                  "I presume my wishes will decide the matter," her husband proceeded, after a moment of cold scrutiny of that handsome, careworn face. "But as I know you have some influence with Vinton, I should like you to exercise it to forward my views."
                  She was too well-bred to neglect this direct appeal. "Really, if you have arranged the matter, I cannot see what I have to say about it."
                  "Then you will give the marriage your sanction?" asked Mr. Rockford, who had a secret dread of his wife's power over Vinton, and an instinctive suspicion of her opposition.
                  "I am sorry to say I cannot, but perhaps that will make very little difference," she answered gently.
                  "What! do you mean to say you will refuse your consent to so advantageous a connection?"
                  "I regret extremely that Vinton should have taken such a fancy; but since you are good enough to consult me, I will not conceal that I wholly disapprove of it."
                  Mr. Rockford's brow grew black as he demanded, "But you surely have no reason for openly opposing it?"
                  "None perhaps that I can assign," replied Mrs. Rockford, calmly; "but the connection is very repugnant to me, and I must do all in my power to prevent it."
                  Only too well Mr. Rockford knew what that power was, and astonished at the sudden determination of his usually compliant wife to act against a scheme which for some time had been a favorite one, he grew angry and impatient.
                  "I am amazed and indignant at you, Claudia, for this strange whim. I thought you had Vinton's interest too much at heart not to be pleased at a match so desirable in every way—wealth, position, an amiable young woman. I repeat it, I am indignant at you for such an absurd notion."
                  No answer from the tranquil lady at his side, and he went on, rising and standing before her in great vexation, "I insist upon your at once altering your views, or explaining your motives for this extraordinary freak."
                  "I have no reason to assign," said Mrs. Rockford, gently, though in reality she was alarmed and distressed at the painful position in which she was placed.
                  "No reason? Then, Claudia, as you are a woman of ordinary sense, I presume you will acknowledge the folly of your dislike to the marriage, and acquiesce in it at once."
                  "That I can never do," she said, faintly yet firmly.
                  "What willful obstinacy is this?" exclaimed Mr. Rockford, losing all patience, and turning upon her in great irritation. "For an inexplicable whim are you going to destroy the happiness of the son whom you profess to love so much?" His wife winced; she felt to her inmost heart only too strongly the force of the taunt. He saw that he had at last roused her, and added malignantly, "Or are you actuated by the old grudge against the daughter of George Sandys?"
                  This was too much. Mrs. Rockford started up, her eyes flashing indignantly, her voice trembling with suppressed passion—
                  "Stop, sir!" she cried, vehemently. "That subject is long buried between us. I have made you an obedient wife through all these many years. Now that I cannot in conscience agree in your views, I have a right to be free from insult."
                  "I meant no insult," said Mr. Rockford, sullenly, some-what awed by his stately wife.
                  "Let it pass, then," she replied, with proud dignity. "I regret that I cannot approve your plans. I shall make no direct opposition to them at present, but I will make no promise for the future."
                  At this moment there was a sound of gay young voices in the hall. Mr. Rockford threw himself into a chair, with an air of disappointment, if not of defeat.
                  "There they come. Some other time we will discuss this again. Until then I leave it to you to tell Vinton that you disapprove his choice. It has my hearty approbation."
               
               
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Mais moi, si je vous perde, n 'en ai-je pas fini avec l' esperance?"
                        
                        ABAELARD ET HELOISE.
                     
                  
                  MR. STUYVESANT PERCY'S long drawing-room was furnished more than usually in that auction shop style which of late has become so much the mode among a certain set of nouveau riche. There were chairs of blue satin with red roses, and chairs of red satin with blue roses, sofas of green and yellow and sofas of grey and pink, and so on through the colors of the spectrum, so that you might have fancied their upholsterer had stolen a bit of rainbow to scatter at random over his wares. On the walls there were paintings of the same florid style, paintings not pictures, though dignified by being represented as "copies from the old masters;" yet certainly not to be recommended either for taste or propriety. Something of this fondness for brilliant colors could be seen in the costume of the master and mistress of the house, on the evening of the ball. They were dressed à la Louis XV. Mrs. Stuyvesant Percy who had been pretty once but was now only faded and fretful-looking, wore a robe of violet velvet, which with the lace she boasted to her friends cost one thousand dollars, without the diamonds, which certainly were not very handsome. She was in a flutter of nervous agitation, and spent the last few moments before the first visitors arrived, in dusting off the powder which in her agitation she scattered from her elaborately dressed head over the "gorgeous" furniture. Mr. Stuyvesant Percy, a small and rather insignificant looking man, had a hopelessly common look in his elaborately embroidered green coat, and the sword which would get between his legs despite his desperate efforts to be dignified.
                  The rooms filled fast, the hearts of the host and hostess were made happy by the highly aristocratic set they soon saw assembled around them. Mrs. Stuyvesant Percy's excitement became wholly pleasurable and she drawled out a hundred commonplaces with an air of most conceited gratification. Among the earliest arrivals came Florence Fay, who really looked very well in the longed-for Scotch dress, except that his legs were rather thin for the prominent position they occupied. For some time he waited on the fair hostess, who having been assured that he was undoubtedly come il faut was willing to allow him to appear as her attendant. He was still standing at her side, when a murmur of admiration ran through the crowd that involuntarily opened to the right and left to permit the entrance of Edith and Fanny Grantham.
                  They advanced hand in hand twin sisters of day and night, and lovely as a poet's dream.
                  Edith, as Sunshine, was robed in a cloud of pale yellow tulle, like a soft light; it was covered with golden rays and dashes, looped up with golden ribbon, and confined around her slender waist with a golden band clasped with Topaz, there were Topaz too in a chain around her neck, in her ear-rings, and in the bracelets on her round arms. But the crown of her beauty was in her splendid hair. After much persuasion her friends had induced her to wear it unbound. Her brow was encircled by a Tiara of Topaz, and beneath this her flowing tresses fell in shining curls, like a halo of glory, over her white shoulders and far down her floating skirt. Her sunny eyes sparkled with pleasure, her cheeks glowed with the rosy flush of health. She was indeed lovely as the incarnation of radiant laughing Sunshine.
                  Fanny, as Starlight, wore a thin black dress, that fell around her like a mist of darkness. It was spangled with silver stars, her girdle was silver clasped with diamonds, her earrings and necklace were brilliant with the lustre of the same sparkling stones, while on her brow flashed a star of magnificent diamonds, that added a regal air to her lively, dashing, beauty.
                  Their appearance produced an immediate commotion in their respective camps of admirers, and they were carried off by two happy partners as soon as they had saluted Mrs. Stuyvesant Percy. In the plenitude of her self-satisfaction she gave them a patronizing recognition, that merely made Edith laugh, while Fanny vowed in an indignant aside to her friend that she would not again help a "snob."
                  Florence Fay had grown ashy pale when his eyes encounted tered Edith's. She greeted him with a courteous smile; he had not the dignity to return it, but bowed with such sullen coldness that the shrewd eyes of Adrienne Clifford, who was standing near, read instantly his secret. She had come just before with Mrs. Grantham, but at her entrance no one had looked up admiringly, and there was the bitterest envy and hatred in her bad breast towards the two fair girls who followed her. She had taken a good deal of pains too with her toilette that night, but the result was by no means pleasing. She wore a Spanish dress, made sufficiently short to display a very neat foot and ankle, and this added to the rouge that stained her sallow cheeks, gave her a meretricious appearance that was exceedingly disagreeable. As Edith turned away, she said with the slightest possible shade of sarcasm:
                  "What fine hair Miss Rockford has!"
                  "I don't like the color," said Fay, maliciously, as he drew near her in the crowd.
                  "Indeed! I thought you were one of her most devoted admirers," said Adrienne.
                  "Oh no. I like her very well, you knew, but then she is not exactly my style."
                  "You don't admire 'les cheveux rouges?'"
                  "What?" asked Fay, to whom she might as well have spoken Sanscrit.
                  "Red hair," explained Adrienne.
                  "No; they say it shows a bad temper, don't they?"
                  "I believe so. But you need not try to deceive me. I am certain that you are a lover of hers."
                  "Not in the least, I assure you," protested Fay eagerly, and blushing scarlet. "She is very well to talk to and all that sort of thing, but not the girl to marry, you know"
                  These vehement lies only served to convince Adrienne of the true state of affairs, but she affected to be satisfied, and said, with the greatest appearance of earnestness,
                  "I am so glad to have you say so! She is a heartless coquette, I am afraid, not half good enough for any one whom I am sure has so much sensibility as I read in those sweet blue eyes."
                  The washey orbs in question grew bright with pleasure at the compliment; here was some one who appreciated him, and he simpered with such evident delight that Adrienne, having easily discovered his weakness, went on flattering his dress, his hair, and various other real or imaginary charms, until he was in such blushing good humor that he was ready to do anything for her. Then she returned once more to Edith. She had of late felt a little insecure of her position, and was glad to make a new ally. She found in Fay a very ready one, and before long he was firmly enlisted in her service.
                  Meanwhile the object of these machinations was innocently happy, as a light-hearted young belle has a right to be, when surrounded by all that honorable and respectful homage which is so pleasant during the short season when she can be the ball-room queen.
                  Lionel was there, looking very well in a Continental uniform that had descended to him from his grandfather, who had served with distinction during the Revolution. Edith had, according to promise, danced the first time with him, but after that he was separated from her by the numerous other claimants for her hand, so that it was not until supper time that he was able to rejoin her. An attempt to enter the crowded room, where the dining table was spread, having proved a failure, Lionel suggested that she should wait outside while he did his best to supply her wants. Edith readily agreed, and they went into the small parlor that the Stuyvesant Percys dignified with the title of library. It was, however, much the cosiest room in the house, with neat book-cases and some very pretty pictures. It was pleasanter at night than by day, for at the upper end the place of a window was usurped by a large glass door opening into a boudoir or rather alcove, where Mr. Stuyvesant Percy kept his law books. A low couch ran quite around it, except across the large window which admitted but a dim light to the inner apartment. On the sofa in the library Edith and Lionel found Fanny Grantham with Ben Fordyce standing in front of her, in high glee, his pilgrim cloak thrown back, and his scollop-shelled hat off. He had already proved more fortunate than his friend, for he held a champagne bottle in one hand and with the other was giving her a drink out of the gourd tied to the end of his staff. At the entrance of Edith and her attendant there was great enthusiasm.
                  "Capital!" cried Fanny; "what a parti caré. Here, Sunshine, you shall have part of my sofa, and now 'Pilgrim' and 'Stranger,' take yourselves off and get us some oysters. I'm famished."
                  As the young men disappeared Edith said, "I see you have got your Hopeful or Faithful, whichever you call him. But where is the Giant Despair?"
                  "Oh, he did not want to come."
                  "Why not?"
                  "How should I know?" asked Fanny, trying to look innocent.
                  "Oh! I see you've shipped him. I'm so glad!"
                  "Nonsense! You don't know any such thing. It's a pity he's not here now though, for he says of all things he likes see 'Loveliness feed.'"
                  "Profane!" laughed Edith.
                  "Yes, that was the worst about him. He would be a little impertinent sometimes. But, by the way, what have you done to the redoubtable Fay, for he looks like an elongated sigh."
                  "Nothing, only he is odd and variable, you know."
                  "Oh, that's it, is it? Well, it's no great matter, I suppose. I always feel as if he must have been born, as Edmond About says, under the influence of the Milky Way. There is too much of the milk and water about him to be much affected by such a disappointment. I fancy, though, he may be soured."
                  During this conversation, the two young ladies had been too much occupied to observe a dark shadow which once or twice stole across the curtain that hung over the glass door of the alcove, and then, after a moment of motionless repose, flitted away again. They were interrupted in their discussion of Fay, by the return of their attendants, bringing refreshments, and so the supper went on with much merry talk; until Ben, who had finished his oysters, again filled up his gourd, but this time to drink himself.
                  "What a capital flavor the Champagne has from this," he exclaimed.
                  "I did not notice it," said Fanny.
                  "I dare say not, since I owe its sweetness to you."
                  This was said half aside, and Fanny, to cover her confusion, took up the empty plate and turned to Edith. "See here, Sunshine, just look at this. Percy has put on the Northumberland arms, supporters, and all! One would think it was the veritable duke himself. Really he should have had more sense."—
                  "It's very pretty China though," replied Edith.
                  "Real Sevres—cost five dollars a plate. Mrs. Percy told me so in confidence—that I knew she intended to have broken."
                  By this time several persons were in the room; among them, Adrienne Clifford, with an evil light of triumph in her eyes. She came up to Edith, complimenting her on her dress with such silvery softness, that Lionel felt an innocent pleasure in hearing her admire so much the lady he loved. Then leaving them abruptly, and in a manner that could not fail to attract their attention, she crossed the room to the alcove, and in a very peculiar manner looked behind the curtain.
                  "What do you see, coz?" asked Fanny, as they all rose.
                  "Some one whom I am sure Miss Rockford would like to see," replied Adrienne, looking back.
                  Edith had taken Lionel's arm again, and was just turning away, but these words arrested her.
                  "Did you ask for me, Miss Clifford?"
                  "Yes; here is an old friend would like to speak to you."
                  "Who is it?"
                  "Won't you come and see?"
                  Edith hesitated. It was probably only one of her companions who wished to see her. "Will you come too?" she said to Lionel, feeling a sort of protection in having him by her, in case of any trick.
                  "Yes, certainly;" and so, retaining his arm, she advanced to the glass door. Adrienne stood back.
                  "Go on, Miss Rockford; you will be very glad."
                  And Edith left Lionel, and with trembling, curious hesitation, stepped into the alcove. A man in the costume of a Red Cross Knight sprang forward to meet her with outstretched hands. Uttering a low cry, as those gleaming black eyes met hers, Edith, pale and agitated, sank out of sight; and with one sharp, sudden pang, Lionel felt that his Sunshine was gone. Turning away, with face white as if all hope had fled, his wild, questioning glance fell on Adrienne.
                  "It's Percival Denbigh," she said carelessly. "He is engaged to her."
                  For a moment Lionel stood as if rooted to the spot. Edith and her companion had disappeared within the alcove, but he still gazed after her with eager, desperate bewilderment, until Adrienne, sliding her hand within his arm, said, in silveriest tones—
                  "You had best not wait for her, Lionel; I do not think she will be in any hurry to part with him. Come, let us leave them a little time to themselves; it is so long since they met."
                  She led the passive young man away to a seat in the empty hall. For some moments he did not speak. He was so inexpressibly shocked and disappointed, that he had no power to rally or recover. All his old suspicions of Denbigh rushed to his recollection with convincing force; and when at last he turned his sad, agitated face towards Adrienne, she saw that half her task was already accomplished.
                  "So she is really engaged," he said, in a husky voice.
                  "Yes; she has been ever since last fall."
                  "You are sure?" he asked, not with hope, but as if for added certainty.
                  "Certainly I am. Denbigh is a very old friend of mine, and he told me all about it."
                  "But I never heard of it."
                  "Of course not," returned Adrienne; "you are the last person she would wish to have know it. She likes flirtation too well. Why, it was kept secret because she was anxious for another gay winter, and insisted that no one, not even Vinton, should know it; she is so fond of admiration, you know."
                  "I could not have believed it," groaned poor Lionel.
                  "I am very sorry, dear Lionel, that you feel badly about it. You know I warned you that she was deceiving you some time ago. I have known this a long while, although I have not been at liberty to speak of it; but I have sometimes thought her a little heartless, when I have seen her flirting with you and Fay, while all the time I knew she was corresponding with Denbigh, who, I believe she really does love, after all."
                  
                  "And yet she seemed so truthful! Oh! I could not have believed it if I had not seen it."
                  "You must try not to mind about it, Lionel. After all, she was only thoughtless, and perhaps a little indiscreet," said Adrienne, pretending to palliate her conduct; in reality using expressions that she knew would weigh heaviest against her in the estimation of this upright young man.
                  "It was a mere accident that you discovered the true state of affairs; but now that you have found it out, you must not speak of it. This engagement is your secret now, and you must keep it."
                  "I will not betray her," replied Lionel, sternly. "But, oh, my God! to think how I have been deceived!"
                  "You must not be too hard on her, Lionel. She is very fond of society, you know, and I am afraid something of a coquette; but, after all, she will no doubt make Denbigh a good wife."
                  This view was anything but consoling, and Lionel relapsed into moody silence. Adrienne allowed his own bitter thoughts to take their course for a few moments, and then resumed her hypocritical pleadings.
                  "I hope you will not allow this to make any difference in your conduct towards her."
                  "I will never see her if I can avoid it," Lionel cried, and then at the rush of recollection, he added, "I could not bear it, for oh! Adrienne, I have loved her so much!"
                  "My dear Lionel, how deeply I feel for you," said Adrienne, softly, and quite regardless of the curious eye of distant observers, she laid her hand on his. "Let me console and comfort you."
                  "Thank you," replied Lionel, a little roughly and starting up. "I am going; I cannot stay here any longer."
                  "Very well," and Adrienne rose, too. "I am tired; suppose you take me home, and we will send back the carriage for aunt."
                  Lionel passively agreed, though he would have preferred to be alone. He had not come with Edith, and was therefore under no obligations to go home with her; he thought of this with relief, he was so anxious to escape without seeing her again, from this scene grown hateful in the last half hour. He could never endure to view her happiness with that man whom from the first he had instinctively detested Full of all bitter thoughts he stood awaiting Adrienne's appearance, when he was suddenly joined by Fay. This new won ally of Adrienne's had already fulfilled her instructions by whispering to half the room that Miss Rockford's lover had returned. It was actually a salvo to his own wounded vanity to think that as Adrienne had said she had been a long time engaged to Mr. Denbigh, it accounted for his own rebuff, and he returned to his original belief that but for this she would surely have preferred him. He had followed up Lionel to see how he took his disappointment, so while nothing with malicious delight his look of suppressed anguish, he asked with apparent surprise,
                  "What! are you off already, Mr. Rohan?"
                  "Yes," replied Lionel, rallying with an effort. "Miss Clifford is tired, and I have the pleasure of seeing her home."
                  "I thought you came with Edith Rockford," persisted Fay.
                  "Miss Rockford," answered Lionel, with marked emphasis on the title, "was kind enough to permit me to join her here, but I did not come with her."
                  "Oh, I dare say she is well enough without you," sneered Fay with a sickly laugh. "I suppose she cares for none of us since Denbigh's arrival. What a heartless coquette she is!"
                  "So he too knows!" thought Lionel; but he would not thus hear her lightly spoken of. "Mr. Fay," he said, haughtily, "if you please, we will not discuss the young lady's character," and with a cold bow he turned away to join Adrienne.
                  He forced himself to maintain a certain degree of calmness during the drive, but the voluble talk of his pleased companion sounded on deaf ears. He would not accept her urgent entreaties to come in, but bidding her good-night, hurried away with rapid strides to his own rooms, where he could be alone with his misery.
                  He could not doubt the truth of what he had heard, when he recalled what seemed to him that agitated, rapturous meeting between Edith and Denbigh. She who was the joy of his heart was then quite false or fickle, or had his vanity blinded him and caused him to mistake mere friendship for preference? Yet when he remembered a thousand words and looks, her gentle blush at his return, her warm welcomes, her sweet smiles, he could only explain all by reluctantly admitting that Adrienne's insinuation was true, and she had from mere coquetry trifled with his best affections. Never till now had he known how strong was his love for her. It had gone on increasing through the past months of happiness, until it had absorbed all his thoughts and wishes. Every aspiration looked towards winning her, every hope had clustered around her fair image. She had been, indeed, the sunshine of his life, and now that it was lost, existence was dark. So through the hours of silence and solitude he struggled with his sorrow, as Jacob wrestled with the angel that after all was sent only to prove him.

                  WHEN Edith so suddenly saw that strange figure and recognized the handsome dark face that had never wholly ceased to haunt her dreams, her first sensation was unqualified terror. The singularity of the meeting, its entire unexpectedness, Denbigh's odd dress, and the eager, almost fierce, impetuosity with which he dragged her onto the sofa beside him, seemed to bewilder her so entirely that for a moment she had no strength to struggle against the fascination that had already been so nearly fatal to her peace.
                  "My own darling Edith! at last I have you once more! Ah! you do not know how I have sighed for this moment, my dearest love!" Still retaining her hands, he went on pouring out the passionate declaration of his joy, while she sat pale and trembling, gazing at him with wild, startled eyes, absolutely unable to answer him, until drawing nearer, he asked, "And now my probation is over, is it not? and we shall be so happy together!"
                  "Oh let me go! let me go!" gasped Edith at last, drawing back from him, and trying to free her hands.
                  "Ah, I have frightened you with my madness," said Denbigh, partly releasing her hands, and by a strong effort controlling his excitement. "I should have been less abrupt, but I wished to see you so much!"
                  "You have certainly startled me," faltered Edith, recovering somewhat from her first alarm, and rallying all her dignity to her support in this trying situation. "I would rather have had some warning of your presence, it was scarcely kind in Miss Clifford to give me such a surprise."
                  
                  "It was all my fault," pleaded Denbigh. "I could not wait till to-morrow to see you; she got me a card for this ball, and I could not but come then. I dared not trust myself to meet you before strangers. You will forgive me, will you not, dear Edith? it was all for your sake."
                  "Mr. Denbigh," began Edith firmly, "I think you forget that you have no right to use such expressions towards me."
                  "No right? does not my long devotion confer a right? after all that you once said," he demanded fiercely. He had waited so long for this moment, his passion had so grown in the past months that it was difficult for him, when in surprise he saw her coldness and began to doubt his power to restrain himself from seizing her and forcing her to listen to his suit. Perhaps it was fortunate for her that they were not wholly alone, that the nearness of others obliged him to be courteous.
                  "I have said nothing which can authorize your language, Mr. Denbigh," said Edith, still half afraid of those glowing black eyes. "I have given no promise."
                  "No promise!" interrupted Denbigh. "Have you then no memory? Do you not recollect our last interview and all that it implied?" Then as he watched the crimson blush his words called up, he went on with assumed indignation, "No, I cannot think you are so heartless as to have deceived me with false hopes while all this time I have been living only for you!"
                  "I am very sorry if you have misinterpreted my words," began Edith, and again Denbigh burst forth—
                  "Very sorry! is that all you can say to one who adores you?"
                  "It is all, Mr. Denbigh." Edith tried to make her voice steady, but she still trembled at the wild vehemence of his tone.
                  Denbigh was desperate, and for a moment all caution was lost. "Edith Rockford," he cried, "you shall not say so, you are mine by all that is sacred! you loved me once, and you shall not break my heart now."
                  He had gone too far. Edith although greatly distressed, was fairly aroused, and rose exclaiming haughtily:
                  "Mr. Denbigh, you have made some strange mistake. I never recognized any engagement between us, and I consider your rudeness wholly unjustifiable."
                  Already Denbigh repented his haste, and gazed upon her with deepening admiration, as she stood before him majestic as a young queen, crowned with that sparkling Tiara. Her fair bosom heaving with suppressed emotion, her sweet lips curling with defiance, and her golden hair shining like the aureole of a saint. He had never given her credit for so much courage, she had never been so beautiful before, and now that he feared to lose her, he was ten-fold more anxious than ever to secure her for his own. It was evident that he could not frighten her into compliance, and for once in his life fairly quelled by that divinity that shields an innocent maiden, he attempted no further violence, but threw himself on what he knew to be the vulnerable point of her gentle character. Burying his face in his hands, he almost sobbed out,
                  "Forgive me! forgive me! You who are so lovely ought to know that I cannot easily give up the hope I have so long cherished. Oh! Miss Edith, do not go. I will offend you no more. Only tell me that you do not hate me, only let me sometimes see you!"
                  This appeal was too touching to be resisted. Edith's weakness was her amiability, she hesitated a moment, and did not hasten away—"I regret that I have given you pain," she said gently.
                  "May you never know what I suffer!" he replied hoarsely, and raising his head he looked at her with such eyes of despair, such pale cheeks and haggard brow, that she could not doubt the sincerity of his words. "Stay just a little while, Miss Edith," he pleaded. "Let me at least look at you. I have been bold and presumptuous, no doubt, to build up such hopes on your kindness. But do not part from me in anger."
                  Edith's tender heart smote her, she knew that she had given him some encouragement, she knew that she had once yielded to the glamor of his fascinating manners, and but that she remembered the honest affection that looked out of Lionel's blue eyes she might yet have entertained that pity which is akin to love. She felt that she had no right to resent too severely the passion which her coquetry had perhaps fostered, and was truly sorry for the unhappiness she had caused, she was anxious as far as she could to relieve it.
                  "I have been here too long," she said, refusing the seat he offered by moving to a respectful distance. "But you know I shall be happy to see you at my uncle's. I assure you I am deeply grieved that my thoughtlessness should have caused you any disappointment, and now let us forget what is past and once more be friends."
                  "You are too good," said Denbigh; and, stooping, he lightly touched his lips to the gloved hand that was near him. "Henceforth you need not fear me. I will not offend you again, since you are so kind as to allow me to retain the sacred name of friend."
                  Innocent Edith never saw the sparkle of triumph in those bad eyes, nor guessed the dark desires that were whirling through that busy brain.
                  "I believe you," she said, simply. "Shall we go now?" And so together they left the alcove, and she never heeded nor noticed the whispers that ran through the room at her appearance with this handsome stranger, after an absence that had really been of considerable length. It was already late, and she at once joined Mrs. Grantham. Denbigh respectfully asked permission to attend her to the carriage.
                  "I believe I promised Mr. Rohan," said Edith, with a bright blush.
                  "Oh, never mind him, my dear," said Mrs. Grantham, "he took Adrienne home some time ago."
                  Denbigh learned this with concealed delight. He knew then that his ally had well fulfilled her promise, and he mentally resolved on a proportionate reward. Edith was a little surprised, and a good deal disappointed; but she explained his absence readily by the supposition that his kind-heartedness led him to wait on the invalid, and so very quietly allowed Denbigh to hand her to her place. Thus the last thing she beheld, as she looked into the darkness, was the regard of those gleaming eyes, that burned like coals of fire, and might have been as fatal as Medusa's glances.
                  The short drive was soon over, and Sunshine laid aside her crown with a sigh of relief at the thought that she had broken the slender chain that linked her to one whom she did not love. So worn out with the fatigue and excitement of the evening, she sank into slumbers as rosy as that last sleep of Ariadne, before she awoke to know that Theseus was gone.
                  The next morning, while Mabel was presiding over Edith's late breakfast, listening the while to her animated account of the gayeties of the ball, a letter was handed her from home. Reading it hastily, she looked up with a slight exclamation of disappointment—
                  "What is it?" asked Edith.
                  "I must go home at once," responded Mabel, trying to look cheerful.
                  "Oh, no, you must not. What makes you say so?"
                  "Cousin Mary has been suddenly called away by the illness of her sister, and mamma is all alone. She tells me not to hurry, but I know that she ought not to be left in such solitude."
                  "She has Mr. Haughton," suggested Edith.
                  "Yes, he will be very kind. But do not urge me, dear Edith; you see I ought to go. I will not deny that it is a disappointment to have my visit so shortened; but it cannot be helped."
                  "At least you will stay till to-morrow."
                  "Yes, I will write now to say that I am coming, and so take the noon train to-morrow."
                  The news of this sudden decision of Mabel's was received with various emotions by the different members of the family. Mrs. Rockford heard it with such a sensation of relief as she could scarcely conceal under her wellbred expressions of regret. Her husband, guessing her thoughts, was resolved to checkmate her, and make this a reason for hastening Vinton in his courtship of the desirable young heiress. And Vinton himself was half sorry, half pleased. He regretted the loss of the constant companionship of his beloved friend; but he thought with a thrill of quiet joy that her return to her own home would release him from his self-imposed obligation not to embarrass her by an avowal, while under the shield of his hospitality.
                  The next evening passed pleasantly to all but Edith. Every ring at the bell made her look up with a bright smile, expecting Lionel; but each time she was disappointed. Their visitors were only McDuff, Mr. Benton, and, finally, quite late, Denbigh. He was most careful of his words and actions, profoundly yet humbly admiring of Edith, and unexceptionably exceptionably deferential to Mrs. Rockford; so that even Vinton could find no fault with him. Edith fully appreciated the sad reserve of his manner, and did her best to be amiably interested in whatever he said.
                  The next morning Vinton lingered at home. The train left for Herford at twelve o'clock, and he was resolved not to go down town until he had seen Mabel off. He had a short quiet chat with her before she went to make the final preparations for departure, and just afterwards was surprised by a summons to the library. To his increased astonishment he there found Mr. Rockford, who had remained at home beyond his usual hour for going down town, for the express purpose of suggesting to Vinton that he should not only accompany Mabel home but remain in Herford a few days if he were invited to do so.
                  "Delays are dangerous," he said sententiously, in answer to the young man's look of delight. "I advise you to secure the young lady at once."
                  "You make me very happy, my dear sir," replied Vinton. "I had not ventured to ask your permission to absent myself from my studies so soon again. But you have anticipated my wishes."
                  "Very well, then, you have just time to make your arrangements for going. You may thank me when you return successful."
                  It was already late, as Mr Rockford hinted, and Vinton had just time to collect together his small baggage before the carriage came, and so could not announce his departure to his mother till he stood bag in hand beside his fair companion. Mrs. Rockford looked up alarmed, but he could only bid her a hasty farewell. This was no time for remonstrances, and he atributed the suppressed start, and her wistful entreaty not to be gone long, simply to her affectionate anxiety.
                  Mabel was delighted with this arrangement, and so innocently assured Vinton of her pleasure, that he too was supremely happy. Their ride home in the cars was most agreeable. It was a clear winter day, and the gray country lay soft as a crayon landscape, with its tints of brown and russet. Here and there they caught glimpses of the sea, that sparkled in the pale sunshine, or dashing through thriving little towns, they were whirled over bridges that spanned the still waters of frozen streams, where gay skaters were dashing away on the shining ice. And so at last they reached Herford, and this was the last of Mabel's delightful visit in New York; a period to which long afterwards both she and Vinton looked back, as did Abelard and Eloise to that innocent time before they had whispered that love which was a crime.
                  Mrs. Sandys met with undisguised satisfaction the two bright young faces. She had longed for her daughter's return, and it was an added pleasure to see her looking so well, and accompanied by the radiant Vinton. She made him very welcome, gave them a charming late dinner, and then discreetly went out for a walk, leaving them to enjoy a tête-à-tête in the library
                  It was very cosy there, sitting side by side on the same sofa. The yellow rays of the setting sun streamed in under the crimson curtains. A cheerful fire filled all the room with a soft glow. The stillness and cold outside made all within seem bright and warm. In that pleasant room, shut out from all the world, it was easy to whisper of love and dream of the calm future of requited affection.
                  There was nothing impetuous in Vinton's avowal. During one of those pauses which had of late grown very frequent between them, he sat for a while contemplating at first the delicate loveliness of Mabel's profile, as she leaned back on the sofa cushions. Her eyes were downcast; the warm light gave a faint rosy hue to her round cheek, a darker shade to her fair hair Then his eyes wandered to the exquisite hand that lay white as a lily on the crimson sofa, the blue veins pencilled under the transparent skin, the taper fingers curved in the attitude of profound repose. After a moment he gently clasped it in his own strong fingers. At that touch Mabel looked up with a quiet smile, and then he said tenderly—
                  "Dearest Mabel, you must know how long I have loved you. Then may I venture to hope that you will trust yourself to me for life?"
                  Just the faintest blush tinged the sweet face, but the clear eyes met his without faltering or hesitation—"I think I have always loved you, Vinton. I think I shall be happier with you than with any one I have ever seen."
                  "My own sweet Mabel! thank you! thank you for that assurance! How bright you have made my future!" He pressed the hand which he held to his lips tenderly and respectfully, and then went on—"I cannot describe to you how strong is my affection. I think I have loved you from the first moment that we met, almost before that if it were possible. Indeed I cannot realize that you were ever less dear to me than you are now."
                  "It is strange," replied Mabel, truthfully, "I too have had the same feeling. I never had a brother, but it seems to me as if I should have wished him to be like you. I am sure I should not have loved him better than I do you."
                  As she spoke the last bright rays of the setting sun illumined her fair, calm face, as if with a parting blessing. Vinton regarded her as if it were sacrilege to break that tranquility by words of stronger passion, and in the pause the faint sigh of the wind that was rising outside sounded like a warning. At last he broke the charm.
                  "But, darling, you know I must be more to you than a brother. Some day I shall claim a dearer title than that."
                  At that instant there was a sharp crash, and a sudden blow struck them apart. Mabel drew back with a cry of terror, and Vinton started away alarmed. But in a moment he comprehended what had happened. The portrait of Mr. Sandys had loosed from its support, and sliding from the mantle, fallen heavily to the floor. Its weight still rested on Vinton and he leaned it against the wall before he went to Mabel. She, too, had recovered somewhat by this time, and opened the door into the lighted hall.
                  "Are you hurt, dear?"
                  "No," she answered faintly, "only startled."
                  He was surprised to see how pale she had grown. "It was your father's picture," he exclaimed.
                  "Yes, I see; it was not hung very strongly, I remember. But I am glad to have some light."
                  The servant appeared at this moment bringing candles, and they hastened to examine the picture: it had sustained no injury, the staple had merely drawn out of its place, and they were still discussing how it could have happened, when Mrs. Sandys returned. After her first surprise at the accident was over, she remarked with motherly solicitude Mabel's white cheeks, but when she demanded an explanation she only replied by a faint smile, and escaping to her own room, left Vinton to tell her all that had passed. Mrs. Sandys was greatly gratified by his manly declaration of his attachment to her daughter, and gave her most hearty consent to a union she had for some time anticipated. Going afterwards to Mabel and shedding a few glad tears over her, as mothers will on such occasions, she brought her back to her lover quite radiant with pleasure as she thought of the bright future she fancied in store for them. Indeed, perhaps, she was the happiest of the three that evening, for Mabel could not shake off the unaccountable depression of spirits that had seized upon her since her fright, and Vinton was conscious of a nameless foreboding that oppressed him, he scarcely knew why. When they parted for the night it was in Mrs. Sandys' presence so that he could only raise her hand to his lips for that last good night.
                  Naturally after all that had happened he was restless in his slumber; and strangely enough, it was not joy that kept him awake listening to the long wail of the fitful wind. He had at last drawn from the woman he loved an avowal that was to make him happy, and yet he found it impossible to look forward to the future with any certainty of hope. Had Mabel's nervousness affected him or was there really an oppression in the very air, that was heavy with the brewing storm? When at last he fell asleep, he was haunted by strange dreams, in which the sad eyes of Mr. Sandys, looking out from a dark cloud seemed to warn him back from Mabel, who fading away with averted face grew even thinner and paler until she vanished altogether from his longing gaze.
                  After such a night it was no wonder that he rose early intending to seek refreshment in a walk. It was still the grey dawn of the late winter morning, but the storm had come—a drizzling rain was falling, and going down stairs and looking out at the muddy street and the dripping trees, he turned back disheartened. It was not long before Mrs. Sandys, joined him in the parlor, but she came alone to say that Mabel had so violent a headache, that she considered her quite unable to rise. Still further disappointed at this, Vinton resolved to return by the next train to the city, coming back on Saturday to spend Sunday with his friends. This determination left him no time to call on Mr. Haughton as he had intended. He was obliged to leave the message for him with Mrs. Sandys, as well as every kind assurance for Mabel. Her mother was full of confiding affection towards Vinton ton, as her daughter's lover, assuring him that she would write to him in case Mabel were worse, and bidding him good-bye at last with a hearty affection that was most gratifying.
                  Somewhat reassured and comforted by this, Vinton left Herford with a lighter heart than he had carried since he rose, but by no means so joyous as twenty-four hours ago he would have believed he should be when the accepted lover of Mabel Sandys. The storm increased as the morning wore on, and the cars seemed going through endless miles of mist, out of which only faint glimpses could be caught of dreary fields and drenched towns. At last, after a strange slacking of speed for some time, there was a sudden halt; an accident had occurred to some part of the engine, there was no danger, only a tedious delay. Hour after hour the sullen rain fell splash, splash in the mud around the track, or trickled drip, drip down the windows, the air was damp and chill, the people dull and dispirited. A comfortable home and cheerful fire seemed too remote to be possible. The men outside walked about disconsolate under sodden umbrellas. The forlorn house that was the only habitation visible in the open country where they stopped, had its white front all covered with brown stains like a face splashed with mud. Some wretched cows that were left in the grey pasture beyond, were huddled together under a scanty apple tree, whose dripping branches afforded sorry shelter. Altogether, the scene was such as would have depressed a more hopeful lover than Vinton. He fell into a listless melancholy that he could not resist, and even when the train rumbled into the city night had fallen so stormy and dark that it seemed like an entrance into deeper gloom.
               
               
                  CHAPTER X.
                  
                     
                        
                           "O, miserable wretch! whither do thy destinies guide thee?"
                        
                        SIDNEY'S ARCADIA.
                     
                  
                  WHEN Vinton reached home, he found the family assembled at dinner. At his unexpected entrance they looked up with surprise and various emotions of relief or regret. Mrs. Rockford regarded the handsome, smiling face of her son with keen apprehension; she could not believe that he would, without consulting her, actually form an engagement, but she felt that every hour passed with Mabel increased the danger of all that she so dreaded. Her husband met the exultant sparkle of Vinton's eyes with a glance of triumph, and a sidelong scrutiny of his wife's harassed face, that was anything but kind. Edith was pale and preoccupied, she had been these two days past wondering with impatient, longing heart, what had become of Lionel, she had not seen him since the ball, and was perplexed and surprised by his strange disappearance. With sisterly solicitude she had also thought often of Vinton's dangerous position, anticipating his return with an anxiety she could not repress, and now she looked up at his eager face so sadly that his first words after the greetings were over, were—
                  "Why, Edith, what is the matter? you look as if all the sunshine had faded from your eyes."
                  "It is nothing," replied Edith, with an effort to smile, "I don't think I have yet recovered from the effects of the ball."
                  An attempt to follow up this with some talk with his mother, was such a signal failure that Vinton soon gave up, and an awkward silence ensued. He had somewhat recovered his spirits by the return to the light and warmth of home, but here again the depressing influences seemed to pursue him. There was certainly a gloom hanging over the party; and then he began to think how he should dispel it by announcing his engagement, as he intended to do as soon as he was alone with the family. This anticipation made his heart beat so fast that he could scarcely sit quietly in his chair till the dessert was on the table, and the servants dismissed. Then the important moment had arrived, and feeling this, with humid eyes and glowing cheeks, Vinton broke the silence that held the little company like a spell.
                  "I hope you will all congratulate me, for I have some very good news to tell," he began, not looking at any one in particular, and in his own embarrassment never noticing the fixed glitter of his mother's eager eyes, or the scared apprehension of his cousin's parted lips. Mr. Rockford alone looked delighted, and said, in a tone of encouragement,
                  "Well, sir, what is it?"
                  Then addressing him, Vinton went on, "I have taken your advice, sir, and I have the honor of announcing to you, that I am engaged to our sweet Mabel Sandys."
                  "I am delighted, my dear boy—" began Mr. Rockford, in a tone of most unusual cordiality, but at that moment he was interrupted by a groan so hollow and anguished that it seemed to come from the very heart, followed by a shriek of horror. Mrs. Rockford had fallen fainting from her chair, and Edith had sprung, terror-stricken, to her side.
                  "Mother! mother!" cried Vinton in wild alarm, and feeling as if the apprehension that had so long haunted him had at last a cause, "Oh my God, what is the matter!"
                  "I don't know," replied Edith, in tears of distress, and trying to raise the stately head that lay prone on the carpet, with its crushed laces and disordered hair.
                  "Nonsense! it is only a swoon!" exclaimed Mr. Rockford, impatiently, and coming to her side. "She has not been well lately, it will soon be over; here Vinton, help me to carry her up stairs, and Edith send for Dr. Monroe."
                  Vinton darted at Mr. Rockford a look of surprise, almost of indignation. "I do not need any assistance, sir," he said as he stooped and raised his mother gently in his arms, kissing her pale forehead with such passionate fervor as left no doubt where the strength of his affection lay.
                  Edith had obeyed her uncle's orders by ringing the bell, but she left him to give his own directions, and followed her cousin as he bore his inanimate mother slowly to her room.
                  "Has she really been ill long?" asked Vinton, as together they laid her on the bed. "How selfish I have been in my own happiness, I never noticed it."
                  "I don't think she has been well for some time past," replied Edith, "she has fainted more than once, but she did not wish you to know it."
                  "Dearest, dearest, mother," almost sobbed Vinton, as he chafed her cold hands, while Edith bathed her brow. He felt almost as if he had caused the illness, and recalled with remorse her swoon at the funeral, and her illness after Christmas, feeling as if he had not been sufficiently watchful of her since, blaming himself that he had allowed Mabel's image to exclude every other.
                  Mr. Rockford had sent up his wife's maid Aglae, a quick neat Frenchwoman, who speedily loosed Mrs. Rockford's dress and with Edith's assistance applied such stimulants as at length recalled her to consciousness. She opened her eyes with a gasp, and so slowly and painfully came to a comprehension of her situation Yet at first she seemed unable to speak, by signs expressing a wish to be raised, and soon after pillows were put under her head, pressing her hand to her heart, and catching her breath with evident pain. Her son watched her with distress he could not conceal, this was so evident that Edith fearing it might increase her aunt's sufferings, urged him in a whisper to leave the room till she was better. Mrs. Rockford caught the words, and stopped him with a faint voice.
                  "Don't go away, Vinton. I am better now, and I must speak to you."
                  "Never mind, mother dear," he replied, tenderly, "you must not talk now, you must be better first, the Doctor will be here soon."
                  "I do not want a doctor," said Mrs. Rockford, decidedly; "he can do me no good—send him away."
                  "Oh, don't say that, mother; you must see him, at least for my sake; you know you must try to be well."
                  "I shall never be well again," sighed Mrs. Rockford, passively. "But I will see him, if you wish."
                  Almost immediately after, Dr. Monroe arrived and the cousins withdrew. Edith had an engagement to go to a ball that night with some friends, and it must be allowed she was somewhat eager to go in the hopes of meeting Lionel; now, however, it was impossible for her to leave home, and she went at once to her boudoir to write a note to the chaperone, to say that the sudden illness of her aunt would oblige her to remain at home.
                  Vinton restless and wretched went down to Mr. Rockford in the library to ask him a hundred eager questions about his mother's illness. To such solicitude it was impossible for him to reply without some show of feeling, though he did his best to assure Vinton that there was nothing alarming in it, and as quickly as possible turned the conversation to his engagement. But Vinton was not so easily satisfied. Even this interesting topic could not divert his thoughts from the beloved invalid. He walked about the room in nervous impatience, giving but short answers to Mr. Rockford's congratulations, and when he heard Dr. Monroe's step in the hall, he sprang to meet him with all his heart in the question:
                  "What do you think of mother?"
                  "There is no immediate cause for alarm," replied the physician, entering the library. "The most entire quiet is absolutely necessary; with that, and all freedom from excitement, I trust she will recover." The tone with which these discouraging words were pronounced by their ordinarily cheerful friend, far from quieting, increased Vinton's apprehensions.
                  "Is there any danger?" he demanded with white lips, while Mr. Rockford calmly asked,
                  "Do you find the presence of any disease?"
                  "I cannot say positively," answered the Doctor, "I fear that this has been coming for some time. How long has she been subject to these attacks?"
                  "Three or four months," responded Mr. Rockford, "I have frequently suggested to her the propriety of consulting you, but she has invariably refused. But I wish you would plainly tell me what is to be apprehended."
                  "If there is any danger," said the Doctor gravely, "it is to the heart, and I tell you this the more readily because you will at once understand how important it is that she shall be kept from all agitation."
                  This ominious sentence was received by Mr. Rockford with a slight start of surprise, by Vinton with an absolute groan of horror, and such a look of distress that the Doctor added kindly:
                  "Don't let me alarm you too much, my dear sir, there may be no organic disease; indeed the illness I trust will soon yield to judicious treatment, I only tell you what is to be apprehended that you may shield your mother from all that can trouble her. Mental distress or any anxiety is above all to be dreaded."
                  With this last injunction, Dr. Monroe withdrew, leaving Vinton somewhat relieved from the first horror of his words, but still feeling as if he had just cause for the most extreme anxiety. Full of all tenderness and solicitude for her, he hastened back to his mother's room, and, indeed, as he gazed at her again, he felt only too strongly the conviction of the danger that threatened. Edith, who had rejoined her aunt as soon as her note was dispatched, had assisted Aglae to undress her, and she lay under the crimson curtains of the bed, with her night dress smooth over her bosom as a shroud, her iron-grey hair hanging in heavy masses around her face, that was so ghastly it might have been a dead face, but for the burning eyes that were wild with a look of misery and despair. At Vinton's approach, they rested on him with such mute entreaty and love, that, involuntarily, he exclaimed—
                  "What is it, dear mother?"
                  "Are we alone?" asked Mrs. Rockford, hoarsely.
                  "Yes, except Edith. But, indeed, dearest mother, I only came to sit by you. You must not talk to me now."
                  "Yes, yes, I will," she said, eagerly.
                  "No, no. Please me in just this, mother; not to-night."
                  "Vinton, Vinton, don't ask me that. I must speak to you now; it will do me no good to wait until to-morrow. I cannot rest or sleep till I have said what is in my heart."
                  This appeal was made so eagerly, and with so much excitement, that Vinton did not dare to resist it. He thought that no harm could be done by conversation, compared to that which might result from thwarting her wishes, and leaving her to herself with an unexpressed desire, perhaps it would even soothe her to hear him talk quietly of his coming happiness and his plans for the future. As these thoughts passed rapidly through his brain, he looked up and saw that Edith had stolen away; the mother and son were alone together, and he said—
                  "Well, then, let us have a little chat. Only try to keep quiet."
                  
                  "I will," replied Mrs. Rockford, with compressed lips and in a choking voice. "I will try to be as calm as possible; but oh! Vinton, you do not know how it distresses me to say what I must say;" and she pressed her hand to her side with such a gesture of suffering, that he cried in alarm—
                  "Then do not say it, mother. Wait till you are well, and then tell me."
                  "No, no! I must speak now;" and after a pause, as if to collect her strength, she added: "Oh! my son, I never thought that you would actually form an engagement, without consulting me."
                  Somewhat relieved, Vinton hastened to explain. "Why, dearest mother, I am sorry I have seemed negligent, but, indeed, I did not intend to propose so soon, until just before I left the house, when I had no time to speak to you; and I thought I was certain of your approval; you seemed so fond of Mabel, and my father assured me of your consent."
                  "What!" demanded Mrs. Rockford, sharply," did my husband tell you that?"
                  "Yes; or, at least, he implied that you would both be delighted, and urged me to hasten my suit."
                  "Yet he knew that it had my strongest disapprobation, and that I had told him I would never give my countenance, under any circumstance, to so ill-omened a connection."
                  Then, for the first time, it dawned on Vinton's mind what the threatened danger was, yet at first he refused to credit an idea so repugnant, so overwhelming.
                  "Oh! don't say that, dear mother; I thought you would so rejoice in my happiness!"
                  "With any one else but that girl, Vinton; but you must give her up wholly and at once. She can never, never be yours!"
                  Vinton gazed in alarm at his mother's agitated face and fierce eyes, as she spoke so vehemently these fatal words. For a moment it crossed his mind that she was raving, so little was he prepared for such bitterness of opposition. He was somewhat indignant, too, at the tone in which she spoke of his darling Mabel, and briefly demanded—
                  "Why not?"
                  "Do not ask me. I cannot give you any reason," she declared, with a gesture of despair; and then, her voice faltering, she cried out, "Oh, my boy! my boy! it kills me to tell you this—to think that I, who have so loved you, must give you this pain!"
                  Softened and touched by the misery of her tone, Vinton seized her white hand and raised it to his lips. "If I had only known this before, I would never have made an engagement without your consent. You know, darling mother, you are dearer to me than any woman on earth."
                  "My own noble Vinton!" cried Mrs. Rockford, drawing him to her and passionately kissing his brow.
                  "And now, mother, let us not say any more about it, at least to-night," said Vinton, as he tenderly responded to the caress.
                  "Yes, I must. Do not refuse me. Let me finish what I have to say."
                  "I fear you are over-exerting yourself."
                  "No, dear, I am better—you see I am. Then let me go on. I can never sufficiently deplore what has happened. I have been weak and wrong, or I should never have permitted it to come to this; but I intended to interfere before you were hopelessly entangled."
                  "But now that my word is pledged, you will try to be reconciled, will you not? We will not hasten the marriage, and in time you must approve."
                  Mrs. Rockford closed her eyes in silent suffering. Must it be her dreadful duty to blast the honor and the happiness of her generous and devoted son? Yet she durst not hesitate. The retribution had come; she could not hope to avoid it.
                  "My son, you know I would freely lay down my life for you. Then do not believe that it is any passing caprice that forces me to oppose your wishes. I hope you will never oblige me to give my reasons, but I tell you this detestable engagement must be broken at once."
                  At these words Vinton started from his seat. "I insist upon your taking some rest, mother," he said, refusing to credit the full force of the sentence. "You are tired. You do not know how cruel you are. To-morrow we will talk of it."
                  "No! Now! now!" almost shrieked Mrs. Rockford. She felt as if this anguish could not be prolonged. It must be ended at once. "You do not know the agony you inflict by refusing to listen to me."
                  
                  This appeal was not to be resisted, and with a sigh Vinton resumed his seat. "What is it that you wish, then? Tell me over again. I cannot bear to understand."
                  "You must give up Mabel."
                  "Don't you like her?" he asked, avoiding for a moment any direct reply.
                  "Yes," answered Mrs. Rockford, "I love and admire her more than any girl I have seen for a long time. I should be proud to call her my daughter, were it not for an insuperable obstacle that must forever bar your union with her."
                  "And will you not tell me what that obstacle is?"
                  Again a spasm of anguish convulsed Mrs. Rockford's features. "No!" she gasped. "Oh! God, preserve me from ever being forced to explain it to my son!"
                  Beyond measure distressed and alarmed, Vinton yet knew not what to do, in this terrible alternative. On the one hand, his honor and his love bound him with cords of iron to Mabel; on the other, his duty to his beloved mother called on him to break these ties, even although his heart broke with them. And indeed, in view of her suffering at this moment, it seemed almost murder to refuse to do all in his power to soothe her.
                  "Is there no other course but absolute renunciation that will satisfy you?" he asked mournfully.
                  "No, none! If you value not only my peace, but my life, you must resign her," gasped Mrs. Rockford. Her strength was nearly exhausted, and her son saw it.
                  "It is enough, dearest mother. I will distress you no more. I owe you a long debt of gratitude, and I can do no less than obey your commands." His voice was hoarse and tremulous. The struggle was a terrible one, but he thought that his mother's very existence depended upon his decision
                  "Thank you! thank you! my darling boy!" said Mrs. Rockford, with an expression of relief that was almost a smile. "To-morrow we can arrange how you can best retreat from this entanglement without dishonor. Now I can rest in comfort."
                  "Then let us say no more," replied Vinton, mournfully. "You need sleep, and I need time for reflection."
                  He rose as he spoke. He had made a present sacrifice, whose magnitude he could not conceal from himself.
                  He would not attempt to treat it as a light matter, and he felt too much amazed and bewildered to undertake any longer conversation with his mother.
                  "Kiss me good-night, Vinton," she said as he turned away, so pleadingly that he could not refuse to press his lips to her cheek. Wistfully she gazed into his mournful eyes, and when he was gone her own closed wearily, almost with the wish that she might never open them again. But she was not destined so soon to find repose. Her husband, who had been alert and watchful of all that had passed, had guessed what must have taken place during the long interview between mother and son, and meeting Vinton on his way down stairs, had by a few questions elicited an acknowledgement of the half promise he had given his mother. This discovery irritated him beyond all bounds, and after making a vain attempt to induce Vinton to retract it, he went to his wife's room determined to make a final effort to move her from her absurd decision. The half stupor of exhaustion into which Mrs. Rockford had fallen after her son had left, was broken by her husband's voice—
                  "How are you, Claudia?"
                  At the words she roused herself once more. "Thank you, I feel very weak, but hope soon to be better."
                  "You have been talking with Vinton," continued Mr. Rockford, drawing a chair near her and seating himself deliberately.
                  "Yes."
                  "Yet the doctor forbade all agitation, and your interview must have been a trying one."
                  "Has he told you?"
                  "Yes; I wondered at his look of unhappiness, and then he explained your strange request."
                  He knew well how to touch the right chord in his wife's sensitive nature. When he spoke of her son's unhappiness she winced perceptibly; but she felt too weak for argument, and made no reply.
                  "I do not intend to distress you by an ill-timed urgency," continued Mr. Rockford, as he watched with some alarm her contracted brow and quivering lip. "I have only to say that I have done and shall do all in my power to convince my son that he ought not to yield to the caprice of an invalid, in so momentous a matter, and I hope that your own good sense will lead you to avoid all further agitation, by giving that consent to Vinton's engagement which can alone make him entirely happy. I wish you a good night, and I trust in the morning that you will be quite restored."
                  Without waiting for a reply, he summoned Aglae, who had been waiting in the sitting-room near, and so went away again to his library and his papers, little guessing or caring for the anguish of his wife, whose every heart-beat was painful, and whose brain was well-nigh crazed with all the terrible anomalies of her situation.
                  This man of iron, alone of all the household, rested well that night. Mrs. Rockford, who had been roused beyond the possibility of sleep by his cruel words, lay through the long sad hours of darkness, enduring all the agonies of the recollections of the irrevocable past, and the anticipations of the hopeless future. Only too well she realized the desperate struggle that was before her, the best result of which would involve the ruin of the honor and the happiness of that son who was the darling of her heart. On every side there was nothing but wretchedness; and while she felt that each moment of this self-torture hastened the end, she yet had no hope of that repose that could alone prolong a life, which, miserable as it was, she yet felt must not cease till all was accomplished.
                  Vinton spent many hours after he had parted from his mother in restless wanderings up and down his room. Not easily could he resign those dreams of happiness which had so long brightened his existence, and that honor which was dearer than life. His mother asked the sacrifice, while his father demanded that it should not be made. He stood between two duties, and any decision must involve the happiness not only of himself but others. He could not with any calmness contemplate the horrors of his position; and when at last he threw himself on the bed, it was only to toss restlessly from side to side, and finally to sink into an unquiet slumber that brought no refreshment
                  Edith insisted upon occupying the couch in her aunt's dressing-room, that she might be within easy call. With her young health and pure heart sleep was a necessity, but it came later than usual. In a hurried interview with Vinton she had learned all that had passed, and been greatly distressed by his misery and her aunt's illness. At such a time she felt that she had no right to intrude her own anxieties on his notice, and so had not even the satisfaction of asking him if he could explain the absence of her friend. Amid all this trouble, she longed more than ever for Lionel's presence as a consolation.

                  MABEL SANDYS sat alone by the fire in the library. It was three days since she had parted from her lover, and yet she had received no word from him whatever. She had regretted ever since that she had yielded to the nervous headache which had followed her evening of agitation, so much as not to have risen to bid him good-bye; she feared he might have thought her indifferent or cold, and tried to explain his extraordinary silence by blaming herself for not having asked him to write to her. It took but a few hours for a letter to come from New York, so that each mail had brought a fresh disappointment in these past tiresome mornings and evenings.
                  —Who is there that does not know the trying tediousness of waiting for a letter from a dear friend or lover? How dreary the days are when every few hours brings a new disappointment! How we try to explain the strange silence by fancying that our friend is ill, or that the address has been lost, or our last note not received—anything rather than careless neglect. How we try to dismiss the whole matter and not be impatient; yet how it will return to our thoughts, and disturb our interest in everything else. How, when a handful of letters comes from the mail, we try to recognize in every one the well known address and envelope. Under such circumstances our very postal facilities are a vexation and a trial, and we are inclined to feel as if after all, those old feudal dames were better off, who, when all Christendom went to the crusades, did not expect to hear from their absent lords until they returned victorious.—
                  It was Saturday evening, the time when Vinton had promised to return, and Mabel sat listening to every sound, in that fever of hope and fear that is so hard to endure. She recalled every incident of their strange engagement; it was on this very sofa that they sat when he first spoke of that love she had so long felt; and then following mentally the progress of that singular interview, she raised her eyes to her father's portrait, that, restored to its place once more, kept guard over her. Now, it seemed as if the tenderest pity beamed from that sweet face, and she was soon wholly absorbed in recalling all that she had lost in that beloved parent, thinking how at this moment he would have been there to advise and comfort her, wondering if her choice would not have met his hearty approbation. From this reverie she was roused by a footstep in the hall; she knew that it was her mother's, and hastened to meet her at the door. Mrs. Sandys entered, looking a little worried—
                  "I have been to the Post-office, my dear," she said, producing a letter—"Vinton is not coming."
                  Mabel turned pale with disappointment. "Why not?" she asked meekly. "Has he written to me?"
                  "No, there is only this short note for me; but his mother is very ill."
                  "Ah!" cried Mabel, looking a little relieved. "Then of course he could not write. Poor Mrs. Rockford!" she added in a moment, ashamed of her selfishness in not having sooner pitied her. "Please tell me all about it."
                  "I will read you what he says," replied Mrs. Sandys. "It is very short and unsatisfactory, but I suppose he has been much occupied."
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "My Dear Madam—I know not how to frame an apology for my inexcusable conduct, but my dear mother has been ill ever since my return. I am beyond measure distressed and grieved at my inability to see you as I promised, to-day. I can only throw myself upon your kindness, and assure you that I am, as ever,
                              
                                 "Yours most affectionately,
                                 "VINTON ROCKFORD."
                              
                           
                        
                     
                  
                  "Is that all?" asked Mabel, in disappointed surprise.
                  "Yes, my dear, there is no message, not a word for you; look at it yourself," and she handed the note to her daughter.
                  "It is written either in great agitation or hurry," said Mabel, after glancing over the irregular lines and almost illegible characters. "It is very different from his ordinary handwriting."
                  "I fear Mrs. Rockford is dangerously ill," observed Mrs Sandys, suggesting the only plausible explanation of such strange negligence. "I wish we knew something more of her. I think I had better write to Edith. Vinton is so devoted to his mother, that any indisposition of hers would be very absorbing."
                  "I have no doubt there is some good reason for his conduct," said Mabel, with maidenly pride in her lover's infallibility; but although she asserted this so stoutly, she could not help feeling both anxious and disappointed. There was no mail again until Monday, and she thought with a sinking of the heart how she must go through this long time without any more news. Fearing with childlike simplicity that she should never be able to fix her attention on the services with that entire absorption which alone could satisfy her of true devotion. Yet nobly unselfish, she struggled to conceal her preoccupation, and when her mother summoned her to the tea table, she had wiped away the few quiet tears that stained her fair cheeks, and met her with a sweet attempt at cheerfulness.
                  Later in the evening they were joined by the Rev. Paul Haughton. He was the only person who had yet been informed of Mabel's engagement. He had been so long prepared to hear this, and had so faithfully struggled to conquer his own feelings that he was able to bear it without any manifestation of agitation, and to give the fair young creature he had once hoped to win, his hearty blessing in her choice of another. This evening he had expected to find Vinton at the Sandys', and had schooled himself to pay this visit of congratulation, and view his happiness at least with cheerfulness. He was therefore much surprised to find the two ladies alone, and to notice the shade of sadness on Mabel's face that could not escape his loving eyes. He saw too how hard it was for her to maintain any conversation, and knew that when at last she left the room, it was that she might escape to an unrestrained solitude.
                  Mrs. Sandys had become so much accustomed to consult Mr. Haughton in every affair of importance, that she did not hesitate, when they were alone together, to tell him of Vinton's extraordinary conduct. On hearing this, and reading his short note without one word for Mabel, Paul's white forehead flushed with indignation.
                  "It is very strange," he said, "most unaccountable—most inexcusable!" and then determined not to yield to his inclination to blame him, he added after a moment. "But we must not too hastily condemn him. Perhaps Monday may bring a more satisfactory letter."
                  And so Paul said what he could in defence of his friend—yet the more he reflected on what he had just heard, the more annoyed and distressed he was by it. Was it possible that Vinton had been only trifling with Mabel? Could she have misinterpreted his words into meaning more than he had ever intended? Yet that was scarcely possible. Vinton was too honorable, Mabel too simple minded to permit such a conjecture. Supposing therefore that his proposal had been sincere, his subsequent course was inexcusable. Even his mother's most alarming illness was no reason for an absolute forgetfulness of Mabel. And then involuntarily Mr. Haughton thought how different would have been his conduct had he been the fortunate lover, reaching again the old conclusion to which lovers so often come, that it was impossible for Vinton to love Mabel as strongly and as fervently as he did; feeling with a sigh of pain, how hard it was that her happiness should be in the power of any one less wholly devoted than himself.
                  The next few days were very trying ones to all of that little circle. On Sunday Mabel's patient sweet face looked up so sadly at Mr. Haughton, that he could scarcely keep his eyes from it, and it haunted him like a ghost when he could no longer see it. Then on Monday came the old series of disappointments with every fresh mail. There was no news until Thursday, when there came a note from Edith in reply to Mrs. Sandys' letter. It was written evidently in bad spirits. Her aunt was still very far from well, subject constantly to attacks that filled them with alarm; her cousin was quite worn out with watching and distress of mind, but he intended to write soon himself. There was evidently a tone of constraint in the letter. Even the message sage to Mabel at the end was less cordial than usual. It was no longer possible to deny that there was something very mysterious in this. Mr. Haughton strove to be patient yet a little longer, but when several more days elapsed without any word, he felt that, as the guardian of his cousin's honor and happiness, it was time for him to act. He took Mrs. Sandys quite by surprise, therefore, by coming in unexpectedly as she sat alone one morning, with the announcement that he was going to New York.
                  "I must see for myself what the state of that family is," he said. "I have business in the city of some importance which will afford sufficient excuse for the visit."
                  "But you won't do anything rash," urged Mrs. Sandys, noticing a certain excitement in his manner.
                  "Do not fear," replied Paul. "Nothing can excuse such wanton trifling with Mabel's feelings. But you may rest assured that I shall do nothing that can compromise her; she is too dear to me for that."
                  His voice trembled as he uttered these words, and then for the first time it occurred to his cousin that he felt for her daughter something more than a brother's love. Now that it was too late did a regret cross her mind that this noble friend had been passed by for one younger and perhaps less reliable?
                  Yet harassing and full of anxiety as the past week had been to Mr. Haughton and his cousin, it had been a far darker period to the family he was about to visit. Mrs. Rockford who had for a moment rested in the hope that she had won her son's consent to all that she wished, and from the very nature of the case had supposed that his affection could not be a deep one, had been thrown into fresh alarm, by her husband's stern avowal of his unchanged determination to urge on the detested alliance, and suffered each day the agony of seeing how deeply Vinton felt the misery of his position. All this had so much aggravated her disease that she had never been able to go down stairs, or to do more than move from her bed to a couch for a few hours at a time. She was terribly worn by anxiety and sleeplessness, and was constantly subject to attacks of pain that were most exhausting. Vinton watched her with the tenderest solicitude, and absolutely determined to prevent all cause of agitation, would not allow her for a while to speak to him on the subject ject of his engagement, hoping that when she was stronger her feelings might change, never guessing that the very suspense in which she was kept was wearing away her life with subtle force. Edith ably assisted him in shielding her from all excitement, and with an instinctive perception that any interview with her husband would be certain to produce an unfavorable effect, she contrived for a few days to prevent him from seeing her alone.
                  Yet all this did not for a moment deceive Mrs. Rockford as to the true state of affairs; she saw her son's look of wretchedness, and with senses sharpened by illness, heard him often talking in agitated tones to her husband or her niece. At last she broke the enforced silence. A few questions elicited from Vinton an acknowledgment of the note he had sent to Mrs. Sandys, and then the struggle which she had so long dreaded began. She entreated him to break his engagement, not to be put off with any promises for the future, she insisted on discussing the matter whenever he was with her. She implored him by his love for her to give up this girl, she bade him look at the wreck which his obstinacy had made, and assured him with sighs of anguish that her very life depended upon his consent. And what agony did he not suffer in all this? He saw his idolized mother wasting away before his eyes, and felt that it was his cruelty that had brought about this result, every groan of anguish, every spasm of pain, every look of suffering were as torturing as if they were deliberately inflicted by his unfilial hands. A hundred times he would have ended the contest by giving the promise required if only himself had been involved, but his honor was very dear, and even to please his mother it scarcely seemed right to destroy the happiness of Mabel, that gentle and innocent girl whom he so loved! He could have sacrificed her to his mother, even though it broke his heart, if she had never known his attachment, but bound as he was by this sacred pledge ought he lightly to break it? Then too Mr. Rockford's commands were more peremptory than his mother's, he affected to treat his wife's illness as temporary, even hinting that it had perhaps been got up for the occasion, and although Vinton resented this insinuation as an insult, he felt that he had no right lightly to disregard a father's wishes. Placed in this dreadful situation it was no wonder that nights without rest and days of distressing struggle, left their traces on the fair open face of the son, while they aggravated the mortal disease that was hurrying the unhappy mother to the tomb.
                  In this trying period Edith too was a sufferer, she knew the true state of affairs, and saw what was the real cause of the disorder that baffled the physician's skill. Yet she was powerless to help those whom she so loved in this terrible crisis. She could only as far as possible soothe her aunt after her interview with Vinton, and give him the consolation of her sympathy. It was necessary too to conceal from the curious eyes of the outside world, the slow tragedy that was taking place in that home of luxury and comfort. Many offers of assistance had been made by numerous friends when Mrs. Rockford's illness became known. None of those were accepted but those of the Misses Vinton. As relatives they were of course admitted, and proved indeed most useful. Miss Clarissa, especially, was of great help in saving Edith from much fatigue. But even from them Mrs. Rockford was most anxious to guard the secret of her malady. So a professional nurse was hired who might take charge of her through the long nights, when her misery would sometimes find vent in groans, though never in tears—that resource was denied her dry and burning eyes—and during the day with the fortitude of a Richelieu, Mrs. Rockford insisted upon receiving her friends in her elegant boudoir whenever she was tolerably able. She was most solicitious also that no change should take place in the habits of the family, but that above all her niece should accept some of the numerous invitations that crowded her table.
                  Poor Edith had little inclination for gayety after witnessing the sufferings of those so dear to her. Aside from this, too, her heart was heavy with her own sorrows. The days passed and yet Lionel Rohan never came, even to ask after her aunt. She would not trouble her cousin with her own anxieties, or he might have told her that his friend made frequent inquiries at his office or the bank; but from her young acquaintances she heard of his walking with Adrienne Clifford and seeming as well as ever. He was not, therefore, either ill or out of town, and surprise was fast changing into indignation at his neglect. She was sure that she had given him no reason for this apparent want of courtesy, and then her affectionate heart was tormented with the humiliating fear that he had perhaps suspected her preference, and feeling it impossible for him to return it, had wisely resolved to avoid her. This thought brought a flush to her cheek, and although, even with her modest temperament, she could not but recall a thousand little attentions that seemed to have a deeper meaning than mere friendship, yet the bare suspicion of such a possibility was enough to make her determine to take no measures to discover the cause of his disappearance.
                  But if she missed the devotion of one lover, she could neither check nor discourage another, far more assiduous. Percival Denbigh was at the house every day, always, at first, ostensibly to inquire after Mrs. Rockford, and with the most thoughtful kindness sending her now some fine fruit, and again a basket of flowers, or a new book. Edith for a while avoided seeing him, but she could not always refuse, and when they did meet there was something so sadly deferential in his manner, that she could not but be touched, and blaming herself with increased severity for her undeniable trifling, felt constantly more inclined to do all in her power to atone for her cruelty, by a friendly kindness of manner. And Denbigh saw this with delight. The tiger within him was tightly chained, he could even fawn on his victim; but should he ever be let loose, would he not be all the fiercer for his long starvation?
                  When, in compliance with her aunt's wishes, Edith at last reluctantly accepted some invitations, it was not surprising that she appeared but the shadow of her former self. Preoccupied, constantly hoping for Lionel's entrance, and, when he did not come, longing, oh! so intensely! to escape from the tedious scene. It was not surprising, therefore, that under these circumstances, not caring to dance, she should be glad to find a seat in a quiet room with Percival Denbigh, who did not expect her to talk, and whose kind solicitude was soothing, while his agreeable conversation was a distraction, if not an entertainment. She cared so little what people said, that it never struck her that they would put but one construction on this ostentatious devotion.
                  And so, as Time, even when he treads on hearts, accomplishes his flight, a fortnight elapsed since the day of Vinton's visit to Herford, and he could not conceal from himself that it was weak and cowardly any longer to evade the decision which must be made. He must either refuse peremptorily torily any longer to listen to his mother, even if it killed her, or he must give her the promise she wished, and this at last he was resolved to do. He would sacrifice honor and hope, so she might live. At every fresh visit to her couch of suffering he felt like a murderer, it was so manifestly his cruelty that had blasted her beauty and was destroying her life. He could no longer endure such anguish; his father's wrath, and the few sighs that Mabel might give to her lost lover, were nothing compared to his mother's life. With this in his heart, he went on his return from the office, where he still made a pretence of continuing his studies, to his mother's room. She was lying on a couch by the fire; there was a flush of fever on her cheeks, and that expression of suffering which had of late become so fixed on her face, had deepened to such a look of despair that Vinton was sure she had passed through some recent excitement.
                  "I have been talking with my husband," she said, in reply to his inquiry. "Vinton, I am too much exhausted to say much to you, but this uncertainty must be ended. I can endure no longer if you will not promise to give up that girl. I must make the final expiation—but," and she raised her voice with the energy of despair as she spoke, "remember my death will lie at your door."
                  A spasm of pain that convulsed her features at that moment gave but too much eloquence to her words, and the struggle over, Vinton knelt beside her in a final outburst of filial love and self-sacrifice—
                  "I will, dearest mother, I will! I ought not to have hesitated so long. For your sake I am willing to resign everything—only let me see you look happy once more."
                  "Then you promise?" asked Mrs. Rockford, with an expression of such relief as almost to banish pain.
                  "Yes, darling mother; and lest I be tempted to retract, I will go at once to write my first and last letter to Mabel Sandys."
                  A wan sweet smile rested on the young man's lips as he spoke. Not only would he sacrifice honor and happiness for his mother's sake, but, if possible, she should never know what it cost him. Oh! have there not been heroes since the Greek boy looked calmly in his father's face while the fox was gnawing at his heart?

                        FESTUS.
                     
                  
                  VINTON prepared to write that cruel letter which was to close forever his first dear dream of love, with far more anguish there if it had been his own death warrant. How oculd he frame the hard words so as most gently to express what must be said? He shrunk with trembling hand from the self-inflicted task, and was yet hesitating over the first sentence when a card was handed to him.
                  On reading that name, "The Rev. Paul Haughton," Vinton flung down his pen with a sigh of relief. Feeling as if his friend had been sent as an angel of consolation in his hour of need, to whom he could tell all that he could not write, he hastened with eager steps to meet him.
                  Whatever stern resolve had been in the young clergyman's heart, he was half disarmed when he saw the change that had passed over Vinton since they had last met. His haggard face told of mental struggles and sleepless nights, his dark eyes so like his mother's now, had a look of despair, his pale cheeks told a tale of suffering that was most eloquent in his defence.
                  "Oh, Mr. Haughton! I am so glad you have come!" was his first exclamation as he clasped his friend's hand as if it were a support to which he might cling.
                  "I have wished to see you very much," replied Paul gravely, "but you look ill. Is Mrs. Rockford in any danger?"
                  "I hope not, but we fear everything. She cannot bear the last excitement."
                  There was an awkward pause and then Vinton said, "Did Mrs. Sandys tell you of—of Mabel's kindness to me?"
                  
                  "She did," replied Paul coldly—"I understood that you were engaged to her, but you seem to have forgotten it."
                  This sneer from one usually so kind crushed Vinton; for a moment he remained silent as if to nerve himself to receive a blow and then feeling that his courage would only grow weaker by waiting, he rushed at once into the announcement that cost him so dear.
                  "Mr. Haughton, you are Mabel's cousin, almost her brother, yet try to pity me, even while you blame me, when I say that for my mother's sake I must give her up!"
                  The young clergyman heard this strange announcement with such mingled emotions as almost overcame him. His first sensation was a pang of joy, that he could not repress. Deserted by this lover Mabel was once more free, and what might he not hope? Then his jealous regard for her honor forced this feeling to give way to one of indignation, that was yet tempered by the pain it evidently cost to Vinton to say these words. When he had a little recovered from the first shock he said, somewhat haughtily,
                  "May I ask Mrs. Rockford's reason for this rejection?"
                  "I do not know!" cried the unhappy man, "I only know that she is very ill, and if I refused to break my engagement it would kill her!" and then overwhelmed with the misery and humiliation of his position, Vinton sat down and buried his face in his hands with a low groan.
                  Touched by such evident suffering Paul said in a kinder tone—"I do not intend to blame you, yet it is hard for me to understand you. Mrs. Rockford may have some powerful prejudice, for it is impossible that there can be any tangible objection to an alliance with my cousin," he added presently.
                  "No, certainly God knows I envy the man who shall win her."
                  "Then," continued Paul feeling that he was pleading for Mabel's happiness—"you ought not lightly to yield to a mere caprice, if you really love her."
                  "Love her!" groaned Vinton, "Ah, Mr. Haughton, I can never tell you how I love her! I would lay down my life to save her a moment's pain I know you must think me weak and dishonorable, I have already vacillated too long, but I cannot resist my mother's entreaties when I see her suffering, almost dying."
                  "My poor friend," said Mr. Haughton, no longer struggling against the compassion he could not help feeling for such unfeigned distress. "I will not condemn you. Your duty to your mother is paramount to every other consideration. If she is ill, you must, of course, yield obedience to her wishes."
                  "Ah! you think so!" cried Vinton, looking up with something of relief in his wistful eyes. "Then you will not believe that I wantonly or carelessly break my word with Mabel."
                  "I will do you full justice," answered Paul; "I cannot doubt that you regret the necessity which forces you to this step."
                  "Then you will plead my cause? I was going to write to Mrs. Sandys, but I can say so much more to you than I could to her. You will tell Mabel how I love her, and that nothing but my mother's very life would force me to resign her."
                  "I will say all for you that you could say for yourself," promised Paul, solemnly; and as he spoke, he struggled hard to crush the hopes that would spring up, even with lofty disinterestedness suggesting light for the future. "Perhaps all may yet be well. When Mrs. Rockford is better, this strange prejudice may yield, and you may yet be happy."
                  "I scarcely dare to hope," replied Vinton, sadly, "now that I have made the sacrifice. I could not renew my addresses without my mother's hearty consent, and it is neither fair nor honorable for me to attempt to bind Mabel. I shall never forget her, and never love again;" and his voice trembled as he uttered the mournful words, "but henceforth she is free."
                  "You are right, Vinton," said Paul, in warm admiration of this true delicacy, "I am sure that it will be a long time before Mabel regards any one as she has regarded you, and, with sound health, Mrs. Rockford's views may change. See," he added, with a smile, "I came here to blame you, and behold, I am consoling."
                  Vinton wrung Paul's hand with hearty thanks. "You do not know how your words soothe me! I have suffered so much lately. Even now I do not dare to hope; but if I am ever released from this present duty to my mother, I need not assure you that, if I am permitted, I shall renew my addresses to the only woman I have ever loved."
                  After this the conversation became more calm. Vinton explained, as far as he was able, all that had passed—Mr. Rockford's urgency, and his mother's despairing entreaties—until Paul, understanding partially how matters stood, was ready to exonerate his friend from every shadow of blame. Vinton felt as if a crushing weight were lifted by this considerate kindness, and although he scarcely could hope for the future, the present, at least, was freed from dishonor.
                  The conference between the two friends was closed at last by the entrance of Edith. She came with a pressing invitation from her aunt to Mr. Haughton, to make the house his home while in the city. As Vinton cordially urged the same request, and Mr. Rockford entering a few moments later, was most courteous in his offers of hospitality, Paul could do no less than accept, though he had not, on his arrival, by any means, intended to stay with those whom he then scarcely knew whether to consider as friends or enemies.
                  Edith did not long remain, and soon after she was gone Mr. Haughton's bag arrived, and he withdrew to dress for dinner. When they were alone, Mr. Rockford turned to Vinton with the question—
                  "Does Haughton know of your engagement?"
                  "Yes, sir; Mrs. Sandys informed him of it," replied Vinton, and feeling that an explanation of his conduct must be made, whatever might be the consequences, he went on, "I consider his arrival most fortunate, as to him I have been able to explain my reasons for being forced to break it, to his entire satisfaction."
                  "What!" demanded Mr. Rockford, "you have not been so foolish and disobedient as to forfeit your pledge, in direct violation of my commands!"
                  Vinton was indignant at the words and tone, but he replied, with an effort at calmness, "It was impossible for me longer to refuse my mother's entreaties, when I felt that this agitation was so fatal."
                  "So, for the caprice of a half crazy invalid, you have flung away your honor as well as all regard for my wishes."
                  Beyond measure hurt at this outrageous attack, Vinton rose with all the old feelings of antipathy and injustice he had so often struggled to conquer burning in his heart. Yet the sacred name of father must insure respect, and he strove not to forget this as he said—
                  "My mother's requests will ever be my law, sir; I regret having given you cause for complaint. If you please, we will not again speak on this subject."
                  "You're a fool!" muttered Mr. Rockford, as Vinton turned away. He heard the words, but would not permit himself to reply, though he left the room full of the bitterest indignation.
                  Yet once alone he strove, as he had so often done before, to remember that he owed a duty to both his parents, and to forget the cruel words of passing anger, so that when he again met Mr. Rockford, his manner bore no trace of resentment. On the whole he was greatly relieved, the worst was over, he had the inexpressible comfort of knowing that Paul did not blame him, he had lightened his mother's sick bed by his compliance with her wishes, and he had braved the first outburst of his father's wrath. Even his resignation of Mabel might not be forever, though this hope was faint, as the tremulous rays of the evening star when it meets the watchful eyes of the mariner long lost in mist and darkness.
                  The dinner passed off rather stiffly—none of the party were in very good spirits. Edith as head of the family, did her best to maintain some cheerful conversation, and for a while succeeded tolerably well, but even her pale sunshine was destined to be overcast. At dessert the servant handed a note to Vinton. With an apology he read it hastily, and then looked up surprised.
                  "Lionel Rohan has gone South on some law business. Why, Edith, when was he here last?"
                  "Not for some time," replied Edith, feeling how her color was fading away, yet rallying her woman's dignity to conceal her wounded heart.
                  Vinton noticed her paleness with pain. "I am sorry I did not see him to bid him good-bye. He says he has been very much occupied, and begs me to make his adieux to you and mother. Fine fellow! I am sure he will attend to this matter well; indeed, it proves the estimation in which he is held that Mr. Brooks has entrusted him with it. He says he shall be gone three or four weeks."
                  And so Vinton talked on, to give his cousin time to recover. She did indeed maintain her composure for the short while longer that she was compelled to remain at table; but she took the earliest opportunity to escape, and feeling as if her last hope had gone, stole away to her own room, and gave vent to her sorrow and disappointment in a passionate outburst of weeping.
                  When the gentlemen left the dining-room, Vinton went to tell his mother what had passed between the young clergyman and himself. Mrs. Rockford heard the account with a long sigh of relief, and thanked her son for his considerate forbearance in urging no explanation with a fervency that was almost painful.
                  Mr. Rockford took advantage of Vinton's absence to express to Mr. Haughton his regret at the extraordinary dislike of his wife to a match which he considered so eligible, and said so much to express his hope that this was a mere temporary rupture that Paul felt once more, and with keener poignancy than ever, that he had no right to take advantage of this for his own benefit, and realized with a desperate attempt at resignation that he must steel himself against every thought but his plain duty to his friend.
                  They were finally interrupted by Vinton's entrance—he came to say that, if Mr. Haughton was at leisure, his mother would be happy to see him. Of course Paul was gratified with the request, and followed the young man to the invalid's room.
                  Mrs. Rockford still lay on the couch, wrapped in a robe of purple cashmere; a shaded lamp shed a soft light over this boudoir, that was redolent of perfume and filled with all the appliances of wealth and luxury; yet all this could not give case or peace to that suffering woman. Mr. Haughton was inexpressibly shocked at the change which the past few months had wrought in that face and form once so beautiful. When he had last seen her she had been stately and handsome, looking young for her age, strong and vigorous. Now the heavy hair was thickly sprinkled with white, the haggard cheeks were hollow and pale, the brow was contracted with long pain, and the eyes, those glowing black eyes, burnt with fierce lustre, like the despairing eyes of those motionless less men with hearts of flame in the hall of Vathek. Yet she exerted herself to greet Paul cordially, putting out the thin hand whose diamonds glittered with a mockery of the waste wealth could not arrest, and asking him to sit beside her in a voice that she strove hard to render less hollow than usual. After a moment Vinton went away, and then Mrs. Rockford spoke of the matter nearest her heart.
                  "Mr. Haughton, I sent for you this evening, not merely to express to you my pleasure at having you under my roof, and my regret that I am not able to do the honors myself, but also to beg that you will not too severely blame my son for yielding to what must seem to you an unreasonable request."
                  "Do not speak of it, madam," replied Paul; "Vinton has explained to me your illness, and however much I may regret this unfortunate affair for my cousin's sake, I cannot blame him."
                  "You little know," replied Mrs. Rockford, as if deprecating his condemnation, "what sorrow my unhappy position has cost me. I admire and love Mabel with all my heart. I would shield her from harm as I would my own daughter, yet a relentless destiny forces me to forbid at once and forever this most mistaken attachment."
                  "Forever!" cried Mr. Haughton, startled at the solemnity of her words.
                  "Yes, forever! Do not let either Mabel or Vinton think that my views can change. I would give my life to remove the insuperable objection, but it cannot be done, and they had best have no false hopes."
                  Her tone and look carried conviction; here was no idle caprice or insane fancy—she spoke with undoubted sincerity, and with such decision as gave no indication of weakness. After a moment Paul said,
                  "I do not wish to be intrusive, Madame, and I cannot doubt that in your eyes some excellent reason exists for breaking this engagement. But as Mabel's brother, as Vinton's friend, as a clergyman with whom all confidence is sacred, I have a right to ask what is this reason?"
                  "I cannot tell you," cried Mrs. Rockford, pressing her hand to her heart with a gesture of anguish. "You have an undoubted right to demand, to insist upon some explanation of my apparently cruel conduct to your cousin and my son; but I beg, I entreat you to forbear! Is it not enough that I have carried in my heart all these years a secret that has blasted my life, and now is there no way to save my son but by revealing it!"
                  These last strange words were spoken in the shrill accents of despair, and as if wrung from her by the pressure of the moment. Paul heard them with startled suspicion, yet with pity for the evident misery, unable to guess even ever so remotely, what this might mean, he yet felt called upon to console rather than to condemn.
                  "I will not ask, my dear Madam. Do not distress yourself. I am convinced that you do not lightly destroy the hopes of those dear to us. But if you do not care to confide your sorrows to me, remember there is One who ever hears the confessions of the afflicted with tenderest compassion."
                  Mrs. Rockford made a gesture of incredulity. "Mr. Haughton, I have said too much, and too little. Already you must understand that there have been acts in my life, sins if you like, that nothing can ever expiate; it is too late for me to repent, since I can never atone."
                  "Atonement is not for man," replied Paul earnestly.—"He who died to save us can alone expiate our iniquities."
                  "Not mine! not mine!" protested the unhappy woman. "I am dying, Mr. Haughton. Nay, do not urge a useless denial. I know that my disease is mortal—that my hours are numbered, but even in view of the awful future before me, I tell you it is too late."
                  "It can never be too late," urged Paul, interested and touched by this strange mixture of defiance and despair.—"Oh, Mrs. Rockford, if you will but lay your burden at the foot of the Cross, you will have peace in this world, and in the world to come, life everlasting!"
                  "Such are the consolations of your religion," answered Mrs. Rockford, wearily. "You cannot understand how useless they are to me—how little comfort I can have in such a creed. I cannot repair the injury I have inflicted. I will not make the reparation in my power—I do not even repent," she added, with a momentary flash on her haggard face.
                  Paul was inexpressibly shocked, while he could not but pity such utterly hopeless misery. "Pardon me," he said, "if I speak too plainly—but, Mrs. Rockford, I am unwilling to believe that you realize the full meaning of your words. If you have erred—and there is no one who has not—I must think that you regret it. It may be now too late to make any public declaration of the secrets of your life, but in your own heart you must surely feel the need of Divine forgiveness and assistance."
                  "Sometimes I do," assented Mrs. Rockford in a softened tone. "But enough of this. I do not know why I have allowed you to say that which I would never listen to from my own pastor. My whole life has been a mistake—that much I may say in justice to myself. By a system of deception which I can never recall without indignation. I was induced to assume my present position. For these long years past I have lived a lie—I, who scorn falsehood! You can perhaps understand how desperately I have sometimes rebelled against my cruel fate."
                  Full of the most sacred compassion, Paul gently laid his hand on hers, as she paused, pale and exhausted with the effort of long speaking. "I can realize, my dear lady, that you have been sinned against as well as sinning. I beg that you will forgive me if I have said anything to wound you. But oh! let me urge you to remember that God is a God of mercy, and that Christ Jesus has infinite love towards those whom He died to save. Let me entreat you to strive to confess all to Him. Permit me to hope that you will sometimes, when you are stronger, allow me to speak with you again on this all-important subject; and if it is any comfort, let me assure you that I shall always remember you in my prayers."
                  "Thank you," replied Mrs. Rockford, moved by this earnest language. "You are very kind. I am tired now, but I shall always be glad to see you; and believe me, I am grateful for your solicitude, even if I cannot avail myself of your faith."
                  Paul rose; this was evidently no time to urge her farther, but his heart bled for this wretched woman, who, more to be pitied than the humblest laborer, whose lot is cheered by light from above, lay there in her elegant home, struggling with a mortal disease in darkness and despair, with no comfort in the past, and no hope in the future, drifting the wreck of what was once all fair and noble, towards an eternal death.
                  
                  Mr. Haughton did not see her again. The next day she was too ill to receive him, and in the afternoon he bade his friends good bye, with the consciousness that his visit had been a benefit both to them and to him, and so went back to his country parish. Although almost convinced by Mrs. Rockford's assurances that Vinton could never again be Mabel's lover, he yet eloquently plead his cause to his cousin and her daughter. Wisely resolved to take no advantage of his position, he fully exonerated his friend from all blame, and while doing his best to cheer the gentle girl whom he so loved in her strange trial, he never allowed himself by word or look to urge his own suit. Faithfully as John Alden he plead the cause of another, when he longed with yearning heart to plead his own.

                  THE weeks rolled by bringing very little change in their monotonous course. Mrs. Rockford failed surely though slowly, but now that she was relieved from agitation, she had fewer of those attacks of suffering that had been so alarming. Vinton was untiring in his devotion to his mother—up early and late to be by her side, never wearying of reading to her, or amusing her with conversation, or in any other way that she fancied. He had never since Mr. Haughton's visit allowed himself even to allude to his broken engagement, but his cheeks had forever lost their boyish bloom, and the deep lines that marked his once smooth forehead, and the sad expression that had become habitual to his fine eyes, told a tale of silent suffering that could not escape the most careless observer. To Mrs. Rockford every new indication of lost light-heartedness was a fresh stab, and she would often, when her son thought her asleep, lie and watch him under her drooped lids, noting every shadow on his young face, hearing every soft sigh, with an anguish unutterable. She was haunted perpetually by one fear which yet she could not name: the fear that he only awaited her death as a release from his promise, and that when she was once at rest in the grave, he would then, when she could no longer ger interfere, consummate this detestable union. Not that there was anything like hope in that drooping head—those sorrowful eyes, but that she felt how monstrous and unreasonable her request must seem to her son, and knew that she could not blame him if when her entreaties were hushed forever, he followed the dictates of his heart, backed as she knew they would be by the urgent commands of her husband.
                  Mr. Rockford, after that final burst of anger at Vinton's disobedience, had ceased to give unheeded orders, or indeed, even to speak on the subject either to Vinton or his mother, merely showing his displeasure by a sullen disregard of his wife's illness. Cherishing always, however, as she rightly suspected, a dogged determination to carry his point whether she lived or died. Of course, with this cause for anxiety, it was impossible for Mrs. Rockford to resist the disease which constantly made slow but certain progress. She did not now require more watching at night than to have her maid sleep within call, and during the day the attendance upon her was not necessarily unremitting, but she was never again able to leave her own rooms, and there she received the numerous friends who sometimes entertained but oftener wearied her with their idle talk of the gay nothings of the moment, while her heart was so full of secret sorrow.
                  But the household did not suffer in the absence of its mistress. The Misses Vinton lived at elegant lodgings in an unexceptionable establishment, kept by reduced gentility. They were, therefore, restrained by no household ties, and when it became apparent that Mrs. Rockford's illness was to be a long one, they left their cosy rooms, and Miss Cecilia went to make a round of visits in Philadelphia, while Miss Clarissa came to take the part of nurse and chaperone at the Rockford's. This arrangement was a most excellent one for Edith, as it relieved her from that feeling of responsibility which at first oppressed her, and enabled her to receive her friends as usual. Notwithstanding her aunt's urgings she could not bring herself to accept more than a few of the numerous invitations which came in the last gay weeks of the season before Lent, which fell unusually late that year. Somehow society seemed to have lost its attractions for her. Lionel's journey continued beyond the period he had at first fixed for his return, and although she was ashamed of the weakness, she was only too painfully conscious that his absence took away all the interest from what had once been so pleasant. In vain her friend Fanny remonstrated and called her a "mope," she could not feel her usual light heartedness. Her aunt's illness naturally exerted a depressing influence. Her own disappointment was hard to bear, but worst of all, perhaps, was her cousin's quiet, uncomplaining sorrow.
                  They no longer talked of the past trial, but Edith continued to correspond with Mabel, and always silently put these precious epistles into Vinton's hands. He carried them away to his own room and kept them, sometimes for hours, oftener for days; she never insisted upon their return. In this way he learned how the winter wore on in the dull country—how Mabel was interesting herself in the Sunday school, and had taken Edith's place among the poor—how unfailingly kind Mr. Haughton was, and sometimes his praises were so warmly sung that Vinton could not repress a sigh of envy, almost of jealousy. Evidently Mabel had not sunk under this cruel separation, and he wondered sadly if she suffered as he did. Thinking with a passion of regret he could not repress, how probable it was that time and absence would efface his image from her heart. It was very hard to be obliged to keep silence now, and never by word or line try to retain his loosening hold on her affections. But he bravely kept his promise to his mother, although he could not in thinking of the coming summer repress the hope that he should then sometimes be happy with Mabel, even as Paul when he wandered on the shore of the relentless sea thought only how those treacherous waters would bear the gentle Virginia to his arms, never seeing that those smiling waves would hurry her to a terrible death.
                  Of course the receptions at the Rockfords had been discontinued since the illness of the mistress; but Mrs. Rockford, who to all her friends insisted that she was not seriously affected, was very urgent that two should be given in the last two weeks before Lent. Edith was entirely opposed to such a mockery of woe, but Miss Clarissa was delighted with the idea, glorying in the fuss of preparations and the flutter of entertaining, so that Edith was forced to acquiesce, at least, cheerfully. Thus in this house of sorrow and sickness were held two of the gayest revels of the season. The last one especially, on Ash Wednesday eve, was so wild a frolic, that Edith, despite her previous knowledge of the ways of fast New York, was somewhat shocked at the closing dance.
                  At a friend's house she could always avoid these last hours in which a ball expires in a friendly carouse, and could escape the German, that grand rite with which the votaries of fashion celebrate their worship of folly and flirtation; but at home she must of course see it out. She would not join in it herself, but from her post near the door she could view all the details of the scene. The tired band, with pale cheeks and heavy eyes, were indefatigably droning out the music, the long screech of the trumpet sounding, as Edith thought, like a wail above the loud jests and uproarious laughter. Then the panting, flushed circle of guests that sat around the room; the men with crimson faces and glowing eyes, rather unsteady on their legs and incoherent in their speech, the women heated and excited, talking fast and loud, flirting with unblushing openness, and drinking at intervals the champange that their partners with shaky hands poured out from the bottles held in reserve under their chairs; always one or more couples reeling about the room in each others' arms, seeming only to keep their balance by the perpetual motion and the necessities of the music, while ever and anon the whole disorderly crowd would spring up, and after mingling in a maze of dance utterly incomprehensible to the uninitiated, would whirl off like so many Bacchantes. And among these women were not only young girls just entering life, but also wives and mothers, and these last not the least reckless either in drinking or flirting.—And here let me pause to ask, are such scenes good schools for our virgins, or safe recreation for our matrons?—
                  It was the last night of the season, and here were assembled the fastest set of our fast metropolis. This would be their last festivity for some time, and they determined to make the most of it. Among those most at home in this wild revel, was Adrienne Clifford. She had deviated from her usual rule of covering a lack of partners by declining all dancing, and striving to recover some of the lost gayety of youth, had taken her place in the ring with Florance Fay. Rumor said that he had of late grown very dissipated. Tonight he was certainly not himself, and having been refused by several other women because he was so undeniably tipsy, he had been glad of even this passee companion. There was a dull flush on her sallow cheeks, an evil light in her dark eyes, as she slipped from the embrace of one man to another, laughing in shrill tones and making a liberal display of her neat foot and ankle.
                  Edith was sorry to see her friend Fanny Grantham among the party, but she was unusually quiet. Her partner was quite sober, and she did not stay very long.
                  It was no wonder that in such a scene Edith was glad of a dignified and thoughtful attendant, and this she found in Percival Denbigh. His attentions had been unremitting of late, for although she had by this time discovered that people suspected an engagement, she had contented herself, notwithstanding Fanny's remonstrances, with a mere denial when it was hinted, and declining his escort on some occasions when she might otherwise have accepted it. But she could not, and would not, deny herself the pleasure of his society; she was no longer in any danger of yielding to his fascination of manner, but she found him as he had always been, a most delightful companion. He was most scrupulously careful never to give her any cause for alarm, respectfully and adoringly devoted, so thoughtful in anticipating her wants, so tenderly eager to serve her, it was no wonder she looked upon him as a valued friend with whom she would not lightly quarrel. So entirely had he succeeded in lulling her fears to sleep, that she believed that he had never felt for her more than the passing fancy she had felt for him, and that henceforth they were to be the truest friends. The tiger crouched very low and veiled his fiery eyes, but would not his spring be all the more deadly?
                  This evening Denbigh had been with Edith whenever her duties as hostess would permit, and he was by her side when she stood looking over the gay ball-room.
                  "Adrienne Clifford dances well," she remarked, after a moment's pause.
                  "Yes," replied Denbigh, shortly.
                  "She must have been very pretty."
                  "She was called the handsomest woman in New Orleans, fifteen years ago," he said, with a malicious accent on the time.
                  "Why has she never married?"
                  
                  "How should I know?" asked Denbigh, abruptly; then added— 
                        
                           "The more the eggs the worse the hatch,
                           The more the fish the worse the catch,
                           The more the bake the worse the batch,
                           The more the sparks the worse the match,
                           Is a fact in woman's history."
                        
                     
                  
                  Edith laughed, with some light reply, and then Denbigh who saw Miss Clarissa approaching, said—
                  "Won't you find a seat in the library? You must be tired."
                  "No, thank you; as I am not dancing, I think I should stay here. Vinton has gone to see about Aunt Claudia, and I scarcely like us to be all away."
                  "Well!" exclaimed Miss Clarissa, bustling up, throwing all the power of expression that an American lady can put into the monosyllable, making it in some cases as powerful as an oath. In this instance it was as much a relief to her feelings as the naughtiest expletive. "Well! if this were not a reception in my cousin's house, I should call it an orgie! How those girls do go on!"
                  "Young people will love dancing," remarked Denbigh, sententiously.
                  "Dancing, indeed!" cried Miss Clarissa, indignantly. "I wonder what would have been thought of such doings when I was young? Then a gentleman approached a lady as if she were a queen and asked the honor of her hand for the next cotillion. Now, a half-tipsy puppy puts out his arm and says, 'Take a turn!' and the girls don't consider it an insult!"
                  They laughed at this eloquent picture of modern degeneracy, and Ben Fordyce, who had been wandering about disconsolately, came up and said—
                  "What a tiresome, stupid performance! Will it never be over?"
                  "Thank you for the compliment," smiled Edith.
                  "Oh, I beg pardon," blushed Ben; and then his face brightened as Fanny Grantham left the dancers and joined the group.
                  "I can't stand it any longer," she said. "Half the men are not fit to speak to. Florance Fay nearly fell over me just now, and then apologized by saying he tripped over a tack!"
                  Edith's smile was rather sad. Was she to blame also for this? Was his unhappy course the result of unintentional flirting? She felt as if she would never like a man again. "I am sorry to see it," she answered.
                  "I am afraid he is going to the bad very fast. He was tight last night at the Mortimers', and to-night. I wonder Adrienne could dance with him. It is ridiculous to see his desperate attempts to be dignified, and his painful efforts to keep in his place."
                  "You are not going?" exclaimed Edith, as she turned away with Ben.
                  "Oh, no! Only to find a seat."
                  "It is early yet," murmured Ben.
                  "And I suppose, now, you would not mind this stupid performance lasting forever," laughed Edith.
                  "It ought to be over soon," groaned Miss Clarissa as they went off. "It's past four o'clock, and well on in Lent. We ought all to be saying our prayers. At this rate, I wonder who will be able to go to church to-morrow."
                  And to be sure, not long after the band struck, refusing to play anything but "Home, Sweet Home," and the tired revellers were obliged to get away to their houses as well as they could. I regret to say that they did not all reach the paternal mansions in safety. Two young gentlemen (?) finished the night in the watch-house, and Florance Fay was found soon after daylight, washing himself in the gutter, under the impression that he was making his morning toilette.
                  If Miss Clarissa's pious horror of the rowdy doings over night had been great, who shall paint her indignation over the result of the next day's investigations. How she found a plate of oysters emptied into the satin curtains, ice cream spilt on the books in the library, and punch in the piano; how a Sevres vase had been turned into a spittoon, how there were broken plates and glasses under the sofa, and bottles everywhere; how there were crumpled napkins in the music, and a dilapidated hat smashed over her favorite work-box: how the carpet in the supper-room was a mosaic of crushed bon-bons, sugared orange, slices of ham, and boned turkey; and how several forks that were missing for some time, causing grave suspicions of the honesty of the hired waiters, were ultimately discovered behind Mr. Rockford's portrait, with the prongs stuck through the canvass.
                  However, this was the last of such fashionable rows for some time. Lent began, and Edith was glad to be relieved from the necessity of mixing in a gayety that wearied her, and able to enjoy the solemn services of the season, that were like a rest on the Delectable mountains to the pilgrim just escaped from Vanity fair.
                  This change of occupation caused Denbigh to alter his tactics. He was still as often as possible Edith's companion, frequently accompanying her to church, sometimes leaving her at the door, but yielding to her persuasions and going in just often enough to make her rejoice in her simple heart that she was exercising a good influence over him, and resolve to do all she could to recall him to the right path.
                  —No more potent appeal can be made to a gentle and loving woman than that which a man of some good qualities whose life is not what it should be, makes when he entreats her to allow him to be with her, that he may avoid evil associates. It is impossible to refuse a request so humble, so seemingly reasonable, it seems absolutely cruel to deny him her companionship, when he does not abuse her confidence, and when she feels that every hour passed with her is so much time saved from dissipation. It is perhaps a hopeless task to attempt thus to reclaim one who has not the moral courage to restrain himself for his own sake, but many a fair maiden has made the kind endeavor, often, alas, to her cost, as when the gentle La Valiere was lured to her destruction by her fond desire to benefit the fascinating and unscrupulous Louis.—
                  Of course Gossip, with its thousand eyes saw Denbigh's attentions, and with its thousand tongues talked of them, but Edith did not much heed, and was happy to spend most of her time either in attendance upon the services of the season or quietly at home, when not with her aunt occupied in some charitable sewing that interested her. One morning she was deep in her work, with her boudoir littered with coarse flannels and cottons, while beside her was a pile of completed garments of those extraordinary shapes that benevolent ladies construct for their pensioners—(I wonder why clothes cut out for theprotegés of these societies are always so queer? Are poor people's children differently made from rich people's children?)—Here she was roused by a visit from Fanny, who came in, as Edith said, like a fresh breeze bringing life and vigor in her rosy smiles.
                  "Well, I'm glad of it, my dear," replied Fanny, as she tossed aside her hat. "It is high time something roused you, you are grown as placid and quiet as your favorite Sunshine."
                  "I only wish I were as bright," said Edith, with a smile that was not wholly cheerful.
                  "So you are sometimes, but not lately. I never a saw a girl so changed. What is the matter? won't you tell me?" she asked tenderly.
                  Edith's eyes filled with tears at that tone of sympathy, but she hastily brushed them away. "You know I have troubles at home, my dear aunt's illness."
                  Fanny kissed her, and then said, "But she will be better before long, we hope. You must try now to be more cheerful. There is no need of you and Vinton both looking so wretched; every one says Mrs. Rockford will recover when the weather is warm."
                  "I don't know as to that," replied Edith, sadly, "sometimes I fear very much for her, and of course Vinton cannot help feeling terribly depressed at her painful situation."
                  "I am sorry it is so," assented Fanny. "But do please, as long as she is not in immediate danger, try to look as if you took a little interest in life, and above all, Edith, if you really are not engaged to Percival Denbigh, forgive me for saying so, but do not let him be so devoted."
                  "Now, Fanny, don't speak in that way; you know I shall never regard Mr. Denbigh as more than a friend, but as such I must continue to esteem him unless he does something to forfeit my confidence. I think it would be very idle for me to drop him, merely for a little gossip."
                  "But it is not a little gossip," urged Fanny. "Every one thinks you are engaged. I deny it vehemently, but it makes no difference. Adrienne Clifford professes to be an old friend of his, and her insinuations weigh more than my contradictions."
                  "Really," cried Edith, flushing at this. "Miss Clifford can have no right to say anything about me. I am sure Mr. Denbigh is ignorant of this, or he would be as much annoyed by it as I am."
                  Fanny shrugged her shoulders. "You don't know Adrienne," she said, "nor Denbigh either, I fear."
                  "Perhaps not, but I like Mr. Denbigh, and if you will excuse me for saying it, I do not like Miss Clifford."
                  "Nor I either, to tell the truth," replied Fanny. "Adrienne says she does not see the use of having relations if we cannot abuse them. I do not intend to abuse her, but I am not going to make any more excuses for her. She is all honey to strangers, but I believe her natural element is mischief."
                  "Why, Fanny!" cried Edith, astonished at this outburst from her usually good-natured friend—"what has she done!"
                  "Oh, I can't tell you. It is contemptible for me to mind it. I suppose; but she has tried to make trouble between—between—" Fanny hesitated, and blushed.
                  "Well?"
                  "Between Ben Fordyce and myself."
                  "Ah! why that is too bad!" said Edith, who had often, in her own dark prospects, thought with pleasure of her friend's brighter fate. "What does she say?"
                  "Never mind," answered Fanny, who did not like to own what means Adrienne had taken to vex and pique her. "But, worse than that, she has tried to make me dislike you."
                  "What me! Ah, Fanny, that is too wicked.' And then with a sudden suspicion of the truth, she added, "But I know we shall never quarrel; and I am so sorry about my poor friend Fordyce. He would be quite wretched, if cut off from your smiles."
                  "Not if he had yours," sighed Fanny.
                  "Yes he would," protested Edith. "Now, don't let Miss Clifford put any such nonsense in your head. I know that he likes me, and I am proud of his preference, but he loves you."
                  "Oh no!" cried Fanny, blushing, to hear so openly asserted what she had so often hoped.
                  "Yes, he does; and you must not trifle with him."
                  "No danger—no, my dear Edith, I know that he admires you."
                  "I believe he does," said Edith, thinking that now, as always, "honesty was the best policy." "And I am sure so far the feeling is mutual. But I assure you, my dear Fanny, that he had the most passing fancy for me, while I believe that from the first moment he ever saw you he has loved you."
                  Fanny listened with downcast eyes; a weight, which she would not acknowledge, was lifted by these words. She knew her friend would not deceive her, and she resolved that henceforth Adrienne's insinuations should have no power to move her.
                  "I know you think me foolish, ma chere," she said; "but I thank you all the same."
                  "Not foolish at all, dear Fanny: Fordyce is a noble fellow."
                  "And you have nearly made me forget what I came here to say. I am going to have a little company to-morrow night, and I want you to come."
                  "Why, Fanny, it is Lent"
                  "Mi-carêmeme. You know to-morrow is mi-carême. Even your High Church scruples ought not to take offence at that. Besides, I shall only have about twenty people, and no dancing. Come, don't say no. You and Vinton must both come."
                  "Oh, Vinton won't go, I am sure."
                  "Won't he! I am sorry; but you must not fail me. By the way, did you know Lionel Rohan had returned?"
                  "What, has he?" cried Edith, with a start and sudden paleness she could not conceal.
                  "What a queer girl you are, Edith," observed Fanny, regarding her with surprise. "You change color like a chameleon, whenever a man's name is mentioned. Now, I did not suppose you cared a fig for Rohan since you refused him."
                  "I never refused him." faltered Edith, in open-eyed astonishment.
                  "Hear! hear!" exclaimed Fanny, incredulously.
                  "Indeed I did not."
                  "What, really?"
                  "No, on my honor. What made you think so?"
                  "Some of Adrienne's diablerie, then. But why has he looked so blue, lately, and why is he so devoted to her, I wonder?" mused Fanny. Then, as Edith did not reply, she added, "Well, he will be there to-morrow night. She would move heaven and earth to get him. I don't suppose you care for that. But do come."
                  And Edith promised, if her aunt were not worse, that she would come. But did she not truly care for Lionel's return? or what faint hope was it that made the next day so bright, and caused her to take such unwonted pains with her dainty evening toilette?
                  Out of regard to Fanny, she declined Denbigh's escort, which was offered the next morning. But she might almost as well have accepted it, for although Vinton drove to the Granthams with her, he left her at the door; and as she was early, the first group that Lionel saw when he entered the door was Edith, in apparently earnest conversation with the man to whom he supposed her engaged. During all these weeks of absence he had striven to banish her image from his heart, a hundred times he had assured himself that the romance of his life had passed; that nothing remained for him but work; and then, with renewed assiduity, he had devoted himself to the business which called him away. Very well, too, he had attended to the interests of his clients. His success had been beyond his most sanguine hopes, and his name had found honorable mention in the papers of the day. But, how the honest satisfaction he might have taken in this result was darkened by the disappointment that clouded his life! Who was there that would rejoice in his praises? His friends would, of course, congratulate him—some sincerely, some with secret envy—but the heart that he had hoped would share his triumph beat only for another. Yet it was not so. Vinton had told Edith of Lionel's achievements, and at this moment, while apparently she was interested in what Denbigh was saying, in reality she was giving him only the polite semblance of attention, while her thoughts were full of Lionel's coming, and the pleasure she could not help feeling in his success, although she realized with a sigh that she had no rigbt in it or in him. Yet, at his first entrance, she did not see him. She sat at some distance from the door, in a recess, by the fire, so that he had an opportunity for observing her for some time before she noticed him. She wore a grey silk, simply made; her hair arranged in plain bands, without out ornament; and this quiet dress suited well with the slight loss of color, and the pensive expression that had of late become habitual to her. In his eyes she had never seemed so lovely. He admired her even more than as the radiant sunbeam of beauty he had last seen her. There was a more domestic, home look about her, a craving of tender affection in the sweet mouth. For one wild moment, despite his resolves, he gazed on her with a passionate longing to tear her away from every one else, and claim her for his own—then their eyes met.
                  Edith caught and could not help reading that eloquent glance, it sent the blood to her heart, and left her white and trembling, she had thought she was prepared to see him, and yet after all she could not repress her emotion. In one instant pride rallied to her support, while simultaneously Lionel thought—She knows how she has trifled with me, yet she shall not see how I suffer. So they met with a courteous bow, neither daring to take the other's hand, and always under the baleful eyes of Percival Denbigh, who saw those signs of emotion with dismay, and resolved to hasten his evil schemes. Women always recover sooner than men from an awkward situation, so Edith was the first to speak—
                  "I am glad to see you safely returned from your journey."
                  "Thank you, I am happy to be once more at home."
                  "I cannot conceive that any one who has ever known Miss Edith can be wholly contented out of her presence," said Denbigh, suggesting the compliment that Lionel either did not or would not see, and feeling that he must say something to give him an impression of intimacy, he added:—"but perhaps all are not so infatuated as I am."
                  Edith bowed rather coldly, and Lionel was glad that she did not like such open flattery. She hastened to change the conversation.
                  "Will you allow me to congratulate you, Mr. Rohan, on your recent success."
                  "You are very good," replied Lionel, with a slight flush of gratification.
                  Denbigh saw the danger. "We were just speaking of you," he said, as if for him there could be but one "we" in the world. "We were both very glad to hear of your brilliant achievement."
                  Of course Lionel was disgusted at this fulsome compliment. "It was very kind of Miss Rockford to interest herself in so humble an individual," he replied somewhat bitterly—he longed to close this trying scene, but politeness required one more enquiry, "I regret to hear of Mrs. Rockford's continued illness, how is she to-night?"
                  "Rather more comfortable, thank you. Though I almost feel as if I were wrong to leave her even for a few hours."
                  "And so you appear as a Fair Penitent in that grey robe?"
                  "Sackcloth and ashes for my sins," said Edith, trying to smile, though every sneering word and cold tone cut her to the heart.
                  "They must be ashes of roses then," cried Denbigh. "I am sure you can have no sins to trouble you."
                  "Miss Rockford knows best whether she has anything to repent of," said Lionel with a slight contraction of the lips, and before she could reply he had turned away with a ceremonious bow.
                  And this was all; the evening passed without their meeting again. Lionel studiously avoided Edith passing most of the time at Adrienne's side, who alternately tortured him with allusions to Denbigh's happiness, or soothed him with ardent professions of her own friendship. She would not even let him speak with Fanny, who once or twice attempted to talk to him, and whom she shrewdly suspected of a design of enlightening him with regard to the true state of affairs.
                  As for poor Edith, she scarcely knew how she got through those tedious hours. Lionel's unmistakable change of manner hurt and grieved her gentle heart. For one brief instant at his first entrance she had thought they were to meet as before, but his cold greeting, his formal address of "Miss Rockford," the cruel irony of his tone dispelled this hope, and left her to the old conclusion, that he pitied perhaps almost despised her. Her pride was fairly roused, she would not let him perceive her weakness, so she exerted herself to talk and laugh even more than usual, but it was such a desperate effort that she was glad at last to escape to a little quiet with Denbigh, never thinking how every word with him was a pain to one who loved her so well. Everything on that unhappy evening seemed to conspire to her distress. Florence Fay was there and although the party was a quiet one, by supper-time he was hopelessly tipsy; she thought that her trials were over when she had escaped to the dressing-room and was waiting with a group of friends in the hall for her carriage, but at that moment Fay staggered by, his fair face flushed to a dull red, his light eyes bloodshot. As he passed her he made an heroic effort to stand upright.
                  "Have the pleasure of offering myself to you to-morrow, Miss Edith," he stammered, then as he heard the suppressed titter that followed his words, he drew up into a maudlin attempt at dignity, "Don't mind, Miss Edith, excuse me, good night."
                  He stumbled off, catching gladly at the offered support of a compassionate friend. Edith was inexpressibly shocked and pained, and as she turned away to take Denbigh's arm, her eyes met Lionel's; in their stern glances she read only too plainly the reproach of "This too is your work." No wonder the poor girl was glad to quit the trying scene, where she was forced to act a part she could not feel.
                  —What a hateful necessity that is which every woman has sometimes encountered of exerting herself in society, when her heart is heavy with an unavowed grief. Oh the utter weariness of the little nothings she is forced to utter, how after a time her words become mere repetitions, her smiles mere grimaces, and when it is over at last, what a relief to tear off the gay dress that is a mockery of sadness, and in some wild fashion give vent to the long pent up distress!—
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER II.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "——I love that woman tho' I curse
                              Her and myself, yet spite of me I love her!"
                           
                        
                        CATO.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "Love is a superstition that doth fear
                              The idol that itself hath made."
                           
                        
                        SIR THOMAS OVERBURY.
                     
                  
                  AFTER that unhappy evening poor Edith grew more quiet and subdued, yet she did not allow her disappointment to make her fretful or even low-spirited. She always appeared cheerful and was even more than usually thoughtful for the happiness of those around her. She listened without betraying ennui to Miss Clarissa's long stories of her youth, and read aloud by the hour together to her aunt who without intending to be selfishly inconsiderate, was apt to fall into a reverie and allow the reading to go on unheard and uninterrupted, not because any book could interest her, but because the sound of her niece's sweet voice soothed her excited nerves.
                  Edith could not at Fanny's bidding resume her old gayety, when her heart was so heavy, but one concession she made to her friend, she did not permit Percival Denbigh to pay her quite so much attention. It is true she allowed him to continue his visits at the house, so that he was able to keep up the semblance of intimacy, but more than once she declined his escort to church, and this in so decided a manner that he was alarmed for his hold on her friendship. Suspicious always of the motives of others, and noting that this change had been simultaneous with the return of Lionel, he fancied that it must arise from his influence, and was on the alert to prevent any future meetings.
                  Yet he need not have been concerned. Once more returned to his duties, Lionel made a desperate effort to become absolutely absorbed in them, although struggle as he would, Edith's image could not be wholly banished. Of course politeness required that he should call at the Rockfords', but he went in the morning, and merely left a card, a few days after the party. Since then, he had not seen Edith, except twice, when they accidentally met on the street. She was always on the lookout for these encounters, and schooled herself to greet him without emotion, though her heart beat fast. But her smile of greeting was so sad and sweet, that, despite his resolves, it invariably upset Lionel, and so bewildered him that he incontinently ran into three or four unhappy individuals, and cut some of his best friends, before he recovered. But so far from his reading anything of the true thoughts that trembled behind those mild brown eyes, he fancied only that her gentle glances signified pity, perhaps contempt.
                  —What adepts have women ever been at concealment! There are certain secrets of the heart that they value more than life, that they guard as they do their honor. And often, too, this results in a fatal mistake; although a man of true refinement is no doubt disgusted by too open devotion, yet let modest maidens beware, lest by too cold a reserve they repel the homage of an honest but diffident heart. Let them take warning by the old story of the fair Vanda, who, from a false delicacy, not only refused the offer of the gallant Rithogar, because he marched at the head of a conquering army, but actually made war against him. She gained a victory, it is true, but what was it worth when embittered by the news of his death? She could only expiate at once her folly and her love by following him to the inexorable tomb.—
                  Percival Denbigh, who knew quite as well as they did themselves the true state of the feelings of Edith and Lionel, never imagined that pride would long sustain them in a separation. Every meeting might result in an explanation which would forever prevent his hopes. Each day he grew more impatient of the delay to which Adrienne's scruples and Edith's retired life forced him. His passion for the beautiful girl, whom he was absolutely resolved to marry by some means, ere long, had gone on increasing in these past months of restraint, until it had become a devouring flame. But, beside this, there was another all-powerful reason for hastening the proposed union. His debts were heavy; his creditors had grown very clamorous, and several notes were to fall due early in May, which he had no way of meeting, unless he had possession of Edith's small fortune. Of late he had had a good deal more of Mr. S. Lyme's society than he at all relished, and this, with several other annoyances of a serious nature, combined with the heart sickness of a deferred desire, to render him impatient of delay. Yet he could do nothing without Adrienne, who, on one pretence or another, had postponed the final catastrophe, until now the spring was rapidly advancing, and Lent was nearly over. This had not been from any want of inducement; his presents had been most lavish—his future promises, in case of a successful issue, most generous. Feeling this, and summing up all the powerful reasons for haste, it was in no very amiable mood that he one morning went to visit his accomplice. He detested these interviews. Callous as he was, it was not very pleasant even to him to be haunted by the ghost of a dead but not forgotten past. On his way to the house, too, he encountered a dun; so that by the time that Adrienne, after some delay, joined him, he was in a most impatient frame.
                  "What is it now?" she asked, in answer to the vexed exclamation he uttered as soon as they were alone.
                  "I am tired of waiting, Adrienne; I tell you I must have her soon, or I shall lose her entirely. You have have put me off too long already, it is time for action."
                  "Has anything new happened?' she enquired, ignoring his declaration.
                  "Nothing very lately, but I dread that at any moment she and Rohan may have an explanation."
                  "Why, is he there much?" she demanded, with interest.
                  "No, I think not; I see her nearly every day, and she never mentions him."
                  "Ah! I thought so!"
                  "But that makes no difference," he added, maliciously. "You need not be so certain, he perfectly adores her, and the only hope for you is to put her forever out of his reach."
                  "I am sure I have done all I can," said Adrienne, choking down her rising wrath.
                  "No, you have not. You have procrastinated most foolishly. I am afraid already the delay may be fatal. We ought to have carried her off while Rohan was away."
                  "But we had no chance."
                  "You should have found a chance. I am sure you have been well paid," he went on, with unmistakable contempt. "I am tired of your having all the sport, and my having all the trouble. Positively, this must end. I must marry Edith Rockford before the first of May."
                  "Why so soon?"
                  "What's that to you," he demanded, sharply. "Have I not been tortured for three months already?" and he started up and walked about in excitement.
                  Adrienne watched him with a glitter of vindictive triumph in her cruel eyes. "I am very sorry," she said, hypocritically, "but you must remember it is a dangerous game."
                  "What! you are not going to desert me now? You forget those little receipts," he sneered.
                  "Oh no, certainly not, Percival," she replied, drooping her eyes to conceal the hate that glittered there. "Only you ought to remember that, and try to be patient."
                  "Patient!" he cried, with a suppressed oath. "Well, I am! You shall not suffer. Edith has a pretty property, and you shall have your share."
                  "Thank you! Come, now," she added, softly, "sit down here and you shall see that I am not so negligent as you think." Denbigh paused, and she went on, "Do you know the Boyntons?"
                  "What, of Fort Hamilton?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Yes, we have a slight acquaintance."
                  "Very well, they are going to issue invitations on Easter Monday for a supper party at their house. Of course all this set will go, and Edith Rockford no doubt. You must be her escort. It will be a night return. I will take off Rohan. Can you not make something of this?"
                  "Capital!" cried Denbigh, seating himself. "Adrienne, you are a she devil. I mean that for a compliment." He smiled ironically, wondering as he watched that face now so full of evil cunning, how he could ever have admired her, recalling the gentle beauty of the sweet maiden he now professed to love as Lucifer in the midst of some conference with the lost spirits might have remembered the heavenly loveliness of a seraph's face.
                  Some time longer they discussed their evil schemes, and then Denbigh said—"And in the mean time you think you can take care of Rohan?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Don't be too certain. A word from Vinton, or a visit at the Rockfords', might spoil all."
                  "The only way is to give him some further proof of your engagement. I have often thought of a plan which perhaps it would be best now to execute. You have some letters of Edith's?"
                  "Yes."
                  "Let me have them."
                  "What for?"
                  "I will let him see them. That surely will be convincing proof."
                  "But if he reads them he will be undeceived."
                  "Trust me; I know Lionel Rohan," she added, with a pride in his good qualities which she yet could not imitate. "He would not look at one of them without your wish for all the universe."
                  Denbigh shrugged his shoulders. "You are infatuated," he said. "You think him a second Bayard. Best not trust him."
                  "You judge others by yourself," retorted Adrienne, angrily. "I would answer for him as I would for myself."
                  "Yourself!" sneered Denbigh; then as he saw the wrathful flash that followed his words, he added, "However, you remember the homely adage. I know you are clever. I don't believe you will do anything foolish, and I will send you the letters to-night."
                  So they parted, after some further arrangements for future communications. How they hated each other, and yet for the present how necessary they each felt the other to be!
                  This interview had taken place in the drawing room. Denbigh had gone early to avoid any interruption from visitors, and when he left, Adrienne, with slow steps, and in no very happy mood, strolled into the library, where Fanny sat at work. Going to the window, she lifted the curtain, and stood for a few moments looking out into the pleasant avenue. Her heart was full of the bitterest envy and hatred of every bright face that passed. Her own life had been a hopeless failure, and she detested every one whose pros pects were more fair. Conscience, which Providence gives to us all, had not yet been so stifled in her breast, but that she felt the full amount of the enormity of the deed in whose accomplishment she was about to assist, but this caused no relenting in her evil brain. She had not one thought of compassion for the innocent girl whom she was hurrying to a fate worse than death. Her very purity and loveliness, so far from disarming her, made her only the more desirous to drag her and every other good being to her own degraded level. Then, too, lost as she was to all independence or high-mindedness, she yet was not so callous as to be indifferent to the contempt Denbigh's bribes gave him a right to feel for her; and lastly, she was beyond measure annoyed and disappointed at Lionel's indifference to all her blandishments. He still continued, it is true, to be her devoted friend, but the instant she insinuated any warmer sentiment he drew back so decidedly that she was positively afraid to persist. For all her brave assurances to Denbigh, she felt how slight was her real hold upon this young man, whom she yet, with all the earnestness of her bad nature, passionately adored. At any moment he might see her in her true character, and she might lose even the tantalizing pleasure of his society. Her only hope was in destroying all his confidence in female purity by ruining Edith, and then in the first reaction she dared to dream that her faded charms might awaken a responsive interest. In the depths of her evil soul she longed for that time, and chafed with impotent rage at all that thwarted her path. So she stood there, her heart a wild chaos of envy, hatred and malice, and all uncharitableness. Had she possessed the fabled gift of the evil eye, she would certainly have blighted a cheery, honest face, that looked up at her sad eyes with a friendly nod.
                  "Why Fanny," she cried, "here is an extraordinary phenomenon. Ben Fordyce out making morning calls"
                  "Indeed," said Fanny, dropping her work, and half rising in some perturbation.
                  "Yes, he is coming in, too. I wish you joy of such a stupid visitor."
                  "He is not stupid," protested Fanny, indignantly.
                  Adrienne shrugged her shoulders. "Chacune à son goût."
                  
                  "I am very glad that our tastes don't agree," retorted Fanny.
                  "So am I. I can't say I ever liked other people's leavings, not even Edith Rockford's."
                  "How can you endure Lionel Rohan then?"
                  "He never proposed," resumed Adrienne with a flush.
                  "It was not for want of inclination, though. For my part I am happy to be second after my noble friend."
                  And here the waiter entered with a card.
                  "I am going," said Adrienne. "So have you beau and bore all to yourself," and with this Parthian arrow, she departed. It fell harmless, however. Fanny forgot that and everything else in her greeting of the radiant Ben.
                  —I think a man must feel very queer when he has regularly made up his mind to offer himself to a woman and sallied forth for that purpose. There must be something so awkward in the promulgation of the awful question—"Will you have me?" That is one of the few trials from which our sex is exempt. I have heard it said by an "old campaigner," that the only privilege the men have left us is the power of refusal, and looked upon in a certain point of view it atones for a great deal.—
                  In this case, however, Ben need not have feared any such cruel fate. Yet as he had not the ability which we have of reading the lady's heart, a considerable amount of trepidation mingled with his hopes. To be sure Fanny's manner had not been wholly discouraging, but he had an honest diffidence in his own desirability; he was not so rich as Sedley, or so stylish as some of her other admirers, but then he was quite certain none of them loved her as much as he did. For sometime past he had been anxious as he represented it to put himself out of misery by knowing the worst, and this morning he had courageously resolved to "conquer or die." It was not without many misgivings that he entered the presence of the fair coquette, yet one reflection consoled him, he was not astride of "Bones," and had not that unsympathizing quadruped to contend with.
                  As for Fanny, with the rare intuition of her sex she suspected the object of the visit, and in presence of his embarrassment became quite calm and collected. She tried hard at his entrance to give him a hint to sit beside her on the sofa, but he was provokingly obtuse, taking a chair on the other side of the room, so there was nothing for it but to attempt a commonplace conversation. We have seen that Ben was never very brilliant at this, and so after a few moments there came an awkward silence, which Ben employed by looking in an innocently wondering way at his exceedingly pretty vis-à-vis. This naturally was rather trying, and Fanny sought occupation by resuming her work. It was a piece of embroidery, representing a lion crouched in an elaborate jungle. Her pattern had slipped down, and instead of picking it up she went on working with some blue worsted she happened to have on her needle, in the eye of the King of Beasts, giving him a most peculiar appearance of innocently mild vision.
                  "You are very industrious," observed Ben, after a while, "I hope I do not trouble you."
                  "Oh, no, not at all," replied Fanny, and then catching Ben's glance, and reading something that made her heart beat, she went on, filling up all the unoccupied space on the lion's face with blue, so that he looked as if he were weeping copiously.
                  "What is it you are so busy about?"
                  "Oh, here's a chance," thought Fanny, and aloud, "come and see."
                  Ben felt as if he had stepped into a balloon which was going to take him straight to Paradise, as he crossed the room and took a seat beside her on the sofa. Seeing this Fanny continued rapidly tattooing the lion's nose.
                  "What is it," asked Ben, leaning over her.
                  Fanny spread the work out on her lap with hands that trembled a little. "Don't you know what it is, or must I write under it as the painter was forced to under his picture—this is a lion."
                  "It looks like a lion to be sure," said Ben, "but what funny eyes he has."
                  "Oh," cried Fanny, crumpling it up with a blush—"that's a mistake."
                  "Oh no, let me see," and he drew it out again. "What a sentimental beast he is to be sure, why he is crying so that his tears run in a perfect stream."
                  Fanny laughed. "You are too bad to make sport of my stupidity; here, look at the pattern."
                  "Oh this is different, why this lion is quite fierce, so it is your tenderheartedness that has made him weep over his sins. I suppose he is lamenting the little Hottentots he has recently devoured."
                  "No more impertinence," cried Fanny. "The idea of a man attempting to criticise embroidery! I shall put it away."
                  "No, no," exclaimed Ben, "I have a mind to study natural history. Perhaps you meant these marks for tatooing. Do they tatoo lions in Africa?"
                  "Give it to me," persisted Fanny.
                  "No," reiterated Ben, retaining the pattern. There was a slight struggle during which her hand touched his, and the balloon rose several yards. Ben was disarmed, he released the work, and said with a sigh.
                  "Ah! Miss Fanny, I wish Beauty were as kind as you have made the Beast."
                  "You are enigmatical," replied Fanny after a pause.
                  "Do you not pity your victims?"
                  "Now for it," thought Fanny, but she answered demurely, "I never have any victims."
                  "Oh, Miss Fanny! why, I'm one."
                  "You, Mr. Fordyce!"
                  "Yes, have you no compassion?" and Ben's heart beat so that he thought she must hear it, while the balloon vacillated most uncomfortably.
                  "What shall I do? cry?" asked Fanny maliciously, enjoying his confusion. Ben thought her profoundly indifferent, and the balloon went down with a run.
                  "Oh, Miss Fanny, I deserve this, it was foolish for me to hope, but you have made me very wretched," he burst out sadly.
                  "Ah," thought his serene tormenter; "I have gone too far; I might as well help him a little," so she looked up with most bewitching simplicity. "Why should you be wretched?"
                  "Because I love you, and you don't care for me," he cried impetuously.
                  "Oh, Mr. Fordyce!"
                  There was a pause, during which the balloon collapsed utterly. Ben sat with hands tightly clasped looking on the floor, the picture of despair. Fanny stole a side glance at him, and generously resolved to end his misery.
                  "Is that all you have to trouble you?"
                  "Yes," tremulously and scarcely daring to think.
                  "Then I don't think you need mind." Fanny almost whispered the words, but they were enough, in an instant a pair of strong arms were around her, and Ben was going on in such wild fashion as took away her breath. She was very happy though, and as for him, after all the balloon had taken him to Paradise.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER III.
                  
                     
                        
                           "Oh! colder than the wind that freezes
                           Founts that but now in sunshine play'd,
                           Is that congealing pang that seizes
                           The trusting bosom when betrayed."
                        
                     
                  
                  IT was like a ray of light to a weary wanderer in a dark path, when Fanny announced to Edith her engagement—Poor Sunshine was sadly dim and cloudy when she was roused from her dismal reverie by the arrival of her joyous friend. But the declaration of the object of her visit dispelled for awhile all gloom, and her smiles and congratulations were as earnest as if no shade rested on her heart.—When the first excitement was over, Edith asked—
                  "And what do papa and mama say?"
                  "Oh, they like it very much; it seems Ben's mother was an old friend of my mother's."
                  "That's nice; and how about Miss Clifford?"
                  "She pretends to be all smiles. 'So pleasant for dear Fanny to have a real attachment,'" she said, imitating her cousin's manner. "She has quite left off troubling me about you."
                  "I am glad of that."
                  "Yes," continued Fanny, laughing, "there was no use. I told her once for all I did not care if you had refused Ben."
                  "What!" cried Edith, dismayed. She had not intended to betray her friend's secret.
                  "Oh, you need not try to look innocent. Adrienne discovered it long ago. No use to try to be a simple little humbug, Ben has confessed."
                  "Well," replied Edith, relieved, "if he has told you the whole truth he must have said that he never cared for me except as a friend. I know he never loved me in the least."
                  "As to that I can't say," answered Fanny, looking pleased, "I only know I am very glad you had the bad taste not to take him, so that I may have him."
                  "I was sure you would just suit each other!" Edith went on triumphantly, rejoiced that the last cloud was dispelled. "I am so glad," and she kissed her friend again who then announced that the happy man was waiting down stairs. Together they descended to the drawing-room, where Ben was discovered walking up and down like a sentinel on guard, and whistling desperately.
                  "How rowdy you are," cried Fanny, and Edith advanced with outstretched hands.
                  "Oh, Mr. Fordyce, I congratulate you with all my heart!"
                  Ben colored furiously, and in his embarrasment gave her little fingers such a wrench that it was with difficulty Edith could refrain from screaming. "Thank you," he said, forgetting to let go his hold.
                  "There! there!" remonstrated Fanny, "that will do!"
                  "I beg pardon," exclaimed Ben, dropping the hand, "I hope I have not hurt you."
                  "Not much," replied Edith bravely, and Fanny said—
                  "You ought to have had more pity for the Bones." At that unlucky word, Edith's eyes met Ben's, and his expression was so comically woful that she could not help laughing; after a moment he joined her, followed by Fanny, and in that outburst of merriment the last shade of embarrasment between them vanished utterly.
                  But although there were some gleams of brightness in Edith's life, yet this was a very dark period with her. Her aunt's illness, her cousin's sorrow, and now her friend's engagement made her feel more lonely than ever. She was very isolated, having no father or mother, brother or sister. It is true, her relations were very kind, she knew that they felt the tenderest attachment for her, yet to neither of them was she first, and she had such a craving for sympathy and affection! She was fast outgrowing her youthful fondness for the frivolities of society, she felt the want of something better than a tedious round of parties; something more substantial than the flattery that wearied her. Hers was a tender and loving disposition; she knew she should be most truly happy could she escape from the detraction and malice of the great world to a quiet home with one who loved her above all others, and then on her memory rose the image of Lionel with the wistful, passionate look she had read in his eyes for one brief instant, until her gentle heart grew heavy with the weight of unshared anxieties.
                  —Ah, why is it that it is the inexorable destiny of woman to love, and to love so soon! Why can they not a little while enjoy the innocent happiness of youth, before the great mystery of life overshadows their first light-heartedness! All too soon to the young girl wandering on the golden shore of childhood, comes the song of enchantment. She listens with eager happiness to the delicious music of the spell; the rosy blossoms that once amused her lose their power; they are thoughtlessly flung away, and full of hope she embarks on the great ocean of love. It has its beauty, no doubt. There are hours of restful calm, and the murmur of baby voices is second in sweetness only to the syren song that first enthralled her, but always she must guard the rudder and trim the sails—the joyous carelessness of youth is over now—the flowers of spring, the tranquil shade of the shore are lost forever!—
                  In the midst of her perplexities, Edith still with simple trust continued to regard Denbigh as a friend in whom she might confide. Yet, from regard to the remonstrances of Fanny and some others of her young companions, she persisted in declining his escort to any public place. It pained her much thus constantly to have to refuse his apparently reasonable requests, when she could not but see the disappointment he took no pains to conceal. At first she contented herself with gentle assurances that it was from no lack of esteem that she declined his attentions, but an incident that occurred at this time made her finally resolve frankly to tell him her real reason.
                  One day, after dinner, when she was about going off as usual to sit with her aunt, she was arrested by a most unusual request from her uncle, for a few words in the study. Very much surprised she followed him in silence, her heart beating a little with that nameless anxiety we sometimes feel after a long season of trial at anything unexpected. However, her uncle relieved her by saying, as soon as the doors were closed—
                  "My dear Edith, I have to communicate to you a most flattering proposition I have recently received for you."
                  "Indeed," said Edith, nervously—"what is it?"
                  "Mr. McDuff has done me the honor to make a formal proposal for your hand."
                  "Oh, uncle!" cried Edith, distressed.
                  "He is very wealthy," pursued Mr. Rockford. "Of an excellent family, highly respectable, in short in every way unexceptionable."
                  "I am very sorry he should have thought of such a thing," replied Edith, decidedly. "But, indeed, I cannot accept him—please tell him so as kindly as you can, dear uncle."
                  "Don't be rash," said Mr. Rockford, sternly. "It is not often that so desirable a match is offered. You had better take time for reflection."
                  "Oh, no! that would be no use. I shall never regard him otherwise than as a friend, and you had better tell him so at once."
                  "I have no right to coerce you," continued Mr. Rockford. "Nor would I wish to if I could, but I think you had better consider it."
                  Edith shook her head. "My mind is fully made up."
                  "Why, what is your objection?"
                  "I—I don't like him," faltered Edith, growing every moment more pained.
                  "Perhaps you prefer some one else," suggested her uncle gravely.
                  Edith blushed so vividly at this that he could not help with her silence interpreting it to mean an acquiescence.
                  "I should regret to find it so," he said slowly—"Mr. McDuff feared something of the sort, but I assured him it was a mistake."
                  "What!" cried Edith, alarmed at the thought that others had guessed her secret. "What do you mean, uncle?"
                  "He said that he had heard you were engaged," explained Mr. Rockford; "but I told him it could not be that you would have taken such a step without my knowledge."
                  "You are right," said Edith, looking up proudly. "I have no thought of any such thing. But to whom did he suppose me engaged?"
                  "To Mr. Denbigh."
                  "Ah!" cried Edith, at once relieved that her preference was not suspected, and annoyed at this new evidence of the currency of this tale. "There is no foundation for that silly report, and I beg that you will tell Mr. McDuff so."
                  "Then you will consider his proposal?"
                  "No, I cannot—that would not be fair to him. No amount of reflection can alter my determination. You must assure him that I appreciate the honor that he has done me, and that I shall always regard him as a friend, but I cannot accept him."
                  "You are your own mistress," grumbled Mr. Rockford.
                  "There, there! uncle," said Edith, rising with a smile, "don't worry that you have me on your hands a little longer." She kissed him with such grace that his cold brow relaxed, his sweet niece had perhaps the warmest spot in his iron heart, and he submitted to allowing her to escape without further expostulations.
                  But although she closed the interview thus lightly, Edith was much distressed that she was obliged to inflict the mortification of a refusal upon this man whom she really esteemed. Very closely she examined her own conduct, to discern wherein was the wrong which had resulted in his mistaking mere friendship for decided preference. She could not recall anything that warranted his conclusion. She was not aware—how should she be?—how much there was to encourage in her bright, cordial manner—how sunny her smile of welcome was to nearly every one, how flattering her gentle interest in the dullest conversation. But it was reflecting on this event that made her resolve to tell Denbigh decidedly why she could no longer accept his attentions.
                  As if inspired by a foreboding, the unlucky McDuff had chosen Good Friday for his hapless offer. He was himself a stanch Presbyterian, and it never occurred to him how inauspicious was the day selected. Lent was fairly over, Easter Sunday was a balmy, mild day, and the avenue was gay with Spring toilettes. Mrs. Rockford seemed to revive with the warmer weather, and looked better than she had for a long time, when on Monday morning, as she reclined in an easy-chair by the open window, Edith came with an invitation to the Boyntons for herself and Vinton. These Boyntons were a pleasant family residing at a handsome country seat, near Fort Hamilton. The young ladies, two very pretty girls, had been a good deal admired in the past winter, and they were desirous of returning some of the numerous ous civilities they had received. So they availed themselves of this first weather that was suitable, to invite some thirty of their especial friends to drive out to their place before dark, have a dance, and return by moonlight. There was a novelty in the entertainment that pleased the fortunate few who were "expected," and nothing had been talked of lately among Edith's friends but the preparations for the expedition. Mrs. Rockford was quite earnest to have her niece go, and had just persuaded her to accept, when Percival Denbigh sent up his name.
                  Edith went down to meet him with the card in her hand and was very glad to find that he too had "an invite."
                  "Then you are going, Miss Edith?"
                  "Yes."
                  "I hope I shall not annoy you; but I came to offer my services as your escort."
                  Edith hesitated. She certainly would prefer to have him with her, as Vinton she knew would not go, and there was no hope of Lionel. Yet she would not decidedly accept. She must consult her cousin first, and then with a little charming embarrassment she told him why it was that she was forced to decline his polite attentions. Denbigh heard with a surprise that would have deceived one more suspicious, and then with the utmost apparent frankness expressed his regret that she should have been so annoyed, his entire sympathy with her feelings. Yet how closely he watched her for any betrayal of her heart! How he longed to discover some emotion that would indicate an interest, well as he knew that Rohan alone held her preference, he yet could not but entertain a wild hope that his overwhelming passion would awaken a response. But she was provokingly serene; the first hesitation which had naturally accompanied the opening of the subject over, there was only the old look of calm friendship in her soft eyes, and it was with a sigh that was wholly unfeigned, that Denbigh said as he rose—
                  "You are right in this, as you are in everything, Miss Edith. But I hope that you will allow me this last honor. I shall leave for the South before long, and I assure you I will never again annoy you with my attentions." There was a gleam of desperate triumph in those fierce eyes as he uttered the last words. Regret for the present coldness was swallowed lowed up in wild anticipation of the rapidly-approaching hour when she should be wholly his.
                  "If I consent in this, Mr. Denbigh, you will not again give me the pain of declining?"
                  "No, it shall be the last time," said Denbigh; and that thought made the hand tremble strangely that he placed in hers for farewell. How little either of them knew how surely that would be the last time!
                  Denbigh had accomplished what he regarded as a final success, and his heart was full of tumultuous anticipations. His accomplice, too, had not been idle. She had already secured Lionel as her escort to the Boyntons', and assured him that Denbigh was to go with Edith, before he had taken the first step towards asking her. But closely as her enemies were drawing the net around her, Edith had still some friends who were not wholly negligent of her interests. Fanny Grantham had, ever since the party at her house, dimly suspected the true state of her friend's heart. Determined to discover first if Lionel were indifferent to so much loveliness, she had contrived, despite Adrienne's vigilance, to say a few words to him one day when he was calling at the house. The interest which he could not conceal, the blush which followed her jesting, convinced her that it was, as she expressed it, only her cousin's diablerie and Denbigh's devotion that stood between them. But Adrienne was very wary, and she interrupted them before Fanny could say half what she wished. Baffled thus, the quick-witted lady instantly decided on a plan of action which she was sure must result in such happiness for her darling Sunshine as she was then enjoying herself. Her engagement was announced, and full of the new dignity and independence which this gave her, Fanny boldly resolved on an unprecedented course. Accordingly on this very bright Easter Monday morning, as Vinton was on his way down town, his heart rather lighter, and his step rather freer, under the influence of the beautiful weather and his mother's apparent improvement, he was surprised by being suddenly joined by the handsome brunette.
                  "Good morning, Vinton. Don't stop; I will walk on with you. I have something to say."
                  "Indeed, Miss Fanny! That's very unusual with you."
                  "Now don't be disagreeable. What I have to tell you is really important, and will require all your wits, I assure you."
                  "Very well then, what is it? You don't want to sue Fordyce for breach of promise, do you?"
                  "No, impertinent! Listen to me now. What is the matter with Lionel Rohan?"
                  "With Lionel Rohan!" repeated Vinton, amazed. "I don't know; is he ill?"
                  "No, not ill, incorrigible! but why does he never go to your house?"
                  "I don't know. Does not he?"
                  "No; there see. How selfish you are!" cried Fanny. He has not been there but once since he came home."
                  "How do you know?"
                  "I asked him, and he said so."
                  "That is odd," observed Vinton.
                  "Odd! Of course it's odd. Do you suppose he does this without any reason?"
                  "No, hardly. Really, Miss Fanny," continued Vinton, with serious interest, "I believe I have been very selfish. I never noticed. I did think it strange he did not come to bid us good-bye, but I saw his card and I concluded he called as usual now. Do you know what is the matter?"
                  "Yes, at least I guess it."
                  "What! You don't think Edith can have refused him?" cried Vinton, stopping short in horror at the idea.
                  "No; she says not, and you know she is truth itself. But I fancy he thinks she likes Denbigh."
                  "Well, so she does."
                  "Oh dear, how stupid men are!" exclaimed Fanny. "I mean he thinks she is in love with him."
                  "But she is not."
                  "I know it, and that is exactly what I want you to tell Rohan."
                  "Tell him so! But then he would think it very queer. I don't want to fling Edith at his head!"
                  "Oh, you are so matter of fact!" said Fanny, in despair. "I don't want you to blurt it out, but could you not bring it in mildly?"
                  "Perhaps I could—I must try," answered Vinton, really as desirous as Fanny could possibly be to set this matter straight. He was very glad that she had told him, and he thanked her heartily. Then Fanny approached the second object of this encounter. She mentioned the expedition to the Boyntons', which he, in his absorption with his own sorrows, had either not heard of or not noticed, and then suggested that he should manage matters so that Lionel and Edith should go together. Fanny was quite sure if that could be done that it would be all right.
                  "Now, see, Miss Fanny," cried Vinton, "I am not so dull after all. I have an idea."
                  "Wonderful!" retorted Fanny.
                  "A very good idea, too, though I am a 'stupid man.' I will offer Lionel my pony phæton, and then of course he must take Edith."
                  "Capital! Why, you are getting brilliant. Now I will leave you. I had to meet you here, as I did not want either Adrienne or Edith to suspect anything, as they would if I had seen you either at my house or yours."
                  "Won't you walk farther? I shall be happy to have your escort."
                  "No, we are nearly at Canal street, and I never go below."
                  "Besides, Fordyce might be jealous. Well, good bye."
                  And so they parted, Fanny glorying in her success in outwitting Adrienne, as she hoped, while Vinton, with several new ideas in his head, reproaching himself for the selfishness that had prevented him from sooner suspecting what Fanny had just told him, went at once to Lionel's office. He found his friend busily employed at a table covered with books and papers, and looking so harassed and over-worked that he was at once certain that he too had a heart-felt sorrow. Indeed, as the two young men shook hands and sat down together, it was painful to trace the alteration which the past months had made in those faces once so smooth and happy, and their first words were a mutual injunction not to work so hard, as if it were mental toil alone that had traced those deep lines. This over, Vinton at once, after the manner of men, plunged in medias res.
                  
                  "Are you invited to the Boyntons?"
                  "Yes."
                  "I am glad of it. I cannot go myself, of course, on my mother's account, but I want you to drive my ponies and take care of Edith."
                  Lionel colored so vividly at this unexpected remark, that Vinton was certain his cousin's name was by no means indifferent to him. "You are very kind," he said. "I should like it very much, but I have already promised to wait on Miss Clifford."
                  Here was an unexpected disappointment, and Vinton could not help exclaiming—"How provoking! It's no business of mine, to be sure; but how can you endure that woman?"
                  "She has been very kind to me," replied Lionel, rather stiffly.
                  "Well, it's your own affair; but I took a dislike to her from the first. I don't believe there is either honor or honesty in her composition. However, you need not get excited, I shall not abuse her any further. But you know my phæton seats four, so you might as well take the ponies, and if you do have to wait on Miss Clifford, you can take care of Edith too."
                  (This was not a very brilliant arrangement, but I fancy it was as near right as most men would have been.)
                  "I should be most proud of the honor; but perhaps Miss Rockford would prefer some one else," suggested Lionel.
                  "Why, my dear fellow!" cried Vinton, remembering Fanny's injunctions and wishing to get at it mildly; "what do you mean? Who should she like better than you?"
                  "It is not for me to guess at Miss Rockford's preferences," said Lionel in a maze, anxious to avoid betraying the secret which he had accidentally discovered, yet wondering at the deception which Edith must have practiced to conceal her engagement from her cousin.
                  "I do not believe she has any preferences which you do not know," continued Vinton. "I am sure she has not a friend in the world whom she values more than she does you."
                  "I wish I could think so," sighed Lionel. "But whether it be so or not, now that you have so kindly confided her to my charge, I shall do all that I can to make the expedition pleasant to her."
                  "Thank you; but I am sorry you can't go with her," added Vinton, trying another tack. "I am afraid now she may go with Denbigh."
                  "I think that is the plan," assented Lionel.
                  
                  "If it is, I am sure Edith don't know it," cried Vinton, in fresh surprise.
                  "Perhaps not," said Lionel hastily, fearing he had betrayed himself. "I dare say other people arrange these things without consulting those most interested."
                  "It may be so; but even if he is with her, I shall feel more secure of her safety if I know that you are near. I don't like Denbigh."
                  Lionel did not reply, he scarcely liked to echo this sentiment, considering all that he knew, and Vinton went on,
                  "There is something about him that I distrust and although I believe he is tolerably steady now, and I know nothing tangible against him, I yet never like to see him with Edith. He is at our house constantly; but she is so kind-hearted she won't send him off, though I know she don't like it, and so people have got up a silly story that they are engaged."
                  Lionel was puzzled for an answer, and so contented himself with the non-committal one of "Indeed!"
                  "Yes, I dare say you have heard it?" queried Vinton.
                  "Yes, I have," said Lionel shortly.
                  "But you do not believe it?"
                  "I don't know."
                  "It is not so, I assure you," protested Vinton, earnestly. "He is with her often, to be sure; but the poor girl has had a great deal to trouble her this winter, and I think he amuses her when she is low spirited, that is all."
                  Lionel was at once pleased and distressed—pleased at the faint hope that would arise at these words, but distressed at the possibility of such hypocrisy as Edith must have been guilty of, so to deceive one so dear as her cousin. And then those clear eyes rose on his memory with such a look of truth and innocence that he wondered if, after all, he could have made a terrible mistake, and would not refuse to listen with eager interest to Vinton's loving description of his sweet cousin's unselfish devotion to the comfort of those around her, and his earnest assurances that she was certainly not engaged to Denbigh. When Vinton quitted his friend he thought that he had made all smooth, and pleased himself with anticipations of coming happiness. In truth, he left Lionel in a chaos of contending emotions—he recalled all that he had himself seen as proof of the engagement ment that could not be denied, and yet when he remembered how simple and guileless was Edith's nature, he could scarcely doubt that Vinton must know the real state of the case. He was half inclined to rush to the Rockfords, and once for all end this suspense; but then it was not honorable to woo another man's love, and he was under a promise to spend this evening with Adrienne Clifford.
                  When Fanny saw her cousin, under pretence of wishing to read, take a book and retire to the library, she strongly suspected that she was expecting a visitor and resolved to anticipate her. Accordingly, when the bell rang, she looked in the hall to see who it might be. Fortune did not favor her; it was a party of young friends whom she was obliged to entertain in the drawing-room, and she had the mortification of hearing Lionel come in some time after, and go at once to the library.
                  The room was lighted only by a shaded lamp; it was very warm, and as soon as he opened the door Lionel recognized the powerful odor of patchouli, Adrienne's favorite perfume, which she used in such large quantities that one might almost suspect there was a design in it. She was there then, yet at first he did not see her; she lay on the sofa with a gaudy Afghan thrown over her, apparently asleep—her wary eyes were veiled by the heavy lids, yet it was surely not profound repose that made her breathing so quick, nor was it mere carelessness that left so wide-apart her open dress, and displayed so liberally her heaving breast. Lionel did not suspect that she had been on the alert near the door till the moment of his entrance. But it struck him that she was not asleep, and the moment he perceived her, with gentlemanly delicacy, thinking that she would be mortified at being so discovered, he stepped back to the door, and, with his hand on the knob, said "Miss Clifford" so loudly that Adrienne could not refuse to hear it and start up with feigned surprise. Her ruse had failed then. He had never thought of availing himself of that moment of unconsciousness to steal a harmless caress, as he had done one bright autumn morning to a fairer sleeper. All her studied attitude had been lost, and her heart was full of disappointment and vexation as she came forward with her honeyed smile, and her lingering pressure of the hand.
                  
                  "Ah! dear Lionel, I am so glad to see you. I believe I was asleep."
                  "I hope I did not disturb you."
                  "Oh, no, you could never disturb me. I am always so happy to have you with me. Don't sit in that stiff chair—come here on the sofa."
                  Lionel obeyed, and took his place beside her. She saw at once that he was preoccupied; he did not notice her blandishments, but sat gazing abstractedly before him. After a moment there was a pause. Adrienne studied his handsome profile with an intense longing desire she could not repress. Would those fine eyes forever look coldly on her? those firm lips never meet hers in a responsive caress. Nothing but an absolute dread of the result restrained her from flinging her arms around him, and unblushingly avowing her devouring passion. Yet how profoundly indifferent he was! at that moment his whole heart was full of another, and it was only by mentioning her name that she could awaken any interest. With a secret malediction, Adrienne at last broke the silence with a remark about Edith and the proposed expedition. Lionel roused himself instantly to tell her that Vinton had visited him that morning, and the arrangement for the drive. Adrienne was delighted; it was exactly what she wished. "Such a pleasant parti carrie," she said. Another silence, and Adrienne unable to control herself wholly, slipped her hand into his.
                  "Dear Lionel, I wish I had your picture."
                  "Do you?" laughed Lionel, surprised.
                  "Yes, you are so handsome."
                  "Nonsense," cried Lionel, impatiently. Then reading something of the secret distress she could not conceal in her languishing eyes, he said, kindly, "I believe you really are a good friend of mine, Addie."
                  "Indeed I am!" fervently, and squeezing his hand.
                  "And yet, do you know," he continued, in his interest in what he was saying dropping her clinging fingers and turning fully towards her, "I am afraid that Denbigh has induced you to deceive me."
                  "How?" gasped Adrienne, aghast.
                  "Are you absolutely certain that he is engaged to Miss Rockford?"
                  "Perfectly so," replied Adrienne; and then with her instinct stinct of caution, reserving a loop-hole of escape, in case of the worst, she added, "at least he has told me so with such solemnity that I cannot doubt him, besides you know what we have seen."
                  "Yes," hesitated Lionel. "Yet Vinton does not know it, and I do not think she would deceive him."
                  "Peut être," said Adrienne with a shrug.
                  "It will be infamous if I have been duped!" exclaimed Lionel, indignantly.
                  "I don't think you have been," rejoined Adrienne. "I am not in Miss Rockford's confidence, but Denbigh was here to-day, telling me how he hoped soon that his engagement would be announced. He is desperately in love; he carries her notes in his pocket next his heart."
                  "What! does she write to him now?" asked Lionel, staggered.
                  "Yes, they can't meet every day, you know, and I suppose lovers are very silly. By the way, he dropped one of her billets doux here to-day. Will you return it? Here it is."
                  Adrienne took from her work basket a letter and carelessly handed to him. The envelope was fresh, without post mark, but only too well he knew that dainty writing.
                  "No!" he said, starting back as if it were a viper, "don't give it to me."
                  "Oh, yes, why not? I know he will want it."
                  "You must get some other messenger," he replied sternly.
                  "Now don't be obstinate," she said, coaxingly, "I have no one to send, you know."
                  "If he values it so much let him come for it himself, then."
                  "Oh! but he will not know where he lost it, and there is no one here to take it," she repeated.
                  "Put it in the post then."
                  "How cross you are, dear Lionel," laughed Adrienne, satisfied now that she had gained her object. "Well, I will, you won't refuse to mail it though."
                  "No; certainly not," replied Lionel, with an effort conquering his hesitation, and restored to his wonted amiability, "if you will put it up."
                  Adrienne complied. She enclosed it in a fresh cover, addressed it, but did not stamp it or seal it. Lionel did not notice this, however, as he thrust it away in his pocket as if it would burn him. He could not stay after that, and Adrienne did not urge him. She saw that he was in no mood for trifling, and she heard the voices of Fanny's departing friends in the hall and dreaded her interference.
                  "I shall see you again on Thursday," she whispered, as she opened the door.
                  "Yes; we will come for you about four."
                  Here Fanny caught sight of him and began to make signals. Adrienne saw them, and stepped quickly to his side.
                  "Does it rain?" Of course Lionel followed her to the door.
                  Fanny made a desperate effort. "Mr. Rohan."
                  "Oh, no! the stars are quite bright. Good-night, pleasant dreams," and Lionel ran down the steps.
                  "Gammoned!" muttered Fanny, clenching her little fist. "Never mind, I'll speak to him yet."
                  Lionel went off with that innocent note lying on his heart like a coal of fire. Was it to be his wretched duty to restore to the man he detested the words of love from that dear darling he so worshipped? He hurried on as if the letter would consume him—he seemed to feel it burning its way into his soul. She was false, then; all that he believed to be good was a deception. And yet he could not hate her—could not forget that pure and gentle beauty. His rapid walk soon brought him to one of the uptown post-offices, and he took out the note with a sigh as if he were relieved from a crushing weight. He saw that there was no stamp on it, but he did not notice the seal as he hastily thrust it with the money away from him as he would a deadly reptile. Had not its poisonous influence blasted his last hope and destroyed his confidence in truth?
                  The next morning Percival Denbigh received the letter that had been the unconscious instrument of such wrong—Curiously he picked it up. The outer cover was open; he could not repress an oath at Adrienne's folly as he drew out the inner envelope and examined it. Under the edge he had put a thin film of gum the day before. As he held it up he saw that this had not been disturbed. The plot was successful then, and his lips curled with triumph as he tossed it aside.

                              Like giant warders lay.
                              Upon the bursting woods below
                              The pleasant sunbeams fell;
                              Far off one streak of lazy snow
                              Yet lingered in a dell.
                              The western winds blew soft and sweet,

                  ON Wednesday afternoon, the day before the proposed expedition to the Boyntons, Percival Denbigh was riding alone through a lonely road running back of Fort Hamilton towards the interior. He had been busy for the week past in making preparations for the morrow, and this was not the first time he had taken his way to this place. Yet he was very cautious; not even riding his own horse, but coming to the ferry in an omnibus, and hiring a hack at a livery stable in Brooklyn, where he was not known. As he went on, the houses grew less frequent and the woods thicker, until after traversing a mile or two from the village, it was difficult to realize how near was the populous city. Still he proceeded, generally up hill, but at last down a slight declivity, across a stream; again up an ascent, and then turned off from the road into a lonelier lane. It was evidently not long laid out; there were no fences beside it, and the trees stood thickly along, except in one place, where they had been somewhat cleared away, and a small cottage put up. Everything about it was unmistakably new; the refuse brick and stones from the cellar still lay before the door. Some saplings, that had passed unnoticed, stood in front of it. The building itself, constructed in the cheapest manner, had but one coat of paint daubed on it; the place of steps supplied by a temporary structure of rude boards, and the lot around it still full of stumps, was also unenclosed.
                  Here Denbigh reined up his horse, and springing down, went up to the door and tried it. It was fastened inside, and he knocked impatiently. There was some delay, and then it was opened by an old woman. I say old, and yet it would have been difficult to guess her age from her appearance. She was large and powerfully built, with an appearance of undiminished strength, despite a stoop in the shoulders; her face was repulsive in the extreme; a mass of wrinkles—but more than that, marked with the indelible lines of exhausted passions and evil desires. Her gray hair, in tangled disorder, hung over her low forehead, under which a pair of cold black eyes looked out with a keen glitter. Her dress was utterly slovenly—a ragged frock, of nondescript color, revealing her shrivelled throat and long, sinewy arms.
                  "Well, Slater, is everything here?" asked Denbigh.
                  "Yes, sir," she replied, in a harsh, disagreeable voice, "they come this morning."
                  She stepped aside, and he entered the small room into which the door opened, and looked critically around. It was wretchedly finished, with low ceilings and dingy walls; a cheap carpet, of gay colors, covered the floor, but it was not nailed down, and did not fit at the edges. A set of parlor furniture, such as you may pick up at any auction store, was disposed, without any regard to order, against the walls. The only appearance of habitation was a deal table that stood in one corner, on which were an earthen plate, a common knife and fork, and some remains of a sordid meal, with a pewter jug of beer. Denbigh noticed this with a frown, and demanded impatiently—
                  "What did you bring these things here for?"
                  "I didn't mean no offence," said the woman, cringingly. "It was kinder lonesome in the kitchen, so I jist tho't I'd come in here awhile."
                  "Take them away," he continued, contemptuously, "and don't bring them in again."
                  Slater took up the table and shuffled off into a smaller side room, from which proceeded an odor of burnt grease. Denbigh went to a second door, and looked into the back room. It was the same size as the parlor, without carpet; a set of bed-chamber furniture standing about in complete disorder.
                  "Sweet place to bring my bride," muttered Denbigh, in disgust. "But the worse the cage, the sooner my little bird will be glad to get off on my own terms."
                  He summoned Slater, and, under his supervision, she put the two rooms in respectable order. The bed was made, a piece of carpet spread beside it, and a tolerable appearance of comfort produced by a proper distribution of the scanty furniture.
                  "Now," he said, when all was done, "don't you come into these rooms again, except to dust them."
                  "No, sir."
                  "And have a good fire here to-morrow evening."
                  "Yes, sir."
                  "And, above all, be careful not to say anything to the lady to frighten her. Ask no questions, and do just as I bid you, and you shall be well paid."
                  The hag's eyes glittered. "Thankee kindly, sir."
                  "You are not very presentable," he continued, as his eye ran over her coarse face and dirty dress. "You must get yourself some decent clothes."
                  "I ain't got no better," she snivelled.
                  "You are an incorrigible beggar," he sneered. "Here is money, though. Now, no finery, but a decent dress and cap."
                  He turned away, but paused to ask—"Has any one been here?"
                  "No, sir;" and then she added, with an oath, "It's a dreadful lonesome place."
                  "All the better. But no swearing to-morrow, remember;" and, with this parting injunction, he went out and remounted his horse. As he rode away, he noticed with pleasure how clear the amber sunset was. Every prospect of a fine day to-morrow, then. His triumph was very near, and he hurried on, feeling as if he could not endure a moment's delay, and could only allay his excitement by the rapid motion.
                  He had no confidant in his entire scheme, not even Adrienne Clifford. She knew that his plans were complete, by the few words he uttered when they met for a final consultation the next morning. He told her exactly what she was to do, but he did not tell her where he intended to take Edith, lest, in case of his success, she might become terrified and betray her retreat
                  As he had anticipated, the next afternoon was fine. The sun shone brightly, and the birds in the park sang a song of rejoicing, as the party started out. There was no warning in the air, the sky was as serene as were the Scottish heavens that fair spring day, when the beautiful and unfortunate Mary set forth on that fatal ride that was to end in the disgrace of Dunbar.
                  The company was a very gay one that at five o'clock, nearly an hour later than they had intended, crossed the ferry. There were a dozen conveyances of different descriptions, close carriages for the chaperones, in one of which Mrs. Stuyvesant Percy sat stiff and triumphant, open phætons for the young people, and two of those vehicles vulgarly called "buggies," for engaged couples, of whom Ben and Fanny were of course one. Edith had heard with delight from Vinton that Lionel was to drive his wagon. Her aunt's apparent improvement continued, the influence of the day was cheering, and she dressed for the drive in a mood of gay ety such as she had not known for a long time. Denbigh had taken the precaution to go early to the Rockfords', so that he was there when Lionel came; but as the phæton was announced almost immediately after his arrival, there was no time for conversation, and her greeting was so cordial that he could not be as cold as he had intended, so that she took her place beside Denbigh with undiminished happiness. Indeed, she was so lovely that day that it was hard for Lionel to maintain any composure in her presence, he so felt as if he must tell her how much he loved her, how cruel he thought her conduct. He hardly dared allow himself to look at her, lest his long pent-up passion and grief should find vent in an outburst that would startle her, she was so provokingly beautiful. Her dress was fresh and becoming as possible—a green silk, the very hue of spring, finished at throat and wrist with soft lace, displayed every curve of her graceful figure. One of those fancy straw hats that were then just coming in fashion, trimmed with the same color, rested on her golden curls, which, blown by the wind into some disorder, assumed their wonted look of careless grace. A plaid cloak, which she carried on her arm as a reserve for their cold return drive, completed her well-chosen costume.
                  The drive was very pleasant after they left the dust and crowd of the city behind them, and were out in the open country. The air was mild and pure, full of the delicious freshness of spring. The gorgeous sun sank down through depths of sapphire and opal and topaz, warm with the fires of coming summer. The fields were green with springing grass, or rich brown after fresh ploughing, and from the cottage gardens stole up the odors of violets and hyacinths. The trees were red with bursting buds, or yellow with young leaves, and in their swaying branches little birds sang their loving carol. The streams, turbulent with recent freedom, babbled gayly over their pebbly beds, and in the still ponds the merry frogs performed their monotonous concert.
                  Very gayly the cavalcade rattled over the smooth road, to Fort Hamilton and the Boyntons' house. It was a fine old mansion, standing out of the village, and commanding a view of the river. As they landed on the broad piazza the sun was setting in a final ruby glory over the hills of Nevisink, and the waters were glowing with tawny gold. Here was no lack of animation; all day the white-sailed ships passed up and down, going away on their voyages to far-distant climes, or coming home joyful after long absence, with eager, sun-browned faces peering over their weather-beaten sides. Here too, great steamers took their way on their errands of peace or pleasure, defying the winds and waves with their black prows, as they rushed on in obedience to the great power within them. And here the war vessels held on their majestic course, saluting with roaring cannon the forts of our great metropolis.
                  When the party from New York arrived at the Boyntons, they found already assembled there a goodly company from the nearer neighborhood, friends from Brooklyn and the village; so that there was a large collection of carriages and riding horses provided for in the ample yard, where place was made for the conveyances of these late guests.
                  All the way down Fanny Grantham's head had been so full of her final determination to outwit Adrienne and set matters straight between her friend and Lionel, that she could talk of nothing else, and Ben, who was interested in all she cared for, and was especially attached to both Edith and Rohan, enthusiastically promised to help her. Their first step was to go in advance of the phæton, and so reach the house before them. Once there, Fanny, with magnanimous disregard of her appearance for the sake of her friend, tore off her hat, and—hear it, oh unbelieving men!—without one look in the glass, rushed down stairs again, so that she was on the piazza when the rest drove up. She had told Ben what to do; but having, as we have seen, no great faith in the tact of any man, she was there to give him fresh orders.
                  "There," she whispered, "Adrienne must go up stairs to take off her things, and then you tell Rohan I want to speak to him."
                  But Adrienne was very wary. She saw Fanny's alert look and suspected something.
                  "Mr. Denbigh," she said languidly, but with a glance that he understood, "I am rather tired; could you be so kind as to take my shawl and hat for me? I will wait here till you are ready to go in."
                  Of course Denbigh complied, and turned away with Edith, Fanny saw the pain on Lionel's countenance as he watched them disappear together, and was sure that Vinton had not said half enough, and more than ever determined to succeed. But Adrienne had him safely now; she would not even let him leave her to go to the dressing room, telling him to put down his hat and coat in the hall, she did not wish to be left alone.
                  "Dreadful!" exclaimed Fanny, in dismay. "Edith will be back in a moment, and then we must go in, and after that she will keep him close by her, of course. What shall I do?"
                  "I don't know," replied Ben. "I know you are smart, and I'll be your bottle-holder. I can only advise you, in the words of the immortal chicken, to go in and win."
                  "I have it!" cried Fanny, "that is exactly what I will do! I'm engaged, so why should I care?" And before Ben could speak, she had walked straight up to Lionel, who stood with Adrienne on his arm, looking as if he might be in his study for all he knew of what was going on around him. "Mr. Rohan," she said boldly, "may I have the pleasure of a few words with you."
                  "I shall be most happy," stammered Lionel starting in surprise, and making a motion as if he would drop Adrienne's arm. But she was too quick. Darting a defiant look at her cousin, she said with lofty contempt:
                  "Fanny, I think you forget yourself. Mr. Rohan came with me, and you know we have not yet paid our respects to Mrs. Boynton."
                  Fanny gritted her white teeth to restrain her wrath. "No doubt your advice is as valuable as your example. I do not intend to deprive Mr. Rohan of the happiness of your society now, but when he is at leisure I must claim his attention for a few moments."
                  "As soon as we have seen the Boyntons I shall be at your service," said Lionel gravely.
                  Adrienne drew down her lip to shew her glittering teeth in a ghastly attempt at a smile, and at the same moment Edith appeared with Denbigh. He had been waiting for her at the foot of the stairs, but how could Lionel know that? It looked as if they had been together ever since they went off, and it was with an effort that he could suppress his pain sufficiently to greet their cordial hostess with well-bred composure.
                  Fanny was resolved he should have no chance to forget his engagement with her, and kept close beside him dragging Ben with her, as after the salutations Adrienne was bringing him out of the room.
                  "Good for you, Fanny," whispered Ben, "keep her up to time, she is a plucky customer, but you'll take the wind out of her yet."
                  "Hush!" whispered Fanny, keeping her eyes all the while fixed on Lionel.
                  "I am growing jealous," protested Ben, "you look as if you cared for no one but Rohan."
                  "Nonsense; here, this way!" exclaimed Fanny, in excitement, and turning suddenly she headed off Adrienne's retreat.
                  "Floored, by Jove!" cried Ben, sotto voce.
                  
                  The ruse was successful, Lionel instantly dropped Adrienne's arm. "Now, Miss Fanny," he said politely, "shall we have the talk now?"
                  "Yes, if you please," and Fanny took his arm in triumph, "Ben will take care of you, Addie."
                  
                  And then as soon as she was out of sight she could not repress a merry burst of laughter, at thoughts of the woful looks of her cousin, and her lover at being left to each other's disagreeable society. But her amusement was short; face to face with Lionel's grave grey eyes, it was by no means so easy to open the delicate subject. All her ideas seemed to have left her, and she felt herself growing "as stupid as a man." So she walked on in unwonted silence till they had reached the quiet of the picture gallery. A few remarks on the works of art there collected, and then she grew desperate, feeling that something must be said. They sat down on a sofa, and at that moment Edith and Denbigh appeared at the door. Lionel changed color a little, and Fanny burst out.
                  "Edith Rockford is the most amiable woman in existence."
                  "She is very lovely!" assented Lionel, following her graceful figure with his eyes, as after making a brief tour of the room, she went out again.
                  "Yes, but sometimes amiability is a fault, and she ought not to let that horrid Denbigh be with her so much!"
                  "No?" said Lionel. He did not know how to reply; was this a new proof of her innocence or her guilt?
                  "No! certainly not," continued Fanny decidedly; "now they are not engaged I am sure, and yet she is so kind-hearted that she will not send him off, and give the lie to the silly report."
                  "They really are not engaged?" asked Lionel with interest.
                  "No, I know they are not," and then Fanny added desperately, "There now, Mr. Rohan, that is what I meant to tell you; of course its none of my business, and I dare say you think me very officious, but I am in Edith's entire confidence, I am really certain that she refused Denbigh last fall, or while he was South, I know she wrote to him, and of course since then she has been more careful not to wound him than if there had never been anything between them, but she don't love him, nothing would induce her to marry him, she certainly is not engaged to him!" Having reached this eloquent climax, Fanny paused with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes, but her words carried conviction with them, and were eagerly, gladly, received. To her astonishment, Lionel, who had been listening in intense excitement, suddenly denly seized and wrung her hand in the most open manner, and utterly regardless of appearances.
                  "Thank you, oh thank you, Miss Fanny!" he cried impetuously. "You are so good to say this to me! If you knew how often I have longed to know the truth!"
                  "You have it now," returned Fanny, shaking his hand with delight. "I believe that Denbigh has done all he can to deceive you and every one else. Edith would not think it when I told her so, she is so honest herself she cannot credit any one else not being so."
                  "But I have seen so many things," said Lionel with sudden despondency, remembering all that had passed.
                  "You have seen nothing that ought to convince you that she could be false!" answered Fanny indignantly.
                  "You are right," assented Lionel, no longer attempting to restrain the torrent of happy hope, regarding all the past as a dark dream, and wholly carried away by the stream, no further proof was needed. Blind and foolish as he had been he felt at that moment that only from her lips would he learn the truth.
                  "Why, she looks like an angel," continued Fanny enthusiastically, "and she is an angel of goodness and purity."
                  "But perhaps after all she does not like me," suggested Lionel; suddenly encountering this thought as a lump of ice in the warm river of delight.
                  "That is not for me to say," retorted Fanny laughing. "You must ask her yourself."
                  Lionel joined her laugh as he started up, feeling as if he must rush to her feet at once. And at this moment Adrienne and Ben appeared with the announcement that supper was ready. There was nothing for it but to change partners again, and follow the crowd, but in a few moments Lionel was by Edith's side at the table. She had come in still with Denbigh, and disregarding Adrienne's objections he insisted on taking the seat next her. Fanny slipped in on the other side of Denbigh, and immediately began to ask him a series of animated questions; Lionel turned to Edith with his heart in his eyes, his voice fairly trembling with suppressed emotion,
                  "Miss Edith, may I have the first dance?"
                  She could not mistake that eloquent glance—that tone so full of tenderness, and the return to his old friendly address. She was very happy, and her smile was glad as sunshine as she answered:
                  "I am not going to dance, but I had no time to look at the pictures just now. After supper shall we see them together?"
                  This was a very encouraging speech. Edith knew it and blushed as she uttered it. Fanny had seized this moment to ask Denbigh where his plantation was? He did not choose to tell her anything about his affairs, and made rather an impatient answer, turning round in time to note Edith's down-cast look, and Lionel's grateful "Thank you."
                  Beyond measure annoyed, he deliberately turned his back on Fanny, and sat watching Edith with such intentness that she was both surprised and alarmed. Something of the old evil look was in his eyes, for the first time in many months. She thought of the scenes of last summer, and began to fear that he might turn from a friend to a lover again. She was not able to escape; Lionel, happy that he had secured her, and really afraid to trust himself in an indifferent conversation with her now, was talking to Adrienne, and opposite a party of gay young people were too absorbed in their own jests to heed any one else. Edith tried to appear unconscious and speak carelessly, but Denbigh would not allow it. There was too much long suppressed passion in his heart for him to play indifference. Now that the time for self-control was so nearly over, it was impossible for him to maintain the irksome reserve. He would not talk, but sat regarding her with those glowing eyes so ardently, that she could not refuse to notice it. At last, after a pause, she said with an attempt at a smile:
                  "Mr. Denbigh, you surely ought to know how I look by this time without studying me so closely."
                  "I can never tire of such sweet contemplation," he murmured. "You are so beautiful."
                  "You forget yourself, Mr. Denbigh," said Edith with dignity.
                  "I know you have told me not to hope," he replied recklessly, "but do you remember what Burns says? 
                        
                           "'Yet sure 'twere impious to despair
                           So much in sight of heaven!'"
                        
                     
                  
                  The tone, the words, the look, justly offended Edith. A motion was made at this moment among some of the ladies to leave the table, and availing herself of it she rose haughtily. Without any reply to Denbigh, except an indignant glance, she turned away from his offered arm and addressed Lionel before Adrienne could claim him.
                  "Shall we go now, Mr. Rohan?"
                  Only too happy, Lionel gave her his arm with rapid thanks, and together they walked quickly away.
                  "Is that all you could do?" Denbigh sneered, turning upon Adrienne in his baffled rage.
                  "Was it my fault, mon cher? You must have said something rash or she would never have looked at you so virtuously."
                  "How can I help it? I must and will have her. She is beautiful as a queen."
                  "Well, well, you will have her before long. Come; no use to stand here, we shall be noticed"
                  "Yes, let us follow them!" he cried, starting forward.
                  "No! why Percival, you are losing your head. We have no decent excuse for interrupting them now. Let them do what they please until it is near the time for starting; then I will take care of Rohan and you shall have Edith for your own."
                  These last significant words soothed Denbigh, yet he chafed like a caged tiger at heart, when he thought of those two lovers, though he yielded to Adrienne's advice and allowed her to lead him away.
                  Lionel and Edith, after leaving the supper room, went, as she had proposed, to the picture gallery. But this was a mere form. Lionel was in no mood for admiring pictures—he could see nothing but the lovely girl beside him, and he hurried her through in most unsatisfactory manner, saying "Yes," and "No," at random; finally urging her desperately to go out on the piazza. Overruling her faint objections of fear of cold by rushing off after her cloak, and then, seeing people approaching, carrying her like a whirlwind through the hall and out into the solemn moonlight. To their unspoken delight they were alone at last. The young people had begun to dance in the parlors, and there was little danger of interruption.
                  It was a lovely scene on which they looked in the first eloquent quent moments of silence. The full moon lit up with its silver rays the noble river and the great ocean. The bank opposite lay, a dark, intangible shadow, like the hill of a mirage. In the distance Fort Lafayette rose grey and quiet out of the tranquil waters, like a castle of enchantment, and the white ships crept past on the azure sea like the creations of a dream, while down the rippling waves of the river, out over the rolling billows of the ocean, a scintillant path of light like scattered diamonds stretched away to the distant horizon.
                  Edith and Lionel spoke a few words softly of the lovely scene as they took a rapid turn up and down the piazza, pausing at last at the end where the moonbeams were brightest. Edith had thrown her cloak over her shoulders, but from the throat it floated away showing the white ruffles that lay on her heaving breast. Her hair—her glorious hair, disordered by the light breeze, fell away in curls that gleamed pale gold even in that uncertain light. As Lionel gazed on her, scarcely he dared to hope that so much beauty might at last be his, but surely it was worth a thousand risks, and, determined to know his fate, he spoke with trembling lips.
                  "Miss Edith, do you remember that party at your aunt's long ago, when we were children?"
                  Edith turned her hazel eyes to him, liquid with happiness, "Indeed I do."
                  "There first I called you Sunshine, and you have been the Sunshine of my life ever since. Will you be my Sunshine forever?"
                  Even then, taken by a sweet surprise, Edith looked at him, her eyes full of soft emotion, her lips parted with a blissful smile; then, overcome with so much joy, she reeled and would have fallen had he not caught her in his strong arms.
                  "Mine! mine!" he murmured passionately, "say, darling, you are mine!"
                  All the weeks of estrangement were over—all fear was forgotten—all doubt was gone, in that rapturous moment, when Edith, hiding her face on her lover's shoulder, whispered a glad consent.
                  How long they might have stood there oblivious of everything but each other and their new found happiness, it is only for those who can measure lover's raptures by experience ence to tell. But after awhile they were roused by the opening of the door. A second sentimental couple had come out to enjoy the moonlight. This recalled them to a sense of time, place, propriety, and such other mundane considerations, and they resumed their walk. Edith leaned heavily on Lionel's arm; she was yet tremulous with the excitement of the new joy, and he was proud of that clinging grasp. It made tangible his own overwhelming delight which was scarcely yet "a sober certainty of waking bliss."
                  Thus they advanced until they met the other couple and discovered that they were Ben and Fanny! At this, without any apparent cause, they all burst into such smiles as without any words conveyed their perfect content to the initiated. Afterwards they became more rational in their conversation; but before they had time for those explanations which were yet so essential to their happiness, they were interrupted by Miss Boynton, who came with an urgent request to Edith to sing for them. She had been instigated to this by Adrienne, who had been impatiently counting the moments of Lionel's absence: she had tried in vain to devise some other method of separating him from Edith, but could think of no better plan than suggesting to the hostess that Miss Rockford sang "delightfully." Very reluctantly she resorted to this; it would give the woman she detested an opportunity for displaying an accomplishment—but even that was better than a prolongation of that dangerous companionship.
                  Edith felt very little inclination, or indeed capacity for singing, and tried at first to decline; but quite a group gathered around her so loud in their entreaties, that with her usual amiability, she finally consented. Feeling that she could never face a room full of inquisitive eyes on Lionel's arm without betraying her secret, she accepted the escort of Mr. Boynton to the piano. There she gave song after song with even more than her usual power of expression and sweetness of voice, until she was released by the appearance of the waiters with mulled wine and other refreshments. Looking about then she noticed—that Lionel had disappeared. She was a little surprised; but Percival Denbigh was by her side, apparently humble and respectful as ever. Of course, as she came with him, she could not subject him to the insult of refusing to make her adieux
                      with him. Indeed, her heart was very tender just then—she felt as if she could forgive a great deal.
                  So she bade Good-bye, gladly thinking that, on the return drive, Lionel would at least be near, and so went happily off to the dressing-room, Denbigh leaving her at the door to go in search of Adrienne. Her simple dress was soon arranged, and she had time to chat with several friends, and still Adrienne did not come. She was a little surprised, as the party seemed to have broken up; but just then Fanny Grantham came in, rushed up to her, put her in a corner, and drove every idea out of her head by crying, breathlessly—
                  "Did he do it? is it all settled? Are you engaged?"
                  "Yes," stammered Edith, blushing. "Oh, Fanny, I am so happy!"
                  Fanny, carried away with delight, kissed her rapturously, and then fairly danced for joy, utterly oblivious of the look of silly dignity with which Mrs. Stuyvesant Percy, from the other side of the room, tried to crush her.
                  "That is splendid! superb! Now I hope we shall really have some Sunshine. Is not it nice to have a lover? But you don't know half yet," she added, patronizingly from her larger experience—and so she went on pouring out a stream of congratulation all the time she was putting on hat, cloak, and gloves, and then with another kiss hurried away to meet the impatient Ben.
                  Very soon every one was gone, and Edith was alone; she began to wonder where Adrienne could be, when Denbigh at last appeared at the door.
                  "Miss Clifford and Mr. Rohan have walked down the road a little way," he said. "Miss Clifford has her shawl with her; the night is so fine she did not care to come in. I promised to find them there."
                  Accepting this apology, of course, Edith went down stairs with him. The pony phæton was the only vehicle which remained; all the rest had gone, though some horses belonging to young men living near stood ready saddled, waiting for their owners.
                  Denbigh assisted Edith to a place on the front seat, tossed a coin to the groom in attendance, and springing in beside her, started off at what she thought an unnecessarily rapid pace down the avenue.
                  "Mr. Denbigh," she said, after a moment in which she looked anxiously and in vain for their missing companions, "if you drive so fast, I fear we may pass them."
                  "Don't trouble yourself," answered Denbigh, shortly. "They are safe enough;" and, as they turned into the road, he struck the gay little ponies with the whip. They felt the sting through all their dancing blood, and dashed off at a furious speed.
                  Now thoroughly alarmed, Edith cried out, "Stop! stop! Mr. Denbigh—oh, pray stop!"
                  He took no notice of the entreaty, only hurrying on the excited horses.
                  "They are running away! We shall be killed!" gasped Edith, white and trembling, clinging to the carriage for support. "Oh! for God's sake, stop!"
                  Still no answer from her unheeding companion, who sat beside her, his dark eyes flashing, his teeth set, his hair blown back by the wind, silent and stern as the ghostly lover of the doomed Leonore.
                  At the same desperate rate they swept through some of the by-streets of the village. It was late; no lights burned in the quiet houses, that gleamed white as ghosts, or frowned dark as prisons in the weird moonlight. Edith lost all self-command in her paralyzing terror, and uttered shriek after shriek that sounded only on drowsy ears, and goaded Denbigh to urge the flying steeds to greater efforts. At first she had thought that he had lost control over the spirited ponies; but seeing how cruelly he used the whip, it darted across her disordered brain that he must be intoxicated. At this dreadful idea, resolute to escape, even at risk of life, she made a frantic attempt to throw herself from the rushing wagon. But Denbigh was on the alert; with a sudden motion he twined his arm firmly around her slender waist. So they flew on, past the last straggling houses, down the deserted highway, and into the still country, sleeping like a pale corpse under the pale moonbeams. Another turn, and they were rattling through that lonely road that led into the gloomy woods. Edith no longer struggled—what use? The man beside her was iron, the stars above, the majestic moon looked coldly down on the lost earth, and the dreary forest had no comfort in its voice. The goal was nearly won, and drawing the half-fainting girl closer to his side, Denbigh drove madly on through the black, unpitying night.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER V.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "High in mid air, on seraph wing,
                              The paley moon is journeying
                              In stillest path of stainless blue;
                              Keen, curious stars are peering through
                              Heaven's arch this hour."
                           
                        
                        MIDNIGHT AND MOONSHINE—MOTHERWELL.
                     
                  
                  WHEN Edith began to sing, Lionel escaped from the crowd and stationed himself near the piano, where he could watch her without annoying her. There he stood wholly absorbed in rapt admiration of the beautiful girl, and the intense happiness he felt in having at last won the prize he had so long sought in vain. Even yet he could not realize the full extent of his success, and his thoughts were rather a joyous rhapsody than a coherent reverie, until he was roused by a touch on his arm, and turning beheld Adrienne Clifford—
                  "Lionel," she whispered softly, "I am very tired—will you come away with me, so that I may have a little rest before we go?" Here she coughed eloquently—"I dread the return drive, my chest is so weak."
                  With a suppressed sigh which he disguised in a courteous assent, Lionel gave her his arm. She clung heavily to it, with clasped hands, as they crossed the hall.
                  "Mrs. Boynton has offered to keep me all night, and I should accept were it not for Miss Rockford."
                  "Pray don't let that trouble you," replied Lionel, feeling that in their new relations he was quite sufficient protection for Edith, and rather glad to be better able to guard her against Denbigh's attentions. "I am sure she would not wish you to expose yourself on her account."
                  "Well, when it is time to start, we will see, perhaps, she would be glad to get rid of both of us."
                  "I hope not," said Lionel, gayly. He was half inclined to tell her what had just passed, but his hopes were so new they were yet sacred; and although he had no tangible reason son for it, he already felt a vague distrust of her, not that he definitely believed that she had deceived him, but she had carelessly repeated what Denbigh had said, and might with equal carelessness speak of his engagement; on the whole, it seemed better not to mention it even to her, until he had consulted Edith. These thoughts passed rapidly through his mind as he allowed Adrienne to lead him through the library and so into the now deserted picture gallery.
                  "Where are we going?" he asked at last in surprise.
                  "Oh, I have found such a cosey little place where we can have a nice talk." And she paused at the end of the room before an alcove half concealed by the heavy crimson curtains that fell over the entrance.
                  Lifting these she ushered Lionel into the space beyond, which was furnished as a boudoir. The walls were draped with crimson damask, which, gathered at the ceiling in a golden star, fell in heavy folds to the floor. A low couch covered with cushions of the same rich hue ran around the sides, a thick Turkey rug covered the floor, a shaded lamp shed a soft lustre in this ruby-colored tent, and a vase of flowers on a graceful table diffused a voluptuous odor on the warm air.
                  It was indeed a charming retreat, and Lionel's first thought was a wish that Edith were his companion. He was a little surprised when Adrienne, loosing the cords that confined the curtain, let it fall so as quite to cut off, not only all view, but all sound from outside.
                  "Why do you do that?" he asked.
                  "I want you all to myself," she replied, with an expressive glance, throwing herself down beside him on the couch, so near him that her dress rippled across his knees—her dark eyes were dangerously close. She looked uncommonly well, the dim light concealed the ravages of time, the red draperies gave a glow to her sallow cheeks, her eyes were unusually bright, and her white teeth flashed seducingly between her moist lips. Had his heart been wholly disengaged, he might perhaps have yielded for a moment to the fascination which a reckless woman can almost surely exercise over a young man. As it was, with the dear image of a purer loveliness in his heart, these faded charms had no power to excite an emotion—he did not even think that there was any significance in her looks, he was so wholly absorbed in the memory of another, and with a careless indifference he pushed her dress aside, and moved to give her more room. Adrienne bit her thin lips with an ill-concealed frown—it was evidently too soon, yet a little longer she must restrain herself. She rallied her spirits, and began one of those playful conversations which had often before amused him. To this he readily responded, his heart was so light he was more than usually inclined to merriment. So for a while she rattled on in an animated talk, spiced sometimes rather highly with a dash of French wit. At first Lionel was entertained, but he did not care for her badinage, he despised the scandal she freely uttered, and the double entendre disgusted him. He grew very impatient, and finally suggested that it was time to go. To this Adrienne responded by consulting her watch and announcing the time, which was such an astonishingly early one that Lionel could not object to a little delay. But he was not long contented, soon insisting as decidedly as politeness allowed that they ought to rejoin their friends. Still, on one pretence or another Adrienne lingered, growing every moment more determined to win her handsome companion. At last, however, it became evident that he would not remain, and she began to fear that he would go without her. It was time to play her last card. She ceased her efforts to detain him, and with a sudden movement dropped her head on his shoulder. The action was so unexpected that in alarm Lionel passed his arm around her waist, exclaiming—
                  "Are you ill?"
                  "A little faint," she said, in a low tone and with closed eyes. "Oh, hold me yet a moment! that is so delicious!"
                  "Let me call some one, or get you some water," he urged, in increased surprise and dismay.
                  "Oh, no, no! I am so happy with you, dear!"
                  As she spoke she raised her head and looked at him with languishing eyes. There was that in her expression that no man could fail to read. Lionel saw that she was not ill. He felt all that her words implied; and, horrified, he drew back from her touch.
                  "Oh, stop! Don't go away!" she murmured, seizing his hands. "I love you, Lionel; I love you, dear!"
                  There was something so strange in this shameless avowal, something so trying, so revolting in his situation, that at first Lionel was silent; then only drawing away his hands, and after a moment saying slowly—
                  "You forget yourself, Miss Clifford."
                  "No, no, I don't!" she cried desperately, reading no encouragement in his sad grieved face. I tell you I love you! Is it nothing for me to make such an avowal? With all my heart I love you!" and with a sudden impulse she threw her arms around his neck, and tried to raise her lips to his.
                  Bold, bad, unprincipled, she had resolved to win this young man, cost her what it might, and now that she was fairly aroused, she was utterly reckless of everything but the passion she dared to call love.
                  Lionel was thoroughly enlightened by those last words and that attempted caress. Never, he was resolved, should those audacious lips touch his, yet warm with Edith's pure kiss. Disgusted and indignant, he tore away her clinging arms and started to his feet.
                  "I do not want your love!" he exclaimed. "I never shall love you. I will not have you talk so infamously!"
                  She looked at him with keen glittering eyes, fierce as a wild animal deprived of its prey, and in her utter degradation once more essayed a useless supplication. With despairing energy she tried to clasp his hands, crying—
                  "You must listen to me. No matter if you don't love me, only let me love you."
                  "Oh! shame!" he answered. "Do not persist in such useless humiliation."
                  "Slowly her gaze fell, and she hid her face in her hands. "Have you no pity?" she murmured.
                  "Pity! Yes, from the bottom of my soul I pity you."
                  "I have loved you so much!" she gasped, in such real distress that Lionel could not but feel a contemptuous compassion. Perhaps he had been harsher than she deserved; in the excitement of the moment he might have used language that would uselessly wound, and he said more kindly "I am sorry for all this, Miss Clifford. I shall forget it, and so will you."
                  "Never!" she replied, looking up with eyes in which the softness of love was fast turning to the hard sullenness of hate.
                  
                  "At least," he said, turning away, "it is over now. I must go."
                  "No, stop one moment. Do you refuse to love me because you love some one else?"
                  "That is no affair of yours," he answered, impatiently.
                  "Yes, it is. I know you love Edith Rockford, but she does not love you."
                  "I beg you will not mention Miss Rockford's name," said Lionel coldly, and laying his hand on the curtain.
                  "Ah! but I will though!" she cried, springing forward and seizing his arm. He instantly shook off her hand. Her eyes gleamed as she went on in shrill tones—"You think my very touch contamination! What do you say, then, to have the Edith whom you love in Percival Denbigh's arms?"
                  "What?" demanded Lionel, in horror-struck surprise.
                  "Ah! you had better love me than the bride of another."
                  "Hush!" exclaimed Lionel. "I know Miss Rockford is pure as an angel. I scorn your vile insinuation."
                  "It is no insinuation—it is certainty. At this moment they are happy together."
                  "That is false!" he protested, in uncontrollable excitement. "Speak, and tell me what you mean."
                  "It is no concern of yours," she retorted, doggedly. In her rage she had come near betraying her accomplice. Now a tardy caution suggested itself.
                  "It is, and you shall explain yourself!" he cried, seizing her hands.
                  "Ah! it is your turn now to entreat!" she sneered. "Let me go. You hurt my wrists."
                  He dropped his hold. "I am a fool to believe you," he muttered. "I will go to Edith myself."
                  "You cannot find her!" she persisted. "I tell you she loves Denbigh, and she has gone off with him."
                  "I do not believe you," he declared, raising again the heavy curtain.
                  At this last moment once more Adrienne's manner changed. "Lionel," she moaned, "forgive me. It is all true that I have said. But stay with me. She does not love you, and I do."
                  "I detest you!" retorted Lionel, goaded beyond all patience, and dashing aside the curtains he made his escape.
                  Adrienne looked out after him, baffled, humiliated, enraged raged. At that moment, if she had dared, she would have killed him.
                  "You are too late!" she shrieked, with shrill malice, and the words followed him like a malediction.
                  The company was all gone, the lights in the picture gallery were out, the hall was quite deserted, there was no sound of gay voices, only a low murmur of talking in one of the closed parlors, as Lionel paused under the lamp to consult his watch. One o'clock! He had been grossly deceived in the hour; and seizing hat and cloak he hurried to the back piazza, where the phæton had been taken. It was gone! Was he indeed too late? Up to this time he had not dared to think, even now he would not believe, that Adrienne had spoken the truth, as he looked about for some one of whom he might make inquiries. The yard was quite empty; all the gay cavalcade had rolled away, while he had been imprisoned in that windowless, soundless bower, as by a spell of enchantment. At first he thought there was no one there, and was just turning away to make a frantic appeal to the host, when he caught sight of a groom sitting on a box near the stable, placidly smoking. To him he hastened with agitated steps.
                  "Do you know where my phæton is?"
                  "Gone, I suppose, sir. I don't know which yours was, but they are all gone."
                  "Mine was a light wagon, with green wheels, and black ponies."
                  "Oh, yes, sir, I know, they was the last that went. I brought it round about half an hour ago."
                  "Who were in it?" gasped Lionel in a voice he could scarcely control.
                  "A dark chap and a pretty lady got in and went off like mad."
                  "Which way?"
                  "Down the road towards town, as near as I could judge."
                  He waited for no more, but in a sort of bewildered frenzy, with his brain on fire, rushed out of the yard towards the avenue. Edith was gone! His pure angel had by some means been carried off by that detestable man. With the memory of her sweet assurances so fresh in his heart, he could not doubt that this had been an involuntary flight; and for what purpose? He shuddered to think. He must follow and rescue her; but how? He struck his forehead in despair, and again recalled Adrienne's words. Too late!
                  At that moment something stirred under the shadow of a great tree. Looking eagerly, he saw two saddle horses standing there, evidently waiting for some lingering guests. They seemed to Lionel as if sent by Heaven; with an inarticulate prayer, he loosed the nearest, and sprang on its back. Even then he looked for some one to whom he might explain the apparent theft; but moments were precious; there was no one in sight, and striking the astonished animal a sharp blow, he dashed down the avenue like the wind.
                  His rapid ride through the still night, with the cool moonbeams falling on the sleeping country in a shimmering shower, recovered him a little from his fever, and he began to think more coherently. At first it was only a wild, frightful horror that possessed him, at the idea that the fair and gentle girl he loved was in the power of that bad, unscrupulous man. Only too well he knew how little could be hoped from any sense of honor on his part. All the stories he had heard of Denbigh's dark life recurred to his memory, and he trembled with rage and the sense of his helplessness to prevent evil. Never for a moment did he doubt that Edith was the innocent victim of some infamous plot. Already too long he had distrusted her; with her sweet assurances to convince him, he would not again suspect the truth of his lost love. The more he reflected, the more sure he was that this disappearance was the result of a conspiracy. Adrienne's conduct was in a measure explained, and he recalled Vinton's warning, and execrated his folly that he had not heeded it. He thought with loathing and detestation of the shameless declaration of unrequited passion with which she had sought to lure him from his guardianship of Edith, and blamed himself, with bitterest regret, for having for a moment listened to her hypocritical professions. And then again came the dreadful vision of his pure darling in the remorseless clutches of his desperate and disappointed rival.
                  And so, in mute agony, he dashed over the well known highway, deriving a certain relief in the speed, yet knowing well how hopeless was his chase after a wily enemy. Still he must hurry on—every second was worth a drop of his heart's blood, and, after all, he might be too late!
                  How cold and unpitying the moon was, lapsing slowly towards the west through thin clouds that floated like tresses of gray hair, across the sky, black in its arch as a prison vault! Deserted as the land of a lost civilization, the road stretched away towards the village, while the houses were lightless and silent as tombs. Eagerly through the pale darkness Lionel looked in vain for some late wanderer who might give him news of the vanished phæton, but no one was in sight. The hush and gloom of deepest night rested over the little town. He thought he could not be wrong in keeping still on the main road to the city, and he had traversed a rapid mile beyond Fort Hamilton, without seeing even a ray of light from any window, when his alert eye caught the shape of a human being under the shelter of a cottage porch. It was a wretched tramp, who, unable to get any other lodging, had crawled there, by penury's dire curse condemned even to steal his short, uncomfortable repose.
                  Reining up his horse, and realizing with his clearer brain the necessity of caution, Lionel dismounted and gently touched the ragged sleeper. With the quick start of longused vigilance, the man was awake in an instant, springing to his feet and demanding, hoarsely—
                  "What do you want?"
                  "You have a hard bed, friend," said Lionel, kindly. "Here is something with which to find a better. Now, no thanks; but tell me, quickly, has any wagon passed here lately?"
                  "Yes, sir," replied the beggar, catching an inspiration from Lionel's impressive manner; "there come a good many carriages by a while ago, when I was looking for a place to sleep. I tho't they was all gone, and stepped in here; but just then there come another wagon tearin' along. I was fear'd they'd see me, and so went back in the shadder; but I needn't a' minded, they was too busy to heed me."
                  "Why! what were they doing?" cried Lionel, breathlessly.
                  "The lady she called out, but the man he paid no heed, only whipped his horses and then went round yon corner as if the d—— was after them."
                  "Which corner? which way?" demanded Lionel, already on his horse.
                  
                  "The first one to the right, and thank ye sir." But his benefactor was off, and he picked up his dirty bundle with a chuckle and turned towards the village.
                  Lionel started on this new clue cheered by the thought that at least so far he had not gone wrong. He had ridden fast, too, but not so fast as those he followed. The road was up hill now, and after urging his horse with undiminished speed up a steep rise, he was forced to allow him a moment's pause on the summit.
                  How still it was! Yet too early in season for the myriad voices of summer night, there were only such sounds as served to make the silence more oppressive:—the faint sighing of the lingering breeze, the far-off song of drowsy frogs, and nearer, the labored breathing of the tired horse. Above, how fathomless the sky! Away through the dark depths of infinite space, shone the diamond radiance of our sister planets, while from yet greater distances trembled the scintillant rays of the suns of other worlds, and slow dropping down the reaches of ether the dying moon sank, a pallid Queen, towards the river, that white as a death bier, stretched out its smooth surface below. Around, the light and shade were mysterious as that fading brightness which illumines with receding lustre the frozen worlds that roll on the confines of our system. In this solemn beauty of night, the great trees stretched out their spectral arms with a gesture of menace, and over the still fields the shadows of the thin clouds flitted like unquiet ghosts.
                  Short pause did Lionel allow. The hush and quiet fell on him like a spell. After a moment he drew out his watch. Two o'clock.
                  An hour, and what an hour! What detestable use might not have been made of that lost time; and on that thought once more he started his panting horse. As he dashed on his upward way, how he peered into every copse thinking in some shade he might see the phæton; how he listened to every sound, thinking it might be Edith's distracted shriek. After all his haste he might yet be too late!
                  Already the road had grown more lonely, though it was still a highway. It ran straight up hill for some distance, and he toiled on without hope, yet still not quite despairing. Haste still seemed the one only present good, and he continued his rapid pace till he came to where the road branched. Here he halted in dismay; a wrong turn might be fatal; each moment was bearing more surely away from him his dear lost love; his brain was dizzy with the thoughts of all vile possibilities, yet there was nothing for it but a halt. In this dreadful uncertainty it at last occurred to him as a forlorn hope, to search the ground for traces of the passing phæton. Dismounting, and trying hard to banish his torturing thoughts, he carefully investigated first the right hand way. There were many marks of wheels, but none which he dared trust. Disappointed, and fearing that his unpractised eye would never be able to detect such trifling signs as were now of such vital importance, he crossed to the left hand road. But here a casual glance showed him the clue he looked for. There was the fresh cut of the double wheels, but better than that were the dark earth-scattered stamps that could only have been made by the feet of the flying ponies.
                  With a fervent thanksgiving Lionel remounted and hurried on. But ere long there was a cross-road. Nothing for it but to get down again and assure himself that he was right. So, while chafing with the fiercest impatience, did he painfully work out the path so quickly traversed by those whom he sought. Sometimes his task was a difficult one. The road was hard or the marks many, but none, he always discovered, so tossed and deep stamped as those of the scared runaways. Once more, he paused to see how the short spring night sped away. Four o'clock.
                  The way grew lonelier. If he had needed any proof that some evil was intended, he had it with fearful force in his observation that the path grew step by step rougher, more untravelled. The houses were all passed; the forest grew thicker around; the hills steeper. The track was more easily followed now, but the night waned fast, and already what hours of agony Lionel had endured—hours that cannot be described—that cannot even be imagined—in which he was tortured with the thought of his angel love in every conceivable circumstance of terror, in the power of that cruel, relentless man. And ever on his memory rang Adrienne's warning words, "Too late!"
                  The air grew chill and cold. In the west the setting moon sank, with a last crimson flush on her broad bosom, slowly out of sight. For awhile the myriad stars shone out in sparkling splendor. But the night was nearly over; the frogs had ceased their shrill chorus, and a great hush heralded the coming day. Then the faint grey of dawn streaked with pearls the eastern horizon, and for awhile the earth seemed not only asleep, but dead, in the pallid light that crept so fast over the shadowy scene.
                  So the night passed away, but in those hours of darkness, oh God! what might have happened. With pale cheeks and haggard brow Lionel toiled over the last hill. Another descent, where a little brook murmured gayly over its pebbly bed. There was a white rhime on the weeds that fringed its margin, and in the broadening light little birds stirred in the swaying bushes. The earth was awaking. Brighter and brighter grew the now yellowing radiance; a rosy flush crept up the orient sky. Trees came out of shadows, and stood no longer in dark masses, but distinct groups of willows or elms. The thin frost lay like a silver dust on the green grass, or glittered on the brown fences. The birds, fairly aroused, fluttered and twittered in the blooming branches, and distant cocks called to each other that morning had come!
                  There was light enough now to see the only track on this retired road, but although he was very near the end, and hurried fast his tired horse, the first golden rays of the rising sun fell on his anxious face as Lionel entered the lonely lane.
                  "Sunshine!" he murmured, "but ah! where is my Sunshine!"
               
               
                  CHAPTER V.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "And the dark hath a million burning eyes, all of his secret tell;
                              And the whispering winds are damned fiends that hiss in his oars of hell."
                           
                        
                        GERALD MASSEY
                     
                  
                  FROM the moment when, on that mad midnight race, Denbigh was obliged to support Edith with one arm, he felt that he was losing all control over the fiery little ponies. The clever three minutes' trot into which they had at first struck, had several times degenerated into a canter, from which he had with difficulty brought them back to their proper pace, and after he was so burdened, he could no longer prevent their dashing off at a furious gallop. However, half the distance was by this time accomplished, and for the rest of the way he trusted to be able to keep them in the path. More than this he did not attempt, only by an occasional touch of the whip keeping them up to their full speed. But this was wholly unnecessary; the ponies, unaccustomed to such treatment, soon grew restive, and finally almost unmanageable. The ghostly moonbeams, the dancing shadows, filled their sensitive brains with terror, and they flew on at a rate that before long alarmed even their desperate driver. Nothing slacked their rapid run; they breasted the steep hills with unabated swiftness, reaching the summit panting but unchecked. Again, on, in a wild race over a space of smooth road, swerving in increasing fright from every dark shade, swinging round the turns with reckless leaps, crunching over the rough stones with furious jolts. Now they plunged down a steep hill, the wheels rattled fast behind; with dainty steps, they scarcely avoided a stumble that might be fatal. Across the road at its lowest point, ran a little stream; the white moonbeams falling on its rippling bosom made it look like a sheet of silver. With pointed ears they saw the imagined terror too late to avoid it. They drew half aside, but already they were in the rill. The cool waters springing up in a glittering shower under their small hoofs, gave additional alarm to their excited nerves. They strained up the opposite hill in frenzied haste. Here was the last cross road, with a sudden wrench of his vigorous arm, Denbigh succeeded in forcing them around the curve. They passed it abruptly, nearly overturning the phæton, and were in the lonely lane. The gloom of the trees around them, the sudden change from the brighter way, gave the last touch to their headlong terror. Blinded and bewildered, they made a few quick, distracted leaps; there was no fence to guide them, they dragged the light wagon against the trees, once, twice—the wheels narrowly escaped entanglement in the trunks. The cottage was in sight now, the sullen light from its window falling in a red bar across the path. With crazy eyes they saw what seemed a new danger, and to avoid it rushed directly over the sapling that stood before the door. For an instant it resisted the force brought against it, snapping the pole and tearing away the harness. The infuriated horses reared wildly in dumb affright, the little tree bent at last, and with a sudden turn the phæton was upset. Edith was flung to the ground, and Denbigh, retaining for a moment his hold on the reins, was dashed out with great force, dragged on a few cruel paces, and then the ponies, freed from restraint, tore away from the broken wagon, trampling with one fatal step on the fallen man, and breathless and exhausted stumbled into the gloomy forest.
                  Edith had not, during all this fearful drive, wholly lost her consciousness. After her final attempt to escape from her hateful companion, and finding herself in his powerful grasp, she had given up in a sort of dull despair. It was no use to struggle, that could but precipitate the fate which their rapid pace threatened, and feeling utterly helpless, she closed her eyes with an unspoken prayer, awaiting the inevitable end. It came at last. Paralyzed with alarm, she felt those last dangerous bounds. Then there was a crash, a moment of unconsciousness, and she awoke to find herself lying on the soft earth, with no worse injury than the rude shock, and the sand that was easily shaken from her silken robe. Slowly recovering, with another short prayer of thankfulness for her extraordinary escape, she rose and looked around her. Above through the branches of the trees, the gentle moonbeams sifted like flakes of silver on the scene below. Around her were the fragments of the broken wagon. Near by the crushed sapling trailed its yellow branches on the ground. A short distance off, dimly discernable in the shadow, stood the panting ponies, arrested by the tangled trees. In front of her the cottage rose up dark, except where the gleam of light stole through the blinds; and close by, on the pile of earth and stones, there lay a shapeless, unmoving mass that Edith regarded with shuddering terror. At that moment the door of the house opened, and a woman appeared on the step holding a candle in her hand, and peering out into the darkness.
                  "Help! help!" cried Edith, turning towards her, with the feeling that any one of her own sex would be a protection.
                  "What's happened?" asked the woman, coming forward with the light.
                  "I think he has been drinking," said Edith, disgustfully, and drawing away from the stupified body.
                  "It's worse than that!" exclaimed Slater, with an oath, as she held the light over the prostrate form.
                  Then Edith looked and saw with sickening horror that Denbigh was powerless for evil. Overcoming her first repugnance, she approached the woman, and together they bent over that apparently lifeless form. His face was ghastly pale, his black hair, soiled with dust, falling away from it in livid contrast; the blue lids were closed over his fierce eyes. From between the set teeth a stream of blood was slowly stealing over his dark beard. He had fallen on the hard, cruel stones, as pitiless as his own heart. One arm was crushed under him, and there was something fearful in the limp helplessness of the other limbs.
                  "He is dying!" said Edith in alarm. "Oh, this is too dreadful!"
                  "He is mighty bad off, to be sure," said Slater. "He little thought to come here this way."
                  Edith did not fully take in the sense of these words. Now that she had nothing to fear from him, she was only anxious to do what she could to aid him. "You will help me take care of him, won't you?"
                  "To be sure," replied Slater, surprised. "What else be I here for?"
                  "Then you will take him into your house."
                  
                  "Lord bless you!" exclaimed Slater, "'taint my house, it's his'n. Here, you take the candle, and I'll see if I can lift him."
                  Edith heard her with bewildered surprise; but this was no time for questioning, so she took the light in silence. Slater stooped over the unconscious man, and raised him in her powerful arms. A hollow groan showed that at least the spirit was awake to suffering. He was a heavy burden, and Slater staggered as she stepped forward, his head fell back helplessly on her arm, and Edith, aroused to compassion even for him, overcame her reluctance to his touch and carefully supported it on her shoulder. Thus slowly they proceeded into the house, and to the bed-room. During this removal his groans were frequent, and when they laid him down, his lips suddenly unclosed, a dark stream of gore flowed out over his elegant dress onto the white pillows, and a shade of bluer pallor stole over his rigid features.
                  "Is he dead?" gasped Edith, in an awe struck whisper.
                  "No, only in a swooned," said Slater.
                  "What can we do for him?"
                  "Nothink as I knows on; he'll come to after a while, I guess—if he don't, it's all one, we can't help it."
                  "But this is horrible!" exclaimed Edith. "Is there no one here who can go for a doctor?"
                  "Lord! no! Who should there be? He wouldn't have nobody only me."
                  Again Edith was surprised, but something she felt must be done. "Have you any camphor?"
                  "No, nothink of the sort."
                  "And no brandy?"
                  "No, I had some beer, but I suppose that ain't no good, besides I guess it's a most all gone."
                  "At least there is water here"
                  "Yes;" and Slater, at Edith's directions, brought some from the wash-stand. With a strong effort conquering her disgust, Edith gently bathed that once handsome face, now so ghastly, and washed away the clotted blood. For a while her efforts seemed useless, but at last he sighed and appeared to recover consciousness, for without opening his eyes, those heart-rending groans recommenced. Edith listened for a few moments, and then feeling that she could be of no further use, and unable longer to endure the sight of his agony, she went out into the parlor. Slater remained behind awhile and then joined her, stirring up the wretched fire.
                  "How is he now?" asked Edith.
                  "'Bout the same—we can't do nothink for him. Not much as he thought to be this night."
                  There was a moment's pause. Edith was thinking of all that was inexplicable in this woman's words, and looking curiously around the room. There was a smartness and newness about the furniture in strange contrast with the humble appearance of the place, and then Slater herself was such a queer person. For the first time she narrowly regarded her as she stood there in front of the fire. In compliance with Denbigh's injunctions she had procured a calico dress of a large flowery pattern, a broad collar of coarse embroidery, and a cap with wide ruffles, that shaded without softening her disagreeable face. Instinctively from the first, Edith had shrunk from her, though she had not before seen how wicked and depraved was her expression.
                  "Is this your house?" she asked, at last, resolved to solve the mystery.
                  "No, didn't I tell you it was his'n?"
                  "What, his house? Mr. Denbigh's?" demanded Edith, incredulously.
                  "Yes, to be sure—Mr. Percival Denbigh took it for you."
                  "For me!"
                  "Just so. Didn't you know about it? Little he thought to come here this way though. How did it happen?"
                  "The horses ran away; but I don't think he meant to come here, at least he did not tell me."
                  "Didn't he, though?" answered the woman. "Where did you expect to go this night?"
                  "Go! why home, of course!" replied Edith, indignantly.
                  "Why, you must be the sweetheart he meant."
                  Edith scarcely yet began dimly to comprehend the situation. "What!" she cried, "do you mean to imply that he intended to bring me here?"
                  "He never said nothing about not tellin' you," meditated Slater. "He only said he wanted me to take care of this house for a while, and I was to ask no questions. I knowed he was goin' to bring a pretty lady here, and you be a pretty lady, sure-ly."
                  Completely overcome by the enormity of this discovery, Edith could only sink trembling into a chair. All was now explained—the delay in starting, the deception by which she had been persuaded to leave without her companions, the rapid drive, and the final runaway! What an escape! She shuddered to think how fatally she would have been compromised had Denbigh reached there well and strong, and she had been a prisoner in this strange house, with only that stupid, stolid woman for protection. The accident which alone had saved her from a fate too terrible for contemplation, seemed like a direct aid from above, and she could only in her first amazement, fervently thank that God who had mercifully guarded her innocence from even a shadow of suspicion.
                  Now that she knew that Denbigh had deliberately selected this road, and that this woman was an accomplice, she felt a thousand times more anxious to escape from this horrible position. Yet she could not but pity Denbigh. The anguished groans that sounded from his bed of suffering modified her first indignation into a divine compassion, it was easy to forgive one so helpless, it was impossible to harbor resentment in view of so terrible a retribution, and she resolved that the first act when morning enabled her to go in search of aid, should be to send succor for him. And then the thought of Lionel, which through all this awful time had been as the memory of home to the weary traveller, returned with fresh comfort. With her implicit trust in his devotion, she did not doubt that he would seek her out, perhaps at that moment he was searching for her, certainly he was thinking of her, and with sweet confidence in meeting him, in safety, she could pity as the angels pity that miserable and tortured man.
                  She had sent Slater back to watch by him, and as long as he made no sound but these low groans, she would not voluntarily look on his distress, but at last she heard him speaking inarticulately. It might be that her ear would be quicker than that dull woman's to catch some word which might come from him, and she hastened again to that chamber of horror. A change had passed over him, there was a dull glow on his cheeks that told of fever, and his eyes were wide open, bright with a fierce glitter, but utterly wild and unreasoning.
                  "Water! water!" he murmured hoarsely.
                  Edith held the cup to his lips, raising his head a little with her hand, and Slater whispered, "He's got some inn'ard hurt, and a big bruise on his neck."
                  He drank thirstily, his head dropping heavily, as Edith loosened her hold.
                  "He ain't got no power over hisself," pursued Slater, "I think his back is broke."
                  "Hush!" said Edith imperiously, and there was a pause only broken by Denbigh's gasping breath. Edith moved the candle a little that it might not shine in his eyes, and the light fell on her lovely face with its halo of golden curls, and its sweet expression of pitying compassion. He looked at her with a long shriek—
                  "An angel! an angel! yet this is not heaven! I tell you, Adrienne Clifford, she is beautiful as an angel! and she shall be mine!"
                  "He's out of his mind," commented Slater, as he paused with a prolonged groan.
                  "This is terrible!" exclaimed Edith, "are you sure there is no physician you could bring?"
                  "I ain't been here but a few days, and I ain't seen nobody. When it's light I might find some one," replied Slater, reluctantly.
                  "Ah! ha! ha!" laughed Denbigh, wildly, "you say I called you beautiful once, Adrienne! but you were young then, not such a hag as you are now," he paused and tried to raise his hand to his forehead, it fell back impotently. "What is the matter with my head? Do you know Adrienne? Are we in hell? Oh! don't tempt me with your devil's eyes! I never loved you as I do her! But what should you care now? have her boy lover to yourself!" Here his restless eye fell on Slater, and he went on in a low tone, "The house is quiet, I mean to marry her, and then I shall be happy," again a long groan, he was silent for a moment and Edith in alarm came near. Once more his eyes lit up with the fierce pain, "An angel! an angel! Yes but you are a devil, Adrienne Clifford. No, do not say I blighted your life! Did not you first lead me away from Alice? My wife! my wife!" he murmured as if the name recalled long-forgotten memories. "No, I did not kill her! it was you Adrienne, your black eyes drew me away, and then she grew pale and was gone! An angel! an angel! she will never let me enter heaven, I must follow your devilish eyes to hell!"
                  Edith would hear no more. "I can do no good here," she said. "You stay with him, and call me if there is any change."
                  She went again to the little parlor, but through the closed doors she could still hear Denbigh's terrible ravings, now only incoherent groans, and then again strange allusions to past orgies, or forgotten loves. But prominent in all his allusions were the forms of Adrienne Clifford, and of his dead wife. Edith could not yet realise the complicity of Adrienne in this plot, but she heard enough in those long hours of darkness to fill her heart with horror, and awaken suspicions she reluctantly acknowledged even to herself. It was terrible sitting there unable to give aid, and yet forced to listen to those moans of anguish. Often she arose, and looked into that chamber of dread, but there was no change, only sometimes he would try to move, and then with yells of pain and fierce oaths sink back, helplessly. Then he would fancy that fiends were holding him down, and pouring molten lead over him, and shriek out blasphemies that made poor Edith's blood run cold. She could only steal away again, and sinking on her knees weep out pitiful prayers for this poor lost soul.
                  Even Slater was touched by his dreadful agony, and whispered Edith in an awe-struck tone, that she believed he was all shattered to pieces. So the weary moments stole away, the miserable fire grew lower and lower, burning dull and lurid, lighting up that comfortless apartment with an angry flicker; the wretched candle sputtered away and at last flared out in the socket, there was no other except the one Slater had in that room of suffering, and Edith would rather sit by the dull glow of the coals than share that light and all that it illumined. Many a time she looked out of the window, never before had a night seemed so endless, would morning ever come? Then again she thought of Lionel, and the time when she should escape from this place of terrors, and be once more safe at home among friends, but could she ever recover from this night of horrors, she wondered vaguely if her golden hair had not turned grey in all that distressful time. Then again she made herself more sad by thinking perhaps she was to blame for all this, once she had liked this man, now so fallen, perhaps her thoughtless coquetry had remotely lead to this final catastrophe. Whatever innocent wrong she had done she surely expiated by her tears and sorrow, as she felt to her very heart every agonizing cry of that wretched man.
                  After awhile, when she went again to the window, she saw, to her intense relief, the bright dawn stealing through the trees. Very soon she could see the road white before the door, and distinguish distinctly the nearer objects—the broken tree, and those fatal stones, red with what seemed a faint stain of blood. Not much longer need she wait. Denbigh's ravings had grown more incoherent in the last hour, and now they had ceased in a stupor of exhaustion. When she went in to look at him for the last time, he lay with closed eyes again—but how shocking the change that the daylight revealed! His cheeks were hollow; his brow wrinkled; great purple circles were round his swollen lids, and over his face such a livid pallor had come, that Edith was aghast.
                  "He must be worse," she whispered to Slater.
                  "He is struck with death," replied the woman. "He never will be any better."
                  Full of the greatest distress, Edith hurried away, and wrapping her cloak around her, went out to search for help. The pure fresh air of morning revived her somewhat, but she felt very weak and unequal to any great exertion, as she turned her faltering steps away from the house. She followed the direction Slater had said led towards the road, but it might be a weary way to the first habitation where she could obtain aid, and she went on almost despairing, when suddenly her quick car caught the faint beat of a horse's feet. Some one was coming, then; and she paused to see who it might be. Down the hill splash through the water; faint a moment, and then tramp, tramp up the road. The pace slackened a little, but once more on smooth ground, the sound came quick and strong as of some one riding in haste; nearer and nearer, now he turns the corner; in a moment he is in sight. Surely there is something familiar in that graceful, alert figure!
                  
                  At the same moment the horseman caught sight of the pale, sad-eyed girl—a few rapid steps, with his heart beating almost to suffocation, and he was by her side,
                  "My darling! my darling!"
                  "Oh, Lionel!"
                  She could only gasp his name as she sank into his arms, and so sobbed out all her terrible story on her lover's breast.
                  After awhile she recovered somewhat, and together they went back to the lonely cottage. Lionel's presence seemed to give Edith new strength, and she was even willing to wait there during his absence. His first overwhelming indignation at the plot which her broken words disclosed was quenched by her account of Denbigh's awful sufferings. It was impossibls to retain any resentment, when he gazed on the crushed form of his baffled and ruined rival.
                  Another hour Edith was left there alone, but she could bear it better now—Denbigh was quiet, and Lionel, her beloved friend would soon be there to help her. The first arrival was the physician whom Rohan had sent. Very little could he do for the dying man; but his presence was a relief; and shortly after, Lionel returned. He had made good use of his time, having brought with him a wagon to carry Edith home, and a man to lead back Vinton's poor ponies. Every possible care was taken of them after their return to their comfortable stables, but they never recovered from the effects of their desperate night race.
                  One of Lionel's first acts had been to return the horse he had so unceremoniously borrowed. He had no idea who its owner was; so he could only send it to Mr. Boynton, with a note, offering ample excuse for his apparent theft, and merely stating, in explanation, that he had followed the runaway ponies, mentioning the accident their fright had led to, but, of course, saying nothing of the intentions of the dying man. It may be as well to state here, that the gentleman to whom the horse belonged had been greatly surprised at finding him gone when he left the Boyntons'; but, never suspecting that he had been stolen, had concluded he must have loosed his bridle and strayed away. He was obliged to walk home, but as the distance was short, this was no great hardship. He was agreeably surprised at his steed's speedy return, and very amiably accepted the apologies which, a few days afterwards, Lionel made in person.
                  The physician and Slater seemed amply able to take care of Denbigh, who, before Edith left, had broken out again into frantic ravings. In listening only for those few moments to his heart-rending shrieks, Lionel felt that whatever evil he had designed was punished by this awful retribution. On their homeward drive, he decided with Edith that it was best, on every account, if possible, to keep the motives of the night disaster a secret. The runaway and the accident would sufficiently explain their mysterious disappearance. Edith was very languid, but, leaning on her lover's arm, listening to his gentle words, felt that, after all these storms, at least she had found rest.
                  At the ferry they left their country conveyance, and on the other side taking a carriage, drove to the Rockfords', reaching there just as Mr. Rockford and Vinton were sitting down to their breakfast. The family had been a little surprised at Edith's not returning, but Vinton, who sat up for her, refused to be anxious, because Lionel and the wagon were also missing. He had concluded that she must have staid all night with the Boyntons. Therefore when she entered, so pale and wan, leaning on Lionel Rohan's arm, they started up in dismay, with rapid questions. Edith left her lover to explain all the dark events of the night, while she hastened away to whisper her happy secret and the story of horror to her sympathizing aunt. Miss Clarissa, too, must be told of the engagement, though not of all that had led to the catastrophe of Denbigh's fatal injury. She was very much interested; but more thoughtful than any one else, was the first to suggest hot tea and repose for the poor tired heroine.
                  The whole family were delighted with Edith's choice. Mrs. Rockford, feeling with daily increasing certainty how fast her disease gained ground, was glad to think that before the dark change, her dear niece would have a loving guardian. Mr. Rockford considered "Mr. Rohan quite unexceptionable, a very suitable match, very." Vinton had, as we have seen, long wished to have his cousin and his friend united, and Miss Clarissa rejoiced in the prospect of preparing the wedding and the trousseau.
                  After leaving the Rockfords, Lionel had made it his first duty to send the best medical assistance that New York afforded to Denbigh. But it came too late. When the physician reached that lonely house, the dews of death were gathering fast on the brow of the doomed man. He had never recovered his reason since that fatal fall, and on the evening of that day when he had expected to call Edith his own, that gifted but ill-regulated spirit returned to the God who made it.
                  There was a deal of gossip in the inquisitive world about this sudden death and the new engagement, and enough came out concerning the events of the night to render Adrienne Clifford decidedly uncomfortable. The Boyntons considered the mysterious way in which she appeared after their party and claimed their hospitality, very strange. They did not like her, and were unsparing in their denunciations. She had few friends, and none to defend her. Despised by her cousins, neglected by her acquaintance, baulked of her passion and foiled in her schemes, nothing remained but an inglorious retreat. She went back to her home, where to this day she lives the wretched life of one wholly unloved. Deserted by the friends of her youth, no longer admired for her beauty or courted for her wit, without children to cheer her, or society to interest, she spends her time in doing all the mischief she can to those younger or more fortunate than herself. Unable always to accomplish her evil wishes, she grows daily more malicious and disagreeable, so that it seems quite probable that her career may end as did that of the wicked fairy in the tale of Graciosa and Percinet who blew up in a paroxysm of spite!
                  It was fortunate for Edith that she had Lionel's love to sustain her in the time of trial that followed shortly on her happy engagement. Yet there were first a few weeks of calm, while the quiet spring brightened into summer, and all at home remained unchanged. The pleasantest point in this placid time was the merry morning when Edith and Lionel waited on the radiant Ben and the blushing Fanny as they pronounced their marriage vows amid the show and glitter of crowded Grace Church. Edith wished to decline acting as bride's-maid on account of her engagement; but Fanny would hear of no denial, saying playfully that she was sure she should have no Sunshine in her life if Sunshine did not smile on her wedding. So Edith, in blue and white, more lovely than ever with the lustre of her new happiness, leaned on the arm of the proud Lionel, first of the fair train that followed the handsome bride to the altar.
                  Of course there was a gay breakfast afterwards, and then the pleasant journey that was to begin the journey of life to this well-matched pair. All success attend them! Honest in head and loving in heart, may the coming years be crowned with the riches of content, and bright with the Sunshine of prosperity!
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER VII.
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "I am too unhappy
                              To die; as some too wayworn cannot sleep."
                           
                        
                        FESTUS.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "What charm can soothe her melancholy,
                              What art can wash her guilt away?"
                           
                        
                        VICAR OF WAKEFIELD.
                     
                  
                  THE improvement which appeared to sustain Mrs. Rockford during the early weeks of spring was but a deceitful lull in the progress of the disease. A very few days after the wedding she had an alarming relapse, and from that moment she grew rapidly weaker, and this without any apparent cause. No one suspected that Edith's reading to her aunt, for the first time in many months, a letter from Mabel, in which she spoke with affectionate enthusiasm of soon seeing her friends again, had anything to do with this attack. The old anxiety she had for a while combatted with other interests returned with renewed poignancy, and she felt with keenest dread how near was the final struggle. From this time it seemed as if sleep had forever left her tired eyes; except under the influence of anodynes she was unable to obtain the repose that was so essential to her excited nerves. The moment that the potent drugs lost their power she woke to long hours of watching and harassing thoughts, to anticipation that was torture, and memory that was despair.
                  Vinton alone realized the full extent of his mother's danger, and as she grew weaker his love seemed to strengthen. He watched every symptom, and saw all too plainly how fast she was fading away. For the rest, her husband knew that she was very ill, but he left matters to take their course, and remained philosophically indifferent to the result. Miss Clarissa had a theory of her own, to the effect that air and a little exertion would vastly benefit her. Edith was too joyous to see the dark clouds that threatened so sad a storm.
                  As the weather grew warmer the invalid became impatient to return to her country home. No one knew better than herself how fast she failed. She feared with mortal terror that longer to postpone what must be done might make it too late. Of course, now more than ever in that household her wishes were law. Her husband no longer thwarted her in anything; he felt how short a time he would have to encounter any opposition from her, and was willing to let her last days pass in peace. So the house at Rockford lawn was put in order earlier than usual, and one soft spring day, late in May, Mrs. Rockford, with Vinton, Edith, the physician and servants, went on board the boat, which seemed an easier conveyance than the cars, to take the dying woman home.—Mr. Rockford and Miss Clarissa remained to close the New York house.
                  It was a lovely afternoon. As they steamed up the beautiful bay the air blew soft from the south as if it had come fresh from the spice islands of the tropics. The shores were bright with the varied hues of the waving woods and emerald grass, and under the spreading trees the graceful villas looked out on clean shaven lawns rolling down to the water's edge. The sea, smooth as if it had never known storms, rippled in dancing wavelets around the ship, or sprang up in foamy diamonds in the wake, while overhead the sky arched in fathomless azure with the golden sun flashing down its dazzling radiance on the beautiful earth and ocean.
                  Mrs. Rockford seemed really invigorated by the change of scene and the pure breezes, and towards evening, as they drew near home, she begged to have the couch on which she lay rolled out onto the deck. The coast had grown wilder; the sound had expanded so that it was no longer land locked, and already the long swell of the great deep racked the ship. The rugged shore showed no sign of habitation, but as they proceeded they came under the shadow of a hill. On its summit was the desolate burying ground. Mrs. Rockford roused herself and looked up at the frowning cliff. That tall, white monument stood out distinct from the rest; behind it the setting sun sent out streams of crimson light, so that it seemed as if surrounded by a halo of flame.
                  Whether this last exertion were too much for her, or from some hidden cause, Mrs. Rockford was terribly exhausted by this journey. When she reached her own room she fell from one swoon to another, creating the liveliest alarm for her life. But her strong constitution was not yet destroyed.—The faintness yielded at last to Dr. Monroe's skillful remedies, and when he left her for the night she seemed free from pain, and was sunk in such sleep as his medicines could procure for her. In the morning she was better; indeed, she appeared wonderfully strong considering her recent suffering, but the quick eye of the physician detected in this but a false improvement, and knew that it was the fire of a consuming fever that sustained her.
                  Relieved from the immediate dread of danger to his mother, Vinton's thoughts would revert to the old channel. Very soon now that meeting with Mabel of which he had been dreaming for months, must take place. Mrs. Rockford saw that he was preoccupied from any interest except herself, and marked with a keen anguish the flush and start with which he received the announcement that Mrs. Sandys and her daughter were in the parlor. Hope was not all gone then; it was as she had feared. The struggle she so dreaded was fast approaching. With eager ears she listened to every sound that stole to her quiet chamber from the drawing-room below, as if by those faint utterances she could read the scene.
                  At first it was rather a trying one to Vinton. Although he had so carefully prepared himself for this moment, he could not but express in his wistful eyes and tremulous greeting the undying affection he must ever feel towards Mabel. And she was more lovely than ever. Her round cheek had lost none of its color; her blue eyes were all untroubled; every smile, every word, showed a mind at ease, a heart at rest. It was evident that the past months had passed lightly over that tranquil brow. And from this one fact she was the more shocked at the change in Vinton.—The night of anxiety he had passed had made his face even more haggard than usual, and it was painful to trace on it those lines of care that should not have been for many long years to come. Mabel felt an actual pang of regret at what seemed her own heartlessness, and with a return of her old admiring regard, forgot all embarrassment in her desire to express her sympathy in his solicitute for his mother, and her assurances of unchanging friendship. They were soon seated side by side as of old, each feeling how dear the other was, what comfort there was in such companionship, and yet had Paul Haughton watched them ever so narrowly he would have seen no word or look that could have awakened jealousy.
                  So this first meeting which had been dreaded by all was safely over. Edith, so radiant with her own happiness that she saw everything through a rose-colored medium, was delighted that Mabel and Vinton should once more be good friends, and pleased to listen to Mr. Haughton's kind congratulations and hopes for the future.
                  After this it was easy for these young people to meet almost daily. Vinton soon found his way to the Sandys' house, and it became his greatest relaxation to sit in their quiet parlor when released from attendance on his mothers's bed of suffering, and listen to Mabel's gentle consolations. Nor could he help sometimes hoping that when this time of agony was past, he might yet find his happiness in Mabel's placid affection.
                  All this, with senses sharpened by illness, Mrs. Rockford knew from the few words dropped in her presence, and from the tireless watch she kept upon her son. He was too honorable she knew to woo Mabel now, but every moment with her was dangerous, and still she could not nerve herself for the final desperate resort. She was failing fast; all around her saw this. Dr. Monroe felt that his skill could avail nothing, but to smooth the passage to the tomb. Every hour of this torturing anxiety she knew was hastening the end, yet she would leave no means untried to escape the doom that threatened, and which she dreaded far worse than death. One expedient yet remained to be tried; and one morning, when she felt better able to bear the exertion, she asked Vinton to send for Mr. Haughton. Her son was delighted with this request. Many times both he and her gentle niece had tried to turn Mrs. Rockford's thoughts to the Great Source of all consolations, but she had always met their suggestions with such imperious rejection as well nigh precluded all hope for the future. The young man hailed, therefore, this request as being, as he trusted, an indication of a hopeful change.
                  The clergyman, too, received the summons with equal pleasure. He had sought in close attention to his parish duties a distraction from the thoughts that would haunt him, of the happiness in store for his beloved cousin with another. In the long months of winter, when he had been her companion, he had often seen such indications of her preference as made his heart beat with the wildest hopes. Surely he had never seen those gentle eyes look on another with that timid admiration they sometimes expressed when turned towards him, and the glow which his sudden presence called to her pale cheek was deeper than had ever awaited his friend's coming. Yet now he was condemned to see Vinton daily beside her, received with more intimacy than even his relationship had ever allowed. He knew, too, that Mrs. Sandys sanctioned these visits. She saw that Mrs. Rockford could not remain long in this state. She could not blame Vinton for yielding to the wishes of that dear invalid, and she looked forward to the time when, released from his promise, he should once more renew his addresses with anticipated certainty. This gentle lady had done all in her power to soothe her old friend's hours of illness, and had been greatly shocked at the tone of utter defiance with which Mrs. Rockford scoffed at her kind suggestions of religious consolation. She had whispered her distress on this subject to Mr. Haughton, who had, ever since his interview with her in the winter, felt the warmest interest in this wayward sufferer. He had more than once sent up his name with the hope of meeting her again, but had always received the reply that "Mrs. Rockford was not able to see any one." It was therefore with the most fervent desire to be of some help to her, in this hour of need, that in answer to the summons Vinton brought, he went to Rockford Lawn.
                  The soft summer breeze was stealing through the closed blinds and lace curtains, bringing with it the drowsy sound of singing insects and the faint perfume that stole up from the garden, all glorious with the flowers of June. The bright sunshine was carefully excluded from the invalid's room, and on his first entrance Mr. Haugton could with difficulty distinguish the objects in this semi-obscurity. The soft carpet seemed a woven mass of green fern leaves. The mirrors reflecting the pearl and gold wall-paper, seemed cool depths of soft tints. Large bouquets of exquisite roses in beautiful vases on the marble tables, shed their sweetness on the air. Here were all comforts that art and luxury could desire lavished uselessly, unable to give one moment of ease to that poor dying woman.
                  Mrs. Rockford lay on a low couch draped with lace curtains. Her embroidered robe was all white. A muslin cap confined the blanching hair, and out of this mass of snowy draperies looked her haggard face, her burning eyes. Prepared as he was for the change which weeks of illness must have made, Mr. Haughton was yet greatly horrified to see how wasted and ghastly had grown this once beautiful lady. Death had placed his pallid stamp upon her brow in plainest characters, and he read with a sudden conviction her swiftly-approaching doom. Mrs. Rockford guessed his thoughts.
                  "You see," she said feebly," my time is short. What I have to do must be done quickly."
                  "But it is not yet too late," replied Paul, misinterpreting her words.
                  "I do not mean that," she answered, impatiently. "It is no time now to atone for the past. I can only guard for the future against the evil consequences of what is done."
                  "Again I must assure you, even at the risk of offending you, that it can never be too late."
                  "I thank you for your solicitude, and I honor your fidelity to the religion you profess," replied Mrs. Rockford, courteously. "But it is not for such service I sent for you. You can aid me, though not in that way."
                  "I shall be happy to aid you in anything," rejoined Paul. "But I think there can be nothing here so important now as the interests of another world."
                  "That may be," assented Mrs. Rockford, half contemptuously. "Yet I must beg you to permit me to judge. My time is short, my strength but feebleness. I must hasten to say what I consider of the utmost moment. You can do much for me. You can make my dying bed easy and enable me to look forward to the future with some hope."
                  "What is it?" asked Paul. "To the utmost of my power I will do whatever I can to make you happy."
                  "Not happy! that can never be! but content to die. Ah! Mr. Haughton, I could long ago have been glad to be at rest, had it not been for the fear that haunts me of what may happen when I am gone." She paused a moment, as if for breath, and then went on. "You know how I have opposed my son's proposed engagement to Miss Sandys. You know how I wrung from him a reluctant renunciation for the present. But I am haunted with the fear that when I am gone he will think himself absolved from his pledge, and this detestable union may yet take place. Mr. Haughton, you are Mabel's cousin, her guardian and guide: promise me that she shall never marry him."
                  During this appeal, Paul had been growing more and more agitated, and when she made the final demand, he started to his feet in irrepressible surprise and distress. "You do not know what you ask of me!" he cried, "I cannot and dare not make this promise. It would be weak; it would be dishonorable!"
                  "Why?" asked Mrs Rockford, astonished at his emotion. "I know I make a strange request, but, under the circumstances, I think it might be complied with."
                  "But not by me! not by me!" said Paul, quickly. "Any one else rather than I."
                  "Ah! if I could tell you why I ask; if you knew from what it would save me, you would not refuse," plead Mrs. Rockford.
                  "No, nothing ought to induce me to do what you ask."
                  "Yes, if you heard my reasons, I am sure you would do it," she persisted. "Every feeling of your heart would revolt against the horrible union, and you would be anxious as I am to prevent it."
                  "No, no! I do not question your motives," replied Paul, quickly. "Whatever they are makes no difference to me. Only I cannot be the person to interfere."
                  "May I ask, why not?"
                  "Yes, madam," answered Paul, deliberately, overcoming his feelings for her sake. "As you have appealed to me in this trying season, you have a right to an explanation of my refusal. I cannot interfere with my cousin's choice, because I love her myself!" His voice shook as he made this last announcement; but he resumed his seat, as if the struggle were past.
                  "Ah!" cried Mrs. Rockford, with a sudden start of hope, "then she will be yours. She does not, she connot love Vinton, except—" After a moment of hesitation, she added the words, "except as a brother. I am sure of this. Then why will you not woo her at once?"
                  "Because Vinton is my friend," answered Paul, impetuously; "because I had been their confidant, and it would be disgraceful and dishonorable to take advantage of this knowledge, to my own profit."
                  "I see!" assented Mrs. Rockford, a sudden look of profoundest pain sweeping over her face. "Oh, my God! my last hope is gone! You alone could have helped me; and since that cannot be, I must pay the terrible penalty of the past, and destroy my son's honor and happiness forever!" These last words were spoken in such a heart-rending tone, and accompanied with such a spasm of anguish, that Paul cried out in alarm—
                  "You are ill! Let me call some assistance."
                  "No, not now!" gasped Mrs. Rockford. Then added, with slowly-recovered breath, "I need not ask you not to repeat my incautious words. You see what is killing me! It is this terrible mental anguish that destroys me. Ah! if there be an expiation in this world, I have surely atoned for the past!"
                  "There can be but one atonement," said Paul, solemnly. "Oh, Mrs. Rockford, while it is yet time, think of that loving Saviour, who alone bears all our sins."
                  "No, no!" she answered, faintly, and waving him away. "I can say no more now, I am too exhausted. I must struggle on the short remainder of my weary life, without aid, human or divine!"
                  A convulsion cut short her bitter words. It was useless to linger. Paul summoned aid, and, with his heart full of the saddest compassion, went out from the presence of this doomed woman that on earth he was never to see again.
               
               
                  
                  CHAPTER VIII.
                  
                     
                        
                           "An eternal separation! Oh, God! oh, God! how can I bear the thought?"
                        
                        CLARISSA HARLOWE.
                     
                  
                  AFTER that interview with Mr. Haughton, the desperate necessity of final action sustained Mrs. Rockford through many weary days. With a last effort of her iron will she so controlled all outward expression of sufferings as to peruade her friends that it was not necessary to have a watcher constantly with her at night. The maid might sleep in the next room, within call; she would summon her, if necessary. She was so strenuous on this point, that, very reluctantly, Miss Clarissa and Edith consented to the arrangement; but on the first morning the answers to all inquiries were so satisfactory that, after a few days, they all became quite reconciled to it. Indeed it would seem, from Aglae's assurances, that Mrs. Rockford had rested unusually well; no sound had disturbed her own repose. She naturally concluded that her mistress had slept with equal tranquillity.
                  Yet very differently did the unhappy lady pass those hours of darkness. She had caused the small cabinet which accompanied her always in her removals, to be placed beside her bed, and, when all was quiet, she raised herself from her feigned slumbers, and with indomitable energy began her last awful duty. With feeble hands she unlocked the inlaid door, and took out the lower drawer. It was arranged as a desk, and contained writing materials. They were rapidly spread before her on the bed, and with dry eyes and burning fingers she began her labors.
                  It was a harder task than even she had thought, this recalling all the dead and buried past, and with slow torture recording the history of the years so hopelessly gone. Night after night, as long as her strength permitted, the wretched woman wrote on. Sometimes it was only for a few moments, then over her sensitive brain would rush all the tide of some intolerable recollection; or the force of the cruel words a relentless destiny compelled her to frame, would smite her with sudden power, and the pen would fall from her nerveless grasp, and she would sink back in a convulsion of silent anguish. Again the fierce fever seemed to burn with sustaining delirium, and she would hurry on over necessary details that were all she could offer in paliation of her errors, or carried away by her feelings, pour out her heart in eloquent appeals for love and forgiveness.
                  But at last the sad tale was finished, and with it Mrs. Rockford's life, which seemed to have been prolonged for this purpose, lost its last hold on vitality. It was only with intervals of rest that she could fold and arrange the papers, and her signature was an illegible scrawl. Yet all was not yet done. It was long past midnight, the shaded night lamp was burning dim, the house was very still, only outside sounded the long moan of the rising wind that heralded a storm. After a lengthened pause, the dying woman raised herself slowly on one arm, twice she sank back before she could make the needful effort, but rallying all her strength she succeeded finally in leaning over and touching the spring of the secret drawer. Poor pale ghost of her former self, once more, she held that shining lock of golden brown hair. Again as she reclined panting on her pillow the silken curl twined around her caressing fingers.
                  "The last time! the last time!" she murmured as she raised it to her parched lips. But she durst not linger, she felt a deadly faintness creeping over her. She must not be discovered thus; with a final exertion of will, she seemed absolutely to arrest the mortal sickness, while she hastily placed the ringlet with the papers, and sealed them up together. Then quickly, with eager eyes, that seemed straining to keep fixed to their duty, she addressed the packet, and shut it up in the hidden drawer. It was all over now, as she rapidly locked the cabinet, and pushed the keys under her pillow, she lost all power of resistance. A merciful unconsciousness stole over her, as once more the dreadful spasms convulsed her suffering frame.
                  No one knows what hours of agony she endured; the next morning she was discovered by the terrified maid, in a stupor from which nothing would rouse her. The physician was not there, he came every other day, and was expected in the afternoon. Those around her applied all remedies that had been recommended, and at last she awoke to consciousness. She seemed free from pain, only very weak, but there was on her wasted countenance that unmistakable shade that warned them all how near was the great change. She complained of cold, the day was chill and rainy, and they built a small fire of wood.
                  It was towards evening; Lionel Rohan, who was at Rockford lawn, had driven to the station to meet Dr. Monroe, stopping on the way to telegraph to Mr. Rockford, who was in New York. Miss Clarissa had gone down into the dining room with Mrs. Sandys, who had been with them all day. Edith and Vinton alone watched beside the dying woman.
                  The day was very dark, the clouds outside hung in leaden folds, the rain swept drearily across the drenched earth, and a chill wind crept up from the swollen sea. In the chamber of death, all was still, only the fire burned with a faint hiss, the clock on the mantle ticked with rapid monotony, and the storm rushed down with ceaseless splash.
                  Suddenly Mrs. Rockford opened her eyes, which still glowed as if all the wasted vitality were concentrated there.
                  "Vinton, I must say a few words with you alone."
                  "Certainly, mother."
                  Edith rose. Was it a presentiment that made her aunt call her back?
                  "Stay a moment, Edith."
                  "What is it, dear aunt?"
                  "Kiss me, darling, before you go."
                  Edith bent down and pressed her rosy lips to her aunt's wasted cheek, "I will return when you send for me," she said.
                  "Yes dear, but I may not be able to speak to you then." She took her hand, looking tenderly at her. "You have been truly my Sunshine, my sweet niece, you have charmed many a sad hour, and brightened many a dark moment."
                  "It is very good of you to say so, aunt Claudia, but you have always been so kind to me," sobbed Edith.
                  "Have I, Edith? then when I am gone you at least will sometimes think of me."
                  "Always! always!" cried Edith, unable longer to suppress the tears, that only by a strong effort she had restrained ed thus far. "I have loved you so much, dear, darling aunt, you must not leave us now."
                  "Yes Edith, it is better so, if you knew all you would not wish me to live. My life has been a very dark one, if it were not for you and Vinton, I should rejoice that it is nearly over. But it is sad to think that after a few hours I shall never see you again."
                  "Oh but you will, dear aunt, some day we shall meet, I trust, in a brighter world than this," said Edith reverently.
                  "Perhaps," sighed Mrs. Rockford, drearily. "But you will take care of Vinton, you will cheer and comfort him."
                  "Indeed I will."
                  "And now kiss me once more. Good bye, my darling niece, if I have injured you forgive me, and remember me sometimes in your gentle prayers."
                  "Oh, aunt, if you would only pray yourself you would find so much consolation in it."
                  "My petitions would be but mockery, I fear," sighed Mrs. Rockford. "Again, good-bye, dear Edith, you will be happy, I am sure, but sometimes when you are surrounded by every joy, think kindly of me."
                  Edith could only with passionate kisses promise all that her dying aunt wished, and so steal away to her own room, there to weep out all the sorrows of her affectionate heart over the loss of this kind friend whom she had loved as a parent, and whose approaching fate she mourned with most poignant grief.
                  The mother and son were alone now. The day was darkening rapidly; the fire burned low; the rain struck its chilly fingers on the window; the clock marked with its restless beats the passing seconds. Vinton's face was buried in the pillow; his frame heaved with the emotion he could not control. Mrs. Rockford gently laid her hand on his dark ringlets.
                  "Compose yourself, my dear boy, I have much to say to you before we part. Ah, do not look so sad!" she said, as he raised his haggard face and turned his tear-stained eyes on hers, "for my sake try to be calm."
                  With a strong effort he steadied his voice to reply—"I am ready to hear and treasure every word."
                  
                  "Come nearer, then, I must speak to you of Mabel.—Have you given her up?"
                  Vinton was intensely startled. For many months they had not mentioned her name. He had thought she would never utter it again. He could not for a moment reply. "You are surprised." she continued, reading his thoughts. "I have been abrupt, but my time is very short; I cannot tell how soon my strength may fail. Answer me, then, have you given her up?"
                  "You know I broke the engagement as you wished," he replied, evasively.
                  "Yes, and I assure you, Vinton, I appreciated your noble self sacrifice. But you must do more—you must promise never to renew it."
                  "Certainly, I shall not now. Oh, darling mother!" cried Vinton, "let us not talk of this. I love you better than any other woman. I have no heart to think of wooing now."
                  "But I must speak of it, Vinton. The end is coming very fast. Now or never I must have your promise."
                  "What promise?"
                  "Your solemn pledge that you will never marry Mabel Sandys."
                  "Oh, mother, do not be so cruel!"
                  "Cruel!" gasped Mrs. Rockford, "ah, my son! I am dying, yet I would not give you a moment's pain even to prolong my life. Believe me, this which you call cruelty is only mercy!"
                  "You do not know all that you ask, I am sure," replied Vinton, trying to retain his composure. "Mabel is very noble and pure in character; she loves me and why will you take away the only hope that can cheer the future that lies so dark before me?"
                  "Because it is detestable—it is horrible!" groaned Mrs. Rockford, in the excitement of fever that gave her a moment's strength. "No! wretched as I am at this moment, I should be a thousand fold more lost, if from a culpable weakness, I permitted this unnatural union!"
                  "Mother, please do not talk of it," plead Vinton. "I entreat—I implore you to be tranquil, and speak of it no more"
                  "It would be cowardly to accept peace on such terms," replied Mrs. Rockford. "No, while I am able to speak, I must have your final answer. I will not torture you and exhaust haust myself with reiterations, only I tell you that on your promise depends your own honor and happiness and my eternal repose."
                  There was a moment's pause. The clouds hung threatening, the rain dashed ceaselessly against the window, the wind howled with a tone of menace, and throb by throb the clock told off the fleeting moments of the life that faded so fast. The fire burning low fell apart, the broken brands sending up sheets of lurid flame.
                  "Will you promise?" asked Mrs. Rockford again, holding her son's hand tightly as if clinging to existence, and watching with glowing eyes his compressed lips and wrinkled brow. "Oh! for God's sake, promise!"
                  "I cannot, mother," said Vinton, slowly raising his averted head. "It would be wrong for me to sacrifice forever the happiness, not only of myself, but of another."
                  "Then you refuse utterly and positively?"
                  "Yes."
                  Vinton almost whispered the word, but she caught the sound and fell back with a long groan.
                  "Oh, darling mother, look up," he cried in alarm. "I do not mean to be unkind."
                  "No, Vinton, you are right," she gasped. "But oh, God! my punishment is heavier than I can bear!"
                  "Dearest mother, if you would only tell me why you wish it I would try to be resigned."
                  "You will know all too soon. If you would have given me that pledge, the secret would have died with me, but perhaps it is as well so; deathbed promises are made to be broken. Now I am sure that you will never marry her."—Again a moment's rest and she went on. "When I am gone, but not till after the funeral, nor till you have paid that last respect to my memory, look in the hidden drawer in my cabinet. If you cannot find the spring break it open. The rest of the papers are of no value; burn them, and after you have read it, burn that too which is my accursed legacy."
                  "Only be quiet, darling mother," Vinton said, soothingly, "I will do all as you wish."
                  "But not till after I am buried," she repeated wildly.
                  "No, but do not talk of that."
                  "I must, for it is coming very fast—the hand of death is upon me. I feel the cold touch already at my heart. And oh! to think a relentless destiny forces me to destroy in the breast of my only son all sorrow for my fate!"
                  "Oh, never! never! my dear, dear mother," cried Vinton, in horror. "You know not what you say."
                  "Yes I do, only too well, oh my son! my son! Forgive me! Try now to forgive me," she entreated in agonized excitement.
                  "I have nothing to forgive," said Vinton, greatly distressed. "Forgive you? You who have been the kindest and tenderest parent that ever blessed a child with ceaseless devotion. Forgive you? Oh, my own mother, I do not want to live when you are gone—the brightness of my life has been your love, and now you break my heart!"
                  "Yes, you love me now," repeated Mrs. Rockford, more calmly—"but for how long? Oh, Vinton, when you read my sad story, remember how cruelly I was tempted. Try to realize how black was the deceit that separated me from the man I adored, and turned my young life to bitterness. Think how, if married to one I detested, I could ever forget him. Pity me that we ever met again."
                  "Oh, hush, mother!" exclaimed Vinton, greatly shocked, and half suspecting that her mind must wander. "Do not distress yourself by recalling such wretched memories."
                  "You are right," she said, mournfully. "I will say no more; if I have sinned, I have repented it in long years of misery, and the last weight on my soul is removed by this tardy confession."
                  "Then let us look forward to a happy meeting hereafter, where the sorrows of this world are over forever."
                  "Can I hope for that?" asked Mrs. Rockford, dreamily. "At last my deceit is over. God knows how I have suffered. May He forgive me, for the sake of his Divine Son."
                  "Amen!" sobbed Vinton, more touched by this late repentance than by all her words of violence.
                  She was sinking fast, now. There was another pause—the wind sighed mournfully, the gloom deepened, the rain fell like tears. The fire flickered low, the clock monotonously ticked out the fast waning seconds.
                  Vinton knelt with his head buried in the pillow, his tangled black curls mingling with his mother's white locks. One arm was around her, the other clasped her cold hand—he was praying with heart-felt earnestness for this dear fading spirit.
                  "And you will not detest me?" whispered Mrs. Rockford.
                  "Never, darling mother, you know I shall never be happy again."
                  To the dying woman these words sounded like a prophecy. "No!" she cried, wildly. "And it is I who have blasted your life! Yet I loved you so much! Oh, my darling! my darling! it is very hard to part!"
                  "Only pray God we meet hereafter."
                  "Forgive me, forgive me!" she gasped slowly. "Oh, Vinton, my boy, my only son, pity and forgive me! In the years to come, try to think kindly of me—remember the good and not the evil. I have suffered so much! forgive me, forgive me!" Her thoughts wandered. Vinton watched her with arrested breath. Her brilliant eyes were clouded at last—she turned them unsteadily away. "George! George! Is there hope of heaven for me? Oh, God, forgive me!" She made a frantic effort to clasp her hands, while her lips moved as if in silent prayer. "Oh! Vinton—my dear son—try to forgive me!"
                  Suddenly her hands fell apart, a shiver convulsed her frame, her dark eyes glazed, her lips parted convulsively. The struggle was past—the spirit of Claudia Rockford had at last found rest.
                  The gloom had deepened to twilight, the storm moaned fitfully through the darkness, the embers of the fire had sunk away to a dull glow. The clock pointed to the hour, half-past seven. The day was over, the fire was out, the life was ended!
                  Grief was in the house—grief most sincere and overwhelming. Vinton mourned with dry-eyed, inconsolable distress, over the dearest of his earthly treasures, that idolized mother who had been the tenderest of parents, as well as the most sympathizing of friends and companions. Life seemed utterly hopeless, and with passionate misery he refused to be comforted. Edith wept for one dear as a mother, her gentle and affectionate guardian. It was hard even for her to think of consolation; but Lionel was with her, to whisper words of cheer and speak of hopes for the future. Even Mr. Rockford's iron composure felt the shock. It was not so easy as he had thought to part with the dignified and courteous partner of half a life time, and on his impassive countenance there were traces of sorrow perhaps of a tardy regret. And through a large circle of relations and acquaintances the loss of one widely respected and admired, was deeply felt.
                  After two days came the funeral. There was a great gathering of friends from a distance, as well as many from the village. There was a long line of carriages, and among the mourners some very sad faces, but none so anguish-stricken as that of the unhappy Vinton, who, leaning on Mr. Rockford's arm, seemed scarcely able, even with that aid, to endure the trying ordeal.
                  Very different was that showy procession, from the little group that, six months before, had paid the last respect to George Sandys. Yet they stood on nearly the same spot. Once more that deserted burial ground was visited by Claudia Rockford, this time to leave it no more. She had requested to be buried in the family lot which was next that of the Sandys'. So that again the white monument looked down on an open tomb, and those two so long separated in life, in death slumbered side by side. There, lulled by the voice of the murmuring sea, they rest on that lonely hill, while in the long years the same storms weep over them, the same Sunshine smiles on their grass-grown graves.
                  On the night after the funeral Vinton carried his mother's cabinet to his room. After opening the doors, he religiously, as he had promised, burned the unimportant papers it contained, and then, with trembling fingers, overcome with a vague dread, searched for the secret drawer. It was in vain. After many useless attempts to discover it, he reluctantly dashed the little desk to pieces, feeling as he did so almost as if striking a blow at his mother. In a moment the sealed packet fell out. Looking at the address written by that be-loved hand, his eyes clouded with tears. But a promise was to be fulfilled, and at last he tore it open. His first glance rested on a curl of golden brown hair. Curiously he picked it up. Right well he knew who had locks of that same bright hue; and with a sudden indefinite pang of impending evil, he seized the papers and began to read.

                              "Although thou maun never be mine,

                              Yet 'tis sweeter for thee despairing
                              Than aught in the world beside, Jessie."

                              —Surely rest is meet:
                              "They rest," we said, "their sleep is sweet."
                              And silence followed, and we wept.—
                           
                        
                        
                           In Memoriam.
                        
                     
                  
                  MRS. ROCKFORD had been dead six weeks. During all that time Vinton had been ill. On the morning after the funeral his non-appearance had alarmed the family, and his room had been finally broken open. He was found on the floor in a stupor. In the grate were the ashes of burned papers, on the floor at his side the remains of the shattered cabinet. For days afterwards he was in a high fever, and his life was almost despaired of. Edith was untiring in her attendance on one whom she loved as a brother, and whose welfare was also a sacred legacy from her departed aunt. Lionel was there too to sustain her. He took up his residence with the afflicted family, and proved a most valuable nurse.
                  One singular symptom of Vinton's illness was that he never raved. In the fiercest access of a raging delirium, when he knew no one around him, he still only vented his sufferings in inarticulate groans. Occasionally broken words would escape him, but never any coherent sentence; and those around him were so impressed with this singular reserve, that they each reached the conclusion that he was burdened with a great secret that he dreaded to betray. His first rational utterance, when after many days the fever slacked, was an anxious inquiry if in the past time of unconsciousness he had said anything unusual.
                  But Vinton had youth and a strong constitution, though perhaps he regarded these rather as enemies condemning him to life, than as friends aiding his recovery. With their help he slowly regained his strength, though but to appear among his friends the shadow of his former self. So sad and stern, with such despair in his eyes that he was as if utterly crushed by some great blight. Anxiously the gentle Edith strove to cheer him. It seemed impossible to bring a smile to that grief-stricken face. Even an allusion to Mabel awakened only a shuddering sigh. She was away during his slow convalescence, having gone with her mother to visit their friends in Boston; but Edith still continued to correspond with her, and now fixed her only hope of cheering her beloved cousin in the prospect of her return.
                  At the end of these dreary six weeks, when Vinton was so far recovered as no longer to require the attendance of a physician, he announced after Dr. Monroe's last visit his intention of going abroad. This sudden resolution was received with great surprise by the family. Edith alone expressing an approval of the plan and a confidence that a change of scene would surely benefit him. It was this consideration that finally reconciled Mr. Rockford to the proposal. He had been in desperate distress during Vinton's illness, watching through long restless nights with untiring patience. The strongest affections of his iron heart had twined themselves around this noble young man. He loved him all the more perhaps from the very fact that a secret antagonism had sometimes prevented all outward show of attachment. Now he regarded him with solicitude almost as tender as a mother's. He felt that this terrible depression must be dissipated, and was ready to make any sacrifice to insure his recovery. He had even waived his long-cherished schemes, after one brief conversation which Vinton hastily closed, having ceased to press him about Mabel. Now he was most lavish in his offers of allowance, but he was hurt and grieved by Vinton's resolute refusal to take anything but the income of his mother's property, to which he was entitled by her will.
                  So all the arrangements were made for his departure, and his passage taken on the steamer for Saturday. Two days before Mabel and her mother returned. On Friday afternoon, for the first time in many weeks, Vinton went out for a walk. He first bent his steps to the Rectory. He had seen Mr. Haughton many times during his illness, indeed his companionship had been his greatest consolation. Now his first visit was to him. Paul was gratified at his being able to be out, and they had a long and earnest conversation, then Vinton rose to go.
                  "To-morrow I shall leave," he said, "on a long perhaps an uncertain voyage; before I go I have one hard task to perform." He paused a moment, then added; "It is due to you that I should tell you that I forever resign my hopes of obtaining your cousin's hand."
                  Paul started with a sudden flush, and Vinton went on growing white to the very lips as he spoke—
                  "I know my mother's reasons now, they are such as utterly preclude all hope."
                  "Of course you are right to respect the wishes of the dead," Paul gasped.
                  "I have performed a last duty in this act," Vinton added sadly, "I have hoped many a time on my sick bed, that death would spare me this trial, but God willed it otherwise; as long as he lays upon me the burden of life, I hope I shall be able to endure it."
                  "Do not speak so despondently," urged Paul earnestly. "You are young my dear friend, you have everything to hope for the future."
                  "No, nothing," replied Vinton mournfully. "You do not know how utterly my life is blasted. But let us not speak of this, you will be happy, let me occasionally hear of your welfare."
                  "Certainly, I will write often."
                  "Mabel too, I know will sometimes think of me, and now good bye my dear friend, and God bless you."
                  It was Vinton who gave the benediction now, and Paul felt as if he received it from the lips of an earthly saint.
                  On his way down the street Vinton met Mrs. Sandys. The gentle lady could hardly restrain her tears at his altered appearance, she wrung his hand with fervent good wishes, and leaving him to join Mabel at home went away haunted by the sad memory of these hopeless eyes.
                  Vinton was soon at the Sandys' house. Mabel was at home as her mother had said, and he went to wait for her in the library. Once more he was face to face with her father's portrait. There he stood gazing mournfully yet with despairing reproachfulness, in that handsome young face, but even there was a shade of sorrow. Had he too suffered?
                  
                  The door opened, and Mabel stood beside him. Still calm and fair, more beautiful with the benefit of recent cheerful society, her eyes serene as heaven. He turned towards her and she uttered a cry of horror at the change. That haggard form, those hollow cheeks, and melancholy eyes, were but the wreck of the noble youth she remembered one short year ago so joyous and handsome.
                  "I am greatly altered," he said with a wan smile. "You are shocked, I see."
                  "I did not know you had been so ill," she faltered.
                  "Yes very ill, and I have suffered horribly," he said with a profound sigh, "but come, we will not speak of that. Let us sit here a little while, where we have so often sat before." He placed himself beside her on the sofa, then added, "I came to bid you good bye, I am going away."
                  "Going away!" Mabel gasped, regarding him with affectionate pity.
                  "Yes, Mabel, I am going abroad for a very long time."
                  "Oh, I am so sorry," and overcome with all sad feelings Mabel could not restrain her innocent tears.
                  "Do not weep, Mabel" he said gently. "Yet I am selfish enough to be pleased that you regret our parting."
                  "Indeed I do," she sobbed.
                  "And you love me, I know, dear Mabel, "he continued, quietly taking her hand, "yet not as you ought to love the man you will one day make happy with your heart."
                  Mabel looked at him, her pure eyes humid with tears. "I love you very much," she said, simply. "I never knew how much till now you talk of going away."
                  "Yes, dearest, and see, you could not tell me so, only that you love me as a sister. Say, is it not so?"
                  "Yes, Vinton."
                  "I dare not ask you to be more," he added, in tremulous tones. "I cannot tell you all that is past, but I assure you I love you as a true and tender brother. In all the long years to come let me know that you believe this."
                  "I do," she answered, greatly impressed by his strange solemnity of manner. "But you will return soon, will you not?"
                  "No, Mabel; I will say to you what no one else knows. I am going certainly for years, perhaps forever."
                  "Oh, no; why, Vinton, why do you say that?"
                  "I cannot tell you, Mabel; you alone know my secret; I tell it to you, that you may realize how much it costs me to say farewell, and that you will not refuse to cherish me in your memory as one who loved you with sincerest and purest devotion."
                  Mabel was sobbing so that she could scarcely reply.
                  "And now I must go," he said, drawing her towards him. "I believe, from my heart, that you thoroughly understand my feelings towards you, and that thought is the only consolation I have in my unhappy lot."
                  "I do," replied Mabel, earnestly, "I know that I have always felt the deepest interest in you, that I love you as a dear brother. Then why can you not stay here and be my dearest and best friend?"
                  "Ah, you are too good." Vinton answered, with a smile that was sadder than tears. "Do you not see, others would not understand it? A relentless destiny denies me the right of being really your brother. I shall hear of you, though not from you. Some day Edith will write me that you are married to a man worthy of your choice, and I shall rejoice in your happiness."
                  Mable blushed as he spoke, and Vinton wondered if already she had a preference.
                  "But, Vinton, I shall always love you."
                  "Yes, Mabel, I hope you will. That thought will be my consolation in many a dark hour; and now, dear sister, good-bye."
                  Mabel was sobbing so that she could reply only in broken words. Then, for one hallowed moment, he folded her in his arms, reverently kissing her pure cheek in farewell, and so these two, who had once thought to spend their lives together, were parted forever.
                  The next day Vinton went down to New York. All the family were with him, and many old friends came to bid him adieu. It was a hurried parting at last; there was a crowd, a rush, and they were separated from him and forced away. Edith was weeping bitterly. Clinging to her lover's arm, she looked up through blinding tears at the sad white face that was turned towards them from the deck of the steamer.
                  In the west the sky was all bright with the glowing hues of the setting sun, but in the east the clouds hung dark and lowering, and towards that threatening east the great ship moved steadily on. fainter and farther off—soon only a dark speck on the heaving ocean; so into mist and gloom, until it vanished away.
                  —Oh the long agony of uncertainty, the slow torture of prolonged suspense, about one most dear! What wretched days and nights were passed by those who had friends in that ill fated steamer! God help them, for she never was heard of again!
                  What cruel fate was hers no one ever knew. She went down with all on board into the trackless sea. Whether driven by a furious storm into the jaws of death, or with fire raging above and the waves yawning below, none can tell till the record of the sorrows of this world is read at the throne of Light.
                  Let us leave this dark hour and look on a few years. Time, the great consoler, heals many wounds. Mr. Rockford alone sank under this last cruel blow, a prematurely old man; after a short struggle he yielded to fate, and his stern spirit went to its last account. But to the other friends life had still much cheer, and after a while they recovered their joyousness.
                  Once more, there is a happy family at Rockford lawn; but Lionel Rohan is master, and Edith, the gentlest wife and mother, reigns its lovely mistress. And the Rectory is no longer lonely. Mr. Haughton has won the object of his long devotion, and Mabel's smiles make his home happy.
                  The years to come are bright before these young companions, strong in mutual affection and cheered by light from above: let us hope that the Storms are past, and that in the future, they will have only Sunshine.
