               CHAPTER I.
               INITIATORY.
               AMID the Highlands of that river, whose picturesque beauties are the pride of every American, there was situated, at the time of my story, a simple, old-fashioned house, with more years than the nation, and with a history quite as well. It stood in one of the most beautiful localities of the eastern shore, nestling at the foot of a towering Highland peak, with a rare panorama of mountain, river and meadow-land, spread out before it. It was an irregular, many-gabled structure, with bay windows opening upon terraces, and verandahs of modern construction filling up its angles. Some oaks and elms that had stood about the house in their youth, when it was in its newest freshness, and had put forth their tender branches then, with the ambitious but vain hope of sheltering it, had grown old, very old, by its side, and now extended their great huge limbs protectingly above it. One mighty yellow willow stood close to its eastern side, solemn, majestic, with a silvery hoariness of age, mingling its grey leaves amid the quaint clusters of chimneys, and dropping its yellow moss thicken upon the leaves, and upon the old broken stone sun-dial at its foot, which it had longs since overshadowed and made useless. On the southern side of the house, a woodbine had overspread the verandah with at natural trellis, and clambered up to the gable peak, until, finding nothing loftier for its, ambitious growth to fasten upon, dropped again in abundant festoons.
               Spreading to the river's edge, was a fine old lawn, whose sunny surface was shadowed richly here and there by clusters of great trees, and diversified by clumps of shrubbery. There was also, in a shaded nook, a pleasant and quaintly-constructed bower-house, with fragrant vines and flowers growing about it while to the right and left extended orchards and gardens, with labyrinthine walks, sunny glades, and sweetly-sheltered spots with opening vistas to the river's side.
               There was no cunning, no subtle art, no lofty effort of architectural genius in the construction of this mansion. It was a very simple affair. The architect who planned it could scarcely have been an enthusiast in his grand art—he could have been infected but little with dreams of beauty; and, in his simple, honest brain, neither Grecian column nor Gothic vault could have held high place. He never had been inspired by the contemplation of those undying creations of the olden world, that live as a perpetual and magnificent eulogy upon the race they commemorate.—There was no eloquence in art for him—stones had never preached a sermon to his soul.
               And yet it was a fine old mansion, too. A certain kind of rugged strength outspoken in it, and there was an amplitude in its dimensions that was at once liberal and comprehensive. Its halls were broad and ample, its stair-case wide, its windows narrow, but richly capped, and its, cornices nices were deep, almost ponderous, projections. There was an air about it, somehow, of fixed and dogged strength, which its huge beards, low doorways, and large extensions served to promote. It was built of a light brown stone, now stained and weather-beaten, and from its age if for no other reason, it possessed a kind of venerable grandeur that was eloquent and imposing.
               And yet, in all its simplicity, on that day in the olden time when it was first completed—in the olden time when Washington was an infant, mewling and puking in his nurses arms when Franklin, with inky face, munched his apprentice meat at the foot of his case—when "milord" went about be-laced, be-ruffled and be-powdered—when "my lady" moved a thing of hoops and high heels, and towering head dresses, and rouge and patches—when the Red man, with treacherous thoughts, hovered on our forest confines—when sanded floors and leather breeches were the husbandman's fare—when dames in honest woolsey shone—when—why, when, our honest-hearted sires assembled on that day to feast, for the first; time, within that mansion-house—how, to their simple knowledge, did it all appear a wonder of greatness and a marvel of beauty!
               But what the old house may have lacked in way of architecture, it was invested with sufficient legendary and historical, interest to lift it quite above the level of ordinary structures. It had passed through the stormy era of our history, and around about it there had often been enacted stirring scenes and heroic deeds. More than once had the tomahawk of the savage gleamed beneath its old trees, and his arrows been launched against its sides. English troops had assembled upon its ample lawn, and English swords clattered upon its floors. Tory firebrands had kindled its eaves and Tory bullets reddened its hearthstone stone. Rebel officers had feasted beneath its roof, and not unfrequently matured their plans for the furtherance of their sublime struggle. But honor above honors—glory the most transcendent—Washington himself had passed through its portal—Washington had banqueted with it's lord—Washington had reposed his sacred limbs within its walls.
               And there were many little traditions current among the surrounding husbandry, of noted deeds performed by the former masters of the old mansion—of heroic achievements in its defence; and there were tales, too, of their great goodness and their bounties; all of which were interspersed and varied by pleasant, romantic episodes of love. These little traditions, garnished and adorned as, no doubt, they were, by a fair share of fiction, gave to the old house much of all the real interest it possessed, and, perhaps, alone elevated it to any rank among the many grander and more pretentious mansions that modern taste and wealth had reared around it.
               From the peculiar selection of the house and its grounds, it had received the name of "The Clove." A narrow valley, bounded by abrupt sides of the Highlands, extended back from the sore, narrowing as it penetrated among the mountains until it became only a narrow cleft or gorge, but widening towards the river into a tolerably broad expanse of beautiful meadow land. A road that approached along the river bank, swept with a curve towards the mansion, and then wandered with an easy dalliance through the narrow valley, until, finding itself surrounded by the high bluffs, made a bold dash up their rough and frowning sides.
               For many years previous to the opening of my story, the "Clove" had been abandoned. For many years its doors and windows had been hermetically sealed. The dust and the wintry leaves had gathered thick upon the door-steps; the spiders had spun great ample webs across the window shutters and doorways, and year by year had silently and unmolested pursued their brigandary pursuits upon all such hapless flies as fell within their reach. The moss had gathered thickly upon the eaves and upon the cornices, while the spring rains had left many a dark stain upon its rusty sides. Weeds had choked, out the growth of the flowers, filled up the once smooth, velvety lawn, and grown rank and huge at the feet of the protecting verandahs.
               But suddenly there was a change. The sunlight was let into rooms dark and damp so long. The cobwebs were brushed away with a ruthless hand, and the brigand spiders consigned to a retributive end. The weeds were rooted out, and once more the flowers began to nourish and to bloom. The melancholy of its half-ruinous state, was soon retrieved, and the sunlight fell upon it again, with the warmth and the glow that it was wont to do.
               The cause of all this change was a sore puzzle to the speculative gossips of the neighborhood. Conclaves were assembled to discuss, and, if possible, to solve the mystery. But in vain. Neither their accumulated wisdom nor their individual sagacity could discover, either, in the first place, the motives that impelled the abandonment, nor the causes that actuated the return.
               This much only could they learn:—Gilbert Waldron, the only male survivor of his ancient family, that for near a century had lived and flourished in the Waldron mansion, upon whose youth a strange cloud had fallen, and who, for years, had been a wanderer in foreign lands—had returned, and was once more to take up his abode at the Clove. And rumor asserted, moreover, that there was to accompany him a youthful ward, a maiden of sixteen summers, the orphan daughter of an ancient friend of Mr. Waldron's who, on his death-bed, had consigned her to his care.
               But if the reader will stand with me beneath one of the groups of trees that are scattered about the lawn, we may abandon the doubtful society of rumor, and be introduced directly to some of the characters who are to figure in this our story. It is near the close of a June day. The shadows are stretching out long spiral figures across the fields, and gathering darkly beneath the river bluffs. Some clouds that lie towards the west are purpling in their centres.—In the woods and the orchards an unusual stillness has fallen, and Nature, seems hushed as if watching, on tip-toe, the dying out of day. Nothing moves but the shadows, and they creep stealthily, longer and longer, thinner and thinner.
               But presently along the road by the river shoe, we may perceive a carriage approaching, rapidly driven. Its progress is so swift, that in a few moments it is drawn up with panting steeds before the porch. A lady and as gentleman dismount, a middle-aged gentleman and a middle-aged lady. The carriage drives off, there is a bustling of welcome among the servants, the quick, opening of doors, the hum, of many voices, the bustling of steps, and then the door is closed and we are alone with the setting sun and the growing shadows.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               GILBERT WALDRON.
               "MY dear sister," exclaimed Mr. Gilbert Waldron, as he handed his companion into the long drawing-room of Clove House, upon the occasion mentioned at the close of the last chapter, "my dear sister, I know that this is a happier hour for you than for me."
               "Why do you say so, Gilbert?"
               "Because, Amelia, that while my heart, as yours, clings to the old place, and loves its every stone and tree, yet, with me, this return is interwoven with so many thoughts, and stirs from their depths so many emotions, that, perhaps, but little real pleasure finds voice among them."
               "Ah, Gilbert, I have prayed for this hour," replied Miss Waldron; "and I trust that it may be the auspicious dawn of happier days to all those who bear the name of Waldron."
               "I hope so, too," said the gentleman, fervently.
               "I sincerely believe so," was the reply. "It seems to me that we can scarcely fall under the influence of this place, and all its manifold memories and associations, without becoming as it were, under the protection of those guardian spirits, who have borne our race heretofore through so many sorrows and so many trials."
               "Ah, I see, Amelia, that the silver in your hair has not banished the old romance from your heart."
               "No Gilbert, I hope it never will. But I anticipate much pleasure, my brother, from the presence of her for whose sake you, have restored the old house."
               "I am sure," broke in Mr. Waldron, with vivacity, "that you will grow to like Miss Dearwood. And if her glorious presence does not invoke the protection of guardian angels, I know not, indeed, what could summon them."
               "You are always eloquent, Gilbert, when speaking, of Blanche, and your picture of her enchants me so much that I long to see her."
               "You will find that it is not colored too highly."
               "I am assured of it. But are you certain, my dear brother, that you are prepared for the task assigned yourself? Is the past so buried that neither aspirations nor regrets can come upon you and cross your purposes? Are there no fragments left of the old struggle, that might darken, perhaps, her sunny youth? Are you wise and firm?"
               "Believe me, Amelia, said he, "that I have resolved wisely and cautiously."
               "Cautiously, I know," said Amelia, "but if wisely the future only can tell. In this world of ours, events so link on events, and causes produce effects so strangely out of harmony with themselves, that none of us can confidently assume to be wise."
               "True, my sister, but in this I feel I have acted right. What I propose is so purely unselfish, and will so employ my judgment and gratify my imagination, that I shall not have time for any morbid sorrowings over the past. In the earnest contemplation of another mind I shall cease to have occasion to look into my own. But do you know, sister, that it is ten years since I last saw this spot? Ten years—how strange!"
               He walked to the window and flung it open wide, until a flood of golden light from the glowing west streamed soft and mellow into the apartments. His dark form, drawn against the light, seemed to Amelia to tremble slightly, as with his hand in his breast, he stood by the casement for some moments, in contemplative silence.
               "I am not thinking," at last said he, "of the place as it was when I last saw it. I am not viewing it as it is. It is the old boyhood time that comes back upon me—the old boyhood scenes that my vision embraces."
               "It is the province of age, Gilbert, to grow retrospective."
               "Let us live by retrospection, then. I throw off from me everything but my youth, and I come back here to have my second childhood."
               "Why, Gilbert," replied Amelia, smilingly lifting up his locks, "your curls are black yet, and notwithstanding all that has been, your cheek carries no more furrows than many younger men. A second childhood for manhood in its prime."
               "Yes, Amelia, because when we fling ourselves into the current of the world, and are borne out into its wide, shoreless sea, we disdainfully fling away our childhood, and fling away our happiness with it. It is only when we bear within us the hearts of children, the birthright bestowed upon us by nature, the pure impulse for good, and the uncontrolled aspirations for the noble, the exalted and the heroes, that we can preserve our hearts pure and capable of happiness. Ah, if I could but float upon yonder river, or clamber up these hills, or watch the sun sink through yonder sky, or look upon beauty anywhere, with the same fresh spirit as of old, then I would know what happiness is again. Let me strive to regain it."
               He sprang out upon the lawn, already deepened, beneath the trees, into half darkness, but through their vistas the open river gleamed brightly, and its rippling waves were yet glittering with reflected light. Towards the shore he bent, his steps, pausing for a moment, when half way down the lawn, to turn and look upon the house, the chimneys and peaks of which were catching the last rays of light.
               Upon reaching the river bank, he sprang down a little rocky abutment that breasted itself against the washing of the waters, and stood upon the pebbly shore where the stream idly curled up to his feet. The sky was yet blue. The evening star was out with its strange beauty. That peculiar stillness of the twilight hour was settled over all. Not a motion nor a sound, save the faint upheaving of the river against its rocky barriers, and the occasional flapping of the sail of a vessel that was slowly gliding towards the shore.
               It would be vain to attempt a description of all the deep, varied, and earnest emotions that came crowding upon Mr. Waldron's breast, as he stood there by the river's side, silent and alone, looking with mental vision down the long backward vista of his life, crossed with its many lights and shades. The strange interval that had passed since last he looked upon, the scene around him, was not so much the matter, of his speculation, as the events of his earlier life—those incidents of his boyhood that were coming up with a strange clearness. But memory, that mental telescope, when it draws near to us the objects of the far-off time, is apt, also, to be of magnifying power. We do not always preserve a perfect perspective in looking backward upon our life's career, and in recalling scenes of remote enactment we too often fall into the error of exalting them above their original proportions. It was so with Mr. Waldron. The view of his old boyhood haunts was recalling with vivid power all the happy hours and incidents of his youthful career, and, as contrasted with all that his manhood had experienced—all the bitterness, and sorrow, and shattered hopes, that had been the only fulfilment of his once gorgeous dream of fame and power—as contrasted with these, they shone out with a brilliance and a glory that were bestowed more, perhaps, by his imagination, than strict historical truth. It is a trite thing we are saying. It has been observed many times before, that manhood, as it waxes older, draws its chiefest pleasure from retrospective pictures of an ideal youth; but a truth of so general a nature as this may, perhaps, with no impropriety, be re-illustrated.
               The busy talk of Rumor, about the guardianship about to be assumed by Mr. Gilbert Waldron, was true, strange as it indeed may appear for this impalpable and mysterious personage to be capable of such a things as truth.
               Mr. Dearwood had died about two years before the opening of this story. At the time off his death, Mr. Waldron was a traveller in continental Europe, and his migrations were of so desultory, informal a character, that a long period elapsed before the missives sent after him succeeded in hunting out his whereabouts. But as soon after they were received as his preparations could be made, he departed for America, several necessary detentions, however, causing his journey to be exceedingly long. As soon as he set foot upon his native land he hastened to the presence of his ward, most anxious to enter at once upon the duties devolved upon him, and desirous, even, of assuming, in addition, the office of tutor. The young lady's friends conceded at once that Mr. Waldron was so eminently a gentleman and a scholar, that her education could scarcely progress under more favorable auspices.
               At this period, Mr. Waldron was a little more than forty years of age—perhaps forty-five—but certainly not more. His figure was rather above the average height, and possessed, unimpaired, all its youthful grace and beauty. His face was a grand one—grand in its air of serene repose—in its high brow, overshadowed by thick and clustering locks—in its earnest eyes—its square outline—and in its general expression of power and character. There was, however, a marked mildness and sweetness about his lips that denoted a geniality and tenderness of character at once admirable and prepossessing. But when burdened with thought, however, his whole face would assume a massive cast, and evince clearly the hidden strength, the passions living, but dormant—in brief, all the rugged, obdurate and determined characteristics of the masculine race—subdued and softened, yet but too liable to be awakened into all their native power. A life of sorrow and vicissitude bad strewn ashes over his quick and vigorous impulses, leavings him with all that impressibility, fineness of imagination and keenness of perception, so usual with those of a highly vivacious and passionate temperament.
               What the sorrow was that brooded so silently and so secretly upon the mind of Mr. Waldron, his sister alone was possessed of, and she, perhaps, not in full, nor altogether. He never obtruded it upon any one. He strove, indeed, to bear about him no sign of aught that might excite in the minds of others any touch of compassion or pity. His sufferings had bred no misanthropy. The cynic was not in his nature—neither gall nor bitterness ever fell from his lips. There was an earnest freshness in all that he said, notwithstanding his slight air of melancholy. He was genial and open, too, and he possessed one faculty to an eminent degree. This was a nice and quick perception of the poetical in the most ordinary relations. It gave a great charm to his conversation, and afforded a deep delight to those of a sympathetic thetic temperament, to see the picturesque coloring he could throw over common-place topics, and how he could exalt, and poetize, if I may so express it, the many simple incidents that make up so large a total of our, daily being.
               From his earliest boyhood, through all his life, Mr. Waldron had been an earnest and dreaming seeker after sympathy—that perfect sympathy which alone, confers absolute happiness. He had panted for it when a youth, and had flung all the wealth and the depth of his great heart where suffering was the only bitter return. But his bleeding heart did not teach him mistrust of his sublime hope still he dreamed of it, but now in another channel. What love had refused, parental devotion light bestow. But even this hope was destroyed. The child upon whom these happy presages were formed, passed away from his embrace.
               Overwhelmed by a combination of misfortunes, he had sought forgetfulness of them in travel and perpetual change of scene, and, while moving from place to place, bearing about with him haunting remembrances, but still and ever dreaming of an existence where communion of tastes, pleasures, pursuits and responsive emotions, could confer a wealth of immeasurable happiness—hugging this old boyhood aspiration fondly to his heart—suddenly a letter, in revealing to him new duties, opens a prospect of new happiness. He resolved at once to assume, the guardianship devolved upon him, and his highly sanguine heart immediately began to draw the happiest auguries from it.
               He was seeking for something to love: he would be to her more than a guardian—he would be her parent and her tutor. He would nourish the young, rich growth of her pure soul—he would guide her thoughts to a perfect consonance with his own, and enrich her intelligence with all the wealth and glowing richness of knowledge that nature, art, and the world, if sought aright, so gloriously confer! And her youth, too—her golden youth—full of its strange aspirations; how happy it would be for him to watch it unfold, and grow into fullness of being. He had found a daughter. The unutterable happiness of that thought! He would make her the being of his mind. Alas, if she were but the offspring of his heart!
               It was with almost feverish impatience that Mr. Waldron now set about preparing for his return; and when, at last, after many vexatious delays, he set foot upon his native land, without an hour's repose he flew to the presence of his ward. If there had been any apprehensions existing in his mind of the possible incapacity of Miss Dearwood for the high place he was determined to assign her in his affections, this interview entirely dissipated them. He found her more than his hopes had even dared to picture. Glowing with youth and health, bewitchingly graceful, a voice toned to an exquisite harmony, a face full of sweetness and gentleness, a smile that broke upon her countenance like a gush of sunlight—all these, with a certain frankness, and openness of manner at once fascinating and alluring, delighted the heart and the imagination of Mr. Waldron.
               Mr. Waldron now set about the restoration of the old Waldron homestead, with a view of resuming his abode there, which, many years before, had suddenly been broken off. He persuaded his sister, Amelia, to undertake the superintendence of his household. Amelia was a lady of many amiable traits, and of a uniform sweetness of disposition, that no vicissitudes could destroy, nor sorrow overcome. She possessed, too, that rare quality of winning friends everywhere. Her delicate perception of the tastes of all those with whom she came in contact, and her gentle, appreciative smile and manner, sooner or latter, would reach the hearts of the coldest of her companions. But, alas! I am compelled to bestow upon her one title which, I fear, in the estimation of some of my readers, will completely outweigh all her manifold virtues. She was an old maid. It was impossible to conceal this truth. It was even impossible to make a compromise with it. She was past hope. The wrinkles upon her brow and the silver in her hair showed how time had inexorably written her doom.
               Mr. Waldron well knew that Amelia peculiarly possessed those qualities he could approve of in a companion to his ward. And nothing could equal the serene delight experienced by that lady on their return to the old family roof. Aware that it was effected by the interesting relation existing between her brother and Miss Dearwood, she opened her heart widely to the stranger, and prepared to grapple her close and warmly in her affections.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               THE ARRIVAL.
               IT was the second day after the arrival at the "Clove" of Mr. and Miss Waldron, and Miss Blanche Dearwood was now hourly expected. Mr. Elwood, the deceased Mr. Dearwood's attorney, under whose charge Blanche had remained since the death of her father, was to conduct her to her guardian, and personally deliver up his charge. They were to leave New York in the morning boat, but, as a long ride was necessary, after leaving the vessel, it would be within an hour or two of twilight before they could arrive.
               At just about five o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Waldron perceived a carriage coming along the river road, and he hastened to inform his sister of their approach. Mr. Waldron, Amelia and all the household were soon assembled upon the porch, and in a few moments the vehicle drew up. Mr. Waldron threw open the carriage door, and as he assisted Blanche to alight, he exclaimed,
               "A welcome, my dear Miss Dearwood, to the old 'Clove,'" and then presenting her to his sister, he continued, "this is my sister Amelia, of whom I spoke to you."
               Amelia, with a gush of tenderness, flung her arms around Blanche, and pressed her lips warmly to her brow.
               Mr. Elwood now alighted, and Mr. Waldron received him with an easy politeness, presenting him, in due form, to Amelia.
               "A lovely spot 'pon my word," exclaimed Mr. Elwood, after all the ceremonies of presentation were through; "a lovely spot. Fine trees. Rich soil. Noble mountains. Beautiful river. Splendid spot." After which explosive compliments he presented his arm to Amelia, and followed by Mr. Waldron and Blanche, they entered the house.
               "Really," resumed Mr. Elwood, as the party entered the hall, speaking, as before, in his energetic, abrupt manner, "Noble house—old. Fine for all that. Spacious—got a history, too. Associations. That's what I like. A plague upon your spruce, new, holiday-looking houses."
               "Mr. Elwood's approbation does it honor," said Amelia, who, if she had a weakness, it was an excess of pride in the old place.
               "Does Miss Dearwood also admire the 'Clove,'" said Mr. Waldron.
               "I think, sir, that it is very beautiful," replied Blanche. Her words were very simple, and the remark quite commonplace, but it was uttered in a manner so sweet and earnestly impressive, that her companion turned to her quite delighted.
               "I hope," said he, "that you will grow to love it as well and as deeply as we do."
               "I hope so, too," was the reply. Even Amelia here could not help turning a look of pleasure upon Blanche, who certainly did possess the faculty of giving a charm to the simplest words. Her voice was so rarely musical, so low, and full and rich, that somehow it fell with delight upon the hearer, even when she was speaking the most ordinary trifles.
               They now entered the grand parlor, a huge oblong room, furnished in the style of twenty years before, when Amelia, taking Blanche's arm in her own, led her off to be divested of her travelling garb, at the same time announcing that dinner was awaiting them, and that they would adjourn to it as soon as Miss Dearwood could prepare her toilet.
               When they were gone, Mr. Elwood turned to Mr. Waldron, and said,—
               "Mr. Waldron, permit me to congratulate you. I surrender into your care the daughter of my deceased friend. A lovely girl, sir. Beautiful too, sir. Everybody admires her, sir."
               "I am really rejoiced to learn that Miss Dearwood is so generally appreciated," replied Mr. Waldron.
               "Oh, sir, not at all strange!—So amiable. So gentle. So light-hearted. But really, sir, I admire your place so much. Shall we enjoy the view from the porch, until summoned to dinner?"
               Both gentlemen arose and sauntered out.
               Mr. Erastus Elwood, Attorney and Counsellor-at-Law, was as singular in his general appearance as was his peculiar style of delivery. He was a very thin man and a very tall one—very thin excepting in one locality. If you began to survey him from the feet, which, if you were only of ordinary, size, you would find to be much the easiest mode, and let your eye wander up, it would pass along, first, a very long and very attenuated pair of spiral legs, then, after encountering a positively large development in the way of a stomach, it would glide along up an exceedingly narrow chest and shoulders, which shoulders were succeeded by a high, blacks, stiff, satin stock, on the top of which was perched a round, red little head. On the top of the head were a few thin sandy locks; the back of the head was very smooth and bald, by the friction of the above-mentioned stock, and the front of the head was in an incessant state of nervous activity, the mouth perpetually twitching, the eyes blinking, and the whole head bobbing and jerking about in such a manner, that the idea would force itself upon the observer, that nature had deprived him of a neck, and art, endeavoring to supply the want, had provided a wire spring of exceeding activity, the office of the stock before described, being to conceal it from observation.
               When they stepped out upon the porch, Mr. Elwood began to bolt out at series of his characteristic remarks; every one of his short sentences propelled out of his little head by a sudden jerk.
               In addition to Mr. Elwood's other peculiarities, it always seemed as if one part of his anatomy had no sympathy or knowledge of other parts, of which his fat stomach and his extremities is a good illustration. But this peculiarity was also manifested in another way. While, for, instance, he would be talking, and his head keeping up an incessant nervous activity, his legs would preserve an awful dignity, and with long imposing strides, carry his body to and fro.
               Just as he was in the midst of jerking out a glowing eulogy on Miss Dearwood, summons came to dinner, and Mr. Waldron led the way to the dining-room.
               Here the ladies were already assembled. Blanche, being divested of her travelling-habit, was dressed in a simple, white muslin that became her exquisitely. Mr. Waldron had never thought her absolutely beautiful before, but now confessed to himself that nature had left her but little to wish for in that particular. "A little more depth of color," thought he, "and she would be perfect."
               The dinner was brief, Mr. Elwood declaring that it was imperative for him to return to New York by the night-boat, and as it was a long drive to the town of P——, he intended to accomplish the greater part of it before nightfall.
               The carriage was already at the door, when they arose from the table. Mr. Elwood shook hands with Blanche with a great deal of feelings, and, after an effort, succeeded in bringing his head over his stock, and down to the level of her brow, which he kissed in a fatherly manner. He then gave Mar. Waldron and Amelia a spasmodic shake of the hand, and as he jerked out his farewells, strode gravely into the carriage. In an instant more he was whirling along on his journey.
               "Are you, too fatigued, Blanche, to take a turn with me on the lawn?" inquired Mr. Waldron, coming up to Blanche and taking her hand, after the carriage had disappeared from view.
               "Not at all, sir. And this is just the hour, too, when a walk is the most delightful. Have patience, sir, a moment, until I get a bonnet."
               "What exquisite naïeté," exclaimed Mr. Waldron looking after her.
               "An openness and frankness of manner peculiarly pleasing," remarked Amelia, in her wise manner.
               In an instant Blanche was back again, and announced her readiness for the walk.
               "May I ask, Blanche," said Mr. Waldron, as they sallied forth together, "if the aspect of your new home pleases you?"
               "I have grown fond of it, almost already. I do not think I ever saw a more beautiful spot."
               She stopped short, and pushed back her bonnet to look upon the western sky, where the sun had just disappeared, and which was growing with a golden richness, more than usually deep and beautiful.
               "Look, sir, look!" exclaimed she in a low, full voice.
               Mr. Waldron, watching with keen eagerness for every manifestation of sensibility, was more delighted at this little outbreak, than he could possibly have been by any outflow of studied eloquence.
               "Beautiful, Blanche, and many and frequent as sunsets are, there is a new glory in every one we behold. Poets, frequently as they have sung of them, have not exhausted them and never will. When we are old Blanche, and look with fading sight upon them, if our hearts be only true, we shall not even then feel their beauty less than now."
               "I am sure I hope so."
               "But Blanche," and he took her hand, "shall we talk of ourselves and our new life? May I be permitted to ask if the change in your mode of life meets entirely with your wishes, and accords with your desires?"
               "Mr. Waldron, I've always held as sacred the wishes of my father."
               "But I trust the fulfillment of your duty is not accompanied by any sacrifice of your inclinations."
               "No, sir," replied she, "I have looked forward to this hour with pleasure. And yet, sir, you cannot think it strange if I confess, at the same time, of many attachments which now are broken."
               "Why, Blanche, I should be sorry to know to the contrary. I'm afraid that my estimate of your character would prove false if it were possible for you to exist among any class of your fellow-beings without forming attachments, more, or less strong. But at the same time, for your sake, I earnestly hope that no very close ones have been sundered."
               "Why, sir," replied Blanche, looking up to him with a manner somewhat gay, "you know that for two years my heart has been too full of the new life that was before me, to have room for much else. Besides, sir, several years before my dear father's death you were a visitor at his house, and the affectionate tenderness you then bestowed upon a little girl was not lost upon her. I remembered you well, and when they told me that this same kind stranger was to be my guardian and my tutor, from that moment I looked forward to this time with joyful anticipations."
               With a confiding and earnest truthfulness she looked up to him as she spoke these words.
               "What you say, Blanche, gives me happiness."
               "But Mr. Waldron——"
               "My dear ward," interrupted he, "let us settle one thing now at the start. Our future lives lie much together, at least for a time, and we will not bar the growth of an entire confidence between us by the use of too many formalities. Let me no longer be Mr. Waldron. Call me Guardian, Friend or Tutor. I will not name to you any other title, because I am assured that if you once feel and perceive all the affection, and the care, and the devotion my heart will yield to you, your own affectionate nature will suggest the use of a name, the duties of which position it is my pride and hope to perform for you."
               "Let me call you Guardian," said Blanche in a low voice, "I have a father, although he is not of earth."
               Mr. Waldron was silent for a moment, and when he spoke again, there was a slight huskiness in his voice, as if the words of Blanche had touched some hidden wound.
               "I thank you, Blanche," said he, "for this frankness. It was presumption in me to think of filling that happy relationship, which every remembrance and thought of your poor dead father makes holy and sacred."
               "Do not call it presumption. It is pain for me to hear you call it so. I am not, Mr. Waldron, skilled in my own heart. Perhaps I do not know well all its desires, and all its capacities. But the knowledge that I do possess of it assures me, that it will entertain towards you a reverence and an affection, which, if not quite filial, will at least be deep and sincere."
               Mr. Waldron, in reply, only shook her hand. After a pause, he spoke again.
               "My dear ward," said he, "to-morrow we commence the pursuits and the studies that are to be our daily occupations. In guiding your mind to those springs of knowledge, which, I trust, will prove a source of happiness to you, I wish always to consult your own judgment in them, and to be governed much by your own tastes, your inclinations, and your sympathies. I want, Blanche, that our connection should not exactly be that of tutor and pupil, but of fellow-students."
               "You are very kind to say so," interposed Blanche.
               "No, because only by that means can I accomplish all that I wish to do. Nature, to be appreciated, should be studied in sympathetic association with a mind similarly imbued with the same tastes and purposes. Literature and art are exalted, and invested with great additional attractions, in the same manner. Our enjoyments are enhanced, when reflected back to us from other minds, and it is often only by the electrical sympathy of pleasure, that we come to understand a thing fully and thoroughly."
               "I think I understand you, sir," said Blanche.
               "We, therefore," resumed Mr. Waldron, "will pursue our studies together. Your fine taste, quick observation, and nice discrimination, will often show; me where the truest beauty lies; and perhaps my wider experience and deeper knowledge may often guide your judgment to its conclusions.
               "But, really, it grows dark rapidly, and the dew is falling fast. Amelia will wonder at our absence. Let us return."
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               BLANCHE AND HER GUARDIAN.
               THE morning after the arrival of Blanche at the Clove, as Mr. Waldron threw wide open his window to catch the full freshness of the morning air, the first object that arrested his attention was his ward surrounded by a retinue of the farm fowls, doves and dogs, some of whom she was caressing, while she fed the others with grain from at little basket by her side.
               Mr. Waldron paused to observe her, for it was a new aspect in which to study her character. She was dressed in a gown of simple material, of at delicate lilac, well fitted, and falling in graceful folds from her person. She wore upon her head a wide-rimmed gipsey hat, under which her locks of golden brown floated out in unrestrained and rich profusion. The delicate and somewhat pale features of Blanche derived a charming piquancy from this dress, while her face gained materially in beauty and depth of expression from the rich shadow into which it was cast.
               But the highest charm always with Blanche was her grace of motion. Her form was just in that state of budding development which is so peculiarly fascinating, girlish yet, but with the first touch of ripening womanhood. Every movement of her body was perfect grace, and its wavy undulations seemed fairly radiant within beauty. As Mr. Waldron stood and looked upon her on this occasion, her locks flying 
                     carelestly
                     carelessly
                   back, her cheeks in a glow, a low melodious laugh upon her lips, leaping to and fro with a grace and ease so light one would think her weight would not crush a flower—he felt a thrill of admiration fill his breast.
               He watched her for some time, caressing the birds, leaping and laughing with the dogs, until at last he called out to her:—
               "What, Blanche, in the air so early?"
               "Oh, sir, I love the morning," replied she, pausing in her sport, and looking up to him.
               "And doves and dogs as well."
               "I do, indeed," said Blanche, laughing gaily, "The Clove has a noble company of them—hens, ducks, geese and all."
               "They seem to think they've found a noble mistress. What instinct could have taught them so quickly that you were their friend?"
               "A very simple one," replied Blanche, holding up her basket of grain. "I bribed them, sir."
               "By kindness," returned Mr. Waldron; "it is a species of bribery well calculated, to corrupt the purest of hearts."
               "It certainly is the only kind of bribery that can win for you the affections of these creatures."
               "An excellent bit of philosophy. But keep them company for a moment, if you will, and I'll join you."
               Completing his toilet, Mr. Waldron descended to where Blanche and her numerous protégés were assembled.
               "A good morning, dear ward," were Mr. Waldron's words as he approached her and took her hand.
               "Good morning, dear guardian," replied Blanche, in her own simple, earnest way.
               "Come, dismiss your followers, and let us walk in the grounds until breakfast; unless, indeed, the grass is too wet with dew."
               "Not at all, sir. I am well protected."
               "I have been thinking, Blanche," said Mr. Waldron, as they walked off together, "that we ought to indulge ourselves, for a day or two, before commencing systematically our studies, by a visit to all the choice spots of the old place. We should explore the river banks, seek out the finest prospects from these highland peaks, and make ourselves thoroughly familiar with the hidden nooks and the most picturesque retreats of the "Clove." Besides, we ought to know all the traditions, the legendary and historical associations, that belong to each particular spot."
               "What a delightful task you are setting us," said Blanche with enthusiasm: "be sure, sir, I shall treasure up all the traditions with most religious care."
               "You, are fond, then, of these historical fragments?"
               "Who are not. The most common-place localities have a deep interest if there is about them any touch or memory of the past, any association with events of either poetical or historical interest. How much more, then, must be our delight in the contemplation of scenes in themselves grand or beautiful, when hallowed by deeds of heroism or greatness?"
               "Well spoken, my little ward, said Mr. Waldron, in a manner quite delighted: "we must have Captain Dartan to accompany us on some of our exploring expeditions."
               "Captain Dartan?"
               "Yes, an old soldier of the Revolution, who resides on the river shore a couple of miles above us, but his residence is concealed by yonder projecting bluff which you see. His house has always been in that one locality. He served under my grandfather in the war of the Revolution, and although he entered the army in the ranks, he was soon, for signal services, promoted to a Captainship. He is quite a character. His mind is stored with all kinds of Revolutionary lore, and his greatest happiness is to find an appreciative listener to his stories of 
                     
                        Moving accidents by flood and field;
                        Of hair-breadth 'scapes.'
                     
                   He knows, too, the history of every stone and tree about the Clove, and he will relate to you, with most circumstantial fullness, the many. scenes through which the Old House passed during that eventful period."
               "I am interested in your description of him. Shall we see him soon?"
               "Yes; we will drive to his residence to-day, or tomorrow. I have not seen him since my return; but have learned that he is living still, though grown quite feeble. He must nearly have reached fourscore."
               "So old! I think he must be a rare companion for a long winter evening."
               "Oh, he would talk to you night and day, if you would only listen. But, come, let us walk towards the river. I have proposed to myself several improvements about the grounds here, Blanche, on which I want your opinion. This garden is fallen into sad neglect. It was laid out by my grandfather, Colonel Waldron, of Revolutionary fame. Simple as it is, it was considered a very grand affair in those times. I cannot accord it the praise of being a happy conception. The cunning turnings of the labyrinthine walks repeat themselves so much that they grow to be monotonous. There are but few pleasing changes or surprises, and no succession of those varying aspects, which alone make this kind of gardens agreeable."
               "These walks," remarked Blanche, "bewilder one completely pletely. If I were their daily frequenter, I should wish myself an Ariadne."
               "And yet, when you once comprehend them, they will appear to you simple enough. But we must devise some plan to improve them. What do you say, for one thing, to a grand fountain?"
               "A beautiful addition."
               "There are some fine springs in the mountain behind us, and so it would be by no means difficult to introduce several fountains about the grounds. What do you say? Is it decided?"
               "Does it depend, sir, on my judgment?"
               "Entirely."
               "I should be glad if we could have them."
               "Then we shall have them; and you must draw the designs."
               "Oh, but my dear guardian," exclaimed Blanche, with consternation, "I have not the skill nor the taste!"
               "I have every confidence in your ability, my dear ward. I have seen some of your drawings, and I know them to evince fine artistic knowledge, and pure classical taste."
               "But, sir, I never have drawn designs; and, even admitting the truth of your favorable criticism on my poor efforts, I know nothing about the branch of the art to which you refer."
               "But," pertinaciously continued Mr. Waldron, "you have taste, execution, a knowledge of general principles, and, I am sure, a true appreciation of beauty. So, ward of mine, here I impose my first command upon you; and if ever the music of gushing fountains is to fill the air of the Clove, the genius of Miss Blanche Dearwood shall alone invoke their murmurings."
               "Just now," replied Blanche, with a laughing humor in her eye, "It was my judgment that pronounced if they should exist. I now revoke my decision."
               "No," said Mr. Waldron, with a laugh; "your decision is irrevocable. Come, Blanche, consent; and if your genius creates for us but things of grace, think what a pride they will be to us all."
               "When you commanded me, sir, I had no choice but to obey."
               "Well, that is settled; and we must have the fountains. One, I think, in the lawn, and one, or more, in the garden. We must select their situations. What say you to this spot for one? It opens to the river, and, fortunately for us, has been so neglected as to be quite overgrown with brush and grass. We might make it picturesque and wild. The fountain should stand here, beneath this cluster of trees, and the water might escape down this gully, formed by the rain-torrents from the mountain. They could be diverted into another channel, and this, with grass growing along its edges, would make a pretty rivulet. And look, Blanche, we might direct it so as to throw the water down yonder descent of rocks in quite a fine cascade. But you are silent."
               "Pardon me, sir; but I was trying to think how a figure of Undine might serve me as a design."
               "Leaping from the waters, that bound and spring up around her, eh? Poetical, certainly, and I think practicable. But you have not told me your opinion of this situation."
               "Admirable. And it will be so shut out, that no one will guess of such a thing, until they come suddenly upon it. I do like surprises."
               "One's pleasure is certainly enhanced by being unexpectedly excited. We might, indeed, arrange many surprises in the garden here. These turning paths, that open so continuously upon prospects in nowise changed from what they closed upon, could be turned into good account that way. Come, Blanche, you will have no lack of occupation for your ingenuity and taste."
               "I shall rebel, sir, if all the labor is to be devolved upon me."
               "But I am sure that you have resources equal to everything demanded of you. I most particularly desire to see what a thing of beauty you can make our grounds here."
               "But, my dear Mr. Waldron, I have had no experience in landscape-gardening—nor, indeed, in any kind of gardening. A few house-plants have been the only things I've ever given any attention to."
               "I have discovered already that you have a true perception of the beautiful, Blanche; and no experience could avail you so much as that. But, I declare, how late it is! The breakfast-hour is already passed. And Amelia, too, is the most punctual of beings. Let us return."
               They retraced their steps to the house, and found Amelia waiting for them in the doorway.
               "Ah, truants!" exclaimed she; "the toast is already cold."
               They all entered the house together, Amelia affectionately guiding Blanche, with her arm encircling her waist. The meal passed off happily, the conversation principally turning upon their future occupations and pursuits. Mr. Waldron, genial, philosophical, and abounding in happy illustrations; Amelia, gravely gentle and carefully considerate; Blanche, light, sparkling, and overflowing with a quiet humor, dashed a little by a few touches of sentiment.
               "By-the-by," suddenly broke in Mr. Waldron, upon a long dissertation he was giving upon the necessity of an education mutually mental and physical,—"By-the-by, Blanche, I have bought you a pony."
               "A pony," said Blanche, laughing a merry laugh.
               "Yes, a pony; shaggy, short, ugly, but sure-footed. Just the creature, my dear girl, to carry you up our steep mountain-paths. An admirable companion for your mountain rambles, and, uncouth as he is, I have not doubt but that you will come to love him."
               "Oh, sir, you touch me with your kindness," exclaimed Blanche, with tears in her eyes. "Your consideration, your perpetual thought for my happiness, your study of my tastes; how shall I express my gratitude for such friends?"
               At the close of the meal, Blanche arose, and went out, leaving the brother and sister alone.
               "Well, Amelia," said Mr. Waldron, after a pause, "what do you think of Blanche?"
               "I love her, brother, with all my heart," replied Miss Waldron, fervently.
               "Was there ever a form of so much grace, or a face that beamed with so much beauty and goodness?" said Mr. Waldron.
               "Or a voice so musically soft and sweet?" said Miss Waldron. "I always listen to her, when speaking, with real delight. I do not think I ever heard a human voice that so fell upon the heart, and stirred up its emotions, as that of Blanche's does. Her simplest words have about them an inexpressible sweetness. The ordinary courtesies that usually fall upon the ear so monotonously, with her posses a peculiar charm. I thought to-day that her simple 'Good morning,' was the language of poetry. I certainly never fully felt before all the grace and the beauty of this morning salutation."
               "I am rejoiced, sister, to think that you appreciate her so well."
               "Ah, my brother," said Amelia, "if ever the strange cloud that has fallen upon our house, and blighted it, shall be lifted, to what other means could we attribute it than to her radiant presence about the old place?"
               "To what other indeed?" musingly repeated Mr. Waldron.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER V.
               THE CLOVE.
               "AND now," said Mr. Waldron to Blanche, as he joined her just after the conversation recorded at the close of the last chapter, "and now I propose that we shall begin our ramble over Clove Place. We must make ourselves thoroughly familiar with the features of a friend with whom, hereafter, we are to live so closely in companionship. I hope that you are a good walker, because there are some long and rather rough paths to scramble over. We must manage, somehow, to clamber up Clove Peak behind us here, and see what kind of a prospect we shall gain from the top. On the river bank above us there are some exceedingly wild and picturesque spots that we must visit, but they are accessible only to a light foot, and to those not easily fatigued.
               "Oh, sir," replied Blanche, "I am quite strong, and used to much walking."
               "That is good. And I hope, my dear ward, that your mountain rambles will be many and frequent. They will invigorate your constitution and strengthen your frame. But we will not waste our time with talk. Let us start at once. The exertion, unfortunately, Amelia is unable to undertake."
               Blanche now hastened to prepare for the long walk proposed, and in a short time joined her guardian, when they sallied out upon their expeditionary ramble.
               The Clove abounded in many spots of rare beauty, while the heights of Clove Peak afforded many grand and most inspiring prospects. To the Peak, therefore, the two ramblers first proceeded, and the rapture of Blanche at the perfect beauty of some of the scenes that would often break suddenly upon her vision, was genuine and deep. She was fortunate, too, in the companionship of one possessing the deepest appreciation of nature, and whose fine artistic eye would always detect the happiest combinations of form or color. The rare beauty of some of the isolated parts of scenes pointed out by Mr. Waldron, induced Blanche to attempt transferring them to paper. Fortunately she had brought her portfolio with her, and their walk, therefore, received many interruptions in the time occupied by Blanche in her sketches. But they abandoned themselves, without thought, to the pleasure of the hour, and so, whenever anything strongly struck the fancy of Blanche, she would fling herself upon the ground and rapidly commence her work of sketching. Mr. Waldron, meanwhile, would stand by, sometimes improving, but oftener applauding.
               There was one spot to which they gained access, that so entranced Blanche by the sublimity of the scene rolled out beneath it, and by its own peculiar picturesqueness, that she determined that it should, from that time, be her favorite resort. It was a little level plateau high up the side of the Peak, and so projecting out that it commanded a view of the entire breadth of the little valley, with the silver river winding along above and below, with mountains hazy and blue, stretching miles away, with undulating meadow lands rolling down to the opposite shore, and with Clove House, the grand old trees, and the yellow willow, the lawn, and the gardens, and the orchards, apparently directly underneath it.
               
               The plateau was almost as smooth and level as Clove lawn itself, while it was fairly bowered by some fine old ashes and pines, whose limbs were bound and interlaced together by several wild vines that clambered among them. A few cedar bushes, wild and thrifty, and several blooming mountain flowers served to enhance its beauty. It was a retreat so agreeably secluded, and yet opening upon so grand and noble a prospect, that both Mr. Waldron and his companion admitted it to be everything desirable.
               Thus happily engaged, eagerly aiding each other to detect the ever-changing beauties as they presented themselves, hour after hour passed on, and the sun was past the meridian before they descended to the river shore, which, to explore, was one part of their programme for the day.
               "The devious windings of our river," said Mr. Waldron, "with its many inlets, that sometimes are beautifully picturesque, can be better appreciated on the water."
               "If we only had a boat," broke in Blanche.
               "You will not feel the wish long," replied her guardian, for within three days at farthest, one will be at our command. When a boy, Blanche, it was my sweetest pleasure to sail upon these grand old waters. There was not a rivulet nor an inlet, not a bay nor indent, not an inch of the shore any way for ten miles above or below this spot, that I did not visit in my canoe. Can you think, Blanche, that I have forgotten those dearly-prized hours? No! They were the happiest I ever knew."
               Mr. Waldron now proposed, as their lengthened ramble had been exceedingly fatiguing, that they should postpone their project of the river walk until another day. Blanche acceded, and so they returned towards the house, arriving only in time for dinner.
               While at dinner, and discussing the proposal of an afternoon noon visit to Captain Dartan, a carriage was heard to drive up, and a voice strange to Blanche broke upon her ear.
               "Why, there is the old Captain himself," exclaimed Mr. Waldron, jumping up with alacrity. In an instant more the door was flung open, and Mr. Waldron had the old soldier by each hand.
               "God bless you, Colonel Waldron, God bless you!" was the fervent exclamation of Captain Dartan, as he received the warm welcome of his host.
               "Of all the men in the world my dear Dartan," said Mr. Waldron, "I know of none whom I could be so rejoiced to see as you. But come, you remember my sister Amelia."
               "Well, well; but it is nearly a score of years since I have seen her."
               "There are no recollections that I treasure more dearly than some of the hours I have passed with Captain Dartan," replied Amelia, shaking him by the hand with an unusual warmth.
               "This," said Mr. Waldron, "is Miss Blanche Dearwood, the grand-daughter of General Dearwood, whom I'm sure you must have met.
               "Often, often," replied the old man, shading his eyes with his hand to look at her; "Ah, I remember, I remember. He was a noble gentleman." Then taking her hands he smoothed them in his own: "I am glad to know you, young lady. You quite remind me of your grandfather Dearwood—for all the world you're just like him. I'd know you anywhere as a Dearwood, I would indeed, young lady."
               "Blanche is no doubt puzzled, Captain," said Mr. Waldron, "to understand how you can detect a resemblance between her girl-like features and the brown, bearded, massive ones of the old General."
               "I've seen him many a time with the same smile on his lip as the one that now be on hers, Colonel Waldron, and old as I be, I don't forget, I don't forget. Don't you remember—no, no, you don't—that's true enough, but the old Colonel would if he were here—but I can remember—it were just before Gates—or when Mad Wayne were going to storm Stony Point—no, it were when Washington was at Newburg, that I saw General Dearwood and the old Colonel standing in this very room. Ah, that were a sad day, indeed. The Tories had made an attack upon the old house, and a devil's bullet had struck down in this very room the Colonel's young niece—not older than you, Blanche, and she was as beautiful, too. I remember, I remember."
               The old soldier shaded his eyes, and tottered to a seat. The little incident that he had related cast a temporary gloom over the party, and some moments ensued before any one spoke. Mr. Waldron then drew a chair near his guest, and entered into conversation with him. Meanwhile Amelia and Blanche seated themselves nearly opposite—Amelia to occupy herself with some left-off sewing, and Blanche to observe more clearly the appearance of the old soldier, in whom both brother and sister appeared to have so affectionate an interest.
               Captain Dartan had been in his prime a man of uncommon vigor and powers, and with a large physical development. Although at this period somewhat bent with age, and with his once upright, military bearing almost entirely gone, he still appeared to be a man of more than ordinary size. But "his hose was now a world too wide for his shrunk shank," and his coat hung loosely over his bent shoulders. He still preserved, however, his youthful expression of genial heartiness, and his voice had lost but little of its old stentorian capacity. A few white locks, erect and stiff, as if awaiting marching orders, bristled on his knobbed head, and a single tooth or two still adhered to their ancient allegiance.
               Captain Ralph Dartan, at the very outset of our Revolutionary contest, had flung his big fist, and his bigger heart into the Continental service. Some acts of signal daring soon won for him a commission, which was the only reward he ever received from his grateful country for seven years of exertion, danger and devotion.
               Among his fellow-soldiers he was ever a great favorite. "Honest Ralph," "Ox-hearted Ralph," "Glorious Ralph," had been the pet terms bestowed upon him by his compatriots, and they had never been allowed to pass into oblivion. He was still the honest, big-hearted, noble Ralph that he was in Revolutionary times—and at eighty years of age was distinguished for his genial, open-hearted and generous nature.
               He was remarkable, too, for a child-like simplicity, oddly at variance sometimes with the air of military sternness he would endeavor to assume. This simplicity would often manifest itself in an amusing manner, and the pertinacity with which he would adhere to beliefs founded upon the most remote causes, amounted to an eccentricity.
               Mr. Waldron's conversation with Captain Dartan turned mostly upon the history of the Clove neighbors during the long period the Waldrons had been absentees. Captain Dartan, who knew every family within twenty miles, and who made it a religious duty to visit every one within a circumference of five miles, at least, once a year, was well versed in all the family matters of the whole county, and, therefore, could relate to Mr. Waldron all the most extraordinary and note-worthy events that had occurred during a period of ten years. To these circumstantial histories Mr. Waldron listened patiently, until the old soldier, suddenly remembering that his theme was, perhaps, wearying some of his listeners, turned to the ladies, and, as if a matter of gallantry and duty, essayed to entertain them with what he supposed would be more congenial subjects.
               An hour or two of desultory conversation then ensued, in which Blanche appeared in so agreeable and amiable a light, that the old soldier grew quite delighted with her. A delight, too, that Blanche enhanced by skilfully drawing the conversation to Revolutionary subjects, and by evincing so much interest in his exploits as to draw from him several stories of them.
               When, at last, he got up to go, he said to her:
               "My young lady, you and the old soldier must be friends. Do you accede?"
               "With all my heart," said Blanche."
               "Then I shall look for you at my little snuggery. Ah, how glad the old General would be now, if he could see you—so worthy of the name of Dearwood. A noble name, lass, a noble name!"
               With a formal bow he retired through the door. They all accompanied him to the porch, where a little, low and very old chaise, with a little, low, very old and shaggy mare before it, was drawn up. Into the chaise he clambered, with the aid of Mr. Waldron, taking occasion to whisper in his ear an emphatic word of praise of Blanche, so loudly that everybody could hear.
               With a parting salutation, he urged up his mare, and drove off on a slow trot, alone, as was always his custom.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               LOVE, AND A VISITOR
               THUS genially and serenely passed the days at the Clove. With fairy step, bounding up the hills and along the mountain-sides—drinking in daily Nature's fairest and loveliest scenes—studying upon the lofty mountain-tops the inspired language of the poet, until his passionate utterings would thrill with ecstatic fire through her imagination—breathing forth upon the river's stilled surface the melodious outpourings of her bosom—transferring with skilful fingers the glorious vista to the sunny page—catching rare insights into Nature's wonders and mysteries—looking up to her glories in the heavens and down to her loveliness upon earth—thrilled and enraptured with her daily beauties, the mind of Blanche expanded and deepened, vibrating to every touch of beauty, glowing with the fullness and the richness of many thoughts, and overflowing with those sensibilities, aspirations, and emotions, that elevate the human soul to the exalted place destined for it by its Creator.
               Daily could her fairy-like form be seen gliding through the vistas of the forest-trees with "tresses full blown," and a step so airily graceful, that it would seem to those who would catch brief glimpses of her, as if a ray of sunlight was glancing through the glades, or as if some sprite or fay had appeared to make true, fable and poetry of old.
               
               And it was a pleasant sight too, thoroughly practical and prosy however, to see her mounted upon her little Shetland pony, climbing up the steep mountain-paths, or scampering nimbly along their sides, wherever a fair footing could be found. Her costume in these rides, was of a pastoral simplicity. A capacious bonnet, extending far over the head, but opening wide to admit the air freely; a simple, white dress, girdled merely at the waist, and sufficiently short to admit of easy walking, whenever inclination prompted the abandonment of the pony; close-fitting, high-ankled, high-heeled boots; and long linen gloves, that extended to the elbow.
               These pony-rides were Blanche's delight, although her equestrian exercises were by no means confined to them. A pair of fine saddle-horses were in the stable, and, Mr. Waldron and herself often rode out together. Amelia never rode. But the peculiar delight of the pony-rides was their perfect freedom. Abandoning altogether the public roads, she would guide her pony wherever he could gain a footing, penetrating into the tangled thickets of the forests, or along the winding and devious banks of some rivulet; climbing up often the roughest ascents, and picking a way amid huge rocks and closely-wedged trees. She soon got to be so excellent a horsewoman that she would spend hours on his back; of all her pastimes, a wild ride upon Hero—so she called him—was the happiest.
               But while Blanche was thus happy in her new home, a slow change was coming over Mr. Waldron. The old melancholy, that at first had been so diffused by the radiant gladness of Blanche's presence, began to deepen once again, and to weigh heavily in his bosom. It was not a morbid nor a gloomy melancholy, but a softened, saddened feeling, that tempered all his acts, and all his words. Nor did it possess him always, but would come upon him unaccountably at times, and often he, felt as if it were at presentiment foreshadowing darkly. In the presence of Blanche, however, it scarcely existed at all. The soft, sweet gladness, that always outspoke from her overflowing heart, would dispel his sadness as if by magic, and in her society his mind would expand with a healthful glow, and unfold its rich store of learning and fancy lavishly. Sometimes, indeed, Blanche would almost be startled at the brilliant outflashings of his conversation, at his passionate bursts of eloquent thought, while there ran continually through what he said a happiness of illustration, and a genial, glowing spirit of manner, highly fascinating.
               These outbursts of kindled thought even puzzled himself. "But are they not," he would say, "the rich verdure upon the grave—the bright greenness that flourishes upon decay?"
               Mr. Waldron had always been a seeker after an ideal, or a perfect sympathy. It has been before described with what eager hopefulness he had undertaken the guardianship and the tutorship of his ward, with the belief that he could develope and cultivate that unison of being for which he had panted from boyhood. Had he found it? Was, his fond theory realised? These were the questions he asked himself.
               "Yes," sometimes sprang to his lips.
               "No," as often fell upon his heart.
               If it were so, why this melancholy? If it were not, why this thrill of feeling which her presence always produced? And if the sympathy were not perfect between them, wherein was the deficiency? Were not their tastes, their pursuits, their pleasures co-equal? Were not their emotions responsive? Did they not look out upon the world from the same point? Did not the same beauty awaken mutual admiration, the same thought arouse similar feelings? How often would Blanche hang with "bated breath" upon his words, as together they would stand, looking up at the wondrous beauties of the stars? How often, with rapt and eager attention, would she listen to his glowing descriptions of scenes and places, or to his thrilling tale of adventure and danger, as together they would float upon the water, within the shadows of the overhanging shore? And how, too, out of the fullness of her loving heart, had she grown to cling to him and love him as a father, flinging her arms even around him, and nestling her head in his bosom, and kneeling with a kind of devotion to him, and sometimes, in playful love, bestowing that title upon him which once he had hopefully hinted his wish for her to use? Was not this sympathy of the purest and the most perfect kind? Or, if it were not, where could be found a supply for so deep a yearning as that of his?
               Alas! it was all only too perfect. The ecstatic thrills which these scenes gave him were only followed by an aching void. The sunlight which she cast upon his path was bounded by a dark and hopeless vista. Beyond! beyond! How could he help seeing that the happiness of her society would only be a brief gleam along his weary road, and that but too soon some other would appear and usurp all her radiance for himself.
               But what a strange control she had over him! Every smile that lit up her features, every intonation of a voice so rarely musical, every movement of a form transcendantly graceful, sank into the very deepest recesses of his heart, and stirred in his bosom emotions of such exquisite pleasure, that he would fairly fly from her, for fear of their uncontrollable utterance.
               And these feelings strengthened and deepened in his heart almost unawares to himself. He thought, or at least taught himself to believe, that it was all a parental affection. But as these aching voids that possessed him during her absence, and these thrilling emotions that he experienced when she was by his side, grew stronger, another thought began to intrude itself upon his mind, and to assume a definite and positive form.
               "No, no!" exclaimed he, aloud, springing up, and beginning to pace the floor, when, for the first time, the desire in his heart became clear to his own senses; "No, no! I would not for worlds link her all-glorious youth to my old and withered heart."
               But the wish war in his heart, the thought was in his brain. Henceforth that wish and that thought were never to forsake him. Day and night they would haunt him, coming to him in dreams, selling up strongly in his brain during his lonely walks, and when she was by, overwhelming him with their depth, and, alas! their hopelessness.
               Worn, struggling, unhappy heart! With ancient wounds, soared but not healed, still existing in its scarred depths; with the ashes of old dead hopes still weighing upon it heavily—how sad was the new blight that was to fall upon it!
               And did Amelia perceive the struggle that was going on in her brother's breast? Your historian does not know. And yet who can doubt it? How could it escape her watchful tenderness, her anxious solicitude, her penetrating knowledge of her brothers heart? But if it were so, she made no sign. A little more gentle, perhaps; rather grave at times; a closer watchful interest in Blanche; sometimes even a chance-escaping sigh; these were the only signs by which one might detect in her a suspicion of Gilbert's secret.
               
               For Mr. Waldron himself, he closed his lips with an iron will. He forced down the passion into the very depths of his heart, and there held it, gnawing and eating, but making no sound. He would not be so false to his trust, as to attempt to gain her young affections. He would not be so false to her, as to take advantage of her inexperience, of her ignorance of the world, and of her own heart, and breathe of love to her. He felt that it might be easy to lead her into the belief, that the filial affection she experienced for him was in fact a stronger and a subtler passion. He knew his own powers of fascination; he knew the control his eloquence could have over her imagination; he knew well, that in her great ignorance and perfect innocence, she could easily teach herself to believe, that the perfect happiness which his society at present conferred, was all that her youth, or her affections could ever desire.
               But why could she not come to love him? He was not so old. There was about him a genial freshness and a keen impressibility which, even in many younger men could not be found. There could not be any radical or insuperable bar between their beings, or else that unison of tastes and pleasures so almost perfect, could not have existence. Why, indeed, then, might not their unity of sympathies become developed into love? Sometimes Mr. Waldron would reason thus plausibly, and by his ingenious logic stimulate a hope in his breast. These hallucinations, however, would be brief. He had made one fatal mistake before, let him guard against another which would not only swamp his own heart, but plunge into utter ruin all the wealth of hopes and affections that lived in Blanche's bosom. And suppose he were to yield to his passion, and link her young heart to his—suppose he were to bury every knowledge of a past, which, to remember, was to call up obstacles that no honorable mind could set aside—suppose that he were to shut his vision and refuse to look upon the future—how long could he depend upon their happiness continuing? At what moment might not the lightning flash of passion blaze into her soul, and reveal at once and completely the artificiality of their love? And, oh, then the agony, the suffering, the wreck that would follow! Better, many times better, that he should bear for ever, and silently, a new sorrow, than risk the destruction of her golden promises of happiness. But, while all these thoughts and struggles were silently going on in Mr. Waldron's heart, Blanche, unsuspecting and innocent, serenely happy in her books, her studies, her pleasures, lit up with her smiles and her beauty every scene in which she moved and shed around her an indescribable radiance.
               Some two months had passed away in this manner, when the little family group were quite surprised one day by the sudden arrival of Mr. Erastus Elwood, from New York. He stalked into their presence with huge strides, and saluted them in a more than usually explosive manner, while his little head bobbed about on the top of the black satin stock, as if a new spring of unusual vibrative power had taken the place of the old one.
               He had business, he said, important private business to communicate to Mr. Waldron. Very urgent business. Business of a very strange character. Very extraordinary business. Would Mr. Waldron grant him an interview? Immediately?
               Mr. Waldron arose, and proposed that they should adjourn to his study.
               "The ladies," said Mr. Elwood, "will excuse us, I am sure. We will not be long. Miss Blanche. I am delighted. Your health is improved. Decidedly. Much more color. But pardon me. My friend waits. Adieu for an hour. Not longer."
               The interview between Mr. Elwood and Mr. Waldron was a somewhat protracted one, and when they appeared at its close, both ladies were alarmed at the exceeding paleness that had overspread Mr. Waldron's face.
               Blanche, startled, with her usual impulsive manner, sprang to his side, and begged to know if he were sick.
               Amelia, even much more alarmed than Blanche, and with a sudden apprehension that Mr. Elwood's visit was connected with those mysterious and sad events of her brother's past history, with difficulty exercised sufficient command over her feelings.
               "Amelia and Blanche," said Mr. Waldron, "I have news by Mr. Elwood, which requires my immediate presence in New York. We shall start together, this afternoon, so that we may take the night-boat, and reach there early to-morrow morning."
               "I hope your news, Mr. Elwood," said Amelia, forcing herself to be composed, "is not of an alarming nature. My brother really looks as if he had learned something unfortunate."
               "Nothing alarming, ma'am," said Mr. Elwood; "nothing unfortunate. I do assure you. On the contrary. Something hopeful. But it has affected my friend's nerves. Rather excited him. That's all."
               The preparations for Mr. Waldron's journey were hastily completed. In less than an hour he appeared ready equipped; and, after an earnest parting with his sister and his ward, sprang into the carriage, and took his seat by the side of Mr. Elwood.
               "But, dear sir," said Blanche, "when shall we expect you to return?"
               "In a week, I hope," said Mr. Waldron.
               "But it may be a month," said Mr. Elwood.
               "So very long?" exclaimed Blanche, with regret.
               "Let your return, Gilbert, be as soon as possible," said Amelia.
               They all now shook hands once more, and the next moment the two gentlemen were whirled along their way, leaving the two ladies, standing, looking after them, with a dull, sad sense of loneliness and loss weighing upon their hearts.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VII.
               AN UNEXPECTED RENCONTRE.
               THE absence of Mr. Waldron now induced Blanche to take even longer rides and rambles among the highland passes, and as she was deprived of excursions upon the water, she spent the greater part of her time in her favorite mountain resorts, carrying thither her books, her music, and her drawings.
               There was one spot, half way up the ascent of Clove Peak, described already in the account of her first day's excursion around Clove Place, which had always been to her a much-treasured resort; and here she now passed many hours of every day, happy in its seclusion and its solitude. But it was not a solitude to her, as the word is generally understood. Nature was full of eloquence to her sensitive ear, and rang out grand and solemn tones.
               Upon one occasion, about a week after the departure of Mr. Waldron, she was reclining upon the smooth and grassy ground, looking out upon the rare picture—that, look upon as often as she would, each time would appear in some new light—and watching the shadows from the clouds, as they came trooping over hill and plain, like the march of an army, when suddenly a step broke upon her ear—there was a crackling of bushes, a spring, and, before she could gain her feet, she found herself in the presence of a youthful stranger, who stood before her, surprised and astounded quite as much as she was herself.
               Fairly taken aback, and unable to take his eyes from the beautiful object that so suddenly came across his vision, struck dumb, indeed, with surprised admiration, it was a moment or two before the stranger could so far recover himself as to apologize to the blushing and embarrassed Blanche.
               "I trust, young lady, that you will pardon me," said he, at last; "but I did not know that I was intruding into a lady's bower."
               "You do not need to apologize," replied Blanche, "for these are public, not private, grounds, and I am only an usurper."
               The young stranger had turned to withdraw, when the reply of Blanche arrested him. I have already spoken, more than once, of the richness and sweetness of Blanche's voice. It struck upon the ear of the stranger with the same charm that it did upon others, and he could not resist the desire to hear its intonations again, and to look once more upon the rare loveliness whence it came.
               "I am an entire stranger in this section," he said, "and was rambling among these highlands for the sake merely of the many beautiful prospects they afford. I had observed this projecting point from some distance, and, little dreaming of all the beauties it would enable me to contemplate, I set out to reach it, anticipating that it would give an extensive view of the river, above and below."
               "I am familiar, sir," said Blanche, in her usual frank, simple, and unconstrained manner, "with most of the highland peaks in this vicinity, and I do not know of any point whence so wide and so beautiful a prospect is obtained as from this one."
               
               "Gloriously beautiful, indeed;" said the stranger, stepping to the edge of the plateau.
               He was a youth, scarcely more than eighteen, apparently full grown in figure, though not tall; with a smooth and perfectly beardless face; a high, white brow, overshadowed by thick and clustering locks; a somewhat pale, cheek a beautifully formed mouth; an eye, full, dark, and passionate in expression; and a figure, light, but symmetrically graceful.
               Blanche, indeed, could not observe him, as he was standing looking out upon the prospect, without a feeling of admiration; his beauty was so truely poetical in character, while his address had been so graceful, easy, and agreeable.
               "You will pardon me," at last said he, "if I am intrusive, but I cannot help thinking that this beautiful spot below me here is your home."
               "You are quite right, sir," replied Blanche.
               "Would you tell me its name, if it has any?" said he, in a frank, open manner.
               "We call it the Clove."
               "The Clove?"
               "The Clove, or Clove Place."
               "A singular name."
               "It is derived, sir, from the situation of the grounds, which occupy a narrow valley, that penetrates into the interior, and, narrowing as it progresses, becomes scarcely more than a deep cleft or gorge, although towards the river it widens into a broad expanse."
               "I cannot imagine a more rarely beautiful place for a home. But, again, I must ask your forgiveness for this intrusion."
               "Do not," said Blanche, "withdraw, if you take any pleasure in looking upon the scene. My time for returning to Clove House is already past. Permit me to abdicate, and leave you in possession."
               "Nod for the world," interrupted the youth. "I could not forgive myself if I thought I had driven you away."
               "Believe me, it is not so. It is quite time I should return," said Blanche, gathering up her books and drawings. Suddenly a sketch caught the eye of the stranger, as it lay upon the grass. He sprang forward to pick it up, and hand it to her, but doing so with a wistful look at the drawing—a view of the very prospect their present site commanded—and saying:
               "If it would not be too bold, I would beg——"
               "Oh, sir," interrupted Blanche, "if the sketch pleases you, you may consider it your own."
               "I thank you a thousand times."
               "And now good day, sir," said Blanche, preparing to depart, with an armful of books and other matters.
               "Permit me, I beg of you, to assist you to carry your books home," said the stranger.
               "Oh, no sir. You will pardon me. The distance is but short," rejoined Blanche, and before the youth could utter a remonstrance, she leaped with an agile spring from the side of the plateau to a rock a few feet below, and then bounded, from rock to rock down the mountain's side, with a fawn-like grace and an airiness of step that left the stranger gazing after her with wonder, delight and admiration.
               When Blanche had altogether disappeared from sight, the young stranger started as if awakening from a reverie, and then with a sigh flung himself upon the ground, threw off his hat, and fell to watching the moving clouds and the shifting lights and shades that played among the forest foliage.
               It would seem, as he reclined there, as if all the open, genial frankness of his manner, and the happy lightness and grace of his thoughts, had flown, and a sombre, gloomy cloud settled down upon his brow and heart instead. He mused long and silently but not always in the same mood. Sometimes his look of gloom and loneliness would be followed by hopeful gleams, and more than once an exclamation of delight would burst from his lips. In one of these outbreaks of pleasure, he sprang to his feet, and exclaimed: "Who is she? What can be her name? I must, try to see her again. I cannot bear to think of passing on, and never feel the light of her smile again."
               Then after an exultant turn or two up and down the narrow plateau, the gloom settled upon him again, and he exclaimed:
               "But it is my misery to be doomed to exclusion from every human happiness. Inasmuch as I am alone in the world, it would seem as if it were predetermined that I should always remain so—that the fate which ordained my present state, ordained, also, that it should never be changed. Supposing, now, that I should come to know this beautiful creature, to love her, and I am sure I could not exist in her lovely presence without loving her, what encouragement would be extended to a poor wanderer like myself. I have no family—no name but an assumed one. In plain terms, I am an adventurer. Alas! they would turn me from their door. All-beautiful, and all-gentle as I believe her to be, she would learn to frown upon me. It would be wiser for me not to expose myself to such a chance."
               He continued thus pacing up and down, struggling with the new emotion that was stirring in his bosom, and indulging in bitter meditation upon life and the world, as it had been to him, until his thoughts took a passionate form, and with a thrilling grief he cried:
               "My father! oh, my father, why do you cast me off? Why do you heap this curse upon me?"
               This outbreak of passionate sorrow seemed to relieve him somewhat. He paused in his rapid tread, lifted his hat from his brow, and allowed the breeze to cool it, and then, as if to seek complete relief in some other excitement, plunged down the mountain's side in an opposite direction to that which Blanche pursued, rushing along at a headlong speed, leaping over the deep and narrow gorges, springing from rock to rock, with an impetuous energy that soon, in his panting heart, and flushed cheek, dispersed much of the despondency that but a few moments before was weighing upon him so heavily.
               At this rapid rate be continued a mile or two, until he drew near a simple, long, low, old-fashioned structure, that was situated on a shelving part of the shore, and commanding a fine view of the river, for many miles above. As he approached this house, and freely threw open the gate to the little garden enclosure before it, a stentorian voice shouted out from the door-porch,—
               "Glad to see you back, young sir. Fine mountains, eh, sir. If I were twenty years younger, my lad, I'd give your leg's a try on these hills, that I would."
               "Twenty years younger, sir! I shouldn't wonder if you could beat me now, Captain Dartan," replied the youth.
               "Oh, no, Mr. Moore; I'm old now—old."
               "Really, Captain Dartan, you must not call me Mr. Moore. It sounds so strange, coming from one like you."
               "What shall I call you, then, young sir?"
               "Rodman; or, if you will, Rodman Moore."
               "A good name. Rodman. Let me see—was there not a Rodman something with us at Germantown? Yes, yes, I remember. Rodman Willow. A noble fellow. I think you must have been named after him, sir. Yes, I'm sure your father must have known old Rodman Willow, for I never heard of another Rodman before; and where else, then, could he have got the name?"
               "I really cannot say," replied Rodman, with a laugh, "where my parents got the name; but if it really did come from your fellow-soldier, Rodman Willow, I shall henceforth esteem it much more than I have hitherto done."
               "You might well, boy; you might well. Rodman Willow was a soldier who was all heart. Nobody ever knew Rodman to do a harsh thing; nobody ever heard tell of Rodman doing an act of unkindness. No, no; Rodman Willow was always doing, like the scripture orders us, good to all his fellow-creatures. May he rest, in heaven!"
               The old man rose up, and, lifting his hat from his head, stood, with uplifted eyes, gazing up into the heaven above him, solemnly and silently. Rodman thought that he presented, with his white and venerable bead, a really grand picture.
               When the old man was seated again, Rodman ventured to draw the conversation towards the subject just then uppermost in his thoughts. There could be no doubt, he thought, of Captain Dartan being acquainted with everybody in the neighborhood; and, once beginning to gossip about his neighbors, enough could be elicited, Rodman thought, to enable him to surmise who the beautiful forest-rambler could be, whom he had so unexpectedly encountered.
               "Your mountains here are not much frequented, Captain Dartan," said he; "do you have many new residents hereabouts?"
               "Not many, Rodman—for so I will call you, lad, and not do it either without calling a blessing on the name; but, as I was saying, I hav'nt seen much change these twenty years past. Lately, a few of your city people have come up and built some showy sort of houses, just for their summer use. Otherwise, I don't see many new faces about me, excepting, indeed, the youngsters that are, springing, up all around, and changing from babies to men and women, faster than I can keep count."
               "I saw a little way below here, a very beautiful, and an old place, that struck my fancy completely. I wonder to whom it belongs?"
               "Describe it, lad."
               "I remember being struck with the picturesque effect of a massive yellow willow, with its hoar and silvery leaves, that stood close by the mansion, looking, as the sunlight fell upon it, like, frosted age."
               "Colonel Waldron's!" exclaimed the old soldier, quickly; it being one of his eccentricities to always bestow the title of Colonel upon Mr. Waldron, as an exalted compliment, no doubt; "Colonel Waldron's," said he, "or Clove Place, as everybody hereaway calls it. Ah, my boy, that is a place for you. Beautiful! I don't believe that on the face of the earth a lovelier spot can be found. I don't indeed, Rodman Moore."
               "I quite agree with you, Captain Dartan," said Rodman.
               "And Colonel Waldron, where, I should like to know, can be found a nobler gentleman—gentleman, sir, than Colonel Waldron? And there is his sister, Amelia, too."
               "A young lady, sir?" quietly inquired Rodman.
               "A young lady! Why, yes, I call her young. Fifty, I should say."
               "Is that all?" laughed young Moore.
               "But there is a young one, Rodman, Colonel Waldron's ward, and so beautiful, too! Ah, you'd fall in love with her, I'm sure you would, Rodman." The old man rubbed his hands, and chuckled over this anticipation with real delight.
               "But what is the name of this young lady?"
               "Blanche! Blanche! Blanche Dearwood. A real Dearwood. General Dearwood for her grandfather. A sweet creature, Rodman Moore, with all her grandfather's virtues and his nose. Bless me, I would know the Dearwood nose let it be on whose face it would."
               Rodman had learned enough. The beautiful sprite of the mountain must have been this Blanche Dearwood. Blanche Dearwood! A beautiful name, he thought, that sounded in harmony with the grace and the beauty of her person.
               Desiring now to escape from the garrulous talk of the excellent old man, he pleaded fatigue, and entering the house, hastened to the privacy of his own apartment.
               Here he yielded himself to a delightful day-dream. He pictured himself the successful wooer of this beautiful Blanche, with the dark sorrow that had always hung about his life, removed, by a father's affection restored to him. He saw himself by her side, listening to the melody of her voice—wandering with her through grand forests and all-beautiful valleys—watching her fingers bringing out life and beauty on the artist's page; or bending, perhaps, upon him glances of affection and tenderness.
               The picture warmed upon the boy's imagination, and he began to walk the floor with flushed brow and blazing eyes. Ah, what a painter youth is! How gorgeous are his colors! How brilliant are his conceptions and bold his effects! Everything is golden and rosy. He paints no clouds to mar the perfect serenity of his heaven. His perspective extends no farther than his happiness penetrates. He dips his brush in hope, and out of his fancy he paints colors so divine, that it is a thought full of bitterness to reflect how these colors will fade into faint and cast-off finery, and this hope mock, and mock, and mock until the end!
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VIII.
               LOVE, AND AN ADVENTURE.
               AT the close of the last chapter, Rodman was in a daydream. At the opening of this chapter, he is just awakening from a night-dream. The day-dream was of Blanche. The night-dream was a confused and wild medley, in which Blanche and a strange face were associated—in which love, anger, heart-burnings, and heart-desires, and all contending passions, were fearfully hurled against each other.
               Seating himself by his window, he meditatingly looked out upon the morning scene, whose serene and calm beauty gradually stole over his senses, and calmed the turbulent emotions which the past and the present were mutually awakening in his breast.
               But what had a boy of only eighteen summers to do with a past? How was it that there should be a chain binding down aspirations and hopes, and dragging back the eager flight of his soul to a dead weight, from which he could never soar! Strong, honest, daring, full of vigor and earnest impulses, why could he not close a door upon all that was gone by, and rushing into the future, with an unencumbered heart and strong purpose, compel a realisation of the magnificent dreams that now so filled his whole being?
               It was this thought that came upon him, in various ways and forms, as he sat there by the cottage-window, as we have described.
               "If I could forget," said he aloud, "if I could shake off this old remembrance, and rid myself of this desire which for so many years has clung to me, I might overcome the obstacles of my birth and fortune, and win for myself a position that would entitle me to address or love the highest. But I cannot, I cannot. It has filled my heart all this while too completely."
               His reverie was interrupted by the sight of a young girl, mounted on a shaggy, little pony, who was riding up to the house. The very first glance sent Rodman's heart, with a bound, to his throat, for who could she be but his woodland fay, his mountain sprite. Another look made it certain, for as she suddenly lifted up her broad gipsy-hat, the glorious features, the lightning smile, the radiant glance of Blanche Dearwood, were all revealed to him.
               Checking the first impulse, to run down and salute her, by remembering that she would probably only consider such conduct as impertinent, he seated himself to watch her motions, and, if possible, to hear once more the music of a voice whose very first word had so enchanted him.
               Leaping with fearless ease from her saddle, Blanche threw open the gate, and ran tripping up the garden-walk, with both hands extended to greet the old soldier, who was coming out to welcome her.
               "A good morning, my dear Captain Dartan," said she, in a merry manner; "you know my old fondness for an early ride. I coaxed Miss Waldron to have breakfast half an hour later, so that I might have time to trot Hero over here, and see if your good health continued, and to bring you this little pot of preserved strawberries, of which you are so fond."
               
               "So like a Dearwood," said the veteran, with a gratified smile.
               "Ah, there is Angelica," 
                     interupted
                     interrupted
                   Blanche, running up to kiss a middle-aged woman, who appeared at the door.
               The lady who rejoiced in this title was a niece of the Captain's, and, with himself, constituted his sole household. She was a little, mild, patient-looking creature, with a look of perpetual and resigned sorrow upon her features. She was a widow, and by her husband's side she had buried two children.
               "Won't you come in?" said Angelica; "uncle and I were just about breakfasting."
               "Oh, no, I thank you, Angelica; I promised Miss Waldron to be back to breakfast. But you both are really well?"
               "Yes, both, I thank Providence," said the Captain.
               "But what news from the Colonel, bonny Blanche?"
               "None—that is, none that I have received. His sister has had a letter, which states his fears that it may be some weeks before his return to the Clove. I am afraid, dear Captain Dartan, that it is some sad matter that so prolongs his absence. Amelia, I can perceive, is in a continual state of agitation on his account."
               "May Heaven protect and bless him!" replied the veteran, fervently.
               "And now," said Blanche, "let me say good-bye. You will excuse this flying visit, I know. It was a mere freak of mine for a morning ride. You see, I rode Hero, because he could bring me by the mountain-paths. Good-by, Captain; good-by, Angelica. Do come, dear sir, and pass a long day with us. You know how much I love to hear your stories of those grand old times. Won't you promise me?"
               With a witching manner, Blanche held the Captain's hands, and looked into his face, with a smile, at once roguish and tenderly persuasive. Just as the veteran was about replying, Rodman came along the garden-walk. Eager to exchange but a word merely with Blanche, he had determined to frame some excuse for doing so, and, therefore, had abandoned his apartment, and appeared among the party in the little door-yard garden.
               "Oh, here is Rodman Moore," said Captain Dartan, when he perceived him; "a fine youth, let me tell you, Blanche—noble, noble!"
               Blanche gave a start, and blushed deeply, as her eyes fell upon the stranger of the mountain. Rodman himself was somewhat disconcerted, but with a low bow, he expressed his happiness in meeting Miss Dearwood.
               "I did not know," said Blanche, after the exchange of a few compliments, "that Captain Dartan had any relatives by the name of Moore."
               "I have not the honor of being related to Captain Dartan," said Rodman.
               "He is not my relative," said the old soldier, "but I wish that he were. He is related, though, to an old friend of mine, Rodman Willow."
               "The fact is, Miss Dearwood, it was my desire to spend a few weeks among these highland scenes, to occasionally fling a line into the stream below, and sometimes to wing a bird or two on these mountain sides. Captain Dartan kindly consented to lodge me during my brief rural sojourn."
               Blanche bowed, and then declaring that she must mount and off, ran through the gate, and with an agile spring, gained her saddle, before Rodman, who had darted forward, could offer his assistance.
               With a wave of the hand, and another good-by, she tapped Hero lightly with her whip, and off he trotted at a brisk rate, a few hundred feet distant abandoning the road and plunging into the untracked forest.
               When Blanche had disappeared, Angelica announced breakfast, and Rodman unwillingly seated himself at the table, for his second interview with Blanche had stirred up only so much the more all his transports and strengthened so much his admiration of her beauty and loveliness, that he could not bear the necessity of controlling the flow of his feelings by the presence of others. He wanted at once to escape from all society, and, in the solitudes of the hills, indulge in the passionate emotions that filled his breast.
               This fondness for resorting to solitude for relief in all matters that occupied his thoughts, was a habit acquired in early youth, when deprived of all congenial companionship, and condemned to long intervals of perfect solitude, he had, in his silent vigils, poured out aloud to rocks and hills, his overflowing griefs, until it had seemed to him as if half their weight were lifted by the sympathy of nature.
               The breakfast over, Rodman took his fishing-rod, as if resolved upon a little sport in the way of landing a trout or two, and started off towards the mountains.
               "Is that the way you go fishing?" called out Captain Dartan after him, who had been observing all his proceedings.
               Rodman, a good deal confused, stammered out that he was intending first to ascend the Peak, and reach the shore on the opposite side.
               "Ah, boy, don't think to blind me, as old as I am," exclaimed the Captain, who, by this time, had come up to him; "I know, my lad, what's in your heart, there. Blanche! Blanche, my boy! Blanche is the trout you're baiting for—she's the fish you want to hook! I know, I know!"
               The old man, here, quite overcome by the exceeding humor of his joke, broke out in a fit of laughter so loud and so long, that Rodman did not wait until it was finished, but with "you're a shrewd man, Captain," left him by the roadside. When he reached the confines of the wood that stretched part way. up the Peak, he turned to look, and there was the old hero laughing still, and waving his hand after him.
               Escaped from all observation, Rodman now gave vent to the strong passions that were in him. He rushed along and up the mountain's side—now indulging in exquisite pictures of future bliss—now enthusiastically dwelling on the glorious beauty of Blanche—but sometimes, alas! feeling a wild despair sweep over him.
               Actuated by an instinct of love, almost before he knew it he found himself upon the ground where first he had seen her. It did not seem the same place without her presence. Half its charm was gone. There were a few scraps of paper about, as remembrancers of her, and a torn sketch of a fountain, which he seized upon as if it were a treasure.
               Flinging himself upon the ground, and parting the bushes that interrupted his view, he looked down upon the Clove, with the hope of catching but even one glimpse of her form, moving about the grounds. But there was not a sign that denoted her presence. In vain he watched with eager closeness the orchards, the gardens, the lawn, the river walks, she did not appear once to glad his vision. The old house stood serenely calm, in the shadows of the old trees, that murmured above it, as their branches tossed too and fro in the morning breeze. The bright plumage of a peacock sometimes gleamed through the vistas of the orchard-trees, as it moved stately among them. The bark of a dog occasionally reached the ears of Rodman, although but faintly. Otherwise, all was still. The shadows danced and shifted upon the ground, and the lights and shades played among the foliage. The river, farther on, silvery and serene, moved slowly, sometimes richly dark beneath high cliffs, sometimes glittering like a shield.
               The breeze made music in the trees that wagged their high tops above Rodman's head. Occasionally, a bird flew in among them, and added to their melody. Sometimes a squirrel would run along their branches, and peer down at Rodman, wonderingly. A rabbit, even, once thrust his nose between some leaves, and fixed for full a moment his keen eyes upon him.
               Still, for an hour or more, Rodman reclined, silently looking towards the Clove. At last, with impetuous energy, he springs up, and begins to pace the ground.
               He would win her. These were his thoughts. He would cast from him this old spirit-breaking grief, and commence life anew, with new hopes, new ambitions. He would fling himself into the world. He was strong, and could struggle with it, conquer it. He would acquire fame, riches, a name proud in its own greatness, and having no need of ancestral aid.
               And, oh, the glory of winning her! The inestimable happiness of possessing a beauty like that of hers—a smile like hers, to shed perpetual sunshine upon his heart; a voice like hers, to always fall upon his spirit with sweetness and melody.
               But this sudden passion for one unknown, suggests a mocker in his bosom. One unknown, thus reasoned he, as though ordinary modes of acquaintanceship were to measure mine. Did not every glance of her eye, every intonation of her voice, every smile, show me through and through her whole being—her heart, in its perfect innocence; her mind, in its rich fullness?
               "But, Blanche, if you were a sprite, a thing of evil, assuming a form of transcendant beauty, I could not withstand the magic of your beauty."
               So musing, so dreaming, Rodman, at last—oh, direful to say—became seized with a desire to pour out his passion in rhyme. With eager haste, he hunts for paper through his pockets, and, when found, he flings himself upon the grass, and straightway begins to hunt for jingles. After much scratching and long-thinking, he succeeds in pencilling a glowing sonnet to his mistress, to admit which, here, would be doing him malicious wrong.
               Rodman's extravagance must be pardoned. It is something to set down in his extenuation, that he was by no means the first youth in love who ever took to verse. It seems somehow as if the divine passion must let itself out through a jingle. People, who at every other period of their lives are perfectly well and sound, when fallen, sunk, or gotten into love, are sure to buy a rhyming dictionary, and thenceforth suffer under this malady. It is not usually cured till after the honeymoon. It is a sad sickness certainly, and ought to come under the observation of the Medical Institute.
               Rodman never had been a poet. This occasion was his first crime. A maiden offence, and extraordinary temptation, we trust, will plead for his pardon.
               When the verses were finished, Rodman folded the sheet, and, like another Orlando, dropped it upon the grass, where he hoped Blanche might find and read it.
               Extraordinary illusion! How could you suppose, 0 youth, Cupid-blind, that the road to Blanche's heart was through bad poetry? Was she not a daily reader of the sublime productions of England's magnificent galaxy of poets? Had not her tutor refined her taste to a fastidious appreciation of poetical excellence? How could she, then, turn from those great intellects to admire your poor lines?
               But as Cupid is blind, pleads the youth, perhaps the lady, too, may be infected, and so see only beauties in my verses. Oh, vanity! the lady infected, too! After three words with you, and scarcely two full looks. Why, I'll be bound she scarcely knows the color of your hair. Ladies don't tumble, sir, headlong into love at the first glance at a curl, or a nose, or a whisker, after the example of their strong-minded superiors. I may question, sir, if ladies ever fall into love at all. They take a good look, and then a deliberate leap—and the beauty of this is, they don't often want to scramble back again, after another example set them by the supreme wisdom of their lordly masters.
               But Rodman left his verses upon the ground, and strolled off with the hope of encountering her by chance in some of her pony rambles.
               He was still unfortunate. By some chance she had not appeared abroad that day. Noon came on, passed away, and the afternoon had almost half gone. Rodman, during all this time, had been hovering about, watching the house from various points, and paying occasional visits to Blanche's wild bower. He was just approaching it, resolving that it should be the last time, when he was suddenly struck into silence by the notes of a song that were floating on the air. It was the voice of Blanche. With silent speed, he drew near enough to listen, and to look upon her. She was seated, as upon the time when he first saw her, with books, music, and drawings grouped around. An unfinished sketch was before her, which she was engaged in touching, while singing half brokenly, but with pure and full expression, a snatch of an old ballad.
               He bent forward to listen, grew absorbed, when, suddenly, the branch upon which he leaned, broke, and, with so loud a crack, that Blanche started up in alarm.
               Rodman had no alternative but to introduce himself. He did so with the best grace possible.
               "Your pardon, Miss Dearwood," said he, "for again intruding upon your retreat. But I heard, as I was sauntering along, music issuing from this leafy haunt, and I could not resist the inclination to pause and listen. A branch upon which I leaned broke and betrayed me."
               But Blanche's cheek was glowing with something almost like indignation.
               "You appear, Mr. Moore," said she, "to be fond of this spot. I think you have been here before to-day."
               Rodman changed color. His verses were gone. It was those to which she referred. She had found them, read them, admired them. His rhapsody was interrupted—
               "I found, sir," said Blanche, "a folded paper upon the grass, here. It probably belongs to you. You must have lost it, as I do not know of any other person acquainted with this retreat. Permit me to return it."
               She handed him his verses unopened, and folded as he had left them. Rodman received them with the blankest of looks, and bit the paper to pieces with impatient chagrin.
               "You are offended, Miss Dearwood," at last, said he, "with my impertinent intrusions upon your privacy. I will withdraw, and never trouble you again. And yet I scarcely can bring my mind to do so without assuring you, that to do aught or say aught to anger Miss Dearwood, would, in my own estimation, be one of the darkest crimes I could commit."
               Blanche lifted her eyes to him upon these words, and the angry flush faded from her cheek.
               "I am sorry," said she, "if I have judged you too harshly. I am not offended, now. But it appeared to me that I was subjected to a kind of persecution."
               "You do not, then, send me away in anger?"
               "I am not angry."
               "Oh, Miss Dearwood, if you knew that I was actuated only by the purest motive! I stand alone in the world. Without a relative, without a friend, without even companions. I saw you, and longed for the boon of your friendship."
               "Alone in the world!" said Blanche, with sympathy.
               "Do not think, Miss Dearwood," said Rodman, "that I am seeking to arouse your pity. And yet, where is there a wretch that needs it more! I am a beggar, so poor that a word of kindness is a large charity. If I were to hurl myself now headlong down this precipice, there would not, in all the wide world, be one sigh breathed for me, one tear dropped for me."
               Blanche, somewhat romantic, better versed in books than in the world, and uncontrolled by conventional forms, yielded to a generous impulse that sprang up in her bosom. Extending her hand to him with sweet simplicity, she said:
               "Let us be friends."
               Rodman seized her hand, and, carried away by a chivalrous devotion, raised it to his lips. Blanche blushed, and then laughed merrily, as she said,—
               "You are really, sir, a perfect gallant."
               "Miss Dearwood, you have made me very happy," said Rodman, with tears fairly in his eyes; "and to one who has known so little of happiness in all his life, one incident like this becomes imperishably impressed upon his memory."
               "You have no friends, did you say?" inquired Blanche
               "I do not wish for any now," replied Rodman.
               "No relatives even?"
               "There is not one in all the world to whom I could claim any kin. I had a father, whom I remember, but he is dead—so I fear."
               Rodman's face grew pale, his lip quivered, his breast rose and fell. Blanche, quickly perceiving his agitation, forbore to press any more questions, although her strong interest in him—perhaps it was even a deeper feeling—excited a desire to know more of the mysterious grief that hung about him.
               Blanche now resumed her drawing; and Rodman, flinging himself upon the grass, a few feet distant from her side, took up a volume of Thomson, that was lying open upon the ground, and commenced reading aloud a few lines, that aptly described a scene somewhat similar in features to that which they now looked out upon.
               "You hardly know the Clove yet, Mr. Moore," said Blanche.
               "I have not explored it thoroughly, but some of its beauties are deeply appreciated by me."
               "It has a charming aspect from the river," said Blanche. "I have not looked upon it from that point," was the reply.
               "You must have fished farther up the stream," said Blanche, glancing at his fishing-rod, that lay in the grass a little distance off. Rodman was again confused.
               "I am compelled to confess," said he, "that I have not been upon the water at all to-day."
               Blanche turned aside to smile, as if she shrewdly suspected the cause.
               "Miss Dearwood," resumed Rodman, "your song was rudely broken awhile ago by a barbarian's intrusion into your classic haunt. Your melody should live again and float upon the air anew in all its perfect sweetness."
               
               "It was only a snatch of an old ballad."
               "It was very beautiful."
               "I am glad you liked it."
               "If I could only dare——"
               Blanche looked up inquiringly.
               "Would you sing it again," said he, bending forward.
               "If it would give you pleasure," replied Blanche, in her calm and simple manner.
               "It would, indeed, the greatest."
               Blanche sung, with exquisite expression and feeling, a part of an old ballad.
               Rodman listened with sincere delight, and was about begging for its repetition, when a sudden clap of thunder, loud and long, reverberated among the hills, and broke startlingly upon their ears. Absorbed in their conversation and their music, they had not heard the first distant mutterings of the storm, nor observed the gathering and approach of the densely-black clouds, that now swept on rapidly through the western sky.
               "A thunder-storm, and very near," said Blanche, starting up.
               "Will you have time to reach Clove House?" inquired Rodman, watching the fast approaching cloud; "or, do you know, Miss Dearwood, of any retreat near by, which would afford us protection?"
               "None," replied Blanche; "if we run fast, perhaps, we can be housed in time. Come, you cannot possibly reach Captain Dartan's, and—"
               "You will permit me to see you safely home," interrupted Rodman, with eager delight."
               "I am afraid I shall have need of your protection," replied Blanche, glancing anxiously at the huge blackness that was sweeping on so irresistibly, which, even while she looked, was suddenly illuminated into a blaze of dazzling fire, as the lightning flashed through it.
               "Do not let us delay," resumed she, in a low voice, as if overcome by awe; and then, with a motion for Rodman to follow, she started down the mountain's side, with an almost fairy-like agility and ease, darting from rock to rock, and sometimes with perfect coolness, seizing a pendant branch, to aid what would otherwise be a hazardous leap. There was nothing of boldness, nothing masculine, nothing inconsistent with female delicacy or female refinement, in the agility Blanche thus displayed. On the contrary, it seemed so purely a lightness and airiness of step, it was invested so completely with a nameless grace and beauty, that it seemed rather to enhance the refinement and the delicacy of her being. It was, indeed, a fascinating quality, a poetry of motion, that to Rodman was a rapturous pleasure to look upon.
               But the storm rapidly approached. The lightning grew more frequent, and the thunder louder and more rapid. The clouds, too, had overspread the sky so thickly, that in the forest-passes a more than twilight darkness prevailed. Presently a gust of wind rushed along, whirling before it masses of leaves, twigs, broken branches, dust, and spray. The trees shrieked and groaned before the blast, and threw up their long branches in frantic violence, as if in a deep agony. In an instant more there was a pattering of raindrops, and then a rushing sound like a flood, as the rain came down in massive sheets of water.
               Blanche and Rodman, who had hurried on with their utmost speed, regardless of the blinding blast, and the leaves and branches it hurled against them, came suddenly to a pause, as the clouds opened, and cast down upon them a very cataract of rain.
               
               "What shall we do?" said Rodman. "Is there no retreat?"
               "None."
               "A clump of trees yonder might afford a little protection."
               "Quick, then," said Blanche, starting forward.
               "Miss Dearwood, this will shield you a little," said Rodman, tearing off his coat, and rushing after Blanche, to fling it upon her shoulders.
               "No, no, Mr. Moore," said Blanche, "I cannot permit—"
               Her words were interrupted by a blazing flash of lightning, and an instantaneous report of thunder, so stunningly and fearfully loud, that it seemed fairly like the clashing of spheres, while, mingled with it, there was a crash, and a shriek, accompanied by a stunning ringing in the ears, and the earth at their very feet seemed to be quivering, as if struck by a bolt.
               "The tree! the tree!" exclaimed Blanche, breathlessly. Rodman looked; and, to his horror, perceived that one of the very cluster of trees to which they had been hastening was rent from top to bottom, blackened, wrenched into wild contortions, and blazing and smoking with a sulphurous fire.
               "Heavens! this is terrible," said Rodman.
               "I— I—," faintly ejaculated Blanche.
               "You are injured, Miss Dearwood," said Rodman, springing forward, just in time to catch her fainting form.
               "Air—I choke—air," said Blanche, gasping for breath, while her bosom rose and fell heavily. In a moment more her head sank back, and she swooned away, overcome by fright.
               "Miss Dearwood! Blanche!" frantically exclaimed Rodman. "Help! O Heaven, she is dead!"
               With a desperate impulse, wild with fear and horror, Rodman caught her up in his arms, and rushed impetuously towards the house. His youthful strength, under ordinary circumstances, would not have been equal to the burden, but, nerved by his desperate will, he bore her rapidly along over the rough and jagged forest-ground.
               Emerging from the wood, an orchard was to be crossed, that would bring him close to the back entrance of the mansion. But the distance across the orchard was considerable, and even his frantically-nerved strength was sinking beneath the weight he bore. The rain, too, which still continued to pour in overwhelming masses, caused his saturated clothes to cling around his limbs, so as to embarrass his progress, while the drenched skirts of Blanche added much to her weight.
               But Amelia, who had been alarmed at Blanche's absence during so violent a storm, had dispatched domestics in search of her, and one of these observed Rodman staggering with Blanche in his arms, before he had proceeded many yards through the orchard. The man, with a shout, hastened to the aid of Rodman; but the boy, unwilling to surrender his precious charge into the arms of another, nerving himself anew, with a desperate energy, rushed forward with increased speed, and in a few moments more staggered upon the porch, where the greatly-alarmed Amelia, and her household, were assembled. Amelia caught Blanche in her arms, a maid hurried for restoratives, and Rodman sank down speechless from exhaustion.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               HAUNTS AND PLEASURES.
               BLANCHE did not suffer any serious effects from her exposure to the storm, described in the last chapter. As for Rodman, he was secretly inclined to rejoice at it. It established his position as a guest at Clove House, and at once placed him on a companionable footing with Blanche.
               Amelia conceived an interest in him from the first. Whether this was to be attributed solely to the services he had rendered Blanche, or whether the frankness, openness, and seeming purity of his heart succeeded in pleasing her rather fastidious and watchful nature, cannot be asserted with certainty. But that he came to be quite a favorite with Amelia is simply a fact, and one, too, exceedingly gratifying to Blanche.
               Blanche and Rodman now spent a large part of their time together. Blanche was so purely unsophisticated, so little versed in all the little laws that are ordinarily prescribed for acquaintances of so transient or new a character, pure in her own heart, and never dreaming of evil, that she, with quiet simplicity and perfect faith, admitted the confidence and companionship of Rodman. As his society gave her pleasure, she enjoyed it earnestly and serenely, neither checking her desires nor her inclinations by imaginary and unfounded ideas of propriety.
               It was a mutual advantage in many ways, this companionship of theirs. The flow of their thoughts took color from each other. Blanche received a more vigorous impulse to her own mind, and gave to Rodman's many softening and refining touches.
               Her books were now studied with him—her drawings performed by his side—her music executed for his ear. They read the poets together, and emulated each other in detecting the beauties of the inspired page. Shakspeare, Milton, Thomson, Wordsworth, our own poets, these constituted the volumes selected by Mr. Waldron for Blanche's study and perusal. But as he had dreaded the effect upon her pure imagination of the scathing heat of Byron, and the warm sensuousness of Moore, these works had been excluded from her collection.
               They took long rambles together, and almost every morning rode out along the river-road—a most picturesque ride. They also made frequent drives over to Captain Dartan, whose honest simplicity and genial heartiness, together with the rich fund of historical lore he always had at hand to entertain them with, made him a favorite with each.
               But their most delightful excursions were upon the water. In a little skiff, propelled by Rodman alone, they passed many hours in exploring the various indents of the shore, and in penetrating up the many little rivulets that coursed down the mountains, and emptied themselves into the river.
               Upon one occasion, they resolved to proceed as far as possible up one of these little streams. It was a romantic and a delightful scene through which they passed. They forced their way through tangled brakes and overhanging bushes; sometimes gliding through numbers of the water-lily, whose snowy blossoms lay quietly upon the streamlet's surface, and ladened all the air with their pleasant odors; sometimes parting tangled masses of vines and bushes, and gliding under them as if through a wild bower; emerging out upon little lakes, above which would tower interlacing elms, and oaks and willows; moving slowly around grassy island knolls, that were studded, star-like, with lilies and other woodland blossoms; sometimes, Rodman bending to the oar stiffly, cleaving their way up little rapids, over which the water would leap and foam musically; pausing, occasionally, in shadowed spots where the water lay deep, to talk awhile, or perhaps to hunt in one of their favorite poets for some descriptive passages of scenes similar to the one they enjoyed.
               Resting, at last, beneath a grand old-willow, the sun flinging glittering drops of light through its branches—the opposite shore a wild ascent, jagged with rocks, and thick with laurel and cedar—the stream above them leaping down in seething foam a long descent of wildly-bedded rocks—flowery knolls below them, around which the stream murmured a tale of love for the flowers that drooped their heads to kiss it—resting, at last, in this rarely beautiful spot, Rodman said:
               "Blanche, you have often desired of me my early history. It is a debt I owe your generous friendship for one unknown. Will you listen now to my story?"
               "What better time? What better place?" replied Blanche, with pleasure gleaming in her eyes. So, adjusting herself where she might listen with ease, and look-up into the face of the narrator, she said:
               "Now, Rodman, will you begin? Tell me everything. Do not fear of wearying me."
               So Rodman, after a moment's pause, began his history.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               RODMAN'S HISTORY.
               "MY recollections of my early life," said Rodman, "are very indistinct and confused. Of my youngest childhood I can recall only a dull sense of loneliness weighing heavily upon me, and the presence of a stern, white brow, that hovered ever about me, and stupefied me with a kind of awe. Insensibly other things mingle in my memory. I can remember of a square-walled, high-peaked, bare-looking house, with a forest on one side, a river behind, and a great stretch of fields before, which seemed to my boyish fancy to lead nowhere so likely as to the blue sky. I remember its white-walled rooms, with long rows of stiff, upright chairs, ranged with freezing order against the wainscot, and a family portrait, that hung above one mantel-shelf, with a remarkable nose, as far as dimensions were concerned, and a cold, glassy eye, that sometimes would seem to fix itself upon me, when lying awake at night, with an awful expression in its big, round orb.
               "Mingled with these things is the remembrance of my little room, high up in one of the sharp gables, close against the roof, and lit by a sky-light. It was a very small, little room, and the pitch of the roof was so great that there were but a few square feet of its entire compass in which one could stand erect. My bed was thrust close under the eaves, and upon retiring I was fairly sandwiched between the pillow and the ceiling.
               "The pattering of rain drops upon the roof is the most vivid remembrance I have of my many lonely hours within this little room. Of lying hour after hour, hearing no sound but them, and having no companionship but their lonely, melancholy music, with bitter tears wetting the pillow, and an aching at the heart I was not old enough to understand—is the picture the name of childhood often recalls to me.
               "My tutor, for such was the relation the white brow I have mentioned bore to me, was of a stern and cold nature, with a manner so entirely unsympathizing, and an address so pompous and chilling, that I daily went before him with awe and trembling. He always received me in his library, a large room with capacious shelves, filled with ponderous volumes, that he for ever seemed to be studying. I remember one time of speculating as to the use he put all the wonderful learning he must have acquired out of books, which to me seemed, in their pompous and imposing gravity, vast repositories of miraculous wisdom. The conclusion to which I came was, that he was a miser in the way of learning, and that he stored it away in some place to which no one had the key, and where not even himself could more than look upon the treasures.
               "The hours of torture that I spent in this library! I cannot remember them even now without the old dull terror coming back upon me. His sternness terrified, his coldness repulsed, and his learning overwhelmed me. How I ever succeeded in acquiring anything puzzles me now when I think of it.
               "Besides myself and Mr. Arden—this was my tutor's name—two more persons completed the household. John—I never knew him by any fuller name—John, the gardener, who never wore a coat, and who went about for ever humming one tune, and did nothing else; and a red-faced damsel who kept continually bouncing in and out of all the rooms in the house, at all hours of the day,
               "I have mentioned my indistinct remembrances of all these things, as they appertained to my earliest days. I cannot tell when I first came to know them or to observe them. The house, the servants, my little chamber, and the pattering rain-drops, the gloomy and deserted rooms, the library with its awful volumes, and over all, and amid all, gleaming like a pale spectre, the white brow of my tutor—all these float without priority or precedence in my memory. But by and by other things come to mingle with them; half developed sensations become vivid and strong; events lose their misty-like uncertainty, and memory at last pictures with clearness and precision.
               "During my infant days, there would occasionally appear, at long intervals, a strange face, a face greatly different from any of those that daily surrounded me, and so marked with a grand beauty and beaming gentleness, that it from the first strongly impressed my childish imagination. I must have been very young when I first learned to watch for the coming of this stranger, and to experience an intense but ever-silent rapture when his presence would light up the dreary hall, and his voice fall with exquisite tenderness upon my heart, a heart, too, wildly eager for but a few crumbs of sympathy.
               "As time progressed, I grew more and more wrapped up in this mysterious stranger. The memory of his brief visits I would hug to my heart with brooding pleasure; and I would pine and yearn with silent intensity for the time when he would appear again. The mystery of his visits no doubt stimulated the interest I felt for him; but as in all that desert ert of human dismalness, his hand was the only one that ever rested with an affectionate pressure upon my head—his voice the only one that ever whispered a word of tenderness in my ear; was it a wonder that there should have sprung up in my bosom a romantic worship for him? No wonder! My heart, full of natural springs of affection, eager for love, abounding in emotions and passions, undeadened by the weight of pulseless humanity that was cast upon it, caught this single ray of love, with a deep, passionate delight.
               "But speculations began to be rife within me. Who was I? Whence came I? By what link was I riveted to my kind, or was I, indeed, isolated, unconnected, alone, and the broken chain that severed me never again to be united?
               "How was it that others, whom I would sometimes meet, were surrounded by friends and kindred, by affections, solicitudes and sympathies, and I to be cast out and cut off from these things? What was the mystery that surrounded my being? Why did my tutor sternly look me into silence when I would sometimes venture an inquiry into my parentage? Why, indeed, had I no parents? Why no home, no family?
               "These thoughts puzzled my young brain, and sorely troubled me. I could not get rid of them. My imagination was continually devising plausible solutions to the mystery, and sometimes, I think, not so plausible as romantic. But with every solution; and through all my eager desires for human affection, the stranger, the Unknown Friend, mingled largely.
               "But an event was soon to occur that was to change all the currents of my thoughts, and to exercise an influence upon me, deep and lasting.
               "My tutor called me to him one day, and said:
               "'Do you remember a strange visitor who has sometimes visited you here?'
               "I replied, 'yes,' with great eagerness.
               "'He will come again to-day.'
               "'How glad! how glad!' exclaimed I, giving away, for once, to an outburst of feeling in Mr. Arden's awful presence. I cannot describe the look of astonished severity that settled upon his face, and froze up my boyish enthusiasm suddenly.
               "'He will arrive here to-night,' said Mr. Arden; 'but I trust that you will not manifest in his presence any of that rude, indecorous and disrespectful boisterousness that you were guilty of just now. I trust that you will, instead, conduct yourself with proper decorum, and that your manner to this visitor will be marked by attentive respect and calm good breeding. If he caresses you, receive his caresses with cheerfulness. If he address you, reply to him briefly, and to the point, with a proper regard to your accent and your grammar.'
               "My tutor's pompous address checked a dozen questions that were on my lips to ask. I did not dare to speak them. But I longed to ask, who was this stranger? What, even, was his name? Was he, indeed, any friend or kin of mine?
               "All the rest of the day I watched with an anxious and beating heart for the arrival of this mysterious stranger. But at last, night began to draw near, and its approach filled me with apprehensions for fear he would not come. I stationed myself by one of the windows to watch for him, as long as there should be light. It was a bleak, March day. All day long, a dull leaden canopy had overhung the earth, and a shrill, piercing wind rushed among the leafless branches of the trees, and hurled itself against the sides of the house. But now, along the western horizon, where the leaden clouds were somewhat lifted, there was a deep, blood-like streak of red, whose reflection tinged, as if with fire, the tree-tops, the fence-rails, and the window-frames.
               "I describe these things because that day, and all that transpired therein, are vividly and clearly impressed upon my memory. I can remember the minutest circumstances, as if they all took place but yesterday.
               "While I stood yet by the window, watching the shadows deepening, in the forest-depths, there suddenly appeared upon the road, as it emerged from the wood, a single horseman, riding rapidly towards the house. As he approached, I could not help remarking one singular feature of his progress. The wind was sweeping along before and around him, a great mass of withered leaves and twigs that enveloped his horse's feet like a cloud, while the glow from the west was falling upon his cheek with an unearthly tinge, and seeming, to strike fire from the distended nostril of his steed.
               "When he drew near the house, John stepped forth to receive his horse, while he dismounted, and was received by Mr. Arden at the door. I was meanwhile, panting with the desire to ran out and greet him, to once more hear his words of kindness, and feel the tender pressure of his hand. But I was under discipline. At the proper time and the proper place, so said Mr. Arden, if the visitor desired it, I could be admitted into his presence.
               "If the visitor desired it! Alas! those words; they fell with a heavy significance upon me. They showed me how only too probably it was that the stranger felt none of that strong interest for me that I did for him.
               "There was half an hour's tedious delay, when Mr. Arden came to me, and led me by the hand, or rather by the coat-cuff, into the principal parlor. Here the stranger was seated. He was a man somewhat tall, with a gentle, sad face and a smile peculiarly bright. He was clothed in dark grey, and over his shoulders there hung a heavy cloak. He stretched out his hand to me, as I entered, and I hastened to take it.
               "'Will you forgive me,' said Mr. Arden, addressing him, 'if I urge you to remember your own frequently-repeated cautions?'
               "'Do not fear me,' said the stranger; and then, addressing me, he resumed, 'You have not many friends, my lad. You have very few that you can love?'
               "I looked up at him wonderingly. At last, I replied,—
               "'I only know Mr. Arden, sir; except John and Susan.'
               "'My gardener and domestic,' explained Mr. Arden. 'I know of no lads in this neighborhood with whom I can permit him to associate. They are mostly boors, I can assure you, sir, who, I fear, would exercise an unfortunate influence on the mind of my young friend.'
               "A few other remarks followed, the stranger endeavoring to draw me into a communicative mood, until Mr. Arden proposed that I should withdraw.
               "The stranger appeared to lingeringly press my hand, and to hold me close to him, while he smoothed my brow.
               "'A fine boy! a noble boy!' said he.
               "I then, in accordance with the command of Mr. Arden, moved towards the door. But, when I reached it, and as I held it open with my hands, I heard the stranger's voice, and, turning my head to look at him once again, he suddenly dropped his voice into a whisper, but I distinctly saw, rather than heard, these words form upon his lips—'Sir, my son——'
               "I was retreating through the door when the words were spoken, and I scarcely took them in until I stood without, in the dark hall, with a blazing and overwhelming truth rushing through my brain and heart.
               "I was bewildered—thrown at once into a state of extreme agitation—with mingled feelings of wild joy and incomprehensible fear convulsing my bosom. Pressing my hands to my head, I rushed, almost frantically, to my little room, and flung myself upon my couch, striving to calm the tempest of emotions that were in me, and to bring myself to look tranquilly upon the wonderful discovery I had made.
               "But I could not be calm. There was a wild commotion in me—a fever in my brain and in my breast. Springing up from my couch, I walked the floor, and yielded to a perfect intoxication of delight at the glorious prospect of happiness that I thought was before me.
               "Unable to control my restless feverishness, uncertain what course to pursue, I stole down the stairs again, to look upon the stranger through the new medium of a son's affection. As I reached the hall, the parlor door was thrown open, and Mr. Arden came out. I drew myself close against the wall, and held my breath, as he brushed I past me, up the stairway. I then stole cautiously forward, and finding that Mr. Arden had left the door slightly ajar, I pushed it slowly and noiselessly open. The stranger—my father! was sitting over the low embers in the fire-place, with his back to the door, and his head leaning upon his hands. The fire was low, and the light had gone out, so that the room was mostly in shadow, save where a faint glow from the embers upon the hearth fell dimly upon the ceiling and upon the floor.
               "I stood in the doorway, looking upon my new-found father. But it was a name I did not dare to use. The very knowledge that I possessed, strange to say, was a knowledge I was afraid to own. Yearning for his embrace with a passionate longing, wild to hear him for once call me his son, I was withheld by an undefinable fear from confessing all that I knew.
               "Yet, once I was on the point of rushing forward, flinging myself at his feet, clasping his knees, and passionately entreating his pardon and his love, as I revealed my knowledge of his kindred to me. But I was withheld by a fear of his anger. Had not secresy been enjoined upon our relationship? Was he not guarding carefully against the very discovery I had so unexpectedly made? For some wise cause he was compelled to this mystery, and to have it revealed might thwart and anger him.
               "These thoughts occurred to me, and restrained me from at once making a full confession to him. Thus uncertain, and distracted by conflicting desires, I hovered about, until suddenly he made a move, and stood up erect.
               "My courage failed me. I could not master resolution to speak the name of father. Like the prayer of Macbeth, it stuck in my throat. I could not give utterance to the sound, but with a beating heart, whose loud pulsations might almost have been heard in the perfect silence of the room, I stood by the door watching his movements.
               "At last he coughed, and turned towards the door. In an instant I disappeared into the darkness of the hall, and with noiseless rapidity hurried up the stairs, and into my own little room.
               "I now resolved to postpone the revelation of my discovery until morning. I would be up early, boldly ask for admittance into his room, and then, upon my knees, confess all I had to confess. With this resolution in my mind, I flung myself upon my bed, and tried to sleep. But that was impossible, or if I did fall occasionally into a brief doze, I would be awakened by wild and fearful dreams. But for hours I lay and tossed about, sometimes seeking relief in walking the narrow confines of the little chamber. Towards morning, however, I fell into a sleep, heavy, uneasy, full of fancies, but prolonged, for when I awoke the sun was screaming through my skylight window.
               I sprang up, and hurried down stairs, with a vague fear of something in my heart. Entering the breakfast room, found Mr. Arden seated alone, and remnants of the meal upon the table.
               "'Where,' I stammered out—'where, sir, is—'I dared not say father, and what could I say?
               "'Where is our visitor, you would say,' said Mr. Arden; 'he was compelled to depart at daylight, this morning.'
               "'And—' I gasped out.
               "'We will not see him again, probably, for many years.'
               "It seemed as if a heavy blow fell upon me, crushing and withering, and as if all the blood in my body was suddenly thrown violently into my heart. I gasped for breath, pressed my hands to my head, and fell down in a swoon."
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               RODMAN'S HISTORY CONTINUED.
               "AH, Rodman," exclaimed Blanche, interrupting the story, "what a strange history! How sad! But you met your father again?"
               "Never, from that day to this."
               "Never!" said Blanche, "why, Rodman, what a terrible thought!"
               "It is difficult for me to describe," resumed Rodman "the earnest and strong affection that sprang up in me for my mysterious father. I was naturally a musing, reserved, melancholy boy, full of strong passions and affections without an outlet. And when this strange discovery occurred, already panting for sympathy, and yearning with a deep power, for human love, I flung my whole heart at once upon this grand and strange being, whose words of kindness I had felt. It was my delight to invest him in imagination with every quality of goodness, every grace, every nobleness of form and heart. He was continually present in my mind. My thoughts, sleeping or waking, brooded incessantly upon him. Sometimes I would be exalted, etherealized with hope, as my busy fancy would depict a glorious future; and often, in some silent retreat of the forest, yielding to a passionate outbreak of despair at the fate which separated us, I would fling my arms wildly above my head, and pour out an impetuous torrent of grief.
               "Thus brooding on this one idea, stimulating my affections by romantic fancies, there grew in me a love for my unknown parent, secretly buried in my own heart, but deep, earnest, vehement.
               "And it was not unnatural that I should feel this strong passion. Conceive my situation—my brooding, melancholy temperament, the strangeness of my early life, the singularity of the discovery, the mighty weight of the unshared secret that I bore, the early tenderness of the stranger, and the incomprehensible mystery that surrounded him!
               "And what a love it was that grew and strengthened day by day within me! Sometimes I would think that if I could see him but once, fling myself upon the ground, cling to his knees, and hear him call me his son, I would be content to die. Or, if I could follow him, and, creeping up to him while he slept, and nestling at his side, fling my arms around him—if, when he awoke, he should recognize his dead son, it would be happiness in the future world to know, that his lips had kissed my cold brow.
               "I unfold to you, Blanche, all this, because I believe that your tender and impressible heart can understand me. I would not dare to tell, what I have told, to those of the world, worldly, whose cold hearts could only see absurdity in my affections. Their ridicule I shrink from. They would call my passion extravagant. Well, so it was. But you can see, Blanche, how the romance of my situation, my painful solitude, my brooding, thinking, dreaming nature, my deep yearning for a little sympathy—how all these things made it extravagant.
               "Time, Blanche, has tempered and moderated it. It does not thrill me through and through with the same exquisite power it once did, and since I have known these Highland haunts, I have almost ceased to pine after the old yearning. But still, I never hear the name of father spoken, however lightly, but it stirs in my bosom strange and deep sensations.
               "It cannot be hoped that we shall ever meet again. The mystery in which he shrouded himself I shall never be able to penetrate. But to the last I shall cherish as a sacred thing, the remembrance of all that I have told you.
               "Time passed on—years, even; and I was grown to be a lad of fifteen. Still no word, no clue, no rumor, even, of my father. I had watched and hoped all this while with painful anxiety, and now I sunk into apathetic despair. I grow morose, gloomy, sullen, fond of nothing but solitude, and having no pleasure but an indulgence in wild dreams.
               "To Mr. Arden I had grown more bold, and sometimes even put imperative questions to him. But nothing would he ever reveal. Close, cold, pompous, my passion would freeze into vapor as it flung itself against his icy nature. But, more than once, I was on the point of revealing all that I knew.
               "It occurred to me once, from whom came the money for my tuition and support? If that could be traced out, thought I, perhaps, I should have a clue. At this I went with energy, and cunningly. But the discovery availed but little. It was received through the hands of a New York attorney, whose name, however, I treasured up for future use. If we should ever meet, thought I, perhaps you will not be so impenetrable as Mr. Arden.
               "One day, at about this period, as I was sauntering along the river bank, I unexpectedly came upon an angler, quietly seated upon a jutting rock, and watching his line the stream. I would have retreated, but he observed and hailed me.
               "'Can you tell me, lad,' said he, 'which are your best fishing grounds?'
               "I pointed out those localities that were most celebrated, and then was about proceeding on, but the stranger appeared desirous of exchanging a little talk with me.
               "'You reside,' said he, 'in this vicinity, don't you, lad?'
               "'Yes, sir,' was my reply.
               "'A pleasant place. Fine sport, too. Are you fond of fishing, my boy?'
               "I told him that I was not.
               "'That's a pity, for it's beautiful sport. I am sure that if you once began to angle a little you would soon grow to like it. It's a great remedy for the blues, lad, and will soothe and soften a man like at prime Havana. There's philosophy in it, my boy, if one could only find it out. Ever read Izaak Walton?'
               "'No, sir.'
               "'No! that's another pity. What have you read? Are you fond of reading? Whose history, now, do you like best, Washington's or Napoleon's, eh? Do you like to read about the pomp and circumstance of war? Shakespeare said that, lad; suppose you don't know him, eh?'
               "There was an off-hand frankness—an easy, dashing grace—in this stranger, that somehow quite charmed me. He talked on for some time, starting various subjects on which to draw me out, telling me pleasant little anecdotes, and laughing heartily at my own few attempts at humor.
               "We spent an hour together, and when we parted I was quite delighted with my new-found acquaintance, who called himself Knowlton. He had interested himself so much in all the incidents of my daily life, in my wants, my pleasures, and my dislikes; he had entered so heartily into my boyish views of things, professing the same likes and the same dislikes, that I thought he was a glorious fellow, and I hoped that we should meet again.
               "We did meet again, and often. I was from that day continually coming in contact with him. I met him in my lonely forest rambles, on the mountains, on the river banks, upon the highway. And whenever we met, he would stop and detain me for half an hour, to chat with him; and the result of these interviews was that he gradually extorted from me, detail by detail, the principal part of my history.
               "I made him my confidant fairly unwillingly. The mystery of my parentage was a subject that I could, not bear to talk to others about. But this stranger insinuated himself so into my confidence, and with his off-hand, careless, genial manner, led me, step by step, to tell him everything.
               "And then his sympathy for me was apparently so earnest and sincere. He took such pains to encourage my dislike of Mr. Arden, bursting out often into what was, no doubt, mock indignation, at his tyrannical cruelty and his cold-heartedness.
               "There is, I think, such a thing as mental fascination. This stranger exercised a certain form of it upon me. I do not know how it was, but all my thoughts, passions, emotions, became modified, and almost changed, when in his presence. When I would look into his eye, I would feel my own individuality fade away. He exercised, too, an almost painful control upon my mind. Was it his worldly tone, his keenness to ridicule, his example of reckless enjoyment, his indifference to duty, his gay dashing, fascinating manner, that burdened itself with no griefs and no passions—was it the continual dazzle of these qualities before my eyes, that first led me to look with a worldly eye upon my unknown father? Or what subtle poison was there about this man, so instilling itself, that, oh, sad to say, a doubt of my father found its way into my bosom?
               "A doubt of him! I was under an evil influence, then. Let me for ever keep my belief in him, sacred and pure.
               "The stranger and I continued to meet, and now, as he knew all my history, and had established himself in my confidence, I began to fear and distrust him. My distrust, however, was somehow powerless. Often, even while I felt it strongest within me, I would, at the same time, be irresistibly drawn to further revelations of my feelings and thoughts.
               "But to one passion that he stimulated in me, I yielded without resistance. It was a hatred of Mr. Arden. But I did not know, at the time, that he was, in fact, developing this passion. Had I suspected it, I would never have been led to a step that, when it was taken, cut in twain the last hope of ever being restored to my father.
               "As I look back, now, I am amazed at the cunning, the ingenuity, the subtle skill, with which he moulded my nature to his own purposes. He was a master of diplomacy. And his skill was most complete in filling me with suggestions and plans that appeared to spring up alone in my own mind. How it was I cannot exactly tell, but certainly he either instilled it under some subtle cover, or merely prepared my mind for the suggestion to come from itself, but by some process I was led to propose to myself an escape from the thraldom of Mr. Arden; I was led to believe that my father's recognition of me was a duty that I should compel, and that, if I launched myself out upon the world, and sought for him earnestly, I would be sure to encounter him in some of the busy congregations of men.
               "The thought once in me, I brooded over it and fostered it, until it became an intense desire. Resolved at last, I only waited for a fitting time to consummate my plan. One day I resisted an arbitrary command of Mr. Arden, and, seizing upon the opportunity, I boldly declared my determination to submit to his authority no more.
               "Scarcely anything could have astounded my tutor more than my attitude upon this occasion. He turned white and red by turns, and at last, with lips quivering with concentrated passion, he required to know what my conduct meant.
               "'It means this, Mr. Arden,' said I, 'I am convinced that you are in possession of a secret vitally important to me—that you know who and what I am, and who my parents are—that this knowledge is withheld from me—that I am the victim of some dishonest plot—and that, unless I am admitted at once into a full knowledge of all that you know concerning me, I shall escape from your authority.'
               "'Boy, boy,' said Mr. Arden, still white with secret anger, 'you talk absurdly.'
               "'Mr. Arden, will you tell me who my father is?'
               "'I am not sure that you have one,' replied he.
               "'Will you, then, tell me who my family is? What, indeed, my name is, for I've never been called anything but Rodman?'
               "'These inquiries,' replied he, 'are made in an insubordinate spirit. For that reason I cannot answer them.'
               "'You have the power, then, but will not?'
               "'You are answered, sir,' was the stern reply; 'back to your duty. Whenever those who have a right to control you shall think it proper to reveal to you the history of your birth, then be prepared to learn. Until that time subdue your captious thoughts.'
               
               "'Mr. Arden,' said I, impetuously, 'five years ago, in this very room, I overheard one who had been a frequent, visiter here, call me his son.'
               "Mr. Arden fairly bounded from his seat, but I continued:
               "'Now, sir, will you tell who, and where my father is?'
               "'I have refused once already, boy,' said he; 'do not again propose the question, I command you. As for your discovery, it must have been made in a manner both guilty and mean, and I blush for you. To your apartment, sir, and evince no more of this unruly spirit.'
               "He rose up and came towards me, pointing to the door. I grasped my hands together, and looked at him steadily.
               "'Obey, sir,' said he sternly.
               "'Sir, I will not,' replied I very quietly.
               "He flushed, then paled, and appeared undecided.
               "'Mr. Arden,' resumed I, 'you must tell me what I have asked, or I will not obey you.'
               "He approached closer to me with a cane which be bad taken up, and raised it threateningly.
               "'Sir, sir,' said I, with great quickness, 'do not touch me. I could not bear it.'
               "He did not heed me, but demanded again if I would yield. I shook my head. Suddenly the cane fell swiftly, but I caught it in my hands, with desperate strength wrested it from him, and then, hurling it far off, rushed out and away from the house as rapidly as I could.
               "It was done. I was out in the world fairly alone now. What a terrible chilling, dread the thought sent, through me! And what might the consequences be? What if this step should for ever prevent my restoration to my father? Oh, better, better, I thought, to bear all, suffer all, than to lose this only hope of my life!
               "For hours I wandered about the forest, my brain a chaos; at one time plunged into, the deepest gloom, at another, full of exultation and sanguine hopes. At last, I wondered towards a neighboring town, from which a daily stage departed for the great city whose wonders I had often panted to see. The stage was drawn up before the office-door, and the passengers were stowing in it themselves and their baggage, with a great display of impatient haste and petty vexation.
               "I looked on moodily. A strong desire had seized me to go to New York but I had no money. This was the first moment that I felt the necessity of gold, and how truly powerless I was without it. And yet I felt that I must reach New York. There alone would I be safe from the pursuit of Mr. Arden. There alone could I hope to ferret out the mystery of my birth. The name of the lawyer, whom I had discovered to be the agent through whom the means of my support was received, was still remembered by my and he vaguely mingled in my designs for the future.
               "But still the question was, how to reach New York. Once there, I felt sure off finding some way of laboring for my support. As I stood musing, and trying to devise a plan by which to accomplish my purpose, Mr. Knowlton suddenly touched me upon the shoulder.
               "He was equipped for travelling, and had his carpet-bag in his band. He saluted me with his usual easy, off-hand grace, but I saw that he divined the cause of my presence there. It was strange how he got from me the whole story of my encounter with my tutor, even while I felt an internal dislike to speak of it. And when it was told, he said:
               "'Come, you want to escape the clutches of your amiable tutor. I am going to New York. I will take a seat for you, too. There is no place, Rodman, like a great city for a lad of spirit. Fine getting along there. Plenty of chances for money-making, or getting famous; and for pleasure, why it is glorious. And home-bred youths, you know, have ever homely wits.'
               "'But I have no money, sir,' said I, now all anxious to get to the metropolis.
               "'But I have, Rodman. Come, now, here's a gold eagle. Let us give a toss up for it. If its heads, now, you win; and if it isn't, why you'll owe me an eagle until you've got one to spare.'
               "So saying, he flung up the piece into the air, and when it fell, he caught it up, exclaiming—
               "'You are a gloriously-lucky fellow, Rodman, and have won. So now let us secure a seat for you, and then—hey, for New York.'
               "I yielded to him, unwillingly all the while, and in less than half an hour I was seated by his side on the coach-top, as we were whirled along towards New York.
               "But I am wearying you, Blanche, by the length of my story. I will try and be more brief.
               "Arrived in New York, I sought out the attorney I have spoken of, and succeeded in obtaining from him a little petty employment. But it was not long before my energy advanced me, and I was soon admitted as a regular student. I gave him another name—Robert Orthers. Knowlton knew me as Rodman Moore—but Rodman is the only name I have a claim to.
               "Behold me now established in a lawyer's office, filled with ambitious aspirations of fame—which I trusted might, in some way, be the means of fulfilling my treasured hope—and studying the books of the law with all the industry I could command.
               "I did not venture, however, to make any inquiries of my father directly to my employer. I was afraid that, if I did, I might be forced back to the hated authority of Mr. Arden. I hoped, however, of being able to trace out something of him without revealing myself.
               "Mr. Knowlton still continued to attach himself to me. He was in town even more gay, genial, and agreeable than in the country. He was eminently a citizen of the world. He was versed in all books, had travelled to all places, and knew all people. He had stores of anecdotes, piquant gossip, and had experienced an abundance of adventure. He could, therefore, when it suited his ends, be a delightful companion, and, however much a distrust of him at times would take possession of me, I was so solitary in the midst of the bustle, the clatter, the violent commotions of the great city, that his society often became a welcome relief.
               "One day, after a long talk, but in his usual dash-away manner, about the advantages and the charms society would have for me, he ended by saying that he had represented my peculiar position to a lady friend of his, of high rank in society, and that she had desired him to introduce me to her house. Reserved in disposition, and unused to society, I expressed my unwillingness to accept of the invitation; but Mr. Knowlton urged me so strenuously that at last I accepted.
               "Mrs. Carlton, at whose house, soon after this, I became a regular visitor, was a woman of exceeding beauty and intelligence; somewhat imposing in her manners, of a stately presence and a grand face. To me she was always tenderly attentive, devising schemes to interest and bring me forward, and manifesting always a deep sympathy with my forlorn and abandoned state. She was, I understood, a childless widow, rich, but unhappy over some misfortune, forgotten by all the world save herself alone.
               
               "One thing I observed, which I sometimes thought was strange. I never met any other visitor at the house except Knowlton. And he was for ever there. I believe that I invariably found him there when I entered, and left him there when I departed. He was always her confidant, her adviser, but what nearer relation I was puzzled to know.
               "Although Mrs. Carlton did not receive any visitors, yet she was a frequent guest—but always to grand balls or brilliant soirées. To these she several times requested and obtained my company. Although I enjoyed them to a fair degree, yet, they would have been distasteful to me but for one resolve. That was, to mingle into society, to frequent public assemblages, to be in and of the world, with the vague hope that upon some occasion the eyes of my father would light upon me from the midst of the multitude of faces that I encountered.
               "Yes, that hope of meeting him once again, still clung to me with much of its old power. I saw his face always before me as I saw it in my childhood, and wherever I was, walking the street, visiting the theatre, the salon, the church, my eye would canvass with restless anxiety, each brow and figure that passed before it.
               "So matters passed on for a year or two. I grew full of ambition, and began to pant for the time when I should be exalted in the world's regard, and bring to him, when we did come together, a full measure of fame and glory.
               "One day as I stood watching the outpouring of a vast crowd from a concert room, suddenly there blazed from its very midst, flashing upon me for an instant and then disappearing, a face that I could have sworn was my father's.
               "My heart bounded wildly, my brain turned, it was a moment or so before I could command or summon my senses, and then I dashed into the crowd with a passionate eagerness ness. In vain! In vain! False hope, false joy! I could not find him. I peered into every face with impatient anxiety, I rushed after every form that could possibly resemble his, but all, all in vain! Ah, how the old terrible despair sunk like a rock into my heart, and how I dragged myself away from that scene with bitter and unrestrained tears.
               "This event brought back, with all its old intensity, the passionate desire of my life. It overwhelmed me with the old sorrow, and plunged me into a gloom so great that it attracted the sympathy of the attorney in whose office I had found employment—a kind-hearted, eccentric man, who led me by kind persuasions to unfold to him my history. I was glad of the occasion to do so, for all my efforts to obtain the knowledge for whom he, acted as agent in transmitting to Mr. Arden the money for my support and tuition, had been abortive. He listened to my story with great interest. When I had concluded, with considerable excitement of manner, he declared that he would bring all his professional acumen to discover my parentage, and that in a little while he had no doubt but that he would have some good news. He considered me, he said, from that time forth, not his clerk but his client.
               "The next day after this conversation, it occurred to me that perhaps I could learn some traces of my father by a visit to Mr. Arden's. I started off without delay, full of sanguine hopes again, and arriving in the vicinity of my old home, I managed to obtain an interview with John, the gardener. To all my questions he insisted that no stranger such as I described had been to the house since my departure. He said, moreover, that he remembered very well the gentleman that I referred to as visiting there so often in my childhood, but for many years he had not seen him. He told me also that matters went on there much as they did formerly; that my runaway had caused, for a time, much excitement, but that after a few weeks Mr. Arden and the whole household had settled down to its accustomed dullness and repose.
               "Disappointed in this hope, wearied with my city pursuits, I determined, before returning to New York, to pass a week or two in rambling about, with the hope that new scenes would relieve the weight upon my heat. My wanderings brought me among the Highlands here, and to Captain Dartan's door. The glorious scenery of this locality pleased me, and actuated by a desire to indulge, for a time, in one of my boyhood's pleasures, solitary ramblings, I persuaded the good captain to receive me as a lodger.
               "What followed since, Blanche, you know full well. The unlooked for happiness that has here fallen to me, has bound me willingly a prisoner to this spot."
               When Rodman ceased speaking, Blanche, who had, with almost breathless interest, listened to his story, looked up to him, and placing her hand in his, she said, "Rodman, your story is one of the saddest I ever heard. My heart sympathizes with you. Alas, what suffering must have been the lot of one so strangely situated! And your father, too. What can be the mystery that separates you?"
               "Alas, we shall never know," was Rodman's reply.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               STRATAGEMS.
               "MISS WALDRON," said Captain Dartan to Amelia, one day, "now tell me, was there ever a couple better matched than Blanche Dearwood and Rodman Moore? Bless the hour, I say, when priest and ring make their two young hearts one."
               "Captain Dartan," said Amelia with great quickness, "I have been for some time observing the growing intimacy between Blanche and this young stranger, and I am afraid it is ripening into an affection."
               "Afraid, Miss Waldron, afraid! I tell you what it is, ma'am, I'm an old one, and I've seen nigh eighty years of human nature, and I don't think, except Rodman's grandfather, Rodman Willow—I'm certain now he must have been his grandfather—there ever was a truer-hearted fellow than Rodman Moore. No cause to be afraid at all, ma'am—know him like a book."
               "Captain Dartan," responded Amelia, "I have many reasons for believing that this acquaintance will not meet with the approbation of my brother."
               "Colonel Waldron, ma'am? Beg your pardon, ma'am, but your brother's grandfather, of the glorious Revolution, to which, ma'am, I always lift my hat, knew Rodman Willow. So, ma'am, you'll excuse an old soldier, if he persists in thinking, that any of the blood of Rodman Willow will be right welcomed by the blood of Colonel Waldron."
               Amelia smiled, but she resumed:
               "Still, Captain Dartan, I am so apprehensive of the displeasure of my brother for permitting this close intimacy to exist, that I have long been thinking of requesting your aid in arranging some plan whereby they would be thrown less together."
               The old soldier shook his head ruefully, and declared that such a thing would break the hearts of the poor children.
               "But," said Amelia, "my brother, even if he should feel disposed to admit the superior merits of Mr. Moore, will, I am sure, feel the necessity of preventing anything like a pledged affection between them, when both are so young, and know their own hearts and the world so little."
               "There, Miss Amelia, you show some of the true Waldron wisdom. What you say is very like."
               "And moreover, my brother's well-considered and favorite plans for the education of Miss Dearwood, would, if such a thing should come to pass, be rendered nugatory. He will feel it, therefore, to be a matter of duty, to keep Blanche's mind free, and devoted exclusively to her studies."
               "The Waldron wisdom again!" replied; the old soldier, with every deference.
               "So, my dear Captain, until the return of my brother, we must endeavor to restrain their intimacy, and prevent, if possible, any interchange of affection between them. And I would wish to accomplish this without revealing our suspicions or purposes. I might, it is true, simply request Blanche to seclude herself from the company of young Moore, and she is so gentle and yielding that my desire would be obeyed scrupulously; but I cannot do this without paining her young heart. Besides, such a step might defeat our very aim. Unconscious as she may be now of any affection for her companion, once excluded from his society, the desire for it might become so excited, as to lead her to suspect the actual state of her own feelings towards him."
               "Old Colonel Waldron himself, ma'am, might have suggested the wisdom of that. The Waldrons always were wise, always."
               "Now, Captain Dartan," resumed Amelia, "you are a man of wide experience. You have been a soldier. You have been versed in all kinds of stratagems. For my poor part, this is the first plot I ever schemed. Can you, sir, propose anything whereby we may accomplish our end?"
               The old soldier, quite exalted by the importance of the matter assigned him, rose up and began to walk the floor, frowning in an important manner all the while, and rubbing his knobbed head vigorously. Suddenly he stopped, and, with a manner solemnly grave, he asked:
               "Do you know, ma'am, the Soldier's Manual?"
               "I cannot say that I have ever seen it."
               "A wonderful book, ma'am. Full of plots, and tricks and strategies, and warlike manœuverings, and so like. Shouldn't wonder, ma'am, if we should find in it the very thing. I'll drive right over home, and get my copy."
               "It's hardly necessary," replied Amelia, with difficulty suppressing a laugh; "I am afraid that the stratagems there set forth would be too warlike for our purpose."
               "Likely, ma'am, likely." And the Captain resumed his walk, frowning darker, and rubbing his head more vigorously than ever. Presently he stopped again.
               "Suppose, ma'am, I should take Rodman Moore aside, and tell hint privately the whole gist of the matter, and ask him, as a gentleman, to take his walks a little farther to the North."
               "I am afraid, my dear sir," replied Amelia, "that that could hardly be called a stratagem."
               "Right again," said the Captain emphatically. Then, after a pause, he resumed, "I'll tell you what, ma'am; I'll just take an hour or two to turn this matter over, and brush my memory up about some of our old strategies in the Revolution—great strategies they were too, ma'am—and, never fear, but I'll hit upon the very plan. We'll circumvent the enemy, be sure of that, ma'am."
               Taking his pipe, refilling it, and then drawing a chair to a choice spot under the old willow, the old man seated himself, and fell to thinking with all the closeness that he could command.
               Meanwhile, Amelia opened her writing-desk, and began a letter to her absent brother. She had already written to him, describing matters as they stood, and had received an answer from him full of anxiety about Blanche, and urging upon his sister to terminate, but without harsh measures, the companionship of Rodman and Blanche. The letter also stated the probability of the writer's return within a short time, and expressed much concern that so long a period of absence had broken into his plans in regard to his ward.
               The letter that Amelia was now engaged in writing to him, was merely descriptive of the progress of matters since her last, excepting where it urged strenuously his immediate return to the Clove.
               Amelia, as it has been before hinted, no doubt surmising the passion Blanche had inspired in her brother, had watched with painful anxiety the growing friendship between Blanche and the young stranger. Although feeling but too sensibly that her brother was only preparing for himself much sorrow and suffering, yet she could not, without pain, perceive his hoped-for happiness endangered by this new comer.
               "I might," she thought, "at once refuse my permission for him to visit Blanche again. But, after the service he rendered her in the storm, I was so pleased with his open, pleasing, honest-seeming manners, that I, unwisely as it seems, requested his society, and even urged him to consider himself our established guest. After that, I could not persuade myself to forbid him the freedom of the house. There is still a charm about his manner that influences me greatly, and if my brother's happiness were not at stake, and we knew more of his real character, I know no one I've ever seen who would please me better as Blanche's destined husband. Poor girl. I wonder, indeed, if her heart has yielded up all its precious wealth of love to him. I have watched her closely, and I am inclined to think that if she has felt a love for him, she has not owned it to her own heart yet."
               Amelia, who was thus musing with the unfinished letter to her brother before her, was interrupted in her reverie by the loud voice of Captain Dartan, as he came along the hall. Entering the room where she was seated, he exclaimed:
               "I think I've hit upon the plan, Miss Amelia. What do you say to it, now? What if I should just attach myself to Rodman, valet-like, you know, make excuses, you see, for following him about, coax him to take sails, rides, and walks with me, and so keep him out of the dear girl's company?"
               "An admirable plan, dear Captain Dartan," said Amelia, smiling, "but I am afraid that you are not quite young enough to act as Rodman's valet."
               
               "Bless me, I am as spry as at forty. I always was actyve in the legs, you know." And the good, simple hearted old soldier began to show how youthful he was in his limbs, by trying to cut a "pigeon wing." After two unsuccessful attempts, he tottered off to a seat, quite exhausted.
               "Never mind, ma'am," said he; "there's a better way to keep the young people apart, or, leastwise, to keep them from billing and cooing."
               "How, captain?"
               "I'll tell 'em some of my stories. That will do it, never fear."
               "You are a skillful commander, captain, and have many resources," said Amelia. "I feel quite secure in entrusting my purpose in your hands, your energy and ingenuity are both so great."
               The old captain, who at first had been so anxious to bring Rodman and Blanche together, now learning that their friendship was in opposition to the wishes of Mr. Waldron, whom he looked up to with perfect respect and reverence, was as anxious to separate them. Proud, too, of the aid that Amelia required at his hands, he taxed all his cunning and all his ingenuity (of the quality of which, the reader has seen some specimens), to accomplish this end.
               The very night after his conversation with Amelia, he had an opportunity to bring out some of his tactics.
               It was a very warm evening. Blanche and Rodman had seated themselves upon the verandah, where a pleasant breeze from the river could fan their cheeks. Their position, at the same time, commanded a view of the sun-set sky, richly golden and purple, and casting a blushing glow upon the glassy river.
               Captain Dartan observed them, and said aside to Amelia:
               "There they are, now, Miss Amelia, as happy as two doves. But there shan't be any love-making between them, I promise you. You'll see, ma'am, how an old soldier can manœuvre."
               So saying, the good Captain walked directly towards them, took a chair by their side, lighted his pipe, and began to smoke away with vast industry. Rodman felt excessively annoyed at this intrusion, for the Captain had interrupted a very agreeable tête-à-tête, but he had too much respect for the old soldier to evince his annoyance. After puffing away for awhile, making one or two passing comments on the warmth of the evening, the Captain at last took out his pipe and said:
               "I've been thinking since I've been sitting here, young people, of Sally Clare."
               "Of Sally Clare?" said Blanche, interrogatively.
               "Ah, she was a glorious girl. And her fate so sad, too. I shall never forget Sally Clare."
               "Who was she, sir?"
               "A girl of the old times; a heroine of our glorious Revolution. Ah, it's a sweet story."
               Blanche, who knew very well what the old man desired, instantly said:
               "Do tell us the story, Captain Dartan."
               "That I will, my lass."
               And without further ado, the veteran commenced his story, which the reader may skip or not, inasmuch as it is given in a separate chapter.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIII.
               THE OLD SOLDIER'S STORY.
               "YOUR grandfather, Rodman"——
               "My grandfather!" exclaimed Rodman, in great surprise.
               "To be sure, lad," replied the captain; "I don't know how it was, but I'm every bit as sure that Rodman Willow was your grandfather, as if he was here to say so this very minute. You are just like him, lad. I haven't quite made it out, but I'm sure, very sure."
               "But"——exclaimed Rodman.
               "Let him believe so, if he will," whispered Blanche in her companion's ear.
               "Well," resumed the old man, "when, my lad, your grandfather, Rodman Willow, and I set out together on that fine day in June, of the year 1777, to join the great and the good Washington, to help fight the battles of our blessed country, I was a boy, merely, only sixteen years of age. But I was a tall, strong, likely boy, and I was filled to the full with the spirit of liberty, and hatred of the Britishers. So you see I strapped up my little wardrobe, slung it on a stick over my shoulder, and walked forth by the side of my friend and senior, Rodman Willow.
               "I won't stop to tell you all the adventures we encountered on our journey, and what a long, dangerous expedition tion it was, made entirely on foot, from our Hudson homes to where Washington's armies were encamped, near Philadelphia. I won't tell you, either, about our joining the army, nor about the drillings them French generals exercised us in, nor about the many skirmishes we had. I am going to come right at once to the first regular pitched battle Rodman Willow and I were engaged in, and that was the battle of Germantown.
               "I don't know much about Washington's and Howe's manœuvres, as they tell about in the histories, but what I saw I know. Colonel Waldron—a glory for ever rest upon his name—commanded a company of dragoons, and he had obtained the admission of Rodman and myself into his command. We had been stationed upon the brow of a little hill, with our right flank resting against a wood. The morning was very foggy, and so dense was the mist that it enveloped us as if we were in a cloud. We could scarcely see our neighbors' horses; and the fog sent such a damp chill through us that some of us were shivering continually with the cold. Besides, it was rather awful, somehow, to be standing there stock still, never doing a thing, nor seeing a thing, but hearing all the while the musketry and the cannon booming away like everything, and sometimes feeling one's self covered with dust and dirt as some cannon-ball came tearing through our ranks.
               "There was a good deal of galloping to and fro all this while, and orders and messages passing from General Washington to our brave colonel, when just as the fog seemed to settle down thicker 'an ever, the word passed along for the charge. I don't know much how other people feel in their first battle, but I confess, right up and down, that there were a fluttering in my heart, and a gasping like in my throat, when we all moved off together on a slow trot. I wouldn't have felt so bad, I don't think, if could have but caught just one glimpse of where on earth we were going to. But our trot soon grew faster, and in a moment more we were galloping down the long but slight descent, when all of a sudden up went the fog like a curtain, and there, blessed heaven! right before us, with their bayonets a-glistening in the sun that were breaking through the mist, a solid, frowning, terrible mass of steel barring of our way! I tell you my heart did give one mighty leap up into my throat, and I say so, too, without feeling much ashamed, for I believe it was every bit natural.
               "'Charge! Upon 'em!' shouted out our colonel, and somehow these words inspired me, and sent a thrill through my blood. Our horses, too, seemed to feel the effect of those words, and they sprang forward furious, I tell you. Them Britishers must have been made of stern stuff, to see us come thunderin' along, the ground a-shaking under us, our sabres a whirling above our heads, and we all the time shouting like fury; and yet never move an inch, but, with bayonets fixed, wait for our coming.
               "Suddenly that whole glittering mass of steel were lit up by a blaze that ran along its entire length, with a blinding flash, and then there poured out of it such a volley of cold lead, that in an instant full one half of our regiment sank down into the ground, and the rest of us recoiled, and were hurled back from that steel wall. I shall always remember that moment, and it fairly seems to me now as if it all took place but yesterday, it is so clear and plain like. There were wounded, frightened horses, without any riders galloping about, and some flying wild, with their master, dragging under them by the heels. And then all the ground were thick—thick with writhing, bleeding bodies. I did not take me more than a second to see all this, and I hadn't more time either to take for looking about, for there were Colonel Waldron a-dashing about amongst us, with his hair all flying, his eyes fairly blazing, and shouting to us to form and charge upon the enemy once more.
               "The sight of our glorious Colonel sent all the fear out of my body quick. I felt just then somehow such a tingling and rushing in my veins, and, my heart beat with such a bounding, that I shouted out with all my might the cheering words of the Colonel, whose enthusiasm and example were fast gathering together our bescattered ranks. It wasn't long before we had formed and were dashing again upon the enemy, following the waving sword of Colonel Waldron. For me, I never had felt before such a wild and real delightful thrill as then ran through my breast, when I shook my sabre, and spurred my horse with all my might. On we charged, shouting; and, never heeding the now feeble fire the enemy saluted us with, we dashed upon them so fierce and impetuous, that in an instant we broke clean through their ranks, and scattered them, or trampled them, down before us. Just as we were in the midst of our victory, and shouting gladly, a sudden, sharp pain ran through my body, my head grew dizzy, the sky, so blue, and the earth, so red, were oddly mingled, and then a stunning oblivion settled down upon me, and all was like death.
               "I can't remember what followed after that, though, when I came to my senses, I could remember that, during all the length of my swoon, I were still conscious, dully though, of a pain, or ringing in my head. I must have been just sensible enough to feel this pain, for when I came to, I found myself lying with my head upon my hand. The first thing that I felt of returning consciousness was a gleam now and then darting through the darkness that was all about, and then a feeling of numbness, with a confused ringing in my ears, and at last my consciousness returned. My eyes opened upon the moon a-shining so calmly above, with flecky clouds floating about, and the stars were twinkling so bright as they always had, but all were so sweetly and beautifully still, I couldn't tell first where I were. I tried to think how I came in that spot, and it was hard work indeed to recollect it all, my head, somehow, was so poorly. I attempted to rise, but my head grew dizzy, a pain shot through my limbs, and I fell back upon the ground. I then remembered all about it—about the battle, and the charge, and being wounded. I tried once more to rise, for a fear were taking possession of me, and that was, that I were left there to die; and, with difficulty, I managed to get up on one elbow. What a strange and terrible picture presented itself! I wondered fairly to see the blessed moonlight resting so sweetly upon its horrors. There were dead bodies lying thick all about, stark, stiff, and silent; liquid pools, that looked like blood, glistened in the silver light of the moon; dismounted cannon and broken carriages lay mingled with carcasses of war-horses; broken swords, discarded muskets, and gayish trappings lay on every side; but over them all brooded such an air of silence—the dark, stiff figures seemed so terrifying, the sweet moonlight falling upon every object so strangely, making more white faces that were already ghastly—that a feeling of such awe came stealing over me as I never had felt before.
               "I were lying in the shadow cast by a dense forest, and at first could scarcely see the objects right around me; but when I attempted to rise, I found my limbs bound to the earth by a human body, and, on stretching out my hand, it rested on the cold brow of a death-stricken soldier, who was lying by my side. I shrunk from the touch with horror, and then shouted aloud with all the little strength I had; but there was no answer to my cry. That same awful silence rested upon everything, and, more than anything else, made a coldish shudder creep over my heart. I began to feel that I were doomed to die there, all alone, among those white, stiff forms around, and this thought made my heart sink lower and lower in downright despair. By-and-by I grew a bit desperate, and all of a sudden hearing what sounded like a distant murmur of voices, and trying hard to get up again on my elbow, I saw as I did so, a group of people a-hurrying across the field, but a long way off from me. I hallooed when I saw them, with all my might and strength, but they didn't seem to hear me, and hurried on, just as if my voice was a ghost's, and they were running from it. Indeed, I think it some likely they did think it a supernatural voice, and I don't much wonder either, for on that night I were myself as much afraid of ghosts as if I really believed in them. But when I saw them hurrying on so fast, the thought of being left there to die seemed so real horrible, that I grew desperate like, and hallooed to 'em with all the loudness that I could. Finding they still did not hear, I gave one shrill, stunning yell, and then dropped down, faintin'.
               "When I came to from this faintin' fit, I found myself in a large garret, lying upon a pile of straw, and with me another wounded man, who had managed some way to drag himself over to a window, where he might lie and feel the sweet air of heaven. When I had looked round a bit, I called out to the stranger, and said:
               "'Sir, be we fellow prisoners, or only fellow patients?'
               "He looked round and said. with a pleasant smile, and a right noble manner:
               
               "Both, I b'lieve, sir. But, really, I'm glad to see you restored to your senses again. How does your head feel?'
               "I put up my hand and found my head bandaged up, and looking down, there were my right leg bandaged too. Just at this moment in there entered a pretty young lass, almost as beautiful as you are, Blanche, and with such a sweet smile! She spoke in a tender, soft voice, and set my bandages right, and asked me if my head were feverish, and if there were anything she could bring to make us comfortabler. And then she bustled about, and put things right, and answered all our questions in such a modest, pretty way, that my fellow sick one and I were really delighted.
               "My story is getting longer than I expected, so I must be briefer and shorter.
               "That young girl, that I described, were Sally Clare. Her father and some of his work people had found both me and my companion upon the battle-field, and brought us home, although he were out and out a tory. He couldn't bear to see us die upon the field, although it were his intention, when we got better, to take us prisoners to the Britishers. All this is what Sally told us, and more 'an once I saw the tears roll down her sweet, pretty cheek, when she would say how sorry she was father would insist in giving us up to the enemy.
               "My companion were Lieutenant Allstone, and he were a trump, that's a fact! He were always in good spirits, always. He were always laughing or smiling, and made himself and others so happy. I soon began to see that he and Sally took to each other. And that were no wonder, for Sally was a golden lass, and Allstone a perfect prince.
               "Meanwhile our wounds grew better, and we were allowed a daily walk before the house, but winter was now come on, and our sickly bodies couldn't stand the cold air over and above well. At last we had got so smart that Sally came to us, one day, her eyes red, and her cheek pale, to tell us, that her father intended to deliver us up to the first body of Britishers that came by.
               "'And I am afraid,' said she, 'that they will take you on to New York, and confine you in those frightful prison-ships, where the poor prisoners die every day from starvation and impure air. Oh, I have heard such sickening and terrible stories about them ships!'
               "We were a good deal alarmed ourselves at this information. We couldn't bear the idea of falling into the hands of the enemy.
               "'What shall we do?' said I.
               "'Is there no possible way of escaping?' said Allstone.
               "'I think,' replied Sally, 'that I might manage to get you out of the house, but you don't know the country hereabouts, nor which way to go, to keep out of the hands of the enemy.'
               "'If we could find a friend who would be our guide,' said Allstone.
               "'Alas! I know of no one,' said Sally; and then, all of a sudden, she blushed; as red as yon sky were a few moments ago, and after a few minutes of what seemed a struggle with her feelings, she said: 'I think that I might conduct you safely to the American army. I know all the country as well as I know my primer.'
               "'You, Sally?' said both Allstone and I together.
               "'I know you think I'm a weak girl,' said she.
               "'But you would be detected. You would be punished as a traitor, and your reputation, too, would suffer.'
               "'I can aid you, if you will let me,' said she; and then, blushing red, she continued: 'I will disguise myself as a boy. Nobody would know me, and I can conduct you as well as any one to a place of safety.'
               "Poor Sally clung to her resolve, and wouldn't heed all we had to say. She said she could save us, and she would. So we had to give it up, and it was arranged that that night we would escape all together.
               "It were about midnight, when our door softly opened, and there stood Sally, dressed up like a boy, and even in the faint moonlight, that came through the window, we could see her blushing and shrinking like as if half ashamed. But she put her finger to her lips and beckoned us to follow her. We did so softly, and sliding on tip-toe down stairs, we let ourselves out into the open air. There were a wood near, and toward it we walked rapidly, and were soon secure from notice.
               "For three nights we travelled guided by Sally, and during daylight we would lie close under cover. On the third night, just as daylight began to break, and we were looking about for a secure place to hide, all of a sudden, two Hessian soldiers sprang from behind a clump of cedars and called out for us to surrender.
               "'Fly, fly,' cried out Sally.
               "'No,' said Allstone, 'let us conquer the fellows. Villains, surrender!' saying which, he rushed upon them so quick, that before they could fire, he had caught the musket of one fellow by the muzzle.
               "'Ralph, into the other,' shouted he.
               "I made a rush for the other one just as he let fire, missing his aim, however, and grabbing his musket—I were a strong youngster then—I wrenched it from him and knocked him over the poll. Meantime, Allstone were having a desperate fight with his antagonist, who was a strapping big Hessian, and as ugly as sin. I thought I would rush in and help my friend, when the Hessian, Satan I ought to call him, stepped back a little, and drawing a pistol fired it at Allstone. The fellow missed his aim, but the report of the pistol had hardly ceased when I heard a frightful scream. Looking around, there were Sally staggering backward, as white as snow, and a great shower of blood a flowing out of her breast. I ran up to catch her, and Allstone, who saw her as well as I, with a fierce-like yell, made a rush at the devilish German with his sword, which, during his captivity, had never been taken away, and sent in his blows so furious and desperate like, that he beat down the fellow's guard, and struck him dead before him.
               "Meanwhile, I held Sally, trying to stop the blood from running. She had fainted away entire. When Allstone came up to her and saw her lying so like dead in my arms, he dropped down on his knees and cried, and beat his brow, and writhed in pain like. I told you before that they took to each other, and I really believe they had agreed to love each other. When I saw Allstone so overcome, I fairly cried too, and in truth my heart ain't often ached more than it did on that day.
               "All we could do wern't of any use. We tried to bind up the wound, but it were only too clear, Sally were dying. She grew paler and paler, and her breath came shorter and shorter.
               "'Oh, Sally,' said Allstone, 'do not die. Dear Sally, live to love us all.'
               "'I am dying, dear Edwin,' said she, 'don't cry, don't feel so very sorry. I'm going to blessed Heaven, where my dear mother has gone already.'
               "'Don't say so, Sally, don't say so!' sobbed out Edwin.
               "'Tell father it were all my doing. Tell him not to blame you. Tell him that I died blessing him, and you, and all.'
               
               "Oh, it were a pitiful sight to see that sweet girl a-dying there, and her lover pouring his tears like rain upon her brow. I never can think of that time, although it were sixty years ago, without feeling my old eyes grow full of water.
               "'I thought,' said she, 'that Heaven would let us, Edwin, love, and live happily for many years. Ah, my heart were full of bliss. It weren't to be. Good bye, dear Edwin. Kiss me, Edwin.'
               "Allstone stooped down and pressed his lips to hers long and fervently, and as he rose up again, a shadow like flitted over her face, her beautiful limbs stretched out, and then Allstone fainted by her side almost as dead as she.
               "We bore her back to her father's home. Ah, it were a sad, sad procession. Her father upbraided us with curses, until he knew how she had loved Allstone, and then he somehow looked upon us more friendly.
               "I shall never forget the time when we put her in the ground. It were a very snowy day. The ground were covered thick with the white snow, and so were every tree and branch, and twig, and bush. Everything were white, and so hushed, and perfectly still, as if Nature were paying solemn respect to her.
               "It were a solemn scene indeed, when we all stood in the little churchyard, the snow falling fast and thick upon us, making white her grave and her coffin, and our muffled forms. Before the grave stood the old grey-haired minister, the snow a falling upon his bare head, and upon the book before him. Around, everything were so startling still. Our very breaths, as it were, terrified us by their sound. Soon the old minister's voice were raised, and that were the only sound you could hear until they began to let her body down, and then Allstone and I sobbed out like children."
               The old man stopped, and then his auditors drew long breaths. Blanche turned her head aside to wipe away a tear, and Rodman coughed and choked as if he too was feeling some emotion at the story.
               "Dear Captain Dartan," said Blanche, "we thank you for your sad but beautiful story."
               The old man now got up and said that it was late, and he must hurry his departure for home. Rodman proposed to ride over with him.
               "You will have a pleasant moon-light drive," said Blanche.
               The Captain bustled about making his few preparations, and a servant brought his little pony chaise up to the door. These few minutes sufficed for Rodman and Blanche to take a brief turn in the garden, and exchange their parting words.
               Just as the Captain stood by his chaise preparing to enter, Amelia came up to him, and laying her hand upon his arm, pointed towards the garden, and said:
               "I am afraid, my dear sir, that your story-making will hardly accomplish our aim."
               The captain looked in the direction Amelia pointed, and there were Rodman and Blanche standing out in the clear moonlight, Rodman holding Blanche by the hand, and Blanche plucking rose after rose from a bush by her side, and scattering the leaves thick about her feet.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIV.
               A DISCOVERY.
               THE day after Captain Dartan's unsuccessful and somewhat novel attempt at generalship, the morning mail brought to Amelia a letter from Mr. Waldron, announcing his intention of returning that very day. Amelia, quite relieved by the news, showed the letter to Blanche, who expressed at once her great delight, and earnestly declared that she hoped her guardian would never have occasion to leave them again.
               Amelia was a little puzzled at the undoubted sincerity of this remark. Could Blanche, then, indeed, have felt any interest in Rodman Moore? Scarcely, if the return of her guardian, which would at once intercept the acquaintance of the young couple, could give her so much pleasure.
               About noon Rodman came riding over on horseback, and had scarcely saluted the ladies, when along came the Captain's little chaise, the old veteran considerably, excited, and rather overcome with heat. But when he saw Rodman, he gave a triumphant look at Amelia, and seated himself directly by the side of the young man. Rodman, a good deal surprised, and somewhat annoyed, shifted his position to one nearer Blanche. The Captain, perceiving this, caught up his chair, and, crowding between them, seated himself, back to Rodman and face to Blanche, and began very minutely to examine a piece of sewing Blanche was engaged upon. Still more surprised, Rodman now walked around to the other side; but the Captain, observing this, caught hold of Blanche's arm, and exclaimed—
               "Come, my dear Miss Blanche, I've got something to show you," at the same time dragging her bodily away.
               "That was a bold manœuvre, and capital, were'nt it?" said he, sometime afterwards, to Amelia.
               But, notwithstanding all the Captain's watchfulness, Blanche and Rodman managed to have an hour's walk upon the river's side, uninterrupted. The cause of the old soldier's vigilance failing him was this. It was his custom to take an afternoon nap. Upon this day he had resolved to omit doing so; but somehow, finding himself at the accustomed hour seated in an ample arm-chair, underneath the old willow, with a pleasant air blowing into his face, he presently fell into a dreamy mood, and at last dropped into deep slumber.
               "I do not know," said Rodman to Blanche, as they sauntered off together, "what is the matter with our good Captain; but he is grown strangely intrusive."
               "Mr. Waldron comes home to-day," said Blanche, without noticing Rodman's remark.
               "To-day," said Rodman. "I wish that I could feel otherwise; but I dread Mr. Waldron's return."
               "Dread his return?" inquired Blanche.
               "Ah, Blanche! think how informal my acquaintance with you is. How can I hope to find the same generous trustfulness in a man of the world that I have found in your simple and unsuspecting nature?"
               "Mr. Waldron is all tenderness and generosity," replied Blanche.
               "Still," urged Rodman, "I feel that this may be the last time we shall ever walk together, ever talk together. Tonight, I'm afraid, our paths will separate."
               "Absolutely," replied Blanche, with forced merriment, "you talk as if my guardian were an ogre, whose very sight would frighten you away."
               "Even if it were not as I apprehend, and Mr. Waldron should receive me with open arms, I have been too long an idler already. These days of sweet quiet and exquisite happiness must cease. I must go out into the world, fling myself into its noisy, contentious current, and struggle or sink amid its eddies."
               "Sad and melancholy this morning, I see. Will nothing that I can say cheer you up?"
               "Ah, Blanche! I cannot bear to leave this place. It seems to me that my life should exist here, serenely and calmly, mirroring, like a lake, these glories of mountain, wood, and sky."
               "Would not that be an inglorious ease?"
               "Inglorious! You are ambitious, Blanche."
               "Not for myself."
               "Then do not be so for others. Ah, Blanche! it is the saddest thing that can befall the human heart. For me, I wish here that I could abjure the world. I do not ask for higher happiness than might be afforded me, daily breathing this air, rambling amid these hills, floating on these waters, looking up to yonder sky, if there might be near me one sympathetic mind."
               "You are dreaming poetry now, Rodman."
               "And why not? And why is it not possible to act poetry in this world of ours as well as dream it?"
               "Romance! Romance!"
               "If I am romantic, Blanche, the poetry that I dream of is the poetry of common things. There is such a quality pervading everywhere, floating about the most ordinary relations, breathing in the simplest things, if we can only find it out. You laugh at me, Blanche, who have the keenest sense of the Beautiful, and whose mind is all softly glowing with poetry. How quick you are, I have observed it many times, to see a beauty or a grace. The effect of a shadow upon the water, of a ray of sunlight thrown across a dark forest vista, of a play of light and shade amid the forest foliage, of contrasted colors in a group of trees—any of these things your fine artistic sense perceives at once. Why this is poetry itself."
               "I confess to an earnest love for the Beautiful," said Blanche, "but I do not feel myself to possess a more than ordinary sense of its existence."
               "You do, Blanche, you do. And it is a glorious gift. And not only beauty, Blanche, but it is your happy power to be always enabled to see some good and some pleasure in whatever lies before you. The simplest things have a grace to you, and you also invest the merest trifles with a grace. You have no common-places. There is nothing to be done that you cannot do admirably. You never speak a word, however simple, that has not a music and a charm of its own."
               "Mr. Moore, I never knew you to be complimentary before," replied Blanche, almost in an offended manner.
               "Not complimentary, Blanche. That is a fashionable word."
               "I certainly must call them compliments, Rodman; and I am very sorry that you should have spoken them. They were unlike your usual frank and truthful manner."
               "Believe me, I spoke them with every frankness and sincerity."
               "Rodman!"
               
               "Blanche, I love you!"
               He caught her hand in his as he spoke, and bent his eyes earnestly upon her. She turned away, and shaded her face with her bonnet.
               "I know full well, dear Miss Dearwood, how presumptuous I am, how unworthy I am, how sadly hopeless is my suit. To-morrow I must leave you, and our chance of meeting again is indeed uncertain. It would have been wiser for me to have gone my way, and buried my passion from every eye in the depths of my heart. A sudden impulse, however, sent the words to my lips, and revealed to you everything. Blanche, I do not ask of you any pledges in return. I do not dare to expect that you entertain towards me anything more than friendship, but out of the generosity of that friendship forgive me, Blanche, if I have pained you. Say but one word to me."
               Her hand only trembled in his, and her head sank down upon her breast.
               "Blanche, you love me?"
               No reply, still, but a trembling through her whole frame.
               "Ah!" said he, "this will be a sweet thought to bear with me. I never knew a gleam of happiness, dear Blanche, until you shed it upon me, and, since I first met you, I have experienced a blissful serenity and peace. Let me hope, Blanche, that, in some future time, I cannot say how long, but when I have won some right to boldly claim you—when I have proved how true and deep is all I here avow—when I have grown more worthy—when your heart can freely surrender itself to me—let me hope that when such a time arrives you will lift me up to your affection."
               "Rodman!" was the low reply.
               "Blanche, my beautiful Blanche!"
               She turned towards him with trembling earnestness.
               "Rodman, we are most unwise to think of these things. I confess"——
               "That you love me! Ah, Blanche, speak the word if it be in your heart, for you cannot conceive what happiness it would shed upon me!"
               "Ah! what do either of us know of love? And I, you know, am only a child."
               "What do we know of love? By heaven, it needs no philosophy to tell us what it is. And let me tell you, Blanche, that it is only youth that can experience it—others to the contrary, notwithstanding. Blanche, I see in your upward look, that you yield a return to my passion. My arm encircles you, and you do not rebuke me. Your face is turned from me again—but not angrily. You do not punish my presumption. Blanche! Blanche!"
               Her head was upon his breast, and her form, trembling violently, was in his arms.
               At this moment the noise of an approaching vehicle was heard. Blanche sprang from the embrace of Rodman, exclaiming:
               "It must be Mr. Waldron. Come, let us go to him."
               "No, Blanche, not now. You go before. I will follow soon."
               He chivalrously lifted her hand to his lips.
               "Ah, gallant knight!" exclaimed she, blushing and laughing; "but remember your promise, and come soon."
               "Do not doubt me."
               "But you hold my hand, still."
               "I want to hold it for ever."
               "Will you release me, sir, or must I cry out?" said Blanche, who was evidently assuming a vivacious manner to conceal her agitation and emotion.
               
               "By heaven, Blanche!" said Rodman, snatching her to his heart and imprinting a passionate kiss upon her lips, "I'll win you through everything."
               She broke from him, and in silence sped with rapid steps towards the house, before which the vehicle was already drawn up.
               Rodman looked after the retreating form of Blanche as long as it could be seen, and then he began to pace with rapid strides up and down the river-walk, yielding to delightful dreams and happy presages.
               "Now," thought he, "let me become a man full of earnest purposes. Let me throw off the old weight that was upon me, and let me go forth resolute to conquer a position worthy of Blanche. She does not permit my obscure, perhaps criminal birth, to come between her and her affection; but do not let me deceive myself with the hope that her friends will act a part equally noble and generous. I must accomplish something for myself that can, in their estimation, offset the reproach upon my birth. All beautiful and glorious Blanche, from this moment, every hope I have is linked with you! And oh! what happiness, what bliss will be mine the day I've won you!"
               This reverie was interrupted by the voice of old Captain Dartan, crying out:
               "Rodman Moore! Rodman Moore!"
               The old gentleman was standing a little way off, beckoning Rodman to him.
               "Colonel Waldron is arrived, my lad, Heaven bless him," said the veteran, as Rodman came up to him, "and, oh! it makes me sad to think how pale and melancholy like he looks."
               "Is Mr. Waldron indisposed?"
               "Sick, my lad, sick at the heart. But I have told him, lad, all about how a grandson of old Rodman Willow—he's heard me talk of Rodman Willow oftentimes—has been among us here since he were gone."
               "I'm sorry, sir, that you did that," replied Rodman, a little vexed.
               "Sorry! I should like to know now what better word could be spoken for you to Colonel Waldron; tell me that?"
               "But I am not the grandson of Rodman Willow, and what you have told Mr. Waldron will only put me in a false position before him."
               "Not the grandson of Rodman Willow. Young man, I know better. Didn't I know Rodman Willow? To be sure I did. And who ought to know better a grandson of Rodman Willow than old Captain Dartan? I should think nobody. You never knew Rodman Willow. What then do you know about it?"
               The old man was working himself into quite an excitement upon the subject, when Rodman good naturedly said:
               "Well, well, my dear sir, I'll be the grandson of Rodman Willow if you insist upon it. But, really, for private reasons, I am sorry that you let Mr. Waldron into the secret."
               "For private reasons," exclaimed the Captain, nudging Rodman in the side; "all right, my lad, all right. I didn't let a moment pass, but up and told the Colonel how you wanted to be little Blanche's sweetheart."
               "Captain Dartan!"
               "Oh! never fear. It will be all right. You thought I weren't friendly to the match, 'cause to please Miss Amelia, I strategized to keep you and Blanche apart. But I knew the Colonel wouldn't say a word the very moment I said—Grandson of Rodman Willow, sir! Rodman Willow with me and your grandfather at Germantown!—And he didn't say a word, not a word. Oh! I've made it all right for you."
               "Absolutely, Captain Dartan!" exclaimed Rodman, with considerable passion, but suddenly checking himself, he turned upon his heel and abruptly left the garrulous old man, in silence.
               Walking towards the house, Rodman could perceive, in the unusual bustle and animation, that the arrival of Mr. Waldron was affording much gratification to the whole household. But his own heart sunk 
                     forbodingly
                     forebodingly
                  . In what manner, he continually asked himself, would he be received by Blanche's guardian? With friendship, or with coldness? His future happiness was deeply involved in the solution of this question, and, therefore, he looked forward to their meeting with apprehension.
               Besides, there were other causes to fill his mind with gloom. Even if Mr. Waldron should approve of Blanche's friendship for him, it would be necessary for them to part. The days of rare and most exquisite happiness that he had passed with Blanche—days, full of delicious pleasure and perfect peace—must come to an end. He might, it is true from that time, bear with him the rapturous thought of love blessed and returned; but years of separation were perhaps, to ensue—years of struggling, labor, and sorrow. Entering the house, he took up a book, and seated himself by a window. There were voices issuing from an inner room, and among them was that of Blanche. He listened to its low music with pleasure, and he endeavored to catch the accents of the strange voice that sometimes addressed her.
               "Blanche and I have this sympathy," thought he, "we are both without parents. But Blanche has always been surrounded by love, while I have ever only dreamed of it. Blanche, though, is all love, it radiates from her in a sunny gleam, and it would have been impossible for her to have lived with any heart too cold for her to melt. Ah, golden, golden-blooded Blanche!"
               At this juncture the door communicating with the inner room opened, and Mr. Waldron came out, with Blanche by his side, her two hands clasping his arm.
               "Oh!" exclaimed Blanche, "here is Mr. Moore. My dear guardian, let me make you acquainted."
               Mr. Waldron paused abruptly in some light words he was speaking, and a cold look settled down on his face as he bowed stiffly. Then, turning to Blanche, he said:
               "Amelia, my dear ward, is keeping dinner for us. I will only give a moment's attention to my toilet, and then join you. I hope Mr. Moore will pardon me."
               Again bowing coldly to Rodman, he slowly left the room.
               As Blanche turned towards Rodman, after Mr. Waldron's withdrawal, she was alarmed and surprised to see him standing upright on the floor, one arm outstretched, his face of a deadly pallor, and his eyes glaring wildly in the direction in which Mr. Waldron had retired.
               "Rodman, Rodman!" exclaimed Blanche, turning pale herself, and running up to him; "Rodman, what is the matter?"
               Seeing him still standing, paralyzed and motionless, she seized his hand, and begged him to tell her the cause of his strange conduct.
               Suddenly starting from his stupor, Rodman caught her by each hand, exclaiming:
               "Who is that man?"
               "My guardian," replied Blanche, fairly terrified by Rodman's manner.
               
               "His name?"
               "Why, Rodman, you know it is Mr. Waldron."
               "No, no, not so. He is—"
               "What, what?" inquired Blanche, breathless, for a light was breaking upon her.
               "MY FATHER!"
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               RODMAN PARTS WITH BLANCHE.
               STUNNED and bewildered by an announcement the full import of which she could hardly grasp, Blanche staggered back, and would have fallen had not Rodman caught her in his arms. Hastily bearing her to a sofa, he paused for a moment to see if she were in danger of swooning, and then seizing his hat he rushed out into the open air, as if there only could he find relief for the whirl in his brain and the tumultuous emotions of his heart.
               When he was gone, Blanche hurried up to her own apartment, and, flinging herself into a chair, essayed to collect her confused thoughts; and to contemplate with calmness the extraordinary discovery so suddenly made. But it was a matter so involved in mystery, and opened so wide a field for surmise, it was associated with so many painful doubts, that her thoughts only became wild, incoherent, and bewildering.
               That Mr. Waldron, in whom she had ever placed a faith as perfect as that she reposed in Heaven, should suddenly be revealed to her in a light that, look upon it as she would, offered many dark surmises, was an event that filled her with overwhelming consternation.
               How was it that her guardian was a father, and such a thing never in the remotest manner to have been alluded to? Was, then, the old sorrow that so clung about him a remorse? What, indeed, was the mystery of his life, into which she had caught one glimpse so strange? Was the existence of a son a secret exclusively reposed in his own breast? Why, if there were no guilt, had that son been thrust away and concealed? Why had he been abandoned? Why was there no recognition by the parent at this sudden encounter of father and son?
               Blanche bewildered herself with innumerable questions of this kind; but her excited imagination could find no plausible solution to the mystery. But how could she meet her guardian hereafter? How encounter his eye? How render up to him her old faith and confidence with this overwhelming secret in her heart?
               It seemed to Blanche as if she had been standing looking at some scene of exquisite beauty, that had suddenly proved an illusion, vanishing into air, and leaving nothing but blankness behind.
               But there was one thought full of happiness, that would come upon her in the midst of all. Rodman was his son. Rodman, to whom she had given up all the wealth, and all the fondness, and all the depth of her young heart, was the offspring of one to whom she had yielded a devotion and reverence as profound as that of a child to a father. If, then, all the dark clouds that now lowered so gloomily, should be cleared, what unspeakable happiness would follow what a blissful contemplation—Rodman, her chosen husband, and Mr. Waldron indeed her father!
               In the midst of all these contending fears and hopes summons came for dinner. With a strong effort calming her agitated nerves, and trying to assume an undisturbed countenance, she descended to the dining-room, where Mr. Waldron and Amelia were waiting for her.
               "My dear ward," said Mr. Waldron, coming up to her with an alarmed look, "how very pale you are! You are not well!"
               "Believe me, sir, you are mistaken. I am quite well."
               "Doesn't Mr. Moore dine with us to-day?" inquired Amelia. Blanche saw, and with a beating heart, a sudden cloud overshadow Mr. Waldron's brow at the mention of Rodman's name. He grew silent, almost morose, and it I was some moments before he resumed the conversation.
               "Oh!" thought Blanche, "what a terrible thing it would be if the father shrinks from the son with an antipathy as deep as the love the son bears to the parent!"
               Blanche was very quiet during all the meal, and she was enabled to respond to Mr. Waldron's remarks with calmness and coolness only by a strong and resolute effort. Mr. Waldron, indeed, seemed to observe something strange in her manner, for he more than once inquired anxiously if she were well. When the meal was finished Mr. Waldron took her by the hand and said:
               "I am seriously afraid, my dear Blanche, that your health is impaired. Why are you so pale, and so quietly sad?"
               "You have forgotten, sir," replied Blanche, "how pale I naturally am."
               "Ah, Blanche! your cheek is a garden where the rose must bloom beside the lily."
               Leaving the room as soon as with propriety she could, Blanche hurried up once more to her own apartment. Seated by the window she remained buried in thought until darkness settled down, and over the forest hill-tops the crescent moon came slowly ascending. Diverted from her thoughts by its sweet and serene beauty, as it mounted up the heavens and poured down a gentle and soft flood of light upon the earth, she leaned from the window to look upon the river and the sloping highland sides silvering in its rays.
               
               Suddenly she saw a figure emerge from the shadow of tree on the lawn below and come out into the clear moor light. It was Rodman, who appeared to be motioning for her to come down to him. Glad of an opportunity for an interview with him, she flung a shawl upon her shoulders and descending the stairs, let herself out into the night air. Rodman was still standing out in the clear moonlight waiting for her appearance. When he saw her he retreated into shadow, and as soon as she came up to him, without a word he took her hand and led her a few yards further, to a bower in whose leafly retreat they had enjoyed many hours of happiness.
               When they entered the bower the moon was piercing the vine-trellissed sides, and falling in broken rays upon the floor. It was not so dark but that either could see the other's features with ease.
               Rodman placed Blanche in the little rustic seat with which the place was furnished, and, then silent as ever, began to pace up and down with rapid strides. At last Blanche spoke:
               "Rodman, why are you so silent? Let me hear you speak."
               "What shall I say? The wonder is that I have power to speak. Oh, Blanche! I've grown old since I saw you."
               In an instant Blanche was at his side, and her face raised in earnest sympathy to his.
               "He discards me, Blanche: he casts me off: he thrusts me from him, now when I have found him."
               His agitation became extreme.
               "I tell you, Blanche, that I have prayed, and longed, and waited for the hour when we should meet. No one can ever tell how much nor how deeply. The love I bore him was a passion. Now see what the issue is. I cannot bear it—cannot bear it."
               With passionate grief he pressed his hands upon his head; and wildly walked to and fro.
               "But, Rodman," said Blanche, throwing her arms around him and striving to calm him, "why do you say he casts you off?"
               "Did you not see the cold frown settle upon his brow? Our eyes no sooner met than his manner grew frozen. He saw me and shrank from me."
               "It is impossible! I cannot believe it! He could not have recognized you."
               "Why, then, his look of cold repugnance? He would have no cause to hate a mere stranger. Oh! it is only too plain. The passionate love I have ever borne him has never been returned. While I have panted and yearned with an earnest heart-sick longing to fling myself into his arms, he, at the same time, has been avoiding me, hating me."
               "But you have told me, Rodman, with what tenderness he used to caress you, when as a child you only knew him as a stranger."
               "A few kind words at yearly intervals! Any stranger could have been that much liberal. Besides, where every one else was especially harsh the slightest kindness appeared large to my boyish fancy. No, Blanche, no; I feel through and through my heart the sad truth. He does not love me. He never did. No thought of me ever conjured up one pleasant vision to his mind. No thought of me ever melted his heart with one touch of tenderness."
               "Rodman, I am sure you misjudge him. There is some error, some misconception, some distorted circumstance that is the cause of Mr. Waldron's conduct. My judgment is too poor and too weak to comprehend the subject. I cannot give advice; I do not know what is best to do. But, Rodman, if the instinct that I feel is right, it would say to you—Go at once to your father—confess everything to him. I cannot conceive how it would be possible for him to reject you. Take this course, Rodman, and most implicitly do I believe that he would fling his arms open wide to receive you."
               "I should be thrust from his door, Blanche! thrust, branded, and degraded."
               "Impossible! you do not know Mr. Waldron."
               Rodman stopped short in his impatient walk, and seized Blanche's hands, while his eyes glowed with a strange fire.
               "Do you know what I am, Blanche?"
               "Why Rodman, how wild you look."
               "Do you know what I am? No, I see you do not. You are too pure, too innocent. But I tell you he'd whip me from his presence."
               "What do you mean, Rodman? You terrify me with your fierce looks."
               "I'll tell you what I am."
               He was holding both her hands, while his brow was marked with swelling veins, and flushed to a crimson.
               "I'll tell you, but do not shrink from me. I could not bear it. If you should turn from me, Blanche, I'd fling myself headlong into the river there, this very night, and so end everything."
               "Rodman!"
               She was very pale, and trembling.
               "Answer me, Blanche, and tell me if men thrust their honest children into obscurity—if they conceal from the world their legitimate offspring—if they put away into hidden corners, under careful watch, those whom they could own with honor and lawfulness? Strange, I never thought of this before. But now I see it all. I am a stained, disgraced criminal—a creature of crime—a thing to shrink from and to avoid."
               "No, no, no!" muttered Blanche, shuddering.
               "Oh! I feared as much," passionately exclaimed he, starting from her side. But in an instant Blanche was at his feet, clasping his knees.
               "Hear me, Rodman. I shrunk not from you. I did not, indeed. I swear it. Rodman, Rodman, hear and believe me. I was thinking only of him—your father—my guardian, whom I have ever so loved and honored. It was his crime that filled me with horror. But you, Rodman—in you I see no stain—you are as good, as pure, and as noble to me as you ever were. Oh! dear Rodman, believe me."
               "I do, I do. Ah! Blanche, you are the only one that ever bestowed one thought of love upon me. But for this dream, I fling it from me. I tear out the old passion, so wild, so romantic, so extravagant. Ah! Blanche, you can never know what a love it was, nursed by solitude, and misery, and lonely imaginings. Now see what it all is. How many times I've pictured myself flinging down my life at his feet and so winning his love with my last gasp!"
               The young man buried his face in his hands, and wept.
               "And when, to-day," resumed he, "I stood listening to your guardian's voice as he approached, my heart was seized with an indescribable heaviness. And as he entered, and I saw that face, whose every lineament I had cherished so long, it blazed fairly into my brain like a flash of light, and held me spell-bound, speechless, overwhelmed. But, when our eyes met, and I saw that frown, that cold stare, that formal, freezing brow, Blanche, I hope that you may never feel a pang like the one I felt then."
               
               "Rodman, there is not a thought I have that is not pity for you."
               "My dearest Blanche. But I have one word more to say—one painful word."
               "I am afraid I know it."
               "It is farewell. To-morrow I depart. Into the world I fling myself, an earnest seeker after fame, position, rank. When I have won these things, and my strong purpose shall win them, then will I come to lay them at your feet—a worthy suitor, and one not ashamed to ask even for the boon of your love."
               "Ever a dreamer, Rodman. But may heaven give you strength and courage to do all you aim to do."
               "A dreamer! Alas I that is too true. I forget everything. I forget how the stain upon my birth builds up almost an insuperable obstacle to our love. I forget that in worldly judgments nothing that I can accomplish for myself can eradicate a stigma, stamped by another's hand. How do you think I should be answered when demanding your hand?—I—a bastard! What, even, would my honorable father say if I were to sue to him? Do I not see the indignation that would mount his cheek—the scorn that would reply to me!"
               "Do not let your passions master you, Rodman."
               "Blanche, I shall not yield tamely to my fate. I will confront it boldly, and conquer it. I will have respect and esteem—I shall command them. I defy the world. And you, Blanche—degraded, an outcast, criminal as I am—I still boldly ask for your love. I have a right (he added gloomily) to some blessings in this world. Tell me, Blanche, that you will ever love me through all—that your thoughts, your smiles, your prayers, will ever follow me to bless me, to make me strong."
               "My heart is yours, Rodman."
               "Ah! what a blessed thought. There is sweetness enough in those words to outweigh everything else."
               "Is this the last time we are to meet?" inquired Blanche.
               "To-morrow I leave for New York. We must say farewell, to-night.
               "Oh! Rodman, my heart will go with you. Our old haunts will, hereafter, have no pleasure for me. My daily life will be but one continual thought of you."
               "Blanche, my dearest, my loved, my all-beautiful Blanche, let our parting be one long embrace. Oh! I do not know how I can live without the sunlight of your presence. Farewell. Farewell."
               He caught her in his arms, pressed with passionate fervor her lips and her brow, and then, as if by one sudden effort to shorten the painful scene, he tore himself from her, and rushed out of the bower, and the last words that Blanche heard him speak, borne to her upon the night air, as he bounded away, were his broken utterings of "Farewell! Farewell!"
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVI.
               BLANCHE AND HER GUARDIAN.—PAIN AND DOUBT.
               BLANCHE scarcely slept during all that night after the departure of Rodman. Painful forebodings as to the future, and those torturing doubts and surmises that are peculiar to us when endeavoring to unravel or solve events of the past these filled the mind of Blanche with so many images, fancies, and doubts, that during the entire night she tossed about her couch, only enabled to snatch brief moments of slumber.
               She arose with the earliest morn, and walked out into the morning air with the hope that it might restore the bloom which a sleepless night had robbed from her cheek. But upon returning to her room just before the breakfast hour, the mirror revealed to her a pale and heavy countenance, She felt that this would excite embarrassing comments from her guardian upon her health; but the summons for breakfast had already been brought, and there was no help but to encounter then. She glided into the room quietly, and unobserved took her stand by the window. Here so many emotions filled her heart, so many agitating feelings sprung up at the prospect of encountering her guardian in so new and so strange a light from that he had ever appeared in before, that she felt the blood mount to her face and glow upon her cheek.
               "Blanche, we are waiting for you," she heard Mr. Waldron say.
               She took her seat at the table in a flurried and quick manner, and in her very anxiety to prevent any observation of her appearance, she drew all eyes upon her by an omission of her usual morning courtesies.
               "You are agitated, Blanche. You are not well," said her guardian, laying down his knife, and bending his gaze upon her with anxiety.
               "Your cheek looks feverish," remarked Amelia, with no less alarm.
               Blanche smiled, and pressed her fingers upon her temple.
               "My head is not quite well. That is all, I assure you. I have missed of late my accustomed rides, and that, perhaps, is the cause."
               Amelia shook her head; but Blanche, anxious to force the conversation into another channel, compelled herself to smile and to assume her usual vivacious manner. She talked, but with unnatural freedom, and started subjects with a rapidity and abandon that caused more than one look of surprise from her companions.
               But in the midst of the conversation in which Mr. Waldron had preserved a reserved silence, Amelia chanced to mention Rodman's name.
               "Who is this adventurer," exclaimed Mr. Waldron, with the same cold look that ever the name of Rodman was sure to conjure up; "who is this adventurer whom you have admitted, I must say unwisely, into such close friendship?"
               "Positively," replied Amelia, "I cannot tell. He was a lodger with good old Captain Dartan, and chance threw him in our way. His manner was pleasing, his breeding good, and as his acquaintance promised only to be a brief one, we did not think it necessary to make ourselves familiar with his history."
               "I am grieved," said Mr. Waldron with strange acrimony, "that you did not act with better judgment, sister. I certainly, cannot permit every travelling pleasure-seeker the privilege of our society, and I should have been better pleased if, during my absence, you had secluded yourselves from the intrusive visitations of any one with whom I was not acquainted."
               Blanche opened her eyes wide with surprise at these ungracious strictures from her guardian, so unworthy of him, and so unlike him.
               "Besides," resumed Mr. Waldron, "I cannot agree with you, that this city butterfly possesses any of those pleasing manners, or any of that good breeding with which you are pleased to endow him. I confess to have been greatly pre-possessed against him, in the brief opportunity I had to observe him."
               Amelia, with surprise and mortification, only looked down in her cup and sipped her coffee slowly, but Blanche was filled with pain, doubt, and even a little indignation.
               "And I must," continued the gentleman pertinaciously, clinging to the subject, and growing more bitter as he proceeded, "and I must request of you, Blanche, to signify to this gentleman your inability to continue further your acquaintance with him. I request of you to convey this information to him by note. I should prefer for you not to meet him again."
               With tears filling her eyes, Blanche stammered out that she believed Mr. Moore had already left for town.
               "I am very glad of it," was Mr. Waldron's stern reply. Unable longer to control her emotions, Blanche hastily left the room, and seeking the privacy of her own apartment ment, gave vent to the grief that so poignantly filled her bosom at the thought of her guardian's stern, unyielding repugnance to his son.
               The reader appreciates much better than Blanche did, the true motives that impelled Mr. Waldron to his repellant feelings for Rodman. The letter that Amelia had written to him, depicting the danger to which the affections of Blanche were exposed, by the attentions of a youthful and attractive stranger, filled Mr. Waldron with so many jealous fears, that he closed at once the business that was detaining him in town, and hastened with every speed back to the Clove. The desire, the love, the passion, for such it had grown to be, that his ward had implanted in his bosom, and which he held so sacred a thing that it was locked closely in his heart of hearts, he had never breathed to any human being, and indeed scarcely owned to himself. Not daring to hope, yet full of dreams that gave promise of hope, strongly striving to still the passion in his bosom, and wrestling with it with a purpose to its conquest, yet swayed and controlled by its power, he experienced all a lover's jealous pangs at anything that came between him and his light, and all a lover's despair at a rival's promised success.
               The sight, therefore, and the mention of Rodman Moore galled him. His name stirred an unwonted bitterness in his heart, and his praises grated jarringly upon his ear.
               Alas! we are mortals, full of weaknesses. Mr. Waldron, so wise, so true, so pure, so just, was mastered by a mean passion, and his fine sense of right impaired by the force of a coarse, petty jealousy. But do not let us degrade him in our esteem. He was human. He was weak. Perfect strength and entire greatness belong only to the angels.
               When Blanche left the breakfast-room as described, a long silence ensued between brother and sister, until it was broken by Amelia saying:
               "Gilbert, I respect too deeply your sorrows to intrude upon them, but I am afraid that your visit to town has not relieved them any."
               "No, Amelia, no," was the reply, "it was all vain. Hopes raised to be dashed. Joys promised, never to be fulfilled; old pangs, old wounds, old griefs stirred up from their depths afresh, and the gain only so much more of despair and hopelessness."
               "Alas, my poor brother!"
               "It is my fate to be for ever mocked by a revival of these old hopes. I can never know any peace of mind until all that has been is buried so deep in forgetfulness that nothing can animate it. I thought when we returned, weary wanderers, to this abode, that from that time forth no more shadows would fall upon us. I pictured to myself a life of so much serenity, peace and happiness, here in our ancestral home, and amid these scenes so consecrated by the old happy childhood time. I thought myself secure here beyond the reach of old sorrows. But it was a fatal mistake. I can never escape, not until the mould lies up piled upon my breast, the pursuing and relentless consequences of one reckless act."
               "Gilbert, you are too keenly alive to your misfortunes. You feel too closely, reason too nicely, and suffer mostly by the exquisite keenness of your sensibilities."
               "Ah! my sister," replied Mr. Waldron, shaking his head.
               A pause ensued in their conversation, during which Mr. Waldron paced up and down the room with his head upon his breast. Amelia broke the silence.
               "Gilbert," said she, "if I have any claim upon your confidence, what was the object that summoned you to town?"
               "An unexpected clue to my long lost son."
               "And that clue?"
               "Failed completely and strangely. Mr. Elwood employed in his office a law student, who, led by circumstances, revealed to him one day a history so remarkably similar in many particulars to the one he had heard of my poor boy, that he posted at once after me. But upon our arrival in town the boy had disappeared, by what means, or through what motive, we could not discover. Neither my untiring energy, nor Mr. Elwood's professional shrewdness, could gain any knowledge of him. We were baffled, and I have returned the more unhappy because of the hope that was raised and crushed."
               "Strange, strange," muttered Amelia, "but in every way a fatality surrounds us. Alas! what crime is it that we expiate?"
               Mr. Waldron did not answer, and after a few more turns up and down, he left the room.
               About an hour after this, as Blanche, unable to endure the painful solitude of her room, was following one of the winding-paths of the garden, she suddenly heard Mr. Waldron's voice calling out:
               "Blanche, come here."
               Turning in the direction whence the sound proceeded, she saw him standing at a little distance, on the outer edge of the garden, motioning for her to come to him. She obeyed.
               "I am glad," said he, when she came up to him, "to see that you are better than you were."
               "I am quite well, sir."
               "Well in body and in mind?" said he, inquiringly.
               "How can you think otherwise?"
               "There is a tear even now glistening upon your eye-lid. I can see very well that you have been weeping."
               
               Blanche blushed, grew embarrassed, and plucking some leaves from a bush near by, nervously tore them in her hand. Mr. Waldron watched her for a moment, and then dropped her hand which he had been holding.
               "I have no wish, Blanche, to intrude upon your thoughts," said he, after a brief pause, "but I had hoped for a perfect confidence between us. You have some grief that you will not reveal."
               Still she did not answer, but continued as before, nervously plucking at the shrubbery. Mr. Waldron could not but involuntarily connect her reserve of manner with Rodman Moore, whom he was more and more recognizing as a something that was coming between him and his happiness; and his brow grew darkly shadowed, and his lips compressed and stern.
               But, as if to escape from his own thoughts, and remove the embarrassing silence that had fallen upon them, he abruptly changed the subject.
               "I have been down, Blanche, to look at the site we selected for the fountain you designed. While in town, I placed the subject in a sculptor's hand, and if he but succeeds in the execution of your conception—if it prove as glorious and beautiful as your ideal—your fountain will become a great delight to us all."
               "You praise it too much, sir."
               "Not so. The artist himself praised the design highly."
               "I am glad of that, sir, if only for your sake."
               "But don't you desire to know when it will be finished?"
               "Most certainly."
               "But you do not inquire. You evince no interest. You are, indeed, indifferent every way. You ask me nothing about my visit to town."
               "No, sir."
               "I have brought you several matters of interest. Among them are volumes by Irving and Cooper."
               "I thank you, sir."
               "A score or so of new poems and new romances."
               Blanche bowed in reply.
               "Some rare exotics, too, in the way of house plants, and a few new varieties of garden flowers."
               Another inclination of the head for a reply.
               "Blanche!" suddenly exclaimed Mr. Waldron, with a slight degree of warmth.
               "Sir!"
               "You are very reserved and formal this morning."
               "Sir!"
               "You are not acting like yourself, Blanche. You do not evince as much pleasure in my society as you did before my long absence, and my return appears to give you more pain than pleasure."
               "Mr. Waldron!" exclaimed Blanche, in embarrassed agitation.
               "Mr. Waldron! a cold, formal title, a frozen manner, a grave face—Blanche, what is the meaning of all this?"
               Blanche's lip quivered, and her heart beat fast. Whatever might be the change in her own manner, she felt that there was a greater one in his.
               Presently he resumed, but with his usual calmness and quiet. "Blanche," said he, "I am jealous of those who love me. Anything of tenderness or affection withheld from me, which, through habit, I have become schooled to expect, is a pain, a vexation to me. But confess now, Blanche, that you are not, on this sweet September morn, standing here among these objects that we have together so many times admired and loved—confess that you are not full of that buoyant happiness, that bubbling joy, that genial sympathy which once would have gushed out from you when by my side."
               "Mr. Waldron, your words are painful."
               "Mr. Waldron!" echoed he, striding on a-head of her. But turning suddenly back he seized her hand.
               "This young stranger—this Moore—he is gone?"
               "Yes, sir."
               "You have not seen him since yesterday?"
               "No, sir."
               "You do not expect to meet him again?"
               "No, sir."
               "That is well. He is an adventurer, a rover, an unprincipled seeker after fortune, I am convinced."
               "Why, Mr. Waldron," spoke up Blanche, firmly, "what can you know of the character of Rodman Moore?"
               "I know nothing of him favorable, while his position and conduct are well calculated to arouse suspicion."
               "Is this, sir, a generous way of judging of him?"
               "Generous! pshaw! There are some things, Blanche, that we intuitively shrink from. We cannot see or understand the repelling vice in them, but we instinctively flee and avoid it. This young man filled me with repugnance and doubt, at the very first glance."
               "In the name of Heaven, Mr. Waldron," exclaimed Blanche, greatly shocked, as she remembered that these words were uttered by a father of his own son, "do not say this of him."
               "You defend him, Miss Blanche, with a great deal of warmth."
               "I—I—sir—!"
               "Yes, your cheek blushes, your eye fills, your bosom heaves. Blanche, he is a charlatan and a vagabond. My heart reads his through and through."
               "Do not, do not, sir, I implore you, think of him with such feelings."
               "It is madness for you to think of him with any feelings whatever."
               His manner was almost vehement, and his face grew very pale.
               "He did me service, sir, and I am grateful. He was my friend."
               "Your friend! Blanche Dearwood, do not drive me to the exercise of a guardian's authority."
               "Sir," exclaimed Blanche, with astonishment and pain at what appeared to her the length that her guardian's dislike for his son was leading him, "sir, I do not understand you."
               "This boy, then, this adventurer, you must cast out from your thoughts. He is an unknown vagabond, whom I cannot permit to associate with you, or to come in contact with you. My duty to the task I have undertaken requires of me this apparently harsh decision."
               He paused, wiped his brow, and pressed his hand upon his heart, as if he were silencing the remonstrances and whisperings of his better feelings.
               "I do not know that I shall ever meet him again," replied Blanche," but I cannot help bearing about me some pleasant recollections of him. I do not think, sir, that the authority of your office can extend to any jurisdiction over my feelings and thoughts."
               Mr. Waldron looked at Blanche with surprise. Did this calm and firm language come, indeed, from the gentle, yielding Blanche? Was his tractable, pliant, unresisting ward throwing down the gauntlet to him? Blanche, in fact, was aroused at the manifest injustice of her guardian, and stimulated by her indignant feelings to take the stand that she did.
               
               Mr. Waldron was silent, while he pressed 
                     is
                     his
                   hand to his head, as if experiencing a sensation of pain. Blanche, after a few moments, spoke again:
               "Pardon me, Mr. 
                     Waldon
                     Waldron
                  ," said she, "but will you permit me to return to the house?"
               "You don't call me 'guardian' any more, Blanche."
               "Do I not, sir?"
               "No, you do not. But no doubt you speak from the heart."
               "Will you permit me to return, sir?" urged Blanche.
               He turned abruptly on his heel, and strode away in the direction of the river.
               With blinding tears in her eyes, Blanche drew her bonnet over her face, and flew with nervous speed towards the house.
               The scene she had just passed through was almost incredible to her senses. It seemed fairly monstrous to think of her guardian so strangely and wonderfully changed. And what was more, it now appeared to her but too evident that he was, indeed, with relentless cruelty and harshness, repudiating his son. Bitter, acrimonious, irascible! what could be the terrible mystery that, at the sight of his son, could stir up such passions, could fill his heart with such bitterness. Where was his goodness, his nobility, his generous virtues, his sensibilities, if he could be guilty of conduct more heartless than Blanche had ever imagined human nature to be capable of. Oh! what a fall it was from his high state! What a blow it was to her faith in his lofty virtue! How could she comprehend or believe that an act of such relentless severity could have been enacted at the hands of Gilbert Waldron?
               How misled Blanche was in her judgment our readers know. It is only necessary for them to bear in mind Mr. Waldron's peculiar temperament and the passion that had grown up in his heart, to account for his conduct. We have described Mr. Waldron as a man of strong passions, controlled by a stronger will—as one who in his early days had run into great excesses, but that experience, sorrow, and suffering, had been to him a school of philosophy—softening, subduing, purifying. Sorrow had driven him into the world and among men; and while his sufferings were working their healthful influence upon his mind from within, observation, society, humanity, contact with mind, collision with intellect, were from without accomplishing their beneficial aid in the formation of his better nature. And what a noble nature it was that came out of the purifying fire we have already endeavored to describe. We have mentioned how little of bitterness there was in that tinge of melancholy that hung about him, how genial and gentle was his manner, how full of repose and grace it was, how his mind so richly stored, beamed with thought, and fancy, and taste, and the beautiful.
               But all his philosophy, his genial grace, the calm and healthful tone of his mind, seemed to be losing themselves now by the power of this new passion. That Mr. Waldron should experience this love for his ward is naturally in accordance with his inner nature. An intense, an ever-abiding desire for sympathy—for sympathy of heart, soul, and intellect—had during all his life been a predominant passion with him. It had been the great sought-for, and until it was found he felt but too keenly that beneath all his repose and calmness of manner, a restless, yearning spirit would exist. Blanche, at the very first, struck the chord. Her voice fell upon his heart with such unspeakable sweetness, her eyes looked into his soul with so electrical a thrill, there was that about her to which his whole nature responded so fully, he experienced such fascinating delight in her presence, that he saw, felt, and believed that at last the key-note of sympathy was touched; at last, he had found a mind exquisitely responsive to every emotion of his own. But he did not at first conceive this feeling to be love. He thought it was only sympathy, friendship, an attraction of intellect. He was deceived, but not long. He awoke, after a time, to the real state of his heart; and that awakening was one of sorrow, hopelessness, pain. How could a man of forty-five win a girl's heart of sixteen? How could he, the model of a gentleman, the model of honor—how could he become so false to his trust as to accept of his ward's heart, even if in her inexperience she should yield it to him? And yet again—how still this passion; how control it; how abide with her, see her, meet her, be drawn into such intimate contact with her mind, accept of her warm filial affection, be to her a parent, with a lover's passion struggling in his bosom? Strength of mind! Why, he was not above humanity. We have no right to exact from mortals the strength of the gods!
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               RODMAN DEPARTS—FATHER AND SON.
               THE morning after Rodman's parting interview with Blanche, he arose with the earliest light, and made his few preparations for departure. The East was all in a glow, clothed in purple and gold, as if decking itself to do honor to the coming of the great monarch of light, when Rodman sallied out of the little low porch to Captain Dartan's dwelling, and paused for a moment to take a parting look at the familiar scene. In the midst of his survey, and while indulging in some lingering regrets at the little hope he could hold out to himself of ever seeing that spot again, he was suddenly accosted by the old veteran.
               "Why, lad, lad," was the captain's salutation, "where away?"
               Rodman had desired to avoid a formal parting with his host, as he shrunk from the old man's good-hearted garrulous simplicity, and he had, therefore, taken his farewell of him by note. This meeting was therefore unpleasant to him in many ways, but, without any show of annoyance, he returned the salutation.
               "A golden morning, Captain Dartan," said he; "but are you always so early a riser?"
               "Always, Rodman Moore. When God made the sun to rise in so much glory, he didn't intend for his creatures to shut their eyes ag'in it in slumber."
               "That's true, Captain."
               "It's strange now, but I've seen men, rich men, as would give their hundreds of dollars, hundreds, Rodman Moore, and travel over seas, too, just to get a scene like that in the East yonder, painted on a bit of canvas, to hang up in their grand parlors, while these same men wouldn't lose an hour's sleep of a morning to get a view of the real thing itself. Now, I don't know much about paintin'. I never did see many. But I don't believe, Rodman Moore, there ever was a picture painted that were half so bright or so beautiful as that one there."
               "A picture, too, dear sir, that every morning is given to us in a new form."
               "A gallery, a gallery of them, Rodman Moore. Natur' don't get exhausted, boy. Every day she gives us a new picture complete. I've seen nigh eighty years of sunrises and sunsets, boy, and this one to-day is as bright now, as fresh, as new, as if these eyes were baby's eyes, that were looking on a sunrise for the first time."
               "Ah, sir! Nature is a grand painter."
               "Wonderful, Rodman Moore."
               "I am afraid, dear Captain, that it will be a long while before I see the sun rise again over yonder hills."
               "What boy, what?"
               "I'm going to leave you, Captain."
               "Going! where?"
               "Into the world—I hardly know where—I am going, sir, to seek my fortune."
               "Bless my soul," exclaimed the good old Captain, in much consternation and grief, "don't tell me that, Rodman Moore. I don't know how it is, boy, but ever since I first saw you I have loved you almost as much as I used to love your grandfather, Rodman Willow, of Revolutionary memory. And I can't bear the thought, lad, I can't indeed, of seeing you go out into the world, and never more to be seen by these eyes."
               "Why, you know, my dear Captain, that I am poor. I can't live a life of idleness."
               "Poor, lad. Live here with Angelica and me. My savings haven't been large, and my pension is small, but my wants are few. You shall be as welcome as my own son."
               "Thank you, thank you, my dear Captain," said Rodman, quite overcome by the old man's generous affection for him, and shaking his hand warmly.
               "Then you accept."
               "Oh, no—"
               "No!"
               "It's very generous, Captain Dartan. Your kindness touches me nearly. But my course is clear, my duty imperative. I must not yield to inclination. I must not even yield to you, sir."
               "And Blanche, boy, Blanche. What will become of her?"
               Rodman turned aside embarrassed.
               "She loves you, Rodman Moore," resumed the Captain, "I am sure of it. Her sweetest smile is always for you."
               "And a smile so sweet, too."
               "Clear sunlight, boy."
               "Full of radiance, indeed."
               "And love for Rodman Moore," added the veteran facetiously.
               "Captain Dartan," said Rodman turning to him, "I trust to your discretion that you will never to any one at the Clove make mention of me in connection with Blanche. I ask this for her sake. I ask it for mine."
               
               "To be sure, lad, to be sure."
               "And let me tell you, my generous friend, that if I ever dare to aspire to the love of Blanche—if ever I hope to win it—if ever I expect to be worthy of it—I must launch forth into the world to battle for position, rank, fame, even as you did, when you went forth side by side with Rodman Willow—"
               "Your grandfather."
               "To win honor."
               "And a captain's commission. You are right, Rodman Moore. You were born for greater things than to mope away your days here with a worn-out veteran. So go, boy, and may you succeed, that's all I've got to say. Ah! if I could only live to see Blanche Dearwood, Blanche Moore!"
               "So now," said Rodman, "shake hands, and say farewell, Captain Dartan."
               "Not afore breakfast, lad. There is Angelica a-calling us now. Breakfast, first, Rodman Moore, and then we'll say good-bye with better hearts."
               So Rodman, although intending to have been a mile or two on his journey to P—— before sunrise, felt compelled to yield to solicitation, and take a parting meal with his big-hearted host.
               After breakfast, Rodman shook hands with the Captain and Angelica, and, followed by many kind words and blessings, he passed through the little garden-gate, and strode on his way, out into the mighty world.
               Rodman, after leaving the Captain's house, struck directly into the forest, with a view of crossing Clove Peak, as this direction would shorten his walk a mile or two, and carry him by the little natural bower on the mountain side, where he had first beheld Blanche Dearwood.
               It was with mingled feelings of sadness and pleasure that he entered this bower, and took his stand where he could look down upon Clove Place with a parting glance.
               How sweet and serene was the house, the lawn, the gardens, the orchards, and the distant river; all so still and bright in the slanting sun rays, tinged as yet with a delicate rosy touch!
               And this mansion, these far-extending lands, all this beauty, belonged to his father, to that mysterious being, whom he dared not claim, and whom he had twice so strangely met. To his father, whom he loved with a strong love, and yet who cast him off and disowned him. Wealth, fortune, rank, love, happiness, all so nearly his, and yet so remote from being his! But would the time ever come when he would be master of all this before him? Would he ever walk through those grounds in honor, by his father's side? Would he ever stand again where he stood now, with Blanche by him and clinging to him?
               These were some of Rodman's thoughts. But his musings took a far wider range than what we have set down. All the past so mysterious, the present so strange, the future so impenetrable, these by turns passed through his mind, as he stood looking down upon his father's roof, that had never known him but as a stranger.
               And there came upon him, too, with its old force, his strong yearning for a father's love. He remembered that hour when the astounding knowledge broke upon him that the mysterious being, to whom his boyish fancy had always clung, was no other than his father. He remembered that night as he hovered about the doorway, looking in upon his parent's dark form, shadowed by the dying fire grimly upon the ceiling, and he trying to command the courage to fling himself upon his knees, and cry out, "Father." All his youth came upon him then strongly—its passionate dreams and intense longings, its secret and burning passion, and its romantic visions of a great and concealed birth, that time was one day to reveal. Overcome, saddened, by these recollections, Rodman gave way to a passionate outbreak of grief, to a rhapsodical and extravagant outflow of love, passion, and aspiration. Presently, however, a more subdued and a better frame of mind came upon him. His thoughts assumed a more rational cast, and calm determination and resolute reasoning succeeded his spasm of fiery emotion.
               "Always," said he to himself, "always, dreaming, brooding, and full of sentiment and passion. That's not the way to accomplish. Action instead of sentimentalizing, courage instead of passion. I must tear out this old romance. Life is all reality and sternness. If I aspire, it must not be with rhapsody and dreams, but with earnest purposes and faithful labor. Strong will and stern blows, with muscle, and nerve, and brain bending to the work; that is the only way to win. But, Blanche, your love I will cherish closely, and warmly, and for ever. It will give me strength, animate my courage, fortify my resolution, and stimulate my energies. Therefore, Blanche, let me ever hold you in my heart and in my thoughts. Let me emulate your goodness, your gentleness, your perfect purity. Let me become worthy of you."
               The young man paused, and stepping to the outer edge of the projection, looked long and earnestly upon the scene beneath him. He then, with an effort, withdrew his gaze, and stepped back underneath the trees, to take his parting glance of Blanche's favorite haunt; that spot of all the world so precious to him, as the one where he had first beheld the matchless charms of his mistress.
               "Farewell!" said he, "farewell, all! I have passed among these mountains here some hours of the most exquisite bliss, the most perfect happiness. Such hours may never come again, but their remembrance ever will be a boon to carry with me through life. But, farewell!"
               And so, speaking his thoughts aloud, the young man turned his back upon the scene, and plunged into the depths of the mountain forest.
               But the tranquil state of his mind was soon to experience a sudden and violent change.
               His course led him for a short distance along the side of the mountain, until a certain point, where an abrupt descent brought him suddenly upon the highway. Springing along with a buoyant step, he had seized upon a supple sapling, and by its aid cleared an intervening space of jagged rocks, landing nimbly into the centre of the road. But he had scarcely done so, when the snort of a horse, and his sudden spring to one side of the road, acquainted Rodman with the unlooked-for presence of a stranger. Turning quickly to see who it might be—a startled cry broke from his lips, and the blood rushed tumultuously to his face, as his eye alighted upon the form of his father.
               "Mr. Moore, I believe," said that gentleman, with the most freezing politeness, lifting his hat to him.
               Rodman could not reply. He only pressed his hand upon his heart, and with his gaze fixed upon the ground, stepped one side to clear the road. Mr. Waldron, however, seemed to desire an interview, as he rode up closer to him, and addressed him again.
               "You are right, sir," said Rodman, finding that he must speak, "I have met Mr. Waldron before."
               "For two minutes," replied Mr. Waldron, coldly.
               "I cannot accuse myself for its not being longer," replied Rodman, with a flushed cheek.
               
               "I am afraid that's because you are not an impartial judge. If what I learn from the members of my family be true, during my residence in New York you honored my house with your daily visits. Permit me, sir, to express my regret that my unexpected return should be construed by you into a necessity for suddenly discontinuing them."
               Rodman's cheek grew scarlet, but he did not reply.
               "I should have been delighted, sir, at an opportunity to cultivate the acquaintance of a gentleman, who, in my absence, succeeded, by virtue of his many accomplishments, and, perhaps, I may say, blandishments, in winning the confidence of two ladies, neither of whom is acquainted with the facility with which men of the world can make vice look like virtue."
               "Sir!" Rodman looked up now boldly, but his heart beat fast, and brow and cheek grew deeper still in their scarlet tinge.
               "You will pardon me," resumed Mr. Waldron, "if I make use of terms that bear an unfortunate inference. My words have been selected with care, and with a direct view to the meaning they might convey."
               "Mr. Waldron," said Rodman darkly, "I never should have stepped in yonder house if I had known to whom it belonged."
               "Exactly, sir! That's just what I am disposed to complain of. You honored my family with your friendship when I was absent, and upon my return you withdraw your light from us altogether. I am really sorry, sir, that my society does not possess the same attractions that of the ladies did, and I equally regret that you do not find Clove House as agreeable a place of resort now as you did two days ago."
               "May I understand you more clearly, sir?"
               "I cannot think that a man of the world can be obtuse enough not to understand me. But I will speak more clearly. A gentleman, a stranger, from a remote section, unknown, with no vouchers nor letters, in the absence of the head of a family, insinuates himself into its society, and, availing himself of the conventional ignorance of the ladies, establishes himself as a permanent guest, exercising all the experienced fascination of his class; stimulated in his purpose by visions of wealth, projects rides, excursions, tête-à-têtes, with an unsuspecting girl, that into her ear he might pour the poisonous charm of his town wit; and when there appears upon the scene the guardian of this girl, sneaks off in a cowardly abandonment of his design, actuated no doubt by a fear of exposure—such a man, sir, in most circles, would be called an adventurer and a libertine. What would you call him, sir?"
               "Mr. Waldron, you are doing me the greatest wrong," passionately exclaimed Rodman.
               "It would pain me to do that, I'm sure. And in order to avoid the recurrence of such an injustice it would be advisable, I think, for you not again to intrude upon the society of Miss Dearwood. I think that I may assert with confidence that the lady herself joins with me in this request."
               "Blanche! Impossible!"
               "Pardon me, if I differ from you. But I believe that we understand each other now. I bid you good day."
               Striking his horse briskly, he galloped off, leaving Rodman standing looking after him, convulsed with the most violent passions, filled with rage, bitterness and unutterable anguish.
               His father's words seemed to ring in his ears, until he pressed his hands upon his head, to shut out the apparent sound. Had such intimations been uttered by any other being, in his frantic rage, he would have fallen violently upon his traducer, but now he was fairly disarmed of resentment, and filled with a feverish horror at the crushing thought that words like these could be coolly, bitingly, maliciously uttered by the one being at whose feet he so eagerly panted to fling himself—whose love it had been his life's purpose to win. He could not contain himself as he thought upon it. He lost every control over his emotions. He flung himself upon the ground, and, drawing his hat over his eyes, wept bitter tears. These gradually subsided, and were succeeded by a settled, fierce, cynical bitterness—a gloomy spirit of misanthropy—a growing hardness and callousness, accompanied by a desire for redress and revenge. He sprang upon his feet, and with clenched fist and darkened brow, strode impetuously along the road.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               AN UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER—A FAREWELL REPEATED.
               STRIDING on, with a strange light in his eye, and imprecations on his lips, with doubt in his heart, doubt of goodness, justice, or virtue anywhere—doubting even Blanche, who, by the inference of Mr. Waldron's language, had taken stand against him—with callous, hardened doubt, the doubt of the infidel and the sceptic, which has faith neither in heaven nor in earth—with doubt that was as reckless as it was bitter—so strode along darkly and fiercely, Rodman Moore.
               An hour's walk calmed his turbulent feelings somewhat, and pausing on the road side, where a wooded bank swept down to the river, he abandoned the highway, and walked down to the water's edge, for the purpose of bathing his feverish brow. A group of trees that overhung a cool and limpid pool, afforded so inviting a shade, that Rodman yielded to a sudden inclination to pause there for awhile, and in the cool, calm quiet of the scene, endeavor to soothe his agitated nerves. Marking for a pillow where "an antique root peeped out," he was just about to fling himself upon the grass, when suddenly his eye fell upon a stranger seated upon a rock, a little distant removed, profoundly occupied in watching the little eddies of the current, and with his cane slivering off into the stream, the loosened bits of rock that were within his reach. A movement, or an exclamation, that Rodman made at this discovery, caused the stranger to lift his head, and turn his face in the direction whence the sound proceeded, when, to our hero's vast astonishment, he found himself face to face with Mr. Robert Knowlton, who, the reader remembers, occupied a somewhat conspicuous place in Rodman's history of himself.
               "Mr. Knowlton!" exclaimed Rodman, as soon as he could recover from the surprise of this unexpected encounter.
               "Rodman," returned that gentleman, with perfect coolness, as if the meeting was all a matter of course, "Rodman, glad to see you. Been ruralizing, eh? That's capital pleasure, my dear fellow."
               Rodman, a good deal confused, and not a little dismayed, at an encounter which he felt assured was a premeditated one, stammered out that it was capital—very!
               "You've been up here among the Highlands, too," resumed Mr. Knowlton, with an undisturbed, easy manner, while he amused himself by flinging pebbles into the stream; "that was a very wise choice, my lad. These Highlands are certainly delightful. Such scenery, such picturesque haunts, such lakes, such cascades, such forests!"
               Each of these exclamations was accompanied by a jerk of a pebble into the stream.
               "I am glad that you like them, sir," replied Rodman, coldly.
               "Why, what's the matter, Rod? You don't seem to be in good spirits."
               "It's quite likely, sir, that I am not," was Rodman's rejoinder, who was beginning to think of how he might get rid of his subtle, mysterious companion, who now, as formerly merly, while exercising a peculiar sway over him, filled him with doubt and distrust.
               "That's bad, Rod. Men like us, who have no revenue but our good spirits, should be wary how we part with them. Come, man, banish the blues. Bah! I should like to know what there is in heaven or earth worth a man's getting sad about."
               "You are quite right. Nothing!"
               Mr. Knowlton shot a glance at Rodman, but went on in the same careless manner, talking, and playing with his cane in the eddies.
               "But what have you been doing all this while, Rod?" resumed he, reaching forward to draw a floating branch near to him, and apparently much more intent on this than on the subject he was speaking of. "Nothing else but rambling about, eh? Climbing up some of these peaks, and making poetry to the clouds, perhaps?"
               "I don't make poetry, sir."
               "Keep to your resolution, by all means. Heaven save us, but its the most abandoned trade in the country. You had better, for profit and honor both, turn scavenger first."
               "I dare say you're right," was the moody reply.
               "But what have you been doing, Rod? Sleeping and dreaming under the shades? Throwing a line sometimes, coaxingly to a trout? Dozing over the last new novel? In fact, if you've been doing nothing of a states-prison odor, out with it, boy, and tell your adventures."
               "I've nothing to tell, Mr. Knowlton."
               "You must be in love, then. Nothing but that would keep you silent so long. You have been playing Corin to some amorous Phillida."
                Rodman, falling under the spell of his companion's words, flushed and laughed.
               
               "Oh, ho! I see, a young Lothario," exclaimed Knowlton; "well come, confess. Nothing indiscreet, I hope. Love is a rose, my boy—delicious, if you don't get pricked by the thorns."
               Rodman turned away in silence. Oh! miserable actor, by the side of this consummate artist, how the secret of his heart was probed and read.
               Mr. Knowlton leant forward to watch his companion, and for an instant lost his usual reckless, nonchalant manner, in the interest of the moment.
               "Why, Rod, my boy," said he, "you look sad, gloomy, pale. Come, come, don't let a pair of bright eyes wound you so deeply. Love should never be anything more than a holiday affair. It's very pretty sport when played with at arm's length. But come, Rod, it's folly to be sighing away now, when your Dulcinea by this time is only thinking of her next conquest."
               "Sir—Mr. Knowlton."
               "Flirts, Rodman, will be flirts, in town or country."
               "Flirts, Mr. Knowlton."
               "Shrewd, cunning, deceitful vixens, boy. I'll wager a golden eagle, now, that the lass who has been mischievously setting your heart on fire, isn't anything more than a rural 
                     coquettte
                     coquette
                  , who, at this moment, is uttering soft nonsense in vile English to some other of her tender swains."
               "'Pon my word, Mr. Knowlton, you presume. What can you possibly know of the young lady, who—"
               "A lady!" interrupted Knowlton, without apparently noticing Rodman's confusion at the confession he was so near betrayed into making; "a lady! worse and worse. Ladies, my boy, never condescend to make love to poor adventurers like yourself, without some mischief in view. You've been played with, sir. Tricked, bamboozled, by some rouged, besilked, beribband, and perfumed lady, by some flirting, heartless, brainless—"
               "By heaven, Mr. Knowlton, stop where you are."
               "Don't like the picture, eh? Provokingly true, no doubt."
               "You have no right to malign a lady, whom you do not know."
               "What lady, Rod?"
               Rodman bit his lip with chagrin at this cool, quiet question from his companion, which so plainly insinuated his folly in permitting a moment's vexation to betray his secret.
               Knowlton observed the conflict of vexation, resentment, and pride that was going on in his companion's breast, so he quietly changed the subject.
               "But, Rodman, what made you run away from us in town? Mrs. Carlton, your patroness—"
               "My patroness, sir," exclaimed Rodman with indignant pride.
               "What shall we call her, then? You must admit that she has alway been your friend."
               "My friend, yes; I cannot doubt it."
               "Quite a maternal interest she takes in you, Rod. She took your run away quite to heart. She wouldn't hear, either, any of the stories that were told of you."
               "Stories!"
               "Oh! your absence was accounted for in plenty of ways. Some talked of forgery."
               "Forgery!"
               The young man fairly turned black in the face.
               "Others, less vicious, spoke only of petty larceny."
               "Fury!" exclaimed Rodman, setting his teeth hard.
               "But it must be confessed that the suspicions of the first class were greatly strengthened by the conduct of Elwood."
               "Why, what of him?"
               "Shortly after your disappearance from his office, he was everywhere, accompanied by a middle aged gentleman, making urgent inquiries for you. The police were even put on your track."
               "The Police?"
               "All of which, my young friend, you must have the candor to confess, really looked dark. How could your very estimable friends, who held your character in so much esteem, fail to become painfully impressed with the force of these suspicious circumstances? They did not fail to become painfully impressed, and they went industriously about to confide in others the secret of their solicitude for you."
               "Sir, sir."
               "Nothing more than natural friendship, Rod; nothing more, believe me. I have experienced considerable friendship of this kind in life, and I always found it to be really refreshing and delightful."
               "But Mrs. Carlton—she never doubted me."
               "Mrs. Carlton every day vehemently insisted upon believing in your good faith, and was very firm in declaring that you could clear it all up, as you assuredly would, some of these days. I confess that I adopted Mrs. Carlton's opinion. It was infinitely less perplexing, and more pleasing than any other."
               "Mr. Knowlton, these suspicions did me great wrong."
               "You quite delight me by saying so," replied Knowlton, stretching himself, and leaping from the rock where he had been sitting; "but I'm afraid, Rodman, your good friends will never forego their tender solicitude until they've got a plausible story as a substitute."
               "Mr. Knowlton, as I stand here, the cause of my abrupt departure from town was this. One night, in a crowd passing from a concert room, a face, like a sudden and quickly extinguished gleam of light, flashed before me, revealing the features of—of my father. I plunged wildly into the crowd after him, but he was gone, and my eager search was all in vain. This incident plunged me into all the old gloom, and strengthened the old hope. For two days I prowled about the city, hopeless, 
                     desparing
                     despairing
                  , when a sudden resolution prompted me to make a secret visit to my old childhood's abode, in the vague surmise that such a step might afford me at clue to his discovery. I could learn nothing. Full of hopelessness, weariness, and weighed down by a heavy heart, I sought for relief in a week's undisturbed and solitary musings in the forests and upon the bills. That's the whole story, Mr. knowlton."
               "All?"
               Knowlton turned aside to indulge in a low laugh. How little did Rodman know the marvellous depth concealed under that reckless and easy indifference! How little did he conceive how thoroughly he was probed, measured, and read through and through, under that graceful, pleasant exterior! While tossing pebbles into the current, and idly beating the over-hanging bushes, his companion had wound and unwound him, sounded all his stops, and wormed out the most sacred secrets of his heart.
               During Rodman's explanatory speech, so adroitly drawn, from him Knowlton was busy in brushing the dust from his coat, and drawing on his gloves.
               "And now, Rod," said he, taking out his watch, "we have but little more than an hour in which to reach the boat. Come, a brisk walk is before us."
               
               "Are you returning to town?" inquired Rodman.
               "I believe that I have some such intention. But, positively, I am so careless a fellow that sometimes I absolutely forget what my intentions really are. But, Rod, we must walk briskly, if we mean to get the boat." Taking Rodman's arm, and walking quietly and calmly on, as if their destination had mutually been agreed upon.
               "I don't mean to go to town to-day," said Rodman, coolly withdrawing his arm.
               "Well, we'll stop at the tavern, then," replied Knowlton, in nowise disconcerted; "it is a good one. A fine dinner, an afternoon nap, a twilight walk, and a long night's rest. I'm quite delighted with the prospect."
               Again, with perfect and cool assurance, Knowlton took the arm of Rodman, and walked along by his side. Rodman, although experiencing the influence of the same fascination that Knowlton had ever exercised upon him, still shrunk from him. His dashing, careless, reckless mood, however, suited the desperate character of his thoughts, but Rodman had resolved, within his own mind, that, before departing from the Clove, he would seek and obtain one more interview with Blanche—would learn positively if the hint thrown out by her guardian was true; and, to accomplish this, he must rid himself of his strange companion. He felt convinced, too, that some ulterior object was in view—some mysterious purpose, that prompted Knowlton, at all times and places, to thrust himself into his society, to fairly spy upon his actions. And this meeting, too. How could it have been brought about without some system of espionage? Puzzled and distrustful, Rodman determined to escape from the society, of one whom he feared.
               "Mr. Knowlton," said he, abruptly stopping in the road, "I do not desire to know the direction which your business or inclination may guide you, and I must be permitted to reserve the privilege of not stating my own."
               "Why, what's the matter, Rod? You look gloomy and dogged enough for a Timon."
               "If it's your purpose to walk down this road, sir, I will turn back and go up."
               "By Jove, now," exclaimed Knowlton, laughing, "this is the pleasantest incident I ever experienced. I don't think its quite original, though. If my dramatic reminiscences are correct, some very such scene occurred once between one Rover and his friend. By all means, Rod, when you get up theatrical effects, don't plagiarise."
               "Every man," replied Rodman, sullenly, "has a right to elect his own course and his own companions."
               "But every man, my dear Rod, don't. Some men that I know of tumble into their company. May I inquire, Rod, if it isn't a lady, now, that makes you turn and bite your friends?"
               Rodman turned away, without replying.
               "Come, come, Rod, don't let love transform you into a bear—although it's a very natural transformation, too for both bears and lovers, I believe, are addicted to hugging. That's a poor joke, Rod; but, as Touchstone hath it, it's my own. Come, Rod, forswear this gloom; don't waste your sighs upon a woman. With me to town, and I'll so inoculate you with good spirits, that, as Shakspeare says, 'the weak, wanton Cupid shall from your neck unloose his amorous hold, and like a dew-drop from a lion's mane be shook to air.'"
               Rodman still kept his averted gaze, but did not answer.
               "Ah! I see," resumed Knowlton, "I must act the magnanimous Rover. Well, love is a kind of lunacy that must be humored. Farewell, Rod, I'll walk this way. But take my good wishes with you. May your mistress discover in you more accomplishments than those of the admirable Crichton, more graces than Sir Philip Sydney, more courage and chivalry than the Chevalier Bayard, sans peur, sans reproche!"
               Lifting his hat, with formal and studied grace, Knowlton bowed low, and then, with a loud, jocular laugh, sauntered down the road.
               Rodman remained standing for some moments, and then quietly walked away in the opposite direction. Dismissing from his mind all thought of Knowlton, whom his mistrustful fears continually associated with some plan or scheme to his injury—whom he doubted even in moments of the most friendly companionship—of whom he had a vague apprehension, a half developed suspicion, that he was in some way a spy upon him—dismissing, we say, all suspicions and thoughts of him, he turned to the contemplation of his purposed interview with Blanche. It would necessarily require to be a secret one, and it would be a matter of some delicacy to accomplish it without compromising Blanche in what would appear to be a clandestine meeting. He first thought of accomplishing it by the interposition of Captain Dartan, but the garrulous simplicity of the old man rendered that impracticable. After thinking over the various plans that suggested themselves, he concluded that the simplest was the best—that somewhere about the grounds he would be most likely to encounter her, and thus be enabled to obtain the few words with her that he desired without much risk of discovery. He, therefore, walked directly towards the house, made a détour, by which he reached the maze-garden, from the umbrageous depths of which he could survey the house and its approaches unperceived ceived. Hour after hour, however, he hovered about without seeing any one. He began to chafe impatiently, and to tread up and down the garden walks with a feverish vexation. The sun was waning low, and after night-fall he feared that the chances of the meeting would become less. But he resolved not to abandon his purpose while there was a hope left. He saw the sun slowly sink and disappear behind the western hills, and he watched the gradual fading away of its golden refulgence from the sky. The stars, one by one, came out; and, presently, a red, fiery, blood-like light rose through the trees, and hung above them, a ball of gleaming fire.
               Under cover of the night, Rodman was now enabled to draw nearer the house, and, presently, discovering what appeared to be a form sitting by one of the windows, he drew cautiously nearer, and soon perceived that it was Blanche herself. She was sitting, her face upon her hand, buried in profound thought. Rodman noiselessly and rapidly drew near, and not until he placed his hand upon hers did she observe his presence. A sudden start, and a suppressed cry, and then retreating hastily in the room, she beckoned him to follow her. The window opened on a terrace, and he eagerly sprang into the apartment, which was lit only by the rising moon.
               "Rodman!" was all Blanche could utter, as catching his hand she looked at him with eager surprise.
               "You thought me far away from you, Blanche, but I could not depart without once more seeing you," said Rodman gloomily.
               "But, Rodman—these clandestine meetings. My heart rebels against them."
               "Then I will go," exclaimed Rodman impatiently.
               "Angry, Rodman?" replied Blanche reproachfully.
               
               "No, not angry, Blanche, and yet so full of bitterness. But I will never ask another meeting, and it would be a blessing if death should prevent me."
               "Is this courage?"
               "It's easy enough to talk of courage. That abounds everywhere. I have none. And why should I? It's a virtue belonging only to honorable men. No one has a right to exact it of me."
               "Then exact it of yourself. Above all things conquer this gloomy misanthropy."
               "If you're going to talk wisdom, Blanche, I'll leave you."
               "Why, Rodman, what can have happened? You act very strangely."
               "It's quite likely. I inherit the right to do so."
               "Something has occurred to stimulate these bitter feelings."
               "Something has."
               "Tell me, dear Rodman, what it is; and let me beseech you not to give way to these impulses." She wound her arms around him, and looked up into his face.
               "Blanche, Blanche," exclaimed he, somewhat soothed, "I have seen him."
               "Your father—Mr. Waldron?"
               "Yes."
               "And he"—
               "What do you think? He was agitated at the encounter, you would say—he was embarrassed, and endeavored to conceal his confusion under an assumed coldness—so, perhaps, you imagine. You would be surprised, though, to know how he did conduct himself."
               "You are in a state of excited bitterness, Rodman. I implore you not to let your passion lead you to any step that afterwards you would have cause to regret. Tell me of the interview, Rodman—but calmly."
               "Oh! yes, very calmly. He overwhelmed me, Blanche, with keen, cutting satire—he hurled charges against me that now to think of makes my blood tingle—he called me, by insinuation, that, which if uttered by another, would have almost driven me to a personal attack. He did all this, Blanche, with the coolest and most polished severity—with a deliberation and malice of purpose that seems incredible, monstrous."
               "Alas! alas! what can it all mean?"
               "Mean, Blanche! This: I am his disgrace, the living evidence of his crime. He, the honorable, the noble, the respected, must not permit his fair name to be stained. His fame is worth more than everything else—and that it may be preserved untainted, he taunts, persecutes, and thrusts me from his sight. By heaven, the fiercest thought I have is, that I should all my life have been loving one who proves to be so deeply false."
               "There is a mystery about it—a something unrevealed that would make all clear. I am convinced of it. Mr. Waldron's conduct is too unnatural for us to be right in our conjectures."
               "How can we be wrong? We meet; changed as I am, he recognises the features of the boy he sometimes saw, and instantly a frown settles upon his brow. He avoids me, forbids his household to entertain me, seeks for a private interview, in which he overwhelms me with charges that he thinks will be sure to rid him of my presence for ever. It's clear as daylight. Nothing else can account for his conduct."
               Blanche remembered the irascible bitterness with which he had spoken of Rodman to her and to Amelia, and if not convinced, her heart sunk at the too great probability of the truth of their conclusions.
               
               "But, Blanche," exclaimed Rodman, "this is not all; I have not come here merely to speak of this. Tell me again that you love me—repeat once more your vows to me!"
               "Rodman!"
               "Blanche, he forbade me this house, and gave me to understand that you joined with him in refusing ever again to see me. Is this true? Am I to leave this place believing that you, too, turn against me?"
               "No, no, no. Most positively, Rodman, my heart bleeds for you, yearns for you. But I tremble with apprehension. Dear Rodman, if you should be found here."
               "His servants would expel me. There can be no doubt of that. It is not at all to be believed that he would evince the slightest delicacy in the matter. But I could not depart, Blanche, without this assurance from you. I could not live and have my faith in your love weakened by a single doubt. That's why I came to you again, Blanche. Now I am satisfied."
               "Rodman, do not think it harshness if I urge you to go."
               "Blanche, I do not know how to tear myself away. Oh! I love you, Blanche. I have not the courage to say farewell. And to say farewell, too, with so little hope of ever meeting you again. I cannot bear it. Blanche, my dearest Blanche, the world is without a home, without a friend for me. I go out into it alone, burdened with curses and hatred. And yet why should it be so? You love me, Blanche, and I—I could fling myself upon the ground, prostrate in servile humiliation to win your smile. Why must I live without it? Why condemn myself to misery when such unutterable happiness might be mine? Why Blanche, why?"
               The veins upon his brow were swollen, and his eyes were dilated wildly. He caught her in his arms, and fixed a passionate, eager look upon her.
               "Do you hear me? Do you understand me? I love you, and they thrust me from you. I love you, and you can be mine."
               "Rodman!"
               She sprang from his side, but he caught her hands.
               "I am mad, passionate, beside myself. I know not what I say. My senses are not quite clear. Blanche, I am alone. I only thought, for one short moment, that you might fling your fortunes with mine—for a moment I pictured you by my side, we two, out into the world together. Oh! Blanche, forgive me! The thought of so much bliss bereft me of my judgment."
               He bowed his head upon her hands in a paroxysm of grief.
               But at that moment Blanche's ear caught the sound of an approaching step.
               "Some one comes," exclaimed she with alarmed eagerness. "Oh! Rodman, quick, fly!"
               He started up, but a hand was on the knob, the door was flung open, and Mr. Waldron stood upon the sill, while the light from the hanging hall-lamp, flooding the room, revealed to him its occupants.
               Rodman's first impulse was to escape, but in an instant he mastered himself, and stood up, erect and calm.
               "I did not know, Blanche, that you had a visitor;" said Mr. Waldron, after a moment's pause.
               "An intruder, you should say, sir," replied Rodman with perfect calmness; "I am here, against the will of this lady, and in opposition to that of yours."
               "Which, I confess, surprises me."
               "My conduct, I dare say, appears to be without palliation tion. I shall not attempt to excuse it. I can only say that this is the last time, probably, that I shall ever cross your path again."
               "I thank you," said Mr. Waldron, "for your assurances, as far as they go, but I am compelled to require something more. My suspicion of your purpose in insinuating yourself as a guest in this house, has been confirmed by the testimony confided in me, voluntarily, this day, by the old soldier, with whom you were a recent lodger. Permit to say, sir, that Miss Dearwood cannot receive the visitations of a gentleman, who, so boldly, to others, acknowledges his designs upon her hand—and I require of this gentleman his most positive assurances that be will not again ever attempt to see her."
               "I will give no such promise."
               "No?"
               "No."
               "Not even if Miss Dearwood requires it of you?"
               "I will answer that, sir, when the lady makes the request."
               "Miss Dearwood, sir, is a wealthy ward. I am, however, repeating information, that, no doubt, you knew long since. Her friends cannot consent to her exposure to the attentions of every nameless adventurer, who may desire to gain access to her. You must, therefore, promise not to see her."
               "And if I do not?"
               Mr. Waldron's brow flushed, and he bit his lip angrily.
               "I know how, sir, to protect my ward, to enforce authority in my own house, and to punish audacity."
               "You do not mean to threaten violence?" exclaimed Rodman, growing pale with passion.
               "It would not be so strange. Do I not find you a clandestine and forbidden visitor to my house?"
               "I will depart," furiously replied Rodman, starting towards the window.
               "You must first make the declaration I require of you," said Mr. Waldron, stepping before him.
               "Mr. Waldron, do not drive me mad!"
               "I never, sir, had any such intention. I have simply required of you a promise not to visit my ward."
               "I will never give one," responded Rodman, stamping his foot.
               A terrible change came over Mr. Waldron's face. It grew white with passion, his eyes flashed with fire, and a dark frown settled upon his brow. He strode up to Rodman, and in a low voice, but with passionate intensity, he exclaimed:
               "By heaven you shall!"
               Rodman involuntarily fell back, and Blanche, who had been a terrified and trembling auditor to the whole scene, started forward in consternation, exclaiming—
               "Mr. Waldron, Mr. Waldron! Pause, I beseech you. You know not what you do. Oh, heaven! He is—he is—"
               "Blanche!" shouted Rodman, running up to her, "I would sooner have you strike me dead than utter the word you are about to do. Mr. Waldron, we may meet again."
               He rushed to the window, sprang out upon the lawn, and with wild precipitation, sped away from the house.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIX.
               PASSION—TEMPTATION.
               RUSHING impetuously along, heedless of every obstacle, Rodman gave no pause to his headlong speed. It seemed as if he were attempting to outrun his thoughts—to flee beyond consciousness—to gain by the velocity of his pace some relief to his vehement passions.
               Suddenly, as passing the dark shadow of a group of trees, a figure came forth, and stood so directly in his path, that he nearly precipitated himself upon it. In an instant he saw that it was Knowlton.
               "By heaven, who are you?" exclaimed he, panting, and furious with the suspicion that he had been watched.
               "No ghost nor goblin damned, thank heaven and myself," replied the familiar, careless voice.
               "Who are you?" hissed Rodman, between his teeth, "you dog my footsteps. You cross my path everywhere. You are a spy upon me. Who are you?"
               "Of the genus homo, so say the naturalists. I take their word for it, although I'll be sworn it's no compliment."
               "Knowlton, I will not be played with."
               "I respect your determination."
               "I will know who you are."
               "Your assurances give me pleasure."
               Rodman, with an oath, stamped his foot, and seized hold of Knowlton's arm.
               "You are some accursed spy," exclaimed he, quite beside himself, "an insidious, treacherous——"
               "Stop, stop," interrupted Knowlton, "one moment, Rod. There's nothing in the world that troubles me so little as words. They sit lightly on my stomach. You might hurl the whole dictionary at me, and without effect."
               "Then let us part."
               "What, are you going to re-act the scene of this afternoon?"
               "How came you here? Answer me that. Why do you thrust yourself continually into my society? Why did you follow and watch me this afternoon?"
               "Haven't you jumped to conclusions, Rod?"
               The young man turned away sullenly.
               "Which way do you go?" said he.
               "Humph!" was the reply, "I never had any particular destination in my life. I hav'n't any now."
               "Then stay where you are, and leave me to depart. I wish to be alone."
               "What folly this is, Rodman. I am your friend. So is Mrs. Carlton. Go with me to her. She has conceived a strange fondness for you."
               "I disdain all friendship," was the fierce reply.
               "Come, come, Rod, this is not generous. Mrs. Carlton is your friend more than you know. She's a woman, and has her whims—and one is a liking for you."
               Rodman averted his gaze, and gnawed at his lip nervously. Knowlton came up to him, and laid his hand upon his shoulder.
               "Rod," said he, "you want society, change, life. Come with me to New York—to Mrs. Carlton."
               
               Rodman shook his hand from his person, and stalked away in silent gloom. But Knowlton followed, and came up by his side. The young man paused abruptly, and exclaimed:
               "Do you insist upon keeping with me?"
               "Pish! my dear fellow, don't keep up the pouts. I tell you I am your friend—your princeship's friend, Horatio, my noble, melancholy Hamlet. Imitate now, let me adjure you, your philosophical predecessor, and confide in me, whether you, too, have been troubled by the visitations of a father's ghost!"
               Rodman turned abruptly away at this ingenious speech, and Mr. Knowlton's eye lit up cunningly as he did so. It was the misfortune of Rodman that he had very little command over his nerves, and that the slightest emotion would make itself visible in some action or way. Even his efforts, as in this instance, to avoid manifesting any emotion, would often be all the evidence that his cunning, subtle companion would desire.
               "Mr. Knowlton," said Rodman, after a moment's pause, and confronting him with a settled air of determination, "I am going to New York, but I go alone, freed from every remembrance or association of the past—full only of the future. I go to win wealth, rank, fame—and by heaven, I will do it, too!"
               "Who would aid you in such a purpose more than Mrs. Carlton?"
               "I do not ask for aid. I am strong, and can act for myself."
               "Ah! Rod, you do not know the world."
               "There can be no darker shades than what I've known."
               "But you do not know what a thing it is to struggle against fate—to be ambitious and have nothing but your own strength to support you—nothing but your own strength to confront against the ten thousand others who will seek to thrust you aside from their path—to hurl you down where you can not cross them in the goodly thing they thirst for."
               "My purpose is fixed—my strength desperate."
               "But Mrs. Carlton has wealth—influence—earnest friendship for you. You cannot refuse to receive her aid. At least go with me to her and listen to her advice."
               "Mrs. Carlton certainly always appeared my friend," said Rodman, somewhat modified. Knowlton observing his change of mind, took his arm and walked along by his side.
               "But Rod," said he, "whom do you aspire to imitate? Midas or Alexander? Will you seek for the magic touch that changes everything to gold, or aspire for glory and conquest?"
               "I do not know," was the half sullen response.
               "Oh! I see, visions of greatness, devices for wealth! Unwise, unwise, mon ami! Better take the world as it is, and heat your liver with a little too much wine, rather than cool your heart with mortifying groans. What an absurd thing it is now, Rod, for you to waste all your youth—to forego pleasure while you have the appetite to enjoy it—to mope, and drudge, and work like the blindest of moles and the dullest of donkeys—to lose life with an effort to live by these attempts at fortune-making—speaking the frightful jargon of trade—mortgaging the present for the future—losing sensibility, taste, refinement, and growing to be vulgar, mercenary, 'base, common and popular,' as the 'bard of Avon' (according to the play-bills) hath it, and your only gain the jingle of a few gold coins. Bah! what is life but a flower? Squeeze its fragrant essence at once, and fling the rest away. Ambition! the dream of a dolt, the besotted aspirations of an idiot. It's all the same, ambition for wealth or ambition for place. The applause of crowd? Bah! They throw up their sweaty caps and clap their chopped hands, so Coriolanus, boy, and suffocate you with their rotten breath, and call it all honor. Live, my boy, for what is around you and near you. Grasp the present with your whole strength, and never weight down a single pulse with forebodings of what is to come. By Jove, sir, it were better to live ten years than to stagnate a hundred."
               Rodman looked at his companion with astonishment, during this tirade. There was mingled with that spirit of recklessness so peculiar to him, a vein of irony, bitterness and disdain that he had never observed in him before, and which opened a new insight; into his character, or rather started new speculations as to what, in truth, his character might be.
               "You see," resumed Knowlton, with a mocking laugh so different from his usual gay one, "you see that I am a philosopher of the Epicurean school. Enjoy! Enjoy! What are talents, parts, abilities, intellect, heart or fame in this mass of dullness, blindness, idiotcy and rotteness, where cant, and fume, and fury, idiotic frenzy, besotted passions, grovelling desires, and noisy, deadly ambition, clash, and are hurled against each other in selfish fury; and men, like beasts of burden and beasts of prey, tear, destroy, and thrust each other down to rotten oblivion and reeking decay? It's a damned world, said Byron; and by heaven he knew it through and through?"
               He was not dissecting hearts, now, but strangely unfolding his own. Or was he, indeed, an actor always, and all this but stage effect? Was this but a masterstroke to complete his conquest over his companion's heart, moulding his passions to his own?
               "But how enjoy, with so frightful a picture of the world before one as you have drawn?" said Rodman, cooling before the outbreak of his companion.
               "Don't stir up the reeking mass. Hold yourself aloof, and look upon it, like Patience on a monument, smiling at its fury, whirl, impotence, and demoniac folly. Bah! I am a fool myself. I have fretted away more flesh on its account than it's all worth. I look so much down into the seething cauldron that, by Jove! I have imbibed some of its fume and froth. A cauldron, indeed with a broth more wildly mixed than that of the 
                     wierd
                     weird
                   sisters. We are all witches, and 'round about the cauldron go, and in the poisoned entrails throw.' We have our adder's forks and baboon's blood, and grease from the gibbet, to make the 'gruel thick and slab.'"
               The speaker laughed a loud, mocking laugh, that jarred painfully on Rodman's ear, and filled him with wonder. But in spite of himself be felt a strange fascination in Knowlton's dark philosophy—a wild, fierce delight, occasioned by the desperate character of his own thoughts.
               "You make us," said he, "slaves to our passions. We surely can master them—can rise above adversity and the world, and win for ourselves happiness and greatness."
               He was striving more to stem the course which his own feelings were leading, than to combat his companion's argument.
               "No," was the reply; "the divinity that shapes our ends, hew them as we will, laughs at the arrogance of the assumption. A man no more selects his own destiny, or determines what his life shall be, than he fashions his limbs, or gives vitality to his being. It is the wildest presumption, the besotted vanity of mole-blind fools, to arrogate otherwise. The snail thinks his home the world because he cannot see beyond it. Man believes himself the master of his own career, and does not see that he's a chip which wind and tide toss and chafe, and bear whichever way they list. He's the wisest man who sails upon the current, reckless of the end."
               "Strength and courage will surely accomplish."
               "Do we find strength and courage in high places? Does wisdom rule, and greatness conquer? Bah! Inflated pomp fills the world with sounding brass, and the golden ass is robed in the lion's skin. Truth sticks to the bottom of the well, and blind justice smells out, gold with unerring instinct. The laurel shadows the brow of the ignoble and degraded; the Muses sell their favors for pin-money; and Midas is set up for worship, ass's ears and all. We all fret our brief hour, like Shakspeare's poor player, and most of us do better service, turned to clay, and stopping a beer barrel, than ever before. Life is a carnival, It's the funniest farce ever acted. If one should die laughing at it, he would be entitled to a chaplet from Minerva."
               Yielding to this dark misanthropy—and there's a charm in this passion, that, paradoxical as it appears to be, youth oftentimes finds a strange delight in—Rodman vehemently and recklessly fell in with Knowlton's mood.
               "I believe with you," exclaimed he "I grow indifferent to everything—reckless of everything. Enjoyment here after, for me."
               "Ah! Rod, that's better than the philosopher's stone. Shadows shift, you know, and where it's gloom, now, the sun will shine in good time. So never mourn over the present, but laugh and hope for the future."
               "Hope has cheated me all my life. I will not trust to it more."
               "What, are you convinced, Rod, that your Dulcinea is only a jilt, after all?"
               "You must not speak of that subject, Knowlton."
               "A wound that won't bear probing, eh?"
               "Mr. Knowlton"—
               "Rod, you are in trouble—I can see it. Some blow must have fallen upon you, to have caused the violent agitation you were in when we met, just now. Well, well, Rod, don't look as if you would tear me. Here we are at the inn door. Let's banish low spirits, and over a good supper, grow cheerful again. We'll sup and smoke, and you shall see your despondency disappear with your cigar."
               Calmed down to a stolid, callous recklessness, Rodman assented, and they entered the inn together. Knowlton had resumed his usual careless, gay manner. Every sign of his late dark, acrimonious spirit was gone.
               They supped together, and Rodman could scarcely realize the change that came over his feelings. He fell completely beneath the spell of his companion's words. Knowlton, indeed, was unusually brilliant. He abounded in the happiest conceptions—his wit was by turns genial and satirical—full of a happy humor, and lit up by flashes of lurid light. Rodman yielded to the enjoyment of the moment, but his laugh was unusually boisterous, and his mirth seemed to possess a kind of wild feverishness.
               Knowlton, indeed, was availing himself of all his subtle powers, and taxing himself to the utmost, to complete his conquest over his companion. He left nothing untried; and brought to bear all his peculiar fascination of manner, all his skill in the human heart, all his profound knowledge of human nature.
               He succeeded, and before they parted for the night, Rodman agreed to accompany him to New York on the morrow, and to present himself at Mrs. Carlton's house.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XX.
               "LOVE, THE DISTURBING SPIRIT OF THE WORLD."
               AFTER the abrupt departure of Rodman from the presence of Mr. Waldron and Blanche, as previously described, Mr. Waldron bowed calmly to his ward, and, without speaking, left the room. Blanche hastened to her own apartment, and did not appear again that evening. At the breakfast-table the next morning Mr. Waldron was not present. He had shut himself up in his library, where he remained until nearly twelve o'clock, when he descended, mounted his horse, and rode rapidly off alone the northern road. In about two hours he returned, heated, dusty, and his steed foaming. He threw the bridle to a servant, and went directly to his library, without exchanging a word with any one.
               About an hour after sunset, as Blanche was seated upon the verandah, her hand supporting her head, and her craze fixed steadfastly upon the "o'erhanging firmament," Mr. Waldron approached, and stood silently by her side. Blanche's thoughts were so much engrossed that she did not observe him.
               "Miss Dearwood," said he, after a pause. There was no answer.
               "Miss Dearwood does not deign to hear me," said he. Blanche turned quickly, and looked at him inquiringly. Mr. Waldron was startled at the expression of deep feeling that rested upon her features. Her eyes were dilated to an unusual fullness, and beaming with an unwonted depth. Her bosom was slightly heaving, and her cheek was flushed with the thought that had been awakened into being.
               "I have interrupted some pleasing revery," said Mr. Waldron, stepping back as if to retire. Blanche brushed the hair back from her brow with a nervous action and answered in low, tremulous tones:
               "It was nothing sir."
               "Was it the beauty of the stars that so engrossed you, Blanche; or was it some emotion of the heart?" inquired Mr. Waldron, coming up to her again.
               "I do not know," replied Blanche, her voice still low, and full of expression, "but my thoughts for an instant carried me beyond myself. Beauty has the power sometimes, has it not, sir, to fill us with strange, almost etherealized, emotions?"
               "Beauty? Yes! And beauty in its most transcendent form, which is human, is a witchery which there is no spell to exorcise. Blanche—Blanche—" his voice trembled, his lips quivered, and he turned away hastily to obtain the mastery of his feelings.
               "I want to ask you, Blanche," said he, a moment afterwards, speaking with forced calmness, "when you propose for us to resume our studies? We have been sadly neglectful since my return."
               "I submit, sir, to the time you shall appoint," said Blanche almost unconsciously permitting herself to fall into the reserved, cold manner which of late she had found it almost impossible to avoid in her interviews with her guardian.
               "I do not ask, my dear ward, for submission. That is a harsh word, and a strange word for you to use. You remember that we agreed long ago not to be pupil and tutor, but fellow students, don't you?"
               "Yes, sir."
               "Then let us resume our books upon some mutual agreement."
               "I am ready at any moment, Mr. Waldron."
               "Blanche, I do not like this cold compliance."
               "Sir."
               "You do not act towards me as you used to do. You persist in a cold and reserved manner when in my presence. I would like to know the cause."
               "I—I—sir—really," stammered out Blanche.
               Mr. Waldron sprang to his feet and walked away. Presently he came back. There was a perspiration mantling his brow, a flush upon his cheek, and an unusual dilatation to his eye. He drew a chair close to her side, and took her hand.
               "Let me hear you say, Blanche," said he "that your manner does not arise from any fear, any doubt, any harsh thought of your guardian."
               Blanche's hand trembled in his, and her head sank upon her breast.
               "Blanche!"
               "My dear guardian," murmured Blanche, for a moment feeling her former trust and belief in him coming back upon her heart.
               Mr. Waldron nervously wiped the perspiration from his brow, and then bent forward with an air of fixed determination. He took her hand again, which he had dropped.
               "My dear ward," said he, "I have much to say to you."
               Blanche looked up, and he paused. After an inward struggle, he resumed.
               "My ward, let me unfold to you the history of a heart—a heart whose beatings I knew almost as well as those of my own. There was one—a friend let me call him—who in his early days received, it matters not how, a blow, a wound, a grief, that crushed his heart, filled it with the weightiest sorrow, and sent him a restless and miserable wanderer through the countries of the world. Time assuaged his grief, if it did not heal it. He ceased after a while to mourn, and he began to build hopes for the future. His affections were warm and ardent, notwithstanding the trial they had undergone. He became again, what he had been in his youth, a seeker after sympathy. This desire became his passion, his cherished dream. It chanced that a friend died, establishing him in his will the guardian of his youthful daughter. He accepted the trust with alacrity and eagerness. His ward was fair, most fair, and full of many graces and glorious qualities. He saw at once that she could supply his mental wants and afford him that sympathy of which he had been a dreamer. He constituted himself her tutor, in order that he might be brought closer into contact with her mind. Their lives now flowed on together, and for a little while he thought himself happy—beyond the reach of the past, secure in the enjoyment of a peaceful present. But his peace of mind forsook him. He had, in all his fancied wisdom, misconceived and misunderstood his own heart. He was now, for the first time clearly and truly to read it. He saw that this sympathy, this responsive union of taste, feeling, and mind, was an etherealised essence that grew out of a passion that sinks deeper in the human heart, and grasps it firmer than any other thing."
               
               With a fixed expression of silent wonder, Blanche contemplated her companion. He resumed—
               "His discovery filled him with dismay. The exquisite qualities of his ward, the radiant grace that shone about her, the pure virginal flow of her thoughts, the inexpressible beauty that lived in every lineament, in every motion, in every word, in every look, thrilled im with a kind of ecstasy, but, at the same time, stirred up in his bosom a contending war of duties, passions, fears, and hopes. His desires aspired to win her, but his duty restrained them. his heart yearned passionately, but his stern will held it still and pulseless in his bosom. He knew very well that it was a wild, an irrational, and an unwise passion. He knew very well that her youth, in its June freshness, glowing with its ardent, fresh, happy emotions, could never unite its virgin love to his old, sad heart. For he was old, so said the world, but so did not say the flow of affections and yearnings in his bosom. He knew these things, and yet hope would spring up in despite of this knowledge. His passions urged him on, his fears held him back. Many a time the confession hung upon his lips, but was forced back into the recesses of his bosom. But once, upon an occasion like this—"
               With a wild cry, Blanche sprang to her feet, but Mr. Waldron caught her hand.
               "Blanche, I throw off the mask," exclaimed he. "You must have surmised the truth in the story I have told you. Blanche, I do not ask—"
               "Mr. Waldron, Mr. Waldron!"
               "I do not ask," resumed he, with a passionate fire burning in his eye, "that you should yield to me now the wealth of your love. I only plead for kindness, I only plead for the privilege of hoping."
               "Sir, sir!" She struggled in his grasp, and trembled violently.
               "Blanche, hear me out now, after what I've said to you. It is not so impossible for one as aged even as I am to love, and to love well. The heart that has so long sought a harbor will rejoice when one is found at last. Believe this much of me, at least, Blanche, that what I offer you is a love as wide, as deep, and as true as love of the heart can be."
               "Do not detain me, Mr. Waldron."
               "Blanche, hear me yet. There is a wild commotion in my heart that will have words, but I will strive to speak them with mildness. Blanche, I know how ill my age, and care, and withered heart, comports with your blooming youth; I know what a wild, misguided hope it is that seeks the union of our two hearts; I know how I expose myself to the censure of the world, and, what is more, to your old condemnation also. It would have been wiser—oh, how much wiser!—if, at the first, I had conquered and destroyed this passion; but now it has grown to be a mighty thing beyond my control. Its power is impelling me to speak flow, even while a hot shame is burning in my ears—even while my judgment condemns. I am not young, but what can youth know of passion like that which I feel? My life has been schooled in emotion, and my heart nurtured into an exquisite susceptibility to all beautiful things. Where it flings its love, it flings its life's pulse; that which it loves it loves with no alloy of selfishness or vanity, but with the weight, and power, and uttermost capacity of its being."
               "Alas! Alas!" exclaimed Blanche, wringing her hands.
               "You love another," abruptly replied her guardian, almost fiercely. She turned away and did not answer.
               
               "Do not think," resumed he, "that your fancy for this Moore, for now I see that you have conceived for him a girlish whim, do not think that it can prosper. I tell you, Blanche, that he is a miserable trickster. Forget him."
               Blanche darted away, as if to escape, but in an instant he was by her side, grasping her hand again.
               "Hear me yet. I know that I am not master of myself, that I am borne away by a wild torrent, uncontrollable in its strength and its purpose, and you can gather from the change it is working in me, how truly deep and strong it is. Emotions that have long slept, passions that have lain dormant, have sprung up the more vigorous from their long repose, fed, indeed, by the cultivation of sympathies and sensibilities. The outward calmness that I have ever shown, was but ashes that crusted the fire. I knew myself what a volcano slumbered beneath, but others did not. You have stirred up its hidden fires; your beauty, and yet not your beauty, but that something which invests you, and breathes from you like a radiance—this it is that unmasks me now, and displays the fiery, nature of my heart. Blanche, Blanche, for twenty years I have dreamed of love, aspired for love, longed for love. I have found it, and you possess the wonderful power to make it a blessing or an evil."
               "I implore you, Mr. Waldron, I implore you," was Blanche's husky words, as she strove to unclasp his hand.
               But a fiery heat was mounting in Mr. Waldron's face. All his philosophy, his temper, his wisdom, his genial grace, were being swept away by the swelling surge of his passions. The veins grew swollen on his brow, and there was a blazing light in his eye.
               "Blanche, I love you. Hear me say it, and do no turn from me. I love you as strong hearts only can love, with a passion that breaks down every bulwark of conscience, restraint, or command; with a passion—"
               Blanche heard no more. He had unclasped her hand, and breaking away from him, with trembling limbs and a palpitating heart, she hurried into the house, sped with fleeing and frightened steps along the hall and up the stairway, and bursting into her own apartment, closed the door and held it shut. Her face was pale, her eyes dilated, her hair, dishevelled and wild, hung about her cheeks, and her frame shook so violently she could scarcely stand.
               Listening, and hearing no sound, she staggered forward and flung herself upon her knees by her couch, clasping her hands together with anguish.
               "O, my father! my father!" exclaimed she, with thrilling tones, "by what evils am I beset, by what snares am I surrounded? I am betrayed, betrayed by him who should have protected, and there is none to guide or to cherish me! Father, father, guard me, save me, look down from heaven and protect me!"
               Blanche's agitation was uncontrollable. Every muscle quivered, her teeth chattered, her head throbbed, while her eyes were expanded startingly.
               She rose up from the floor, and began to pace the room, pressing her hands to her head as if a sharp pain was shooting through it.
               She had taken but a few turns, when the door slowly opened, and Amelia entered, looking sad and grave.
               Blanche looked at her for a moment, and then rushed to her, flung herself in her arms, and burst into passionate tears.
               Fluttering and trembling like a hunted and frightened bird, Blanche clung wildly to Amelia, while she poured out bitter tears upon her bosom. Soothingly and tenderly Amelia led her to a seat, and folding her arms around the weeping girl, held her close to her heart until her convulsive sobs grew less frequent. After a time they ceased altogether; but Amelia could feel occasional tremors run through her frame. When she was entirely calm and composed, Amelia spoke to her:
               "Blanche," said she, "let me persuade you to retire—your nerves have received a shock, and repose is necessary."
               Blanche looked up and said:
               "Do you know all?"
               "I am not entirely ignorant of what has occurred."
               "Amelia, I cannot understand it. My mind is in chaos—everything appears terribly unreal. It is impossible—I cannot believe it. Tell me, tell me, my dear Amelia, that it is imagination, dreaming—tell me that what my heart says is untrue—tell me that my ears have deceived, my senses misled me!"
               "Alas! poor girl!"
               "Ah! Amelia, I thought he was my father. I called him so. It was a delight to bestow the name upon him. He seemed to me so lofty, so good, so noble, and now—"
               She stopped abruptly.
               Amelia did not reply to these remarks; she only urged her to retire.
               "To-morrow, Blanche, we will be enabled to think clearer and talk wiser. Do not let us give utterance to our feelings to-night, or at least utter them only to Heaven, with the trust that prayer will soothe them."
               Blanche mechanically complied with Amelia's request, and began her preparations for retiring.
               Amelia did not leave her until her head was nestled in her pillow, when fervently kissing her cheek, she bade her "good night!"
               Descending the stairs, she entered the drawing-room which was lit only by the star-light that entered the open windows, and faintly penetrated the gloom, through which with a wild and irregular step her brother was striding to and fro. She approached him, and placed her hand upon his shoulder.
               "What have you done?" said she in a low voice.
               "Betrayed my trust, proved faithless to my honor."
               "Ah, Gilbert!"
               "Yielded to a passion that in my blind vanity I believed I could control; destroyed for ever my self-respect and my peace of mind."
               "Your remorse, brother, borrows its keenness from your delicate appreciation of honor."
               "See now," resumed he, "how well twenty years of philosophy stands the test. Where was that mastery of passion that I fancied myself to possess? Where was that strength that so many years of schooling, and struggling, and stern effort, I had vainly imagined had given my heart? Oh! philosophy, and wisdom, and will, and courage, what are you all before the flood of one passion? Weakness, poverty, degradation!"
               "My brother!"
               "And yet, Amelia, I might have been true to myself but for one cause. The thought of another possessing that which I so yearned for, galled me, filled me with bitterness. I could not bear the idea of a rival. The very name of this person, who was, so unwisely permitted to become Blanche's companion, was offensive to me. It was the thought of him that undermined my strength, and opened the breach for the outflow of my passion. And she loves him! I see it, and feel it."
               "There is an affection between them. I cannot doubt, but it way be merely friendship."
               
               "But he is gone, fled. I doubt his honesty. He gave us no information of his family. He is, to all appearance, an adventurer, and must not again meet with Blanche. But do you, sister, endeavor to soothe and heal her agitated heart. I am once more master of my reason, and if I cannot subdue and bind down this passion, I must resign my trust, and avoid her presence—once more plunge into the world for relief and cure of the heart. See to her, Amelia, cherish her, and if you can speak anything that will soften her judgment of me, have charity for me and do so. Leave me now, leave me."
               Amelia obeyed, and he flung himself upon a chair by the window, where the night air could fan his feverish brow. And so seated, hour after hour passed on, while calm, immovable, with his gaze fixed steadfastly upon the starry sky, his head upon his hand, thought after thought came trooping through his mind; the past, the present, and the future came before him in visions and in dreams—all his thoughts, his emotions, his passions, his memories, his desires—full of a vivid intensity and a transparent clearness, as if by some process his mind had freed itself from its earthly ligaments, and was lifted to a transcendent power, above its natural limits.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               THE TOWN—MRS. CARLTON—THE PLAY.
               TWILIGHT was settling down upon the city in a maze of dust and dusk, as Mr. Knowlton and Rodman stepped on shore from the boat on which they had journeyed down the river. It was at that hour more than any other, when the greatest turmoil and confusion prevail in the lower precincts of the town. The many throated public were vociferous in the transports of suspended labor, and came pouring out of huge, smoky, cavernous looking buildings in noisy throngs. The stage horses and cart horses were dashing hither and thither in impetuous fury, while the stage tops creaked under bone and sinew, and "seats for twelve" expanded to the capacity of a baker's dozen or so of democratic muscle. The crowds on the sidewalks were flowing in a thick and sturdy stream, an eddying, struggling, jostling, fretting current, that engulfed and swept the pedestrian irresistibly on. Vagabondising organs were grinding out discord—shrill-throated news-boys thundered, in soprano, their customary cries—hackmen were clamoring and fighting for fares with noisy volubility; and amid all the clatter and fury of the scene, forlorn and ragged fruit women were presiding over their little piles of apples and peanuts with a serenity and calmness so perfect that one might well question if "all the fiends of hell" could have disturbed their repose.
               
               Seeking out one, of the more quiet avenues, Knowlton and Rodman wended their way together.
               "Shall we pay our respects to Mrs. Carlton to-night," said Knowlton, as soon as they found themselves in sufficient quiet to hear each other; "she will be anxious to learn of your return from your rural jaunt."
               Rodman assented.
               "Rod," resumed Knowlton, "you are melancholy, low-spirited still—that is if your dejected 'havior denote you truly. Come, come, let the devil wear black, my noble Hamlet, and do you eschew melancholy. Can nothing that I can do animate you?"
               "You are mistaken, Mr. Knowlton, I am not so sad as you think."
               "It's folly to be sad at all. Come, I see that Macready acts to-night. Werner, too. My favorite part—and one so crammed full of melancholy that it will send yours to the beam, and by its very preponderance overcome it. Shall we go?"
               Rodman, who certainly was anxious to escape from the weight upon his heart, and full of a feverish desire to drown his thoughts in excitement, and experiencing, too, the effects of Knowlton's epicurean philosophy, readily assented. In his sullen recklessness he was ready to fling himself into any pleasure or dissipation.
               "That's well," said Knowlton; "and here we are at Mrs. Carlton, door. We will pay our brief respects to the lady, and arrange for a supper after the play, when we can discourse upon your prospects and projects."
               Mrs. Carlton's residence was situated in Chambers street, which was not then, as now, filled with stately warehouses. It is true that its high reputation as an aristocratic quarter was passing away, but there were a few old families who still adhered to its ancient glories. Among them as Mrs. Carlton. Her house was quite a plain, unpretending mansion of brick, colored to a pleasant shade of brown, and avoiding those violent contrasts of color so common in metropolitan architecture. A couple of locusts that stood before it gave an agreeable freshness to its aspect, and a few flowers that showed through its windows, invested it with a cheerful grace.
               Ushered into the drawing-room, our two friends seated themselves to await the response of Mrs. Carlton to their call. Perfectly quiet in tone, and yet sumptuously rich, the rooms of Mrs. Carlton were models of taste and refinement. Every article of furniture or decoration selected with so much artistic taste, and with a view to the general effect, that the eye, at first, only filled with the picture as a whole, would, at its leisure, wander from object to object, with sensations of pleasure. The few pictures that adorned the walls, the occasional bust that filled a niche, the tinted ceiling, the heavily curtained windows, the interspersed groups in bronze and marble, the many little objects that so evidenced an exquisite appreciation of the graceful and the elegant, all these presented no startling effects, were not dazzling nor brilliant, but simply and purely elegant. In the whole decoration of the rooms the ornate was carefully avoided. Perfect simplicity and perfect grace were the principles that spoke out in everything.
               The gentlemen had not been seated long when a step was heard, and in a moment more there entered slowly and with stateliness, a somewhat tall lady, with an olive tint upon her cheek, an eye dark and dazzling, and a brow from which the jetty locks swept smoothly back in a Grecian band. At the first glance, it would have been somewhat difficult for an observer to have decided as to the age of this lady. Her form was yet youthful in its symmetry, but her face, even with its smooth brow, and rounded cheek, gave evidence either in its expression, or in the line or two that could be seen at the corners of the eyes, of an age approaching the meridian. She was, in fact, nearly forty, but so well preserved that very few supposed her to be more than thirty.
               As she entered the room, Mr. Knowlton went up to her and took her hand.
               "My dear madam," said he, "I have brought with me our friend who has just returned from his rural jaunt."
               Perceiving, then, for the first, that Mr. Knowlton's companion was her protege, Rodman Moore, Mrs. Carlton went hastily up to him and offered her hand.
               "I am very glad you have come back, Rodman."
               "You are very kind, Mrs. Carlton. I thank you, I'm sure."
               "I have been very much alarmed," continued the lady, in a calm but full and rounded voice; "I was afraid that some ill had befallen you."
               "No ill," rejoined Rodman with a sigh.
               "That is well. A little rural pleasure jaunt you went on, I suppose. But really, Rodman, I should have thought it more kind of you if you had confided in me your purpose. You know that we agreed to be friends."
               "We did, madam. Or rather, I should say, you honored me by the bestowal of your friendship, and I made an ungrateful return. But, my dear lady, we are not masters of ourselves, and sometimes passions consume and control us."
               "Pardon me, Mrs. Carlton," broke in Mr. Knowlton, "but Rodman and I have conspired together against your hospitality. We propose going to see 'Werner,' to-night, and after the play, to enjoy, at your hands, a little supper."
               "You did right, gentlemen, in what you purposed, and only anticipated what I should have been glad to suggest, myself."
               "Rodman, my dear madam, comes back to us full of ambitious purposes, and I proposed the supper as affording an excellent opportunity to discuss his prospects all together. Rod is very anxious to become either an Astor or a Webster. I believe he hasn't decided yet, which of those gentlemen to emulate. I tried to assist his judgment by holding up to him Epicurus."
               "Ah! Robert, your philosophy is not altogether Epicurean. It is tainted with cynicism."
               Knowlton laughed a low mocking laugh.
               "You misjudge me, madam, believe me. Enjoyment is the only thing I covet, the only thing upon which I have a thought. But absolutely, if we go to the play to-night"—
               "First," interrupted Mrs. Carlton, "take a dish of tea with me. You have time enough."
               The gentlemen assented, and Mrs. Carlton led the way to a perfect bijou of a little room, with a few twigs burning in a grate, for it was a cool September evening, and a little table drawn up, on which reposed a salver and glittering tea furniture of silver. The room was hung round with cabinet pictures. A small, book-case stood on each side of the mantel jam, crowded with miniature editions of the poets and old authors. In one corner stood a harp, that graceful instrument, so generally banished for the piano, and about it lay scattered a few pieces of music. A couple of bird-cages were suspended from the window, and a vase of flowers stood upon the mantel. A half-opened work-table had been thrust aside, leaving part of its contents trailing upon the floor. An open book lay upon the rug, and a portfolio of sketches had been tossed upon a sofa, with its sheets flying about in confusion. This ensemble of negligence and elegance gave to the whole room an air of exceeding pleasantness.
               The little party of three seated themselves, and while they partook of their slight repast, their conversation touched only upon a few light and unimportant subjects. Knowlton was easy and graceful; Mrs. Carlton calm, impressive, but always in perfect repose. Her intonation and enunciation were so perfect, her language always so precise, and her style so clear and simple, that her conversation exercised a quiet but a decided influence upon all who heard her.
               The repast was brief, and when the two gentlemen rose to depart, Mrs. Carlton reminded them of their engagement to supper. They both promised to be punctual, and as they passed out, to Rodman she gave her hand.
               The theatre was already quite full as the two gentlemen seated themselves in a box, and prepared themselves to listen to the play.
               Rodman was a novice in all dramatic matters. His experience of the stage was limited to the witnessing of two or three indifferently bad performances. Macready he had never seen, and he had but little idea of the wonderful perfection to which the art had been brought by the genius of this artist.
               "Werner is Macready's greatest part," said Knowlton; "his rendering of it is one of the most terrible and impressive creations in art. If Byron had only lived to have seen it!"
               The curtain went up, and Rodman soon became painfully and intensely absorbed in the play. The part of Werner was to him only too terribly real. The unhappy man's bitter misanthropy, the depth and keenness of his anguish, the wailing cry of his broken heart, his sickness, his poverty, his wrongs, all spoke out so thrillingly in the actor's assumption, that Rodman was fairly spell bound by the mastery of the art.
               And the story, too, awoke in him many emotions. The situation of father and son; the passionate love bestowed on the one side, and the coldness, disdain, repugnance on the other, although reversed relatively from his case, yet it stimulated his interest to a painful degree. And when, at last, overwhelmed by the knowledge of the son's crime, crushed and torn by his disdainful words, the heart rolled back upon itself, and broke beneath its weight of agony, the actor was so fearfully real, the broken groans that burst from him seemed indeed so to convulse his bosom, that Rodman with a thrill of emotion buried his face in his hands and shut out the scene.
               Knowlton during the play had said but little. He watched the stage when the principal actor was upon it, almost as intently as Rodman did, but at other times his gaze would wander listlessly, about the house. In the intervals between the acts he spoke but little, seemingly desirous of not weakening the effect of the play upon the mind of Rodman by distracting his thoughts. Once, however, he exclaimed:
               "What do you think of Ulric, Rodman?"
               "Bold, brilliant, daring, able, but alas! heartless, soulless. His character is more truly painful than the sufferings of the father even."
               "But a mind to conquer, to beat the world at its own hollowness, to wing a lofty flight."
               "To conquer, regardless of the hearts he would trample down."
               
               "Hearts! well, it's a current bit of sentiment that losers always play, but diamonds, my boy, is the only suit for the winner."
               He was interrupted by Rodman suddenly starting up in an agitated manner, and proposing to leave the theatre.
               "What's the matter, Rod?"
               "Elwood is there, watching us, and for the world I would not see him."
               "Elwood! what, our eccentric friend, under whose auspices you grew rusty over Blackstone?"
               "Yes, I wish to avoid him."
               "Don't be alarmed, Rod. He seems to have felt a similar aversion to meeting you—for look, there he disappears through the door, his head in one of its maddest vibrative fits. But why not meet him, Rod?"
               Rodman turned away his head, and at that moment the rise of the act drop afforded him an opportunity to avoid answering Knowlton's query.
               At the close of the play, as they were slowly moving along in the crowd, Rodman felt a hand laid upon his shoulder. He looked around and saw that it was Elwood.
               "Good gracious, boy. Where have you been?" exclaimed that gentleman. Knowlton came instantly to Rodman's relief, and drew him off into the crowd, and at the same instant a rush through, one of the doors threw a mass of people between them.
               "Elwood," said Knowlton laughing, "is somewhat nonplussed. He stands there looking after us, gogling and bobbing furiously."
               Passing on together, arm-in-arm, in the thick of the crowd, they encountered two gentlemen loudly discussing the morality of the drama.
               "Iniquity and immorality" said one.
               "The school of manners and morals," was the reply.
               "The haunt of vice and idleness."
               "The home of art, and elegance, and poetry."
               "The resort of gamblers and libertines."
               "Calculated to elevate."
               "Designed to degrade."
               The crowd pushed them on, and this elegant example of cut and thrust was abruptly terminated.
               As Knowlton took Rodman's arm as they walked off from the theatre, he exclaimed, with a loud laugh—
               "Ah! this cant that you find everywhere. People catch at sounds and shadows and believe they are hugging reason and truth. The theatre now, iniquitous and immoral, the mouthpiece of Shakspeare; the theatre a school of manners and morals, with its lascivious dances, its stilted conventionalisms, its vulgarities, coarseness, glitter, and flimsiness. But so reasons reason, and men call it majestic."
               "In what way, sir, do you reason of the stage?"
               "As an excellent narcotic, a drone, a dead ass, a spasmodic skeleton."
               "But you like Macready."
               "Humph! Macready isn't the stage. There are a few great lights, but the most part is paint and tinsel, bombast and fustian, noise and fury signifying nothing. Shakspeare's periwig-pated fellow, who having neither the accent of Christian, nor the gait of Christian, Pagan, nor man, so strutted, bellowed, and imitated humanity so abominably, has his thousand counterparts with us."
               "This Macready is much esteemed. He appears to be greatly popular."
               "Bah! Popular! A thing so uncertain and changeable that I do not know of anything to which it can be compared pared. Applause! Its breath is rotten; fulsome, craven, licking your hand like a dog, noisy and passionate; but to-morrow a breath or a word—and it's all changed to clamor and hate. I tell you the public is always either a fool or a wolf. It will caress you to-day, tear you to-morrow. We may live to see Macready now, for a cause as weightless as a feather, hooted, and torn, and trampled."
               The bitter vein again, the sneering, mocking laugh.
               "To me," said Rodman, "the stage is poetry. Its fascinations are greater than even I dare own to myself."
               "The stage," said Knowlton, "might be a beauty and a glory. It is poetry, and painting, and music, and sculpture—all arts in one. There never can be an institution so capable of influencing, educating, elevating the people, because there never can be an institution that will so speak to the imagination, to the passions, to the hearts of the people. But the stage blindly maligned and senselessly abandoned by those who alone can lift it to its proper dignity, sinks to an indifferent instrument, working its modicum of good and evil, sowing good seeds in pure soils, and bad seeds in evil ones. But while Shakspeare speaks through the stage, it must have its own greatness, and while, on the other hand, it caters for a depraved public, feeding their lascivious tastes and their brutalized appetites, its stigma is degradation, evil. Instead of purifying the taste it corrupts it. Instead of a school of manners, it is a school of coarse wit, ribald jests, flash elegance, affectation, and mannerisms. And yet, by Jove, the stage is not naturally all this, and there is through it all, even now, gleams of greatness and glory.
               "But, pshaw! It is absurd, now don't you think so, for me to put in rest a lance for or against it? What matters? The world is always a harmonious discord. There is ever method in its madness. Its elements clash together, and it tears, pulls down, and grows rotten, each part in keeping with the whole. As the stage has grown recreant and depraved, so has the pulpit, the bar, politics, literature, and so on to the end. Let the world roll on as it will. I take what comes, fortunes' buffets and rewards, with equal thanks."
               "Your philosophy, Mr. Knowlton, is a strange mixture. I cannot understand it."
               Knowlton laughed.
               "Never mind, Rod. You can't be more puzzled to make out what it is than I am myself. I have a heart, I think, and a brain, so say the Phrenologists, and this heart and this brain play at cross purposes. I give them a free rein, and let them lead me where they will. And they often lead me adverse ways, for they are separate establishments. Reason fires away about right and wrong, and sets up for the world very pretty ethics, even while the heart is acting out underhand a bit of wicked by-play. I wonder, Rod, if I am only an odd waif in the human family, or if the world indeed be all like me.
               "But it doesn't matter a pin's throw. Here we are at Mrs. Carlton's door."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               A CONFERENCE.
               "MY dear Mrs. Carlton, we are delighted to be punctual," exclaimed Knowlton, as that lady came forward to receive Rodman and himself upon being ushered into the supper-room—the same little elegant cabinet which was briefly described in the preceding chapter.
               Mrs. Carlton smiled her placid smile, and thanked them for keeping their appointment. "The supper," she said, "was already served," and placing Rodman on her right hand, and Knowlton on her left, she took her place at the head of the board.
               Knowlton started off talking at once in his rattling way, now gay, light and dashing, and sometimes acrimoniously bitter and misanthropical. Mrs. Carlton listened mostly, her large, round, burning eye fixed attentively upon the speaker, and the perfect repose of her manner rarely disturbed either by flashes of thought or bursts of merriment. When Rodman spoke, however, a faint tinge would 
                     apparantly
                     apparently
                   mount her dark but clear cheek, and a gleam of more than usual brightness would shoot from her eye. When she spoke herself, her voice was round, full and very quiet; and, as before remarked, her words were always enunciated so perfectly, that they exercised a decided influence upon her hearers.
               Her dress was a dark blue silk, close fitting, with no ornament ment save a gold chain that hung suspended from her neck. Her hair was brushed back smooth and straight, after the Grecian mould—a style that well became the classic contour of her face, the beautiful shape of her head, and the stately grace with which it was carried.
               But, notwithstanding the sweet placid smile that played about her lips; notwithstanding the calm and perfect repose of her manner, it was impossible for Rodman to look into her eye, or feel its flash upon him, without being convinced that under that calm exterior there slumbered strong feelings. Sometimes, indeed, there were flashes that would amount her olive cheek into her brow, and blaze fiercely in her eyes; and tremors would often run shiveringly through her frame, but all the rest was a closed volume that Rodman often desired to read.
               Her tenderness for him was always marked from the first. Whether her interest was merely stimulated by his forlorn state, or whether some deeper motive actuated her, Rodman could never determine. Not disposed naturally to be suspicious, yet the ripe acquaintance that existed between her and Knowlton sometimes filled his mind with painful doubts and speculations as to her real motives.
               "As you have returned from your jaunt, Rodman," said Mrs. Carlton in one of the pauses of the conversation, after they had been seated some time, "do you intend resuming your studies with Elwood?"
               "Not with Elwood, madam."
               "Ah!"
               "Rodman," said Knowlton, "has come back to us ambitious to make a name. The question is, what pursuit shall he adopt?"
               "What has so fired your ambition, Rodman?"
               "Love," laughed Knowlton, "so I gather from his blushes and embarrassment whenever the mischievous god is named."
               "Love!" exclaimed Mrs. Carlton, flushing deeply.
               "Romance, my dear lady," said Knowlton, "must be acted by the best of us for once in our life. Rodman has been playing the episode set down for him."
               "Mr. Knowlton, you will not let Rodman speak for himself."
               "I have nothing to say, madam. Mr. Knowlton is only indulging in a little pleasantry."
               "And there is no truth in what he asserts?"
               "Mrs. Carlton, do not force me to a confession."
               "Ah! Rodman, we are not friends yet, I see."
               "My dear lady, there are things that cannot be spoken to any ear."
               The lady turned away with an expression of pain.
               "There is no nearer thing," resumed she, "than friendship. When that is perfect and whole, when the sympathy is entire, the heart lays itself open to its very centre. But do not think I urge you, Rodman. Whatever you render up in the way of friendship, let it be voluntarily and freely."
               "Madam, I am honored by your friendship, and if I alone were concerned I would open my heart to you willingly."
               "Well, well, I'll not say more. But tell me, why will you not return to Elwood, or what do you propose for yourself?"
               "A way, my dear madam, to attain a speedy independence."
               "A new profession?"
               "There I am unadvised. You have promised to aid me with your judgment."
               "Let us think, then," replied Mrs. Carlton, musingly, "which one will best suit you?"
               "What do you say, Rod, to gallipot and lancets?"
               "In none would it be so difficult and tedious to attain success," said Rodman.
               "Think you'd be likely to act the starved apothecary in good earnest, eh?"
               "I am afraid so, sir."
               "What would you think of literature?" inquired Mrs. Carlton.
               "An author!" broke out Knowlton, "by Jove, don't propose for him to sink to that."
               "I have not the genius for such a pursuit," replied Rodman; "my pen is an untractable servant. I have no command over it."
               "Genius," laughed Knowlton, "how absurd! An author, my boy, is only superior to other people in two things, vanity and conceit. The world at large has quite enough of these two foibles, but imagination cannot conceive the immeasurable depth of an author's vanity or the sublimity of his conceit."
               "Rodman, then," said Mrs. Carlton, "is far from being qualified."
               "Authorship," resumed Knowlton, "is a trade that, once you have got the trick of, nothing is easier. A very few ideas, if judiciously managed, will make quite a stock in trade. Everything depends upon your tact in arranging and reproducing them, and if in an addition you can only burnish up a few ancient ones with a new varnish, success is as easy as lying. Bah! What are the books that pour from the press with airs so stately and assumption so grand? Don't be dazzled by all their glitter nor alarmed by their pomp. You've seen a kaleidoscope. See how inexhaustible its combinations appear, how beautiful, new, and brilliant. But pull it to pieces, and lo! it's nothing after all but a few bits of colored glass. The wonder was all in the handling. I need not point the moral, you can guess it well enough."
               Rodman shook his head, and thought of the mighty ones whose genius had ever filled him with the profoundest veneration.
               "But, absolutely," resumed Knowlton, "if you had genius it would be the worse for you. To succeed, the fine imagination, the delicate taste, the pure style of genius, would only be a bar. Coarseness, flash, morbid excitement, melodramatic clap-trap, and low wit, would catch popular applause to the echo, whilst your genius would die starving."
               "Mr. Knowlton," interrupted Mrs. Carlton, "you are too fond of the misanthropical side of things."
               "Positively, madam, most of my friends think me the pink of good nature."
               "I had better," broke in Rodman, "go back to law. I think that with six months more of close reading I could take a diploma."
               "And what then, Rod? Do you expect the golden fees to pour into your pockets at once?"
               "I expect only success as the reward of labor."
               "A sentiment worthy to rank with those immortal ones in the copy-books. But for Elwood—"
               "I cannot return to him. I have reasons."
               "And I have, too," said Mrs. Carlton, with a flush. Then, after a moment, she resumed. "But I know of a gentleman, of high rank in the profession, whom I think could be induced to receive you. But, perhaps, I am acting rashly. I am not sure, Rodman, that you would accept of my assistance."
               "Oh! madam, how can you say so? You are kind, you are generous, and gratefully I accept of your aid."
               "What is the name of your friend, Mrs. Carlton?" inquired Knowlton.
               "Oswald."
               "Oho!" laughed Knowlton, "I know. A strange creature. A bit of a churchman, and a bit of a sinner. A man who swears between his prayers, and who is ever ready to argue, fight, or curse for his church."
               "He is a Christian, I believe, in principle; but the victim of an unfortunate ancient habit, which his excitable temperament makes difficult for him to conquer. But, Rodman, shall we go to him to-morrow?"
               "I will be governed by you, madam," replied Rodman.
               Knowlton now rose from the table, and prepared to leave. Rodman was following his example, when Mrs. Carlton exclaimed—
               "Rodman, you havn't rooms anywhere, I'm sure. Be my guest for to-night. Knowlton goes to his hotel, but a few blocks distant; but for you I can offer accommodation."
               Rodman was about declining, but Mrs. Carlton came up to him, and, taking his hand, spoke in a voice so earnestly persuasive that he felt himself yielding.
               "You will stay, I'm sure," said she.
               Knowlton interrupted his reply by exclaiming—
               "He cannot deny you, Mrs. Carlton. Good night, madam. Good night, Rod." And, waving his hand, he retreated through the door, and closed it upon them.
               When they were left alone, Mrs. Carlton drew up a couple of easy chairs before the blaze in the grate, and led Rodman to one of them. Seating herself in the other, she leaned forward as if to address him, but, with her elbow resting upon the chair-arm, her gaze Wandered away, and she fell into a reverie. It lasted for some moments, during which a perfect silence reigned. At last, she suddenly exclaimed—
               "Rodman, what made you so abruptly leave us?"
               "You know my history, madam; what a strange thing it is. Is it a wonder that wild hopes should spring up—that new phases of it should suddenly appear. One day I thought I saw my father, whose face glanced before me in a crowd, and then disappeared. My absence was prompted by a vague hope of tracing him."
               "This mysterious father, Rodman, do you still feel for him that old and strong affection?"
               "I love his memory still; as I saw him in my childhood, I always see him. His form, his voice, his face, there was that about them all that drew me to him with a strong love."
               "The fancy of a boy, that I cannot understand how you should cling to so long. He abandoned you, forsook you. Do not think I mean to wound you, but we are always happier when we do not permit ourselves to be deluded. Let us now, simply and frankly, see what claim this parent has upon your love."
               "My dear lady, of what use? Doubts and fears of him crowd upon me fast enough, without seeking them."
               "Ah! Rodman, that great wealth of affection that you bear, is a suffering to yourself and no good to others. Rodman, do not bind up your present life so much with the past—with a remembrance merely—with a creation of your fancy!"
               Rodman was silent, but he involuntarily sighed. "If your father, pardon me, Rodman, but permit me to speak of this—if your father, I say, had ever borne to you but a small portion of that love you have entertained for him, he never could, no, Rodman, never could, have abandoned you, have allowed these long years to have elapsed, and never have come to claim you. It was a selfish policy that thrust you away from him in the first place, and it is a selfish policy that has kept you in ignorance of your birth ever since. Why love a father who has cast you off? Why love a father who could abandon your tender infancy to a life so cold and harsh as the one to which you were consigned—a father who denies you his name, his heart, who excludes you from his fire-side, as he would a dog—who hides you from his sight—who wraps himself up in a mystery, that you cannot penetrate—who would even by this very abandonment imply a shame upon your birth?"
               "Oh, say no more, madam. All that you urge I feel keenly. It is the sharpest pain I have, to reflect, that I am dreaded as a disgrace by the very one I have so deeply, enthusiastically worshipped so long."
               "You will then, hereafter, live for those, who, unlike him, cling to you, open their hearts to you?"
               "For others! Yes."
               "Ah! Rodman, our hearts are not unlike."
               "Madam!"
               "Rodman, Rodman, I had a son once, for whom my heart yearns and is filled with passionate love. He has passed away from me. My outstretched arms cannot reach him. The beating of my heart he cannot feel. I would fling myself upon him as you would fling yourself upon your father. I would pour the fullness of my love into his ear. I would kneel to him, cast down my life at his feet. But it cannot be. I have only his memory to cherish."
               Rodman was astounded at this passionate outbreak of his companion. Her manner, too, spoke louder than her words. The paleness that overspread her cheek, succeeded by a deep flush; her eyes that were suffused with tears; the quivering of her lips—these denoted the power of the hidden grief that lay upon her.
               "Mrs. Carlton," exclaimed Rodman, taking her hand. "I sympathize with you, believe me."
               "Your own experience teaches you how to sympathize."
               "Our griefs have indeed been similar."
               "And fate, Rodman, has strangely brought us together."
               "Strange, strange!" replied Rodman musingly.
               "But, Rodman!" exclaimed Mrs. Carlton with earnest passion, and seizing the two hands of her companion; "do you not perceive how fate has ordained this for our good? Do you not see how we may be mutually happy?"
               Rodman looked at her bewildered and surprised.
               "Rodman, is it that you would reject what I would offer, or do you not understand me?"
               "I do not understand, not fully and clearly."
               "Rodman, be my son!"
               Her manner was warm, and her words full of thrilling earnestness. Her blazing eyes shot out a flame of unwonted brightness, and her olive-tinted cheek glowed with a purple flush.
               There was a moment's silence, and then her struggling and strong emotions gushed out in words.
               "Rodman, I have loved you from the first, you recalled to me so vividly my lost son. There was that about you that stirred up my heart in sympathy, that drew me to you by some mental attraction—that turned all the channels of my thoughts from the son who was gone to you who was so like him. My heart yearned to you. It asked no other reason why it should love you than that you touched it as if by some magic spell, and made it all your own. I pined to think that you were not, indeed, my son. I heard your story, and determined then to become as a parent to you, to win your affection, your sympathy, your filial devotion."
               "Madam, madam, you touch me, nearly."
               "Oh! Rodman, do not hold off from me. Be, indeed, to me a son, and permit me to bestow upon you a mother's affection. Do not burden yourself with apprehensions of the future. Do not think of a profession. I have moderate wealth, you shall be my heir. I am alone, Rodman, alone, outcast like yourself, abandoned like yourself, yearning for sympathy and love. Oh! Rodman, let us link our two lonely lives together. Do not refuse me the favor of your affection. Say, now, that henceforth we shall be mother and son."
               "Dear lady," said Rodman with agitation, "do not ask me to forego my old passion yet. I have had deeper cause than you know, to doubt my father; cause enough to shatter every trust and hope I have in him. But the old yearning, I find, clings to me still. I can't yet believe that we shall never meet as in my boyhood I dreamed we should. I hope yet, in despite of things that, I fear, render hope a delusion merely. But you, madam, have been a mother to me—always. I have felt it so from the first, and your kindness coming to me at a time when I stood alone in the wide world, without kindred or friends, when strangers' fingers only touched my hand, and strangers' eyes glanced upon me, filled me then, and always will, with gratitude. I am not forgetful of that kindness now when call you friend. It is not a cold word, and may between us express enough of affection and devotion."
               Mrs. Carlton rose from her seat, and walked the floor for a few moments, and then came back to Rodman as composed and calm as was her wont. She took his hand, and smoothed back the clustering curls upon his brow.
               
               "Be my friend, then. We may teach ourselves eventually to use other names. But, Rodman, you cannot prevent me from considering you my heir, and what I now earnestly ask is, that you will consent to anticipate the inheritance—to receive, in fact, a portion now."
               "My dear lady," replied Rodman much embarrassed, "do not doubt my gratitude if I do not accept your offer. I am not so much in want of money as I am of a means of earning an independent place in the world. And a profession, you know, not only offers hope of emolument, but hope of fame. Besides, the struggle for success will no doubt prove a pleasant excitement."
               "Well, Rodman, your purpose is doubtless a wise one, and it is a great consolation to me to think that I can render you some service in it."
               "I thank you earnestly, Mrs. Carlton."
               "Now, Rodman," replied she rising and taking a candle from a stand, "I myself will light you to your chamber."
               They passed together up the stairway, and entered a richly furnished room, with windows and bed hung with damask, a huge heavily-carved secretary, a dark-crimson papered wall, a crucifixion hanging over the mantel, and a profusion of ottomans, reclining-chairs, mirrors, books, and articles of bijou. A little pile of wood was blazing cheerfully in the grate, which lit up the whole room glowingly and ruddily, and gave it an inviting aspect.
               "Good night, Rodman," said Mrs. Carlton, after placing the candle upon the table, "good night, and happy dreams."
               Rodman instantly approached her, and taking her hand raised it to his lips. Gratified more than she admitted by this little act of devotion and respect, she smiled, muttered a husky word or two, and hurried from the apartment.
               Rodman did not drop easily into slumber that night. He lay for an hour or so musing upon his situation, upon the crowd of events that had filled the last two days, and trying, through all the mist and uncertainty of the future, to shape some hopeful solution to the great problem of his life. But thoughts of these things gradually faded away, and those of Blanche alone filled his mind. He recalled the happy hours he had passed by her side at the Clove, and he pictured the bliss he was to experience in their restoration to each other's arms. Thus thinking and musing he gradually sank away into sleep.
               In his sleep he dreamed. His dream at first appeared to be of Blanche, and her arms were encircling him, and her lips were pressed warmly and passionately upon his brow. But somehow, by a change that did not surprise him, Blanche's face faded away, and that of Mrs. Carlton came in its stead, whose voice appeared to sound in his ear, choked with emotion, while her tears wet his cheek.
               His dream became so vivid, that suddenly he sprang up in bed. He could not tell, he must have been dreaming still, but he thought he saw a white figure with lighted taper gliding from his room.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               MYSTERY.
               WHEN Rodman arose the next morning it was quite late. The sun was streaming broadly into his room, and there was the pattering of frequent steps, and the rumbling of vehicles in the street below.
               He made his toilet leisurely, endeavoring all the time to recall the conversation with Mrs. Carlton of the previous evening, and to convince himself that her magnanimous offer of property, affection, and adoption, had indeed been made. It was all too much like a romance to be believed. It could not be possible that he, a wanderer and an adventurer, an outcast, an unknown, should become the object of so grand a bounty. It seemed like the wildest fiction for him to have so suddenly within his grasp fortune, rank, ease, everything that wealth confers, and that the world considers desirable. And it seemed wonderful to him, now as he looked back upon it, and recalled his companion's passionate appeals, how he had possessed the courage, to resist her offers—offers so alluring, so tempting, so grand.
               It was a test, he thought, of the strength of his purpose, of the unshaken determination of his mind to win Blanche through his own worthiness for her hand. And that he might be true to that purpose, be true, in every future temptation tation, to that resolve, on which he felt his worldly happiness was to rear itself, he earnestly prayed.
               It was not wealth showered upon him by other hands that he wanted, wealth that would be sure to exact a surrender of his independence. His ambition was stimulated to the acquisition, not of wealth absolutely or merely, but of success, fame, position—the right to admission as a peer among the loftiest—the success that would lift him to a level with the highest.
               It would be absurd to claim that Rodman was indifferent to Mrs. Carlton's offer, or that he was superior to the attractions of wealth. To be so were to possess a supernatural nature. On the contrary Rodman was keenly susceptible to all the advantages of wealth—to its ability to gratify the tastes, to the luxury, ease, and pleasure which it confers. But, as we have endeavored to show, there was a higher want that filled all his being, and which sprang up in the moment of temptation between the offer that was laid before him, and all the appetites that it was calculated to stimulate.
               Completing his toilet, be left his room and was descending the stairs, when a servant stepped up with a request from Mrs. Carlton for his company. Turning back, he was conducted to the same floor upon which his own chamber was situated, and led along to the opposite end of the house, when a door was flung open and he was ushered into Mrs. Carlton's sitting room.
               Mrs. Carlton was seated by a breakfast table spread for two.
               "Good morning, Rodman," said Mrs. Carlton, rising and giving him her hand.
               "I am obeying your summons Mrs. Carlton," said Rodman, after the usual salutation.
               
               "I have ordered a breakfast for us two served here alone," replied the lady, "so that we may have a tête-à-tête. Sit down, Rodman, and after you have taken a cup of coffee, we will talk together about your law prospects. You are quite determined, then, to go back to Blackstone?"
               "Yes, madam."
               "Well, as you will. To-day, then I propose that we send for Mr. Oswald.
               "I am impatient to begin, dear madam, and I feel more gratitude than I can express at your liberal, generous, friendly efforts in my behalf."
               "One thing, Rodman, I must stipulate for, you must make my house your home; stop, stop, before you deny me and then adhere to your denial merely to be obstinate. It certainly will not be any tax upon your dearly-prized independence, and your comforts here under my roof, I feel confident, will be superior to those obtained in almost any other way. Come, Rodman, wilful boy, you who have so stoically denied me so much, grant me this little boon."
               "The boon, Mrs. Carlton, is of your granting. I am the fortunate recipient."
               "You do accept, then?"
               "Yes."
               "I thank you, Rodman. It is a simple thing, I know, but yet it gives me much pleasure."
               Pausing for a brief moment, and gazing thoughtfully down into her cup, she suddenly looked up, and with a certain lightness and gaiety of manner that Rodman had never seen her assume before, she laughingly said:
               "Now, Rodman, I'm going to bring you to your confession, with myself for your confessor. Look well that you unfold to me all of your heart, and confess, at the beginning, that you are in love."
               "Madam!"
               "Ah! Rod, don't blush, nor stammer so. I am afraid that that evidence will not obtain for you a verdict of Not Guilty."
               "But, Mrs. Carlton"—
               "Stop, stop, Rodman, don't deny it, for I know more than you think for. Last night, some hours after you had retired, I was in want of a vial, carelessly left in your apartment. I was bold enough to enter for the purpose of obtaining it. But during my brief passage through the room I saw you tossing about as if in a dream, and I heard you mutter, more than once, the name of "Blanche."
               Rodman started at these words, and all the particulars of what he had supposed to have been a dream, came back to him vividly. Mrs. Carlton had indeed visited his chamber during his sleep, to caress him in his slumbers. What was the meaning of it all? From what cause originated this strange woman's extraordinary, almost passionate devotion to him? He could not tell. Everything that surrounded him appeared to be a mystery.
               "Do not," said Mrs. Carlton after a brief interval, during which Rodman had fallen into a reverie, "do not, Rodman, look so sad. Love ought to thrill you with pleasure, send a glow to your cheek, and a fire to your eye."
               "Love," said Rodman, trying to assume his companion's gay manner, "love is as often a weeping cherub as a smiling one."
               "Not prosperous love!"
               "No, madam, not prosperous love."
               "Yours, then, is an unrequited one. You have flung your heart upon that which gives no return."
               Rodman made no reply.
               "Come, Rodman, if I am your friend, make me your confidant fidant. Who is Blanche? Is she a rustic Hebe? Is she a Juno or a fairy? A grand or a delicate beauty? Does she smile or frown upon you?"
               "Madam!"
               "Rodman, I am your friend."
               "I believe you, dear Mrs. Carlton, and will confide in you. I met, during my recent sojourn, upon a mountain side, a creature so fairy-like, so full of grace and winning sweetness, and music, and smiles, that she seemed to me more like a sprite or woodland fay than human. We met often. I grew to love her, oh, how fondly! and she smiled upon me—loved me, too. Happy hours, happy hours! We spent our days together, rambling about, hand in hand, reading the poets together, admiring nature together, studying together, opening our hearts each to the other."
               "What a romantic episode!"
               "Ah! Mrs. Carlton, if you could only see her!" exclaimed Rodman, firing up with enthusiasm; "so beautiful, with her form so fairy-like, with her voice that falls upon your heart bewitchingly, with her smiles that gush out like a burst of sunshine, with her laugh, the gladdest thing in the world, that is like merriment set to music."
               "Why, you are poetical, Rodman. But tell me the name of this exquisite creature."
               "Blanche Dearwood."
               "Blanche Dearwood!"
               The name was repeated with a quick, vehement cry, and Mrs. Carlton was standing before Rodman with a glaring eye, and a passionate expression upon her face. But suddenly averting her head, she crossed the room with a rapid stride, and then came back to him, calm as before.
               "Do you know Blanche Dearwood?" inquired Rodman, who had observed her agitation with great surprise.
               "No."
               "No?"
               "I have never seen her." Then changing the subject, she exclaimed, "I think, Rodman, that we will drive to Mr. Oswald's instead of sending for him. At what hour do you propose? Will twelve o'clock be satisfactory?"
               "At what hour you please, Mrs. Carlton."
               "At twelve then."
               And bowing a dismissal to Rodman, she turned towards a window. But when Rodman had left the room, she clasped her hands together, and began to pace the room up and down in a wild and disordered manner.
               As Rodman sauntered into the drawing-room after his interview with Mrs. Carlton, he found Knowlton stretched upon a sofa, lazily turning over the leaves of a book.
               "Bon jour, mon ami," exclaimed he, as Rodman entered; "are you still bent upon the law? Will nothing but dry, dusty, musty, cobwebbed, prosy quiddets and quillets satisfy you?"
               "I am resolved, sir."
               "Well, I hope you may become a jurist more learned than Kent, a pleader more powerful than Webster; more sagacious, and keener than Curran, in short, an epitome of everybody's virtues. I hope that you will appreciate the comprehensiveness of my wish, if you don't its extravagance."
               "Do you know Mr. Oswald?"
               "No. I bow to him, shake gloves with him, but our knowledge of each other only extends to our mutual opinions upon the weather. I have no doubt I've heard him declare it was a fine day a hundred times. I'm quite certain he has listened to my assurances quite as often, that it was a very fine day. Some of his peculiarities I mentioned to you last night. I've heard in addition, that he is a very aristocratic, purse-proud, as they call it, pompous gentleman."
               "Disagreeable qualities."
               "Why, no. As to the pomp and aristocracy—good sport for a student of human nature. But I don't blame him for being purse-proud. It seems to me, Rod, that that is one of the most natural weaknesses which our flesh is heir to. If my purse now were only a well filled one, I should swell and strut lustily with pride. My shoes should creak portentously. My beard should be of a severe and formal cut. My tread should shake the earth with its conscious pride, and my emphatic 'hems,' carry terror into the hearts of my debtors."
               "A change to come over you, indeed."
               "I try sometimes, Rod, to imagine this feeling of purse-pride. I run my hands down into my empty pockets, but, alas! my poverty is too real, and destroys the fancy. My purse is melancholy and empty. Nothing can fill it. Pour in as you will, it has a bad habit of running off faster than you can supply, leaving bills of credit to establish the balance. The fact is, Rod, an empty purse only symbolizes my poverty. I haven't any purse at all, and, to use an Irishism, there's nothing in it."
               "You speak of credit."
               "Credit, my dear Rod, is one of the most ornamental pillars of society. It supports most of the finery, the gilding, the pomp and show, the gew-gaws, the respectability, the exclusiveness, the pretensions of life. Tear it down, Bob, and, ugh! what at downfall of dusty gentility, gilded finery, shallow elegance, and skin-deep aristocracy. But it is a very pretty thing as it stands. It, may, indeed, be hollow and frail, and erected upon a quicksand. But what of it all? Bah! Don't the gilding and the veneering hide it all?"
               "You give a frightful picture of society."
               "Frightful! How absurd! It's only pleasantly stimulating. What, can there be frightful about mere folly, Rod? The antics that men cut up before high heaven are meet for sport. Laugh at them."
               He rose, stretched himself with a leisure elegance, and began to draw on his gloves.
               "I walk in Broadway, Rod, always between ten and one."
               After drawing on his gloves, Knowlton said:
               "I have not seen Mrs. Carlton to-day. You were more fortunate, in a breakfast tête-à-tête with her. By-the-bye Rod, she likes you marvellously well."
               "Mrs. Carlton is certainly friendly to me."
               "Don't fail to have the advantage of it; I shouldn't wonder if she should adopt you, and if so, bury Blackstone, and hey for pleasure!"
               Worldliness, policy, meanness! Rodman turned away in disgust. Knowlton saw it, and quietly added:
               "She longs for some one to love, some one whom her full heart could fling itself upon. You recall to her a lost son and I know that it would be her happiness if she could lift you to his place. Learn to love her, Rod, if you can."
               So saying, with a wave of the hand, Knowlton sauntered out, and Rodman began to walk the floor, his mind tossed between a thousand surmises of the many strange things by which be was surrounded. There was, perhaps, enough vanity in his composition to be easily satisfied with Mrs. Carlton's interest in him; but her connection with Knowlton troubled him exceedingly. Were it not for that, he felt that he could render up to her all that she desired. But as to Knowlton he confessed his utter inability to sound, measure, or understand him. That he was in fact an actor he felt assured. But how much of what he said or did was assumed, where the line was to be drawn between himself and that which was acted—whether, indeed, his acting was for anything more than effect, or prompted by some deeper motive, it was difficult to determine; and, indeed, the puzzle was, who was he? what was he? what was his relation to Mrs. Carlton? what were his motives and designs in life? A man of leisure, taking life as a plaything, a way-side loiterer on the great stream of humanity—watching its eddies, whirlings, and currents—laughing, mocking, speculating—skeptical of all good things—with keen penetration reading the human heart, but seeing only its foibles and its passions—a epicurean for himself, but cynical in his judgment of others—bitter and misanthropical in one breath, and light, gay, pleasure-loving in the next—a philosopher and an idler—superficial in manner, deep in thought—in short, a mass of contradictions and inconsistencies—what in truth was he?
               In vain Rodman proposed to himself the question. He could not answer it. But one thing he felt instinctively—that he was the greatest enemy he could have to his ambitious purposes. His dangerous philosophy, his misanthropy, his sneers, his elegant and careless ease, and his light and irresponsible manner, were all things calculated, as Rodman wisely saw, to distract him from his purposes and subvert his resolves. Rodman felt himself in continual danger of yielding to his dangerous fascination, and of becoming insensibly the tool of his subtlety, the pliant instrument of his cunning.
               His dark misanthropy Rodman shrank from, too, however much he would—at times catch its spirit, and experience its wild charm. But Knowlton's misanthropy exceeded immeasurably all that he himself had ever felt in his moments of greatest despondency. It seemed so to mock and laugh at all his aspirations, at his ambition for fame, his faith in Blanche, his love for the Beautiful, his long-treasured and not yet eradicated devotion to his mysterious father—in brief, it so shattered ever trust in earth and heaven, that he turned from its contemplation with inexpressible repugnance—repugnance and fear. He felt, with an instinctive keenness, that beneath the blasting, withering simoom of such a passion, his youth would disappear, his courage sink, his strength forsake him, his principles of right become obliterated, and his whole nature sink into a chaotic darkness, without one ray of light in all its gloomy depth. That such an issue would result from this morbid misanthropy he could not doubt; for he knew fall well how in moments of bitterness his mind would have recourse to this passion, and experience for the time-being a fierce, wild delight in its subtle poison.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               DESIGNS AND DESIRES.
               AS proposed, Rodman and Mrs. Carlton called together upon Mr. Oswald. His offices were in Wall street, and consisted of a suite of three rooms. Two of the rooms were filled with clerks, students, and copyists; the students cracking nuts behind vast piles of books, the others industriously plunged into the midst of endless briefs, surrounded by accumulations of discarded pens, bits of tape, and inky wafers. The inner office was Mr. Oswald's private apartment, and into this Mrs. Carlton and Rodman were shown. Mr. Oswald rose up from his desk immediately on their entrance, and formally saluted Mrs. Carlton, and bowed with great pomp upon the presentation of Rodman. He then took his stand before the fire, for it was a cool September day, and Mr. Oswald invariably ordered fires at the least indication of a fall in the thermometer.
               Mrs. Carlton succinctly stated her business, and Oswald keenly scrutinized our hero. Rodman quietly in turn scrutinized him.
               Mr. Edward Oswald was a man of moderate height, with a black wig low down upon his forehead, a closely-shaven face, pursed up lips, a perpetual frown upon his brow, and an incessant restless assumption of pomposity—a kind of irritable and fidgetty dignity. He pulled up his shirt-collar, adjusted his cravat, blew the dust from his coat-sleeve, twitched at his pantaloons, shook, and twisted his foot, pulled down his vest, smoothed his shirt-front, settled his coat, arranged his wristbands, and all the time hemmed and hawed, and kept perpetually tossing his head back upon his coat-collar, and frowning in a manner as if everything; in the world but himself was ineffably contemptible. But when Mrs. Carlton had concluded, and he turned and addressed Rodman, it was then quite evident that behind all his dignity and eccentricity he possessed a kind heart.
               "I should be glad," said he, "to receive Mr. Moore until the completion of his studies. But do you know, sir, do you appreciate, sir, all, the difficulties of our arduous profession?"
               Rodman replied that he was not entirely ignorant of them.
               "A splendid profession, sir, worthy of the great ones, sir, that have given lustre to it. One of the props of the State, sir. Where would be your statesmen, sir, if it were not for the l-a-w? Where would be your orators? Where would there be at profession for gentlemen? Damn it, sir, what would society be without the l-a-w?"
               Rodman confessed his inability to anticipate the consequences of such a contingency.
               "The l-a-w, sir, is the right hand of the church. The l-a-w, sir, is justice, mercy, religion. But it's perverted, sir. There are black sheep, by ——, sir, who disgrace and bring infamy upon it."
               "The misfortune of every pursuit," suggested Rodman.
               Some further conversation ensued, and it was arranged that Rodman should formally commence his duties on the morrow.
               
               "Grant me an early private interview," said Mrs. Carlton aside to Oswald, as they were going out.
               When seated by Rodman's side in her carriage, she playfully exclaimed:
               "Now, Rodman, promise me that I shall be present at your first plea. I am sure that you will make a brilliant début."
               "Ah! madam, it is your kind heart that prognosticates so hopefully."
               On the day following, Rodman presented himself at Mr. Oswald's office, and duly commenced his proposed studies. Full of his high purpose, from that day he applied himself with eager zeal, and bent every energy and function to the mastery of the science. But it was not merely to books of law that he confined his studies. He appreciated very well that he was about to embark in a profession that of all others required of its high priests, a vast acquaintance with every branch of science or letters—a knowledge of things and of men, and a thorough familiarity with the history of the world, and all its subtleties, passions, weaknesses, foibles, heroism, greatness, and, intellect. Embarking in his studies thus, comprehensively and intelligently, his progress was rapid, while his mentality, by discipline and exercise, became deepened and developed.
               Mr. Oswald, who possessed great keenness of intellect, observed from the first Rodman's close and intelligent application to his studies, and, soon became deeply interested in him. He gave to his young student frequently great assistance, guiding him through many, of the subtleties and intricacies of his pursuit, and leading him sometimes to a clearer insight into things than he otherwise could have obtained. For these services Rodman many times expressed his gratitude, but the old lawyer, with his strange contradictions dictions of temper, would let out an oath and a growl, and swear that it was all nonsense.
               But Rodman never became so profoundly immersed in legal abstractions as to forget Blanche, or to grow lukewarm about her. And his remembrance of her was always surrounded by a kind of poetical halo. She was always to him the woodland sprite, from whom there radiated a light of purity, grace, gentleness, and bewitching beauty. He treasured up in his memory, and acted and re-acted again every hour that he passed by her side at the Clove. He remembered with pleasurable distinctness their forest rambles, their morning rides, and their romantic sails. He recalled each motion of a form, whose perfect grace we have so often referred to; he dwelt upon every word she had uttered; he remembered, with the same thrill he experienced at the time, the touch of her hand; he would close his eyes, that he might feel, if possible, once more the warmth of her smile and in his ears would often ring the music of her song.
               Meanwhile, however, his interest in his patroness, Mrs. Carlton, was deepening, and he confessed to himself many times that she was indeed almost a mother to him.
               "If," exclaimed he, "I was free from that old boyhood passion—that romantic, childish devotion to my unknown father, the power of which is so great, it seems as if nothing can obliterate it—if I were free from this, my heart might be perfectly contented in the maternal affection of this lady. Oh! how unlike—how unlike my own parent! So devoted, so sympathetic, so full of affectionate tenderness! Strange—strange!"
               Mrs. Carlton, indeed, appeared only to be living for him. Her object, it was quite apparent, was to win over his entire heart to her, and to obtain a perfect sway and control over it. She studied with the utmost closeness all his tastes and inclinations. She led him into scenes of gaiety and pleasure, in order to wean him from every other passion, and bind him more closely and firmly to herself. She tuned her own mind to perfect unison with his, developing, with rare skill, his intellectual and imaginative functions, and then finding the supply for the want she had created. Did he admire poetry? She always had some rare and beautiful passage to awaken his sensibilities, and at the same time to afford him that sweetest of all pleasures, sympathetic appreciation of the Beautiful. Did he admire paintings? She was ever seeking out and discovering some rare work of art, whose beauties would awaken mutual admiration, and afford mutual pleasure. She eagerly devoured every new book, with the hope of alighting on thoughts or descriptions that would reach and stir up the emotions of his breast. Profoundly wise in the human heart, she knew full well that every emotion, every pleasure, shared between them was a link to bind them together. Resolute in her purpose, and full of resources to accomplish it, she approached him by every channel, and laid siege to his heart by the means of every sympathy. Her olive cheek would flush, and her black eye light up when he would come before her. In society, her attentions were so delicate, and she would so quietly gratify his vanity by exalting him above all others; in conversation, she would bend so profoundly to his thoughts, and applaud them with so much earnestness—she would evince, at all times and in all places, so superior an interest in him—she would pour into his heart so many timely words of affection and tenderness, that it would have been a wonder, fairly, if Rodman had remained indifferent. And in these skilful efforts to attain her aim, she was aided by her superb beauty, romantic in its character, and by the mysterious melancholy that rested upon her brow.
               But none of these fascinations won Rodman from his old affections and his old desires. The pleasures into which he was plunged could not obliterate the memory of Blanche. The dazzle and the glitter that blazed upon his senses only sent his heart the more eagerly to thought of her. The pleasures of imagination and taste, which were so skilfully provided, associated themselves at once with the name of Blanche. Had his love for her not been so deep, it would have been different. A mere fancy would have been obliterated, as Mrs. Carlton fondly hoped and believed, by such a succession of sensations, pleasures, and diverting thoughts. Very few, indeed, could have preserved themselves in such a whirl of pleasure; very few could have resisted an attempt upon their sympathies so systematic, able, and indeed wonderful! With many, the past, with all its freight of memories and emotions, would have been swept away, and the present, with its fascinations and delights, have usurped everything.
               In Mrs. Carlton there might have been noted an impatient eagerness, a violent desire to crush out of Rodman's mind every remnant, every memory of the past. She desired to usurp his heart and mind, to fill him with thoughts of himself and of new pleasures, to bring him to an utter indifference or forgetfulness of his old passions.
               "Robert," exclaimed she one day to Knowlton, "Rodman still thinks of Blanche Dearwood. I cannot bear the thought that it should be so. We must wean him from her."
               "Patience, patience, madam. It will wear out in time. He thinks now that it is a virtue to remember her, and that alone keeps him faithful. But he cannot always withstand stand the allurements (heaven save the mark!) of society, and he'll eventually grow tired of being faithful merely out of a romantic fancy that it's heroic, and chivalrous, and noble, and all that, to be so."
               "Robert, you're not so zealous a worker for me as you once were."
               "An excellent reason why. You are in the field yourself, and a much better general than I am. But tell me, ma chère, what shall I do?"
               "I do not know. Alas! I was blindly careless during the long period when he first came to the city. But I thought that all things were sure, and that time would, more effectually than anything else, link him to me, and wean him from his memories. Had I striven then, as I strive now, to win him, what has followed since would not have happened. But Robert, there is a fatality about us. To think that he should meet and fall in love with Blanche Dearwood! Robert, they must not meet again! Find some way to prevent it. Guard against it. Be sure it does not happen. It must not be. It must not be."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               OLD SCENES REVISITED.
               THE course of our narrative carries us back to the Clove once more.
               The severe shocks that Blanche received in the succession of trying incidents she had experienced, resulted in throwing her into a fever. Upon the night after the painful interview with Mr. Waldron, which had plunged her into such passionate dismay and grief, she lay hour, after hour tossing restlessly about her couch. Towards morning she sank into an uneasy slumber, or rather a dreamy stupor, from which she awoke with a feverish brow, and sharp pains in her head.
               It was after daylight, and Blanche, from her position on her couch, could look through the window and see the ruddy tints of the rising sun fall upon the boughs of a grand old maple that stood directly in the line of her vision. Finding that it was so late she essayed to rise, but her effort to do so was accompanied by such exquisite pain in her limbs, and, and at the same time with so much dizziness, that she fell back upon the pillow, pressing her hand upon her burning brow. Another effort to rise was accompanied by similar symptoms, and she therefore remained quiet, confident that Amelia would visit her at an early hour.
               
               Her expectation was soon realized. And when Amelia entered, at the very first glance at Blanche an expression of alarm came upon her countenance, and she hurried to her side.
               "You are feverish, Blanche!" said she.
               "I am not well, dear Amelia."
               Amelia felt her pulse thoughtfully, and replied:
               "You are not well indeed, poor girl. There has been too great a strain upon your nervous temperament. Repose, Blanche, is absolutely necessary; repose of mind, and repose of body."
               Amelia now busied herself in adjusting and softening the light, and in giving to the chamber a cheerful and pleasant aspect, all the while addressing herself to her patient in as gay a manner as possible, with the object of withdrawing her thoughts from that painful brooding on what had occurred, which so largely contributed to her present indisposition. After placing everything in a comfortable aspect; taking especial pains to bring forward into view as many congenial and agreeable objects as possible, and perceiving that Blanche was already in a better state of mind, Amelia left, the room, and went to find Mr. Waldron.
               When that gentleman learned from his sister how indisposed his ward was, he proposed the immediate summons, of a physician. Amelia hardly thought it necessary, but her brother was so urgent, that she consented that he should send for one.
               The physician arrived after an interval of about two hours. He immediately pronounced Blanche in no danger, and gave his opinion that in a very short period she would be convalescent. He seemed to think it only a heavy cold, but Amelia knew, how much deeper was the seat of her indisposition; while, at the same time, she hoped that due attention—attention bestowed more particularly upon the state of her mind—would in a few days accomplish a beneficial change. It was absolutely necessary, however, to bring her mind into a more healthful action than it was at present, or else there was imminent danger of some malignant fever setting in, perhaps of the brain.
               Amelia's careful nursing soon worked a favorable change. But it was all by the power of medicine for the mind diseased. She drew her patient's thoughts from the contemplation of any painful subjects, placed before her continually matters of at light and pleasant interest, aroused her imagination in a healthful way, and infused through her whole mind so cheerful and gay a spirit, that she soon had the happiness of perceiving the good her labors were effecting.
               In ten days time Blanche was so far convalescent as to be enabled to go about the house, and at the end of two weeks she made her first adventure into the open air. But during all this time she had not seen her guardian. He had taken several lengthy jaunts abroad and when at home he shut himself up closely in his library. Blanche felt that he was avoiding her, while at the same time she experienced herself an apprehensive dread of meeting him.
               As Blanche grew in health and strength, she resumed many of her out-door pursuits, and soon spent much of her time in prolonged rides through the mountain passes. But it was not the same, joyous, happy spirit, that formerly lent such a beauty to every scene in which she moved, that now could be observed amid those highland haunts. The gay laugh that formerly rang so happily in the forest depths could not be heard. The bounding step and fleeting form that glanced through the glades like gleams of sun-light, the melody that floated on the mountain air, outvieing the forest choristers—these were no more. Instead could be seen only the shadowed face, the sad smile, the "dejected 'haviour" of her who was once all gladness and happiness, and peace and joy. Upon her young heart a grief had fallen, and her golden youth, that was once like a June morning, with the foliage in its first fullness, brightest, and gladdest, and greenest, was bowed by the hot breath of passion and of sorrow. Oh! that girlhood might always stand in the dewy freshness and budding gladness of June, and never, never feel the summer fervor of the sun, with dust upon its head, and the sultry blight of passion in its heart!
               Blanche's rides were now to her inexpressibly melancholy, and the peculiar sadness that always seems to pervade an October landscape, served to heighten the pensive character of her feelings. She would pause frequently in some shaded vale, where the fallen leaves were gathered thickly, and in the perfect stillness of the autumn air, through which, sailing and undulating with slow and gentle motions, the dead leaves would fall, stricken, noiseless and sad; and thus surrounded by a melancholy atmosphere, indulge in a profound and exquisite grief. The mountains in their autumnal pomp, that under other circumstances would have appealed so strongly to her love for the picturesque, now possessed but little beauty for her eye. The new aspects that many of her favorite haunts assumed failed to arouse her to any appreciation of their new points of beauty, while they contributed, in the very fact of being changed, something to the sensitive gloom in her heart. With the passing away of her old happiness there appeared to be something harmonious in Nature. Her material sources of pleasure were denied to her, as well as all others. The flowers that she loved were dying, the vines that she had nourished were withering, the forest foliage was in decay, at the very period when all her hopes and joys were dying, withering, and decaying too.
               Amelia, meanwhile, with solicitous care was watching near her, and striving by every means to minister to her sorrows. But Amelia was convinced that there was something in Blanche's mind more than grief at her guardian's unhappy passion. Her emotions were so profound and her melancholy so deep, that it was indeed natural for Amelia to suppose the existence of some deep and hidden wounds. But what were they? Amelia believed she knew, but although her surmises were partially true, she could have no conception of all that Blanche was experiencing. She laid the whole cause of our heroine's melancholy upon a secret love for the young stranger, Rodman Moore. She had observed Blanche so attentively, that this belief was firmly adopted. The alternate flush and paleness of her cheek whenever Rodman's name was mentioned, and other evidences of agitation, that Blanche was too poor an actor to conceal, was a kind of evidence that to a female mind was sufficient and perfect. And Amelia longed to know more. She feared, with a depth that might have owed its strength to something in her own experience, that Blanche might be flinging her heart where nothing but misery could follow. Rodman might be unworthy of her, might be deceiving her, or worst of all, she, poor girl, might be the unhappy victim of a passion that had found no response in him. Perhaps it was "concealment i' the bud" that was feeding upon her cheek.
               One day Amelia ventured to lead the conversation to this subject, with the hope that she might glean something of the true state of Blanche's mind. It was a cool October day, near its close, and they were seated in the drawing-room; Amelia, engaged in sewing, and Blanche in sketching ing. Very few words had passed between them, until at last Amelia interrupted the silence by exclaiming:
               "I am afraid, Blanche, that you will find the winter at the Clove oppressively dull."
               "No, Amelia, not dull," was the somewhat marked reply.
               "Do you not find it so already? Your time is not filled up with so many pleasant occupations as it was."
               "No," was the very low rejoinder.
               "And, soon, when our winter storms will confine you indoors altogether, I am really apprehensive that the days will be to you very tedious, and make you even more melancholy than you are now."
               Blanche did not make any answer.
               "The solitude of even your present life must, I fear, be a painful contrast to those more agreeable days when you had continual companionship. I have often wondered, Blanche, as to what could have become of Mr. Moore. He disappeared very suddenly after the return of your guardian."
               With a blushing face Blanche bent down over her work, but continued silent. Amelia observed her well, but she was resolved to pursue the matter farther, notwithstanding Blanche's evident shrinking from the subject.
               "Speaking of him, Blanche recalls many of my old speculations in regard to him. There always appeared to be something mysterious about him. I do not think I ever heard him take any reference to his family, or to his history. I have always been quite curious to know who he was, but he carefully concealed all his antecedents."
               "Mr. Moore," replied Blanche, with an effort, "told me his whole history."
               Amelia looked up with surprise and curiosity, and added,
               "Neither Mr. Waldron nor myself was ever made acquainted with his family, his position, or even his place of residence. Why, Blanche, was all this concealed from us, and told to you?"
               "Rodman," began Blanche, but Amelia caught the word and repeated it:
               "Rodman!"
               Blanche saw the meaning expressed by Amelia in her emphatic echo of Rodman's name, and she blushed deeper than she had blushed before. She replied, however, in a very low but constrained voice.
               "Mr. Moore never would have concealed anything from his own choice. I know his history, and believe me, Amelia, when I tell you that the mystery of his life is what be cannot reveal."
               Amelia was silent for a moment, and then she rose up, walked over, and seating herself by the side of Blanche, took her hand. Her course was resolved upon. Blanche might refuse her confidence, but if it were, as she believed, that Blanche was yearning for some one to whom she might unfold the burthen in her heart, the opportunity should be presented.
               "Blanche," said she, "will you listen to me, and believe that what I am going to say is with no purpose of paining youth but of offering you what consolation and sympathy I can?"
               Blanche allowed her hand to rest in Amelia's, but she turned away her head.
               "Blanche, may I go on?"
               "Yes."
               "I am aware, Blanche, of the unhappy issue that has grown out of my brother's acquaintance with you. It is, perhaps, necessary to say so, but knowing so well as I did, the inner heart of my brother, his exquisite sensibility, the sensitive and impressible nature of his sympathies, I feared from the first what the end might be. It is my brother's misfortune, Blanche, as well as it is yours."
               "It is, perhaps, much more so."
               "I think it is. My brother cannot rebound from the shock as youth could. Suffering like his, coming to a man so far advanced, so beyond the vanities and ordinary pleasures or ambitions of the world, must follow him for ever. But of all this I will not speak. I only desire to talk of you."
               "Of me?"
               "Yes, Blanche." She paused, smoothed the hair back from her forehead, and then resumed in the same calm, formal, but not ungentle manner:
               "I do not wish, dear Blanche, to look into any chamber of your heart that you would lock from my sight. I do not wish to touch upon any feelings that you hold too sacred for any mortal eye. But, Blanche, I know that you are suffering, I know that there is something feeding upon your heart which you conceal. I see it every day. And it is something more than grief for your guardian. It is deeper, far deeper than that, and springs from causes that you have felt no friendship was worthy to know. And yet, my poor girl, what griefs are there, what joys are there, that cannot be either relieved or augmented by the gentle aid of sympathy? We are not wise when we shut our emotions up in our hearts too closely, and pure friendship, when fully and truly pure, is worthy of being the repository of the most sacred thoughts. Is it not so?"
               Blanche muttered a reply, while her head still remained averted. Amelia's manner was hardly calculated to win the confidence she desired. It was far too formal and stately, although there was through it all a something of tenderness and gentleness. But she was neither pliant nor insinuating; and she felt sensibly that she was all the time too hard to be successful. Changing her tactics, therefore, she approached Blanche, in a different manner. Winding her arms around her waist, she whispered:
               "Tell me, Blanche, tell me all. Do you love him? Confide in me. I, who am your friend."
               Blanche turned, and buried her face in her breast, as she exclaimed:
               "I do, I do!"
               "And he—"
               "We are betrothed!"
               Amelia held Blanche silently to her heart, whose brow and neck were suffused with blushes. And when she looked up, although her cheeks were still in a crimson blush, there was a kind of joy blazing in her eyes, as if the outflow of her over-charged feelings had already caused her a glow of happiness.
               "You are both very young," said Amelia, after a pause.
               "But, oh! Amelia, you cannot wonder that I should love him. You saw him—know him."
               "I do not wonder, Blanche. He appeared to me a noble youth. I liked him always, and your confession only confirms what I before felt assured was so. But, my dear girl, there is one feature about this that pains me—a clandestine betrothal!"
               Blanche grew crimson, but she seized upon Amelia's hands, and looked up into her face, confidingly and trustfully.
               "I know, I know, Amelia," said she "how wrong it was, but you do not know all, cannot know all the extenuating circumstances. Dear Amelia, you, will believe me, I am sure you will, when I tell you how repugnant to me is everything like deception or concealment. It weighs upon my heart heavily to reflect that I am deceiving, and must deceive my guardian. But, alas I what can I do? You will come to know, Amelia, some day why I have been compelled to silence. And look at me, and tell me, if you can, until that day comes, put faith in me, perfect trust in me, through all and everything."
               "Perfect, Blanche, perfect."
               "And I must exact a promise of you, Amelia, to say nothing of this to Mr. Waldron. Ah! when you do know all, you will then see why this is necessary. I wish it were not so. I wish that I could fling myself upon my knees before my guardian this very day, and tell him everything. I should be so much the happier if I could do so. But I cannot, Amelia. My heart has more sorrows than one—Amelia, it is full—full!"
               She wept long and silently upon Amelia's breast.
               "Ah! Blanche, may heaven grant a peaceful issue to then. But, oh! do not be deceived, do not let your heart fling itself where it will perish for need of sustenance and love. Mystery, my poor girl, always looks like evil."
               "No, no," said Blanche starting up, "do not doubt Rodman; he's upright, noble, honest—believe me he is. Ah! Amelia, for every doubt you have now, the time will come when it will be a keen remorse for you to remember them."
               "Is your faith so perfect, Blanche?"
               "Yes, and yours would be, too, if you knew all. I can not be happy unless you put faith in us."
               "Both faith and hope," exclaimed Amelia, tenderly smoothing and kissing her brow.
               At this juncture Amelia was summoned away upon some household matters, and Blanche mechanically dropped into one of the large arm-chairs with which the room was furnished, and which was drawn up before the glowing mass of bituminous coal that blazed and snapped in the deep, wide, brass-rimmed grate. It was just at the twilight hour, when fire-lit rooms have a peculiar charm, and are so provocative of reverie and dreaming. The ruddy glow was falling pleasantly upon the darkly-polished mahogany and thick window-hangings, while amid the folds of the tapestry, beneath the huge, antique cabinet, the book-cases, and low tables, and behind the picture-frames that shone out in radiance of light, the shadows were driven, flickering and swaying, as the light sported and ambled with them. The gilt titles on the long row of books in the richly-carved cases, shone out in the glow spectrally. The ceiling was blushing with a soft tint like a beauty's cheek. A couple of marble busts gleaned palely out of shadowy recesses, but upon one of them a portion of light had fallen, encircling it like a halo. An antique mantel-clock, buried in shadow, but catching upon its gilded cherubs a few reflected rays, ticked loudly forth, and alone of all that was gathered there broke upon the stillness of the place.
               Blanche, falling under the spell of the scene, rich, deep, eloquent in its tone, grew deeply and profoundly abstracted. It is the nature of sensitive minds to vibrate to every touch and tone, catching gleams of happiness from fleeting lights and shades, starting up keenly responsive to every grace or beauty in whatever found—finding "sermons in stones, books in running brooks, and good in every thing." Such minds experience a continual action and reaction—growing eloquent if fanned by a summer breeze, shrinking at a passing discord, and with all their emotions and sensibilities swayed by influences apparently insignificant. The warm tints of the scene just described, therefore, exercised their strong influence upon Blanche. Eloquent and deep thoughts stirred in her bosom, and came crowding in profound intensity upon her.
               Her head was bent forward, and her cheek rested upon her hand. Her curls overshadowed her brow and face, but a warm tint fell upon her cheeks, while her eyes gleamed out of shadows dark as Erebus. Her bosom slightly rose and fell under the influence of some emotion, but otherwise she was motionless and rapt.
               So absorbed, indeed, was she in the mental phantasmagoria that passed before her vision, that she did not heed the opening of the door, and the entrance of her guardian into the room. Mr. Waldron also was not aware of the presence of another person until he had crossed the room, and placed his hand upon the chair with the intention of occupying it, when to his surprise he discovered Blanche already in it, with her gaze abstractedly fixed upon the fire. An exclamation that he made startled her, and she sprang up, a good deal embarrassed at finding herself in his presence. Mr. Waldron apologised for the intrusion, and placed the chair for her to resume it. Blanche did so mechanically, while she pressed her hand against her heart to still the agitation which the sight of her guardian instinctively created.
               "I need hardly tell you, Blanche, how rejoiced I am to find you recovered," said Mr. Waldron, who had stepped back, and was standing with his hand upon another chair.
               "I am sure I thank you, sir," said Blanche, in a low tone.
               "It is many days since we have met," said he.
               "It is," replied Blanche painfully.
               "If it were a space, Blanche, that memory could not travel over—a gulf which the eye could not span, I should find a reprieve from the remorse that pursues me."
               "Sir, oh, sir!"
               "Blanche, you are not happy."
               "No, sir."
               "Your confidence in your guardian is shaken."
               "I implore you, sir."
               "Your old love and respect for him have fled. You doubt, you fear, you shrink from him."
               "Mr. Waldron!" Blanche was excessively agitated, and the tears fell fast and thick.
               "I do not spare myself, Blanche," said he; "I know that you must have these feelings. It could not be otherwise. And you cannot forget them. Or if you could I must not."
               "Mr. Waldron, why, why do you refer to this matter. Let us both forget."
               "There is no forgetfulness for me—because I experience no change. I am not the victim of a whim, a caprice, a stimulated fancy. Passion does not touch me with a lighter touch than it does younger hearts. Nay, when men like me love, they love with a power to which the passion of youth is but a poor, weak, vain thing. To me it was the sudden ingushing of water upon the fountain that was always parched and panting for the draught, and now it must live for ever in the remembrance of it. You tremble. Do not fear. This is the last time you will ever hear me allude to this subject. I speak of it now only to prepare you for something that must be said. Henceforth my heart shall seal up its chambers. I know my future road. It is dark, yet I must follow it. But my life has been cast in one perpetual shadow, and it matters little if the rest be gloomier than before."
               Blanche's only response was her tears.
               
               "Blanche, I have one word to say that I am trying to find the courage to speak. And there are, moreover, some things on my mind, that I desire to say to you—something of my history. And yet your agitation, and my sinking heart warn me that it would be wiser to speak through another. At least let them be deferred. But, Blanche, may I once more take your hand—may I look into your face again, and see if you have compassion for me?"
               Blanche caught his hand and pressing it to her lips, bedewed it with her tears. She was struggling with a strong impulse to flinch herself down before him and reveal all her love for Rodman—and Rodman's kindred to him. It seemed to her at that moment impossible that he could have known his son, that he could in coldness and repugnance have cast him off, branding him with the shame of his birth, if any shame there we're. She felt that if she could unfold all this strange history to him; that, in the transports of a recovered son, and in the new aspect she would appear to him as his souls betrothed, he might rise above this vain and unnatural passion, and be happy in the contemplation, of their bliss, and in the warm affection of two sympathizing, devoted children.
               "Pardon me, Blanche," said he, with a broken utterance, "for the unhappiness that I have caused you. I was unwise. But, oh—"
               He was interrupted by the noise of a vehicle driven up to the door. A bustling ensued, the opening and closing of doors, and steps in the hall. The next moment the room door was thrown open and Mr. Erastus Elwood was ushered into their presence. Blanche started up, instinctively alarmed, for Mr. Elwood was always mysteriously associated with Mr. Waldron's past life, and his presence instantly suggested apprehensive fears.
               "Miss Blanche," exclaimed he, bowing as low as his stiff stock would permit, if it was, indeed, a bow, for it was more like a spasmodic jerk; and it was, at the same time, so alarmingly energetic that Blanche might have been well apprehensive that he was attempting to fling his head at her.
               "Miss Blanche. Your most devoted. As I remarked on my previous visit. You look like a rose. That is," said he, almost immediately detecting that she looked pale and wan, "that is like lily. Hope you are well."
               "I have been somewhat indisposed, sir, but am now quite recovered."
               "Glad to hear it. That is, sorry. In fact, a little of both. I believe, Mr. Waldron. My respects. Unexpected, sir. I am a man of sudden appearances."
               Mr. Waldron's face grew white even in the ruddy fire light.
               "I will withdraw," said Blanche. "Mr. Elwood is undoubtedly on business."
               "Miss Dearwood," interrupted Elwood. "Your pardon. Do not incommode yourself. Mr. Waldron and myself. We can retire. Can we not, sir? I have urgent matters, sir."
               "Permit me, gentlemen," said Blanche, placing her hand on the door knob.
               "Not for our sakes, Miss Dearwood."
               "With your permission, then," said Blanche, and she glided from the room.
               "What am I to gather from this visit?" said Mr. Waldron, seating himself with an effort to be calm, "Is it ill or good? Have you traced the boy?"
               "I have, sir."
               "Ah!"
               
               "The fact is. I was quite on the wrong scent. Before. But now. Everything is sure."
               "I hope so, sir. I do not desire again to be exalted with false hopes, only to be prostrated with disappointment."
               "No fear now, sir. I have found the boy. And that's not all. Something more."
               "Something more?"
               "Ay, sir. Vastly great. Strangely new." And Mr. Elwood's head bobbed with such violence on the top of his high cravat, that he fairly seemed in danger of shaking it off.
               "Well, sir," said Mr. Waldron, pale but calm. Mr. Elwood came up to him, stooped down, and whispered a word in his ear. Its effect was startling. With quick, wild cry, he sprang upon the floor, and looked glaringly at his informant.
               "Is this true, sir?" said he, with a gasp.
               "True. True. No doubt of it. True as law," replied Mr. Elwood, surprised at his client's great emotion.
               Mr. Waldron fell back into his chair, stunned and bewildered.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               A FAREWELL TO THE CLOVE.
               MR. WALDRON and Mr. Elwood appeared together the next morning in the breakfast-room. They had been closeted together for several hours the preceding evening, and their conference, whatever it was, had left Mr. Waldron pale, with sunken eyes and compressed lips. He scarcely addressed Blanche or his sister, who were in the room when he entered. He took his place with the others at the table, but tasted nothing. After a few moments he got up and walked over to one of the windows. Mr. Elwood meanwhile essayed to entertain the ladies. He was full of town gossip and pleasant chat, although, in the midst of his gayest sallies, his eyes would steal a glance at his client. But his auditors scarcely rewarded his efforts. They were both very silently, and evinced no more interest than politeness required in what he was saying. Blanche, indeed, was so painfully absorbed in observing her guardian, and in wondering as to the cause of his unusually deep depression, that she more than once found herself in the embarrassing position of being called upon to answer some query put to her which she had not heard.
               When the meal was finished, and it was a brief one, Blanche arose and was leaving the room, when she found herself followed by Mr. Elwood.
               
               "Permit me, Miss Dearwood," said he, "to speak with you. A few words. In privacy."
               Blanche, a good deal surprised at this request, led the way to the drawing-room.
               "Let us be seated, Miss Dearwood. Permit me. Accept of this chair."
               With formal politeness, he placed a chair for her, and then drew one near for himself.
               "Miss Dearwood," resumed he, after considerable ado, seating himself. "Miss Dearwood. Will pardon me. I am sure. If what I am going to say will give her any pain. I am a lawyer. Of extensive practice. Civil and criminal. And marine. And duty, Miss Dearwood. Duty to my clients, is my first law. I go farther, Miss Dearwood. I adopt the ancient orator's expression. It is my second law. It is my third law. I may add, it is my whole law."
               Blanche only bowed a silent reply.
               "I am commissioned, Miss Dearwood. By Mr. Waldron, your guardian. To possess you with a decision, that circumstances require him to make. I regret that I am compelled to give you pain. It is a melancholy duty. But I have no choice to do otherwise."
               "Go on, sir," said Blanche, grasping her chair back hard, and bending forward with painful suspense.
               "Mr. Waldron, my friend and my client. Could not undertake it himself. He felt that it would be too painful."
               "Mr. Elwood, let me hear the worst at once."
               "I admire your courage, Miss Dearwood. It shows a true heart. Your guardian feels that his duty. His sense of right. Dictates to him the necessity. Of annulling the contract of guardian and ward that exists between you."
               A deadly pallor spread over Blanche's face, but her eyes were fixed steadily upon her companion.
               "It is to him a most painful necessity. But things which he cannot reveal. Make it imperative. I am not myself fully in Mr. Waldron's confidence. I cannot quite comprehend all his reasons. There are some things secret even to me; his attorney. Which is unwise. And without legal precedent. He proposes that you should sojourn with your friends. For himself. He goes abroad."
               "And is this Mr. Waldron's firm resolve?" inquired Blanche tremulously.
               "So he informed me. And it is by a great struggle on his part."
               "Mr. Elwood, I desire to ask you one, question, that if not violating your trust, I hope you will answer."
               "Propound it, Miss Dearwood."
               "Has Mr. Waldron been urged to this step by any intelligence that you brought him last night?"
               "So I believe, And yet I suspect not primarily."
               "And that intelligence?"
               "Pardon me. My legal honor."
               "Permit me, sir, at least to ask you if it concerned his family?"
               "His family?"
               "I use a general term, Mr. Elwood. But perhaps you can understand me."
               Mr. Elwood rubbed the smooth back of his head vigorously, and settled his chin behind his stock, thoughtfully.
               "I will be more explicit, sir. I believe that he once had a son."
               "My dear young lady. Be silent I implore you. That is something we must not touch upon."
               "Forbidden," thought Blanche. "Ah, if I but knew the cause!"
               "And now, Miss Dearwood," resumed Elwood. "What am I to return to Mr. Waldron? Your cheerful consent to his proposal? Your acquiescence in his plan?"
               "My consent! Yes, oh, yes!" and she turned away to hide the tears that were filling her eyes.
               Mr. Elwood rose, formally bowed to her, and gravely left the room. When he was gone Blanche burst into a flood of tears. She could not contemplate the prospect of parting from the Clove, nor reflect upon the many unfulfilled promises of happiness that it at first held out to her, without poignant grief; and she wept too for her guardian, whom she was now fast feeling was a sufferer by some great wrong, and who, it was but too evident, had arrived at this decision by a struggle painful and deep. His appearance at the breakfast-table filled her with tenderness for him, and she experienced an intense desire to learn the full facts of his hidden grief, because she might hold in her own hands the means of his consolation. She shrunk, however, from revealing her knowledge of Rodman's kindred to him, not merely because she was pledged to secresy, but because, if Rodman's apprehensions were true, such a revelation would be a torture rather than a joy to him.
               She had remained for some time in the position that Mr. Elwood had left her, leaning with her elbows upon a table, with her face buried in her hands, when she heard a slight motion or rustle. She started up, and to her surprise, saw Mr. Waldron standing, with his back to her, looking out of the window, exactly as she had left him standing in the breakfast-room. She went up to him immediately, and spoke his name. He turned around quickly, but did not speak.
               "Mr. Waldron," said she with a broken utterance, "am I to say farewell to the Clove?"
               "Blanche, it is for the best," was the reply.
               "Oh sir, why for the best?"
               "Ah, Blanche! destiny will shape our ends, strive as we will. I thought to have passed the remainder of my days here in happiness and peace, but a web was weaving all the while that has made me its victim. I cannot tell you all. I dare not. Some other time you may perhaps learn. Now I can tell you nothing more than that henceforth our paths must move on asunder."
               "My dear guardian, if the past were to be forgotten, as I assure you it can be, then—"
               "Blanche, you are speaking from your generous soul. It is noble of you. But now I cannot permit myself even to contemplate such a things. I have been saved, Blanche, from the commission of a crime—from the commission of it in fact blut, alas! it was committed in thought and purpose. I now stand, even in my own eyes, in such a position that your generous forgiveness cannot avail me. We must part."
               "And I—"
               "You have friends."
               "But I cannot bear the thought of leaving the Clove. I have grown to love it, sir. I call not think of all the deep happiness it has afforded me without a sharp sorrow at the prospect of parting with it."
               "Blanche, soon, very soon, I shall depart for Europe. When summer returns, and I am away, you and Amelia shall come back to the old place again. Your light step and radiant smile, shall once more make these old hills and forests glad. But now you need to be weaned from it. There are associations about it now too full of bitterness for you. Your old gaiety and peace of mind need to be restored by change of scene and change of companions."
               "Mr. Waldron—"
               
               "Blanche, trust in me, and be guided by me. I cannot tell you everything that makes necessary this step. I cannot, in honor, after what has passed, and, after what I learned last night, continue to be your guardian. To-day, Blanche, I leave for town to prepare for your reception among your friends. To-morrow you and Amelia, with Mr. Elwood as your escort, will follow me. Therefore, now let me say farewell. We may meet again. And yet, perhaps, never."
               He took her two hands, and raised them to his lips.
               "Mr. Waldron," exclaimed Blanche choking with emotion, while her eyes were streaming with tears, "I must speak one word before we say farewell. You—you—I believe—had a—son!"
               "Great heaven!" interrupted he with extreme agitation. "And is it possible that you know my miserable history too? Oh, shame! shame! undying and remorseless, must you be blown to every ear!"
               Clasping his hands upon his head he rushed abruptly from the room, leaving Blanche standing looking after him as pale and motionless as any statue.
               Presently she started, and then shudderingly tottered to a seat. The worst appeared now to be corroborated. Rodman's birth was indeed a disgrace, and his existence a shame. There was no room left now for hope—no further doubt of Rodman's suspicions. It all appeared but too true.
               And how would Rodman, thought she, bear this confirmation of his fears? Would he bury his shame in his breast, and in loneliness and in silence bitterly expiate his father's crime? Would he in his morbid pride refuse to be the recipient of anything upon sufferance—disdaining position which he could not win rather than receive—rejecting society, friendship, love even, that were offered in any way out of pity or condolence? Must not this terrible truth in some way prove an obstacle to the prosperous issue of their love? She saw how it might in many ways, and, although she herself could see no stain, no shadow, no spot in the pure circle of his honor—although as ready to fling her love upon him now as if he were freighted with honorable names and ancestral glory, yet, alas! look forward as hopeful as she would, a shadow seemed to lie in their future path.
               Ascending to her room, she seated herself by the window, and endeavored to distract her thoughts from incessant brooding on one sad thought, by her books and her drawings. She essayed to sketch a little, but the tears would occasionally break out and drop upon her work. She tried to read, but at the pause of every sentence she would find herself with averted gaze brooding darkly. Her needlework would not progress with her heavy fingers, and her music was equally unsuccessful in interesting her.
               Suddenly she started up with the resolve to take one more, and the last, ride about the Clove, and to pay a visit of farewell to Captain Dartan.
               In less than half an hour she was mounted on her horse, scampering away over the hills.
               It was a cold, blustering day. The autumn winds were rushing down the mountain-sides, and moaning through the forests like a requiem for departed summer. They were catching the dead leaves in eddying circles, and whirling and tossing them to and fro: they were hurling themselves against the stout old forest veterans—heaving up the river's bosom in foaming billows, and sporting with a fierce sport in the mountain gorges. Full of a lusty vigor, and glorying in their strength, were those autumn winds. And Blanche, as she scampered along upon her mettlesome steed, felt a wild pleasure in them. As they rushed by her, sweeping back her curls, and stirring the blood into a rich glow upon her cheeks, she felt in the pleasureable excitement a temporary forgetfulness of everything else. It was a brief return of her old pleasures, and for a moment her heart leapt with a bound of happiness.
               Just as she was nearing Captain Dartan's house, she met the old man out upon a walk, tottering along by the aid of a knotted and knobbed hickory-stick, and singing lustily, and with evident pleasure, a snatch of an old whig song.
               "Blanche Dearwood! as I am a soldier," exclaimed he, suddenly stopping in the midst of his music as Blanche rode up to him. "Blanche Dearwood. Wonderful now, wasn't it? I was just this moment a thinking of General Dearwood, your grandfather, of glorious Revolutionary memory, and along you come like a ghost."
               "Like a ghost of my grandfather, Captain Dartan?"
               "Not exactly, Blanche Dearwood. But how's all at the Clove? Somehow, lass, things are not there as they was. Colonel Waldron looks pale and troubled like, whenever I see him lately. Aha! since Rodman Moore went away matters are out of sorts."
               "Out of sorts with you, sir?"
               "No, no. The old man's well enough. It isn't any more than right for him to be troubled. He's old, and feels somehow, Blanche Dearwood, as though he hadn't exactly any right on this earth, and so what troubles he mought have, couldn't last long. But he feels, lass, for others. There is a great shadow on Colonel Waldron's path. One can see it there plain enough. But where's the cloud that it comes from? That's what I can't make out, Blanche Dearwood, and that's what puts us all out of sorts. Ever since Rodman Moore has been gone it has been a growing deeper and darker."
               "Do you think, sir," inquired Blanche, almost breathlessly, "that it has anything to do with Rodman Moore?"
               He shook his head.
               "I don't know, lass. There's no telling. Rodman was the light of my poor house, and certainly there hasn't been quite as much sunlight as there were afore he went away. It's somehow darker. Ah! if Rodman Willow's spirit could only look down and see what a noble lad he is!"
               He paused and placed his finger upon his temple.
               "I am puzzled, somewhat, lass. I can't quite make it out. It's snarled a bit. Rodman, now, I dare say, could figure it out."
               "What is it that troubles you, dear Captain?"
               "Rodman Willow was killed at Germantown—his first battle—when I were wounded and left for dead. And I can't remember that he were married afore that. I can't, indeed. But Rodman Moore must be his grandson. I knew he were Rodman Willow's offspring the moment I laid eyes upon him. It's snarled, though."
               "Captain Dartan—"
               "Goodness me," interrupted he, "I forgot. Bless my poor head. It ain't as tight, and smooth, and prim as it were. A bit rusty, lass, a bit, rusty. But this very day a letter came by post, and for you, Blanche Dearwood."
               "A letter for me. Who can it be from?"
               "It don't need much guessing, lass—not much. It came inside of another which were directed to me, and there were some lines to me as how I would serve a certain young gentleman if I would forward it to a certain young lady."
               Blanche's face was all in a blaze.
               
               "Don't you guess, lass? Why it be from Rodman Moore."
               "Oh! let me have it," was Blanche's sudden exclamation, but she checked herself instantly, and grew painfully embarrassed.
               "Don't blush, Blanche Dearwood. He's a noble lad, so I say, who know his grandfather. But here be the letter."
               "I wonder why he should write to me," said Blanche demurely, as she received it.
               "Wonder why! Bless the lass! Ah! Blanche Dearwood, I've seen in eighty years many a love match, beginning away off with Sally Clare's, and I know the signs. Oh! it's glorious, it's glorious," exclaimed he, breaking out rapturously, and rubbing his hands together, "its glorious to think of it! Such a wedding as there will be! Oh! how my old heart yearns for the blessed day. But read the letter, Blanche Dearwood. Let's know all the boy has got to say."
               "Pardon me, dear Captain, not now. I've got a painful word to say to you, dear sir. I've come to say farewell."
               "Farewell!"
               The old man staggered back, and shading his eyes with his hand, looked at her wonderingly.
               "Yes, Captain Dartan, I am to say farewell to you and to the Clove, and to all that I love so well."
               "Blanche Dearwood!"
               "To-morrow, we depart for town."
               "A visiting, eh?"
               "Alas! dear sir, I wish that it were so. But this may be the last day that I shall ever spend at the Clove; this may be the last time that we shall ever see each other."
               "I don't understand. I don't understand."
               He pressed his fingers to his temples again, and seemed to be trying to collect his thoughts. Blanche sprang from her horse, and going up to him took his hand.
               "We are not so happy at the Clove as we were, dear Captain. There has, somehow, a sorrow fallen upon us. I do not quite understand it all myself, and what I do understand I must not speak. But I must leave everything here. I am out to look for the last time upon the places that I love. I have been saying good-bye to many things, and now I am here to say good-bye to you."
               "Alas! alas! poor Colonel Waldron. I remember, Blanche Dearwood, I remember when there was a Waldron, fair, and beautiful, and good like you, who, when she were a gliding through our woods, the neighbors would say it were an angel with a shining light. And she was struck down on the hearth-stone. I see her red blood gushing, now—so sweet, so beautiful, so good. Ah! somehow, since then, things have not been well at the Clove. But"—his mind which had been wandering somewhat came back again, and he looked anxiously at Blanche as he exclaimed—"but what's it all, lass? What troubles you?"
               "Some day, perhaps, we shall know all. Now we can only say good bye to each other. And let us do so with as little sadness as possible. That would be the best way, wouldn't it?"
               "I never thought of it before—so like Rose."
               "What, are you saying, Captain?"
               He started.
               "Nothing, Blanche Dearwood. But Colonel Waldron, lass?"
               "Departs too, but not with me. He will return to Europe."
               "Abandon the Clove again. It's all wrong. Things once wrong and out o' sorts, somehow keep wrong always. Always, Blanche Dearwood!"
               "Ah! sir, let us hope for the best. Who knows? Perhaps, by another summer, we may all be gathered together at the Clove, and so happy! We can't tell, Captain Dartan, what happiness there may be in store for us? And so, you know, we might as well believe there is plenty of it. Don't you think so?"
               "Ah! blessed girl. If I could only live to see you Blanche Moore—"
               "Oh! sir, you musn't talk that way. Come, this is the last time I shall shake your hand. If you don't say goodbye at once, I will leave you without its being spoken."
               He smoothed down her curls, tremblingly kissed her brow, gently rubbed her hands in his, and then buttoning up his coat as if he would by this means stifle the emotions in his heart, he turned abruptly away, without speaking, and tottered off as fast as he could walk. But when a little way removed, he turned, and cried out:
               "Farewell, Blanche Dearwood, farewell."
               Blanche returned the parting word, and then stood and watched him as he hurried off with a rapid and eager step, as if he were tearing himself forcibly from the scene, and striving by this means to control his feelings. When he was out of sight Blanche remounted, and, after turning her horse's head towards home, with eager pleasure broke the seal of Rodman's letter.
               It was a lover's letter, enthusiastic and extravagant, but alternating with fear and hope. He longed, he said, to see her once more, to enjoy the rapture once again of an hour with her, and her accustomed haunts, to feel her smile and her love again. He described minutely his situation, his studies, his ambitious aspirations, and the friends he had found. He talked hopefully of the time when he should become independent; but he dreaded the impediments that in his imagination, darkly, he saw rise between them. He spoke of his father with tenderness, but reserve, and he concluded by begging for a response.
               Blanche, with her horse's rein upon his neck, kept reading the letter over and over with varied feelings of pleasure and sorrow until she drew near the Clove. She was so entirely occupied in this way that she did not observe how near she was approaching the house, until, on passing a turn in the road where it suddenly opened upon the view, she lifted her eyes for a moment to ascertain her position. Her glance, almost instantly, fell upon a carriage that was just leaving the house along the river-road. She knew that it was the departure of Mr. Waldron. She checked her steed, and watched until it was out of sight, and then with feelings inexpressibly depressed and sad slowly rode up to the house.
               Mr. Elwood met her at the door, and was marvelously profuse in his attentions, attaining even an unprecedented flow and redundance of language, and delivering himself, no doubt, of the longest sentences he had ever spoken in his life before. It was all kindness and consideration on Mr. Elwood's part, but Blanche was dejected, and his attentions were irksome. She escaped from him as soon as she could, and passed a few hours in the solitude of her chamber. At the tea-table they were all united again, but the preparations for their departure on the day following occupied their conversation exclusively.
               The next day at the appointed hour, Blanche, Amelia, and their escort, all appeared prepared for the journey. The carriage was already drawn up, and Mr. Elwood with stately dignity handed the ladies in. There was a group of domestics gathered around, many of whom with unaffected grief were watching the departure of Blanche, who had endeared herself to them every one. In her happiest manner she bade them all adieu, but when at last the carriage started, and she had taken what would prove, but too probably, her last look at the Clove, she fell back into her seat, drew her veil over her face, and wept, silently, but passionately.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               BLANCHE AMONG NEW FRIENDS.
               "BLANCHE DEARWOOD!" "Coming to-day!"
               These exclamations ran around a group of some half dozen persons who were assembled in the breakfast room of an aristocratic-looking mansion in the upper portion of the town, on the morning of the same day on which we have seen our heroine depart from the Clove.
               It was a family group, and we will pause to sketch it. Before a glowing heap of anthracite in the steel-barred grate, an elderly gentleman was drawn up in his deep armed-chair, with his favorite journal dropped by his side, his "spectacle on nose," and an open letter spread out upon his knee. Two young ladies were sipping late cups of coffee at the breakfast-table, at the head of which still presided a grave, commanding-style of lady, with a plentiful display of cap, a rich morning-robe, and altogether a somewhat elaborated breakfast-toilet. Upon an ottoman in one corner by the grate, a young girl of about seventeen was lounging, with an open novel in her lap, but with her attention temporarily averted by a matter of greater interest. A lad, the only remaining member of the group, was employed in surreptitiously teasing a snarling little lap-dog that was stretched beneath the table.
               "Do let us hear all about it, father."
               "Dear me, who would have thought it?"
               
               "Why, I thought her solemn-faced old guardian was never going to let her out of his sight?"
               "I declare, father, you are the most provoking! Why don't you read the letter, when we are dying to hear it?"
               "Do, father, do!"
               "Be quiet for a moment, if you can, and I will."
               "Well, now—"
               "There, Edward, you won't keep still."
               "Goodness me—"
               "Hush, father is going to read it."
               Quiet imposed, and their impatience restrained, the letter was read to the attentive assemblage.
               It ran thus:
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              
                                 "WILLIAM HOPEWELL, Esq.
                              
                           
                           "MY DEAR SIR:—When I arrived last spring from Europe, and first assumed the office devolved upon me by Mrs. Hopewell's dying brother, you were so kind as to evince an interest in the object I had in view, and your honored lady expressed an earnest affection for her youthful niece, the guardianship of whom I was about to assume. You also pressed several invitations upon us, which, heretofore, circumstances have prevented us accepting. For several reasons I now desire for my ward a change from the monotonous routine of life at the Clove. It is my belief that a few weeks spent among the attractive gaieties of the town, may serve to keep her from falling into a state of melancholy that the lonely life she is now leading seems to endanger. And, moreover, for Blanche's sake, I desire that her acquaintance with her fathers family should not become cool or distant, which only an occasional interchange of society can prevent. Blanche, therefore, will have the happiness of availing herself of the kind solicitations you once expressed in her behalf, and with your consent, will pass a few weeks as the guest of yourself and Mrs. Hopewell.
                           "Circumstances will prevent me from accompanying Blanche. My sister Amelia, however, will be her travelling companion.
                           
                              "I have the honor, sir, to be, your obedient servant,
                              "GILBERT WALDRON."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               Mr. Hopewell having read the letter, deposited it in his wallet among numerous other documents, and then took up the paper again.
               "Blanche is a nice girl, I believe," said he: "I dare say her visit will be very pleasant."
               "I am sure," remarked Mrs. Hopewell, "that I shall welcome her with every proper manifestation of interest and affection. My brother Gerard was my favorite brother, and his child is endeared to me not only by ties of kindred, but by many associations and remembrances of her father."
               "I wonder if she has sensibility," said Alice, the eldest of the daughters.
               "Won't it be delightful though; we must really give her a ball."
               "Any excuse for a frolic, Loo," remarked Mr. Hopewell. "Will you never get enough of dancing?"
               "I really think, papa, that now you ought to get a box at the opera."
               "We must show her all the sights."
               "Such delightful weather for drives and rides."
               "Oh, delicious!"
               "I'll bet a quarter, girls, that she can beat you all at riding."
               "You're always saying ridiculous things, Edward."
               "And the Keans are acting too. Won't it be delightful to give her the first look at a theatre. Do, papa, look and see what's to be played to-night."
               "I believe that you are theatrical mad, Susan."
               "But when will she arrive, papa? Ah! I do long to see her so."
               "Absolutely, young ladies, you are running wild. Do talk one at a time. It is the proper way."
               "I wonder if she sings."
               
               "Or plays."
               "And if she's handsome."
               "She was quite pretty, you know."
               "Edward, you must fall in love with her."
               "Edward, indeed! He ain't above marbles yet."
               "Ain't I, though! I'll be sixteen next May."
               "I saw you playing marbles yesterday."
               "Oh! gracious."
               "You can't deny it."
               "But I was only showing Billy Ortors a trick."
               "Stop, stop, stop your chattering," exclaims Mr. Hopewell. "Let's have peace. How can I read the paper in such a babel?"
               Upon which their rattling talk ceases, and they saunter off one by one. Mr. Hopewell soon gets buried in his paper. Mrs. Hopewell summons the domestics to remove the cloth, and presently all is quiet.
               Mr. William Hopewell was a flourishing merchant of New York, with a high reputation in Wall street, and a big balance at his bankers.
               Mr. William Hopewell was a man about fifty, with iron grey locks of obstinate stiffness, a rugged and yet not unpleasing face, and a somewhat portly form. In order to complete his portraiture we will add, that be evinced intelligence, a fondness for his dinner, a love of social comforts, and more good sense than imagination. He liked the morning Courier, port wine, the stock list, a chat on 'change, lucky speculations, a hit at Jackson, and a game of chess. He hated concerts, claret, a bad dinner, a panic in finances, the Locofocos, and long sermons.
               Mrs. Frances Hopewell's maiden name was Dearwood, and she was an elder sister to Blanche's father. Twenty-five years previous to the date of our story she had been united to Mr. Hopewell, and the result of the union was four children: Alice, now twenty-three; Louisa, aged twenty-one; Susan, aged seventeen; and Edward, aged sixteen.
               Mrs. Frances Hopewell was remarkable for style and dignity. She was never known to omit any formal observance or to commit any offence against the most rigid laws of propriety. She was never guilty of an inelegant expression, or a slovenly-worded sentence, and her grammar was as perfect, as Lindley Murray could have desired. Her delivery was flowing and redundant, somewhat pompous in words, but its accuracy and clearness rendered it not unpleasant.
               Her mother was the proudest and most celebrated of all the high dames who shed lustre upon the Revolution by their virtues, their devotion, and their heroism. All the formal dignity, grace, the studied courtesy and propriety off manner of that age found in her a rigid adherent; and her daughter, through childhood, awed and overwhelmed by her mother's grandeur, in womanhood, insensibly became moulded and fashioned after the same school.
               But Mrs. Hopewell did not seem to have exercised the same influence upon her three daughters that her mother had possessed over her.
               There was very little dignity or formality, or studied manner, and a good deal of slip-shod grammar in the three Misses Hopewell. These young ladies were remarkable principally for an abiding and insatiate fondness for pleasure—pleasure in whatever form it might come—whether dancing, music, reading, riding, sailing, walking, the ball, the theatre, the novel, new dresses, or in whatever new thing that might afford them a sensation or excitement. Their principal occupation was to contrive new amusements to devise new plans for mirth and pleasure. If parties were few, concerts and theatres dull, novels prosy, the weather rainy, and their favorite beaux out of town, they would have recourse to some extravagant mode for enjoyment, or else, in déshabillé and the blues, doze and pout away the time.
               They were very animated, joyous creatures, and beneath all their frivolity had good hearts. They had smiles for almost everybody, were not particular upon whom they bestowed their attentions, thought more of a frolic than anything else, and were always ready to laugh one into good spirits, and quite indifferent whether they had good cause to laugh or not. Wit was wit to them, no matter how true or false the ring, if it only afforded them an opportunity to be gay, or an excuse for a laugh.
               It might have been noticed by a curious observer, that they always laughed in unison, and all laughed alike, and always laughed in one key. And it also might have been observed how exceedingly partial they were to expletives, and that whenever a thing was up for admiration, how an adjective started by one was sure to be run up the scale by the others, until the superlative was reached.
               Their fondness for expletives, however, never seemed to have induced in them a very nice perception of their appropriateness. We cannot assert with confidence that it was one of these young ladies who upon first seeing Niagara exclaimed "Oh, isn't it sweet!" But we are enabled to declare positively that one of them once in a fit of enthusiasm, at a view from one of the White Mountain peaks, clasped her hands together, and remarked, "Isn't it nice?"
               The Misses Hopewell had a great many beaux. They were so amiable, and so full of high spirits and mirth, and would laugh, and chat, and gossip away an evening so fast, that it was no wonder. And yet, what was a greater wonder still, nothing ever came of it. Positively Alice was twenty-three, and the youthfulness of Susan was beginning to put her to an unfavorable contrast—especially in the view of most of their gentleman friends, who, according to the custom of the country, that gives up society to the youths merely, were as guiltless of beards as the ladies themselves. But really it was indeed a wonder that such very amiable young ladies should escape matrimony so long. Was it that the happiness their society conferred was so perfect that nothing was left to be desired?
               Alice Hopewell was rather tall and thin, Louisa somewhat embonpoint, and Susan, falling a little short of Alice in height, borrowed a little of Louisa's roundness. Susan indeed possessed quite an elegant and well-rounded figure, and she had many other claims to beauty. She was also less frivolous, more honest, and earnest, and frank than her sisters, and of all of them, resembled her brother Edward the most.
               Edward was a bold, frank, fearless, noisy boy, full of fun, humor and mirth. He was as open as day, and as true as steel. His reckless and fun-loving nature would frequently lead him into mischief, much to the torment of the whole family, who were sometimes, and even frequently, betrayed into undue severity towards him. Everybody scolded him, but everybody liked him. He would, however, turn off their harsh sayings with a shrug, and laugh them into good humor in a moment afterwards. His was one of those brilliant minds which catch gleams of everything as if by intuition, and take shallow dips into all kinds of knowledge, yet, by a certain kind of instinct, frequently snatch at deeper truths than laborious reasoners can arrive at. Their conclusions, however, are never the result of deductions. They leap their points, and sometimes miss their footing.
               During the rest of the day until the time for the arrival of Blanche, the young ladies occupied themselves principally about Blanche's looks and manner, and in planning pleasure for her. Some years had elapsed since they had seen her, and then she was quite a little girl, but the pet of them all. Light-hearted and good-hearted, it had always been an especial delight with them to have little, merry, sweet-tempered, and loving Blanche Dearwood with them. Whenever she came plenty of merriment was always on foot, and the younger sisters would be sure to exhaust their vivacious and overflowing spirits in a good romp with her. Now, therefore, they were full of pleasant expectation at her visit. They remembered all her endearing ways, and the many happy hours they had spent with her; they remembered how they had always delighted in and admired her graceful form and lovely face; they remembered, too, her gentleness and her many virtues.
               Eager for pleasure themselves, and desirous of affording Blanche every possible happiness, which with them was nearly synonymous with pleasure, they planned out a succession of entertainments, to commence immediately after her arrival. They would have balls, parties, the opera, the theatre, rides and drives in abundance; visit everywhere and everything, and fill up their whole time with amusement of some kind. That night, they agreed, they would all want to talk with her, and learn all about her new life, and her guardian; and about the Clove, &c., &c. But upon the morrow their pleasure, would begin. In the first place Blanche knew but little about the city, and, therefore, they must ride in Broadway, and visit all the places of interest they could in one day. In the evening they would go and see the Keans. The next evening they must have a party—and so on.
               Late in the afternoon a carriage drove up to the door. In an instant they were all in excitement. And when Blanche, gravely and ceremoniously handed by Mr. Elwood from the carriage to the door, was ushered into the house, they all fell to caressing her at once, overpowering her with kisses, congratulations, and questions. Blanche, a good deal surprised and not a little pleased to find that she was remembered so affectionately, could scarcely refrain from a few tears of delight, while at the same time she smiled and laughed, and indulged in a little of the same glee that her hosts were expressing so loudly.
               Amelia meanwhile had been conducted into the house, and welcomed in a stately manner by Mrs. Hopewell. Mr. Elwood having thus accomplished his mission took a formal leave.
               Blanche was now divested of her bonnet and shawl, and received the tender but quiet embrace of her aunt. Master Edward also came up and frankly offered his hand. It was accepted as frankly, and with a beaming smile.
               The young ladies all this while rattled away, and certainly evinced a good deal of affection for their cousin. A little more delicacy and good taste, Blanche could not help thinking, would have been a graceful addition to their many excellent qualities. They were rather too curious about many matters, and spoke with extraordinary freedom upon a subject that to Blanche was peculiarly sacred. But love to them was like any other pleasure, and a husband a matter quite on a par with a new waltz or a new play.
               Undoubtedly the society into which Blanche was now introduced was not suited to her perfect refinement and high culture, but it was well calculated to divert her from melancholy, and by its freshness and novelty to give a new and vigorous tone to her mind.

               CITY FRIENDS.
               THE next day after her arrival, Blanche was bodily seized upon by her good-natured friends, and carried through what might almost be called a triumphal march. She was escorted around among a score of relatives and friends, whirled through Broadway, shown through numberless shops and picture-galleries, and taken to view various interesting objects in the way of rare bonnets, unprecedented silks, and novel jewelry. The Hopewells were extremely anxious to show her everything, and fretted themselves a good deal in their over anxiety to please her. Blanche could not help feeling that her pleasure would have been greatly enhanced if so much had not been forced upon her. She found that she was expected to go off into ecstasy at everything she was shown. She couldn't possibly be pleased unless she indulged in superlatives. Her friends always looked blank unless she talked extravagantly, which, at last, became so irksome a task that she heartily wished the jaunt was over.
               At last, however, they returned to the house, but even this did not afford any relief or repose to Blanche. They had only a brief space in which to dress for dinner before it would be announced, and one of the sisters hurried off Blanche to her apartment and proffered her aid in her toilet.
               
               At dinner there was an incessant clatter of small talk, and every subject disposed of in the most frivolous manner. There was, it is true, an abundance of bright, vivacious, sometimes witty sayings, but the conversation was disjointed, fragmentary, and diffused. It consisted entirely of skirmishes and guerilla-like inroads into a thousand different subjects, without disposing of any of them, or following them farther up than the exchange of a few blows. It was a game of battledoor in which the cork and feathers were thrown up, and scarcely tossed backwards and forwards, before substituted for a fresh shuttlecock. Blanche was disposed to listen only, but as questions would rattle around her, and as appeals to her taste, judgment or opinion were unceasing, she was forced fairly into the very centre of the giddy whirl, and, however much it was in opposition to her tastes, she found herself catching the infection, and becoming as the rest, an animated sustainer of an off-hand, galloping, noisy conversation. Blanche could not remember afterwards anything that was said that stimulated her fancy, awoke a pleasurable sensation, or that started a train of thought. It was all the glittering froth of champagne, without the rich flavor of the wine itself.
               After dinner, just as they had all assembled in the drawing-room, Mr. Waldron was announced and ushered in. As he entered, Blanche could see that while calm and collected, he was pale and internally agitated.
               His appearance created a commotion among the Hopewells. They all started off at once to thank him for Blanche's visit, and to express, very volubly, their admiration for her.
               "It's well you didn't coop her up there among those barbarians," said one.
               "We are going to show her a little life," exclaims another.
               "Really, Mr. Waldron, won't you go with us to the play to-morrow night?"
               "Ladies, I trust that you will pardon—"
               "Oh! well, but you must come to the ball on Friday night. We are going to have a splendid affair."
               "And in honor of Blanche, too."
               "You surely will come."
               "We'll have a delightful time."
               "Do sit down, Mr. Waldron."
               Mr. Waldron, polite and quiet, took a seat, and expressed his desire to gratify the wishes of the Misses Hopewell, but that circumstances, he said, sometimes deprived him of the control over his own actions. He, however, should be happy, if it were possible, to avail himself of their kind solicitations, and do himself the honor of being present at the assemblage.
               Mr. Hopewell now broke in by inquiring of Mr. Waldron if he had heard of the frightful failures of several Southern houses, and the threatened bankruptcy of many more? Mr. Waldron being compelled to confess ignorance of the important news, the merchant started off into a warm tirade against the Sub-Treasury, quoting with singular faithfulness the arguments on the question set forth in the morning paper.
               The young ladies, meanwhile, had gathered around Blanche, and were busy discussing what should be her dress on the night of the ball. Each had her favorite color and material, and all were clamorous in defence of their respective favorite styles.
               But other guests soon followed, and the company, first only general in their conversation, soon broke up into little circles—one over the piano, another by a window, and a third around a picture. The shifting and changing character of the little groups soon enabled Mr. Waldron to obtain a few moments with Blanche alone.
               "Blanche," said he, "are you happy among your new companions?"
               "I think, sir, incessantly of the Clove."
               "When I am across the ocean, you shall return to it."
               "The ocean, sir?"
               "In a week I sail."
               "But why—" She checked herself, and did not dare to ask the question.
               "Before I leave, Blanche," continued he, "there is a duty to fulfill which I owe to myself and to you. After what has occurred I feel it necessary for you to know my history."
               Blanche started, and a thrill of vague hope, a sensation of pleasure, she hardly knew why, filled her bosom. His history might she not glean from it something for Rodman's good? Might it not, indeed, show her how father and son could be restored to each other?
               Mr. Waldron resumed:
               "Justice to myself, Blanche, requires it. Were you unacquainted with it, you might hear things of me that would, in your estimation, cover me with infamy."
               "You certainly shan't have Blanche there all by yourself, Mr. Waldron," at this juncture cried out Alice, running over and seizing Blanche's arms.
               "Come, Blanche, you are to sing for us. Ah! Mr. Poppin and Mr. Darlen! Miss Dearwood!" The gentlemen bow with formality.
               "Mr. Poppin, do bring us that candle. Blanche, what will you sing?"
               "Really, Alice, if you will excuse me," exclaims the blushing Blanche.
               "Oh! no, no," cry several voices; "Blanche, you must sing. You can sing so sweetly too."
               "One of your ballads, now."
               "Anything—but do sing. Now do, Blanche!"
               And with much bustle and clamor Blanche is coaxed to the piano. With diffidence she endeavors to comply with requests so importunately urged, and sings a fragment of an old song. She gains in confidence as she proceeds, and her voice rises in rich and melodious fullness, expressive, emotional, eloquent. There is an instant's pause as her voice dies away at the end of the song, and then awake the numerous and meaningless praises of a fashionable crowd.
               Mr. Poppin thought it was exquisite.
               Mr. Darlen declared that it was enchanting.
               "Sweet!" exclaimed Susan.
               "Lovely!" said Louisa.
               "Beautiful!" chimed in Alice.
               Blanche was urged to sing again. She complied, and was then succeeded by Louisa. Louisa's music was operatic in execution, brilliant, evincing the mastery over many difficulties, and a very high order of skill. But it was all music as a difficulty, as a mechanical wonder, as a triumph of ingenuity. The expression, the soul, the passion of music—where were they? All sacrificed to skill and execution—to tricks scarcely better than jugglers'—making music not the outpouring eloquence of the soul, the expression of sentiment and passion—but a mechanical cunning and juggling ingenuity.
               Mr. Waldron and Blanche found an opportunity to exchange a few more brief words together.
               "It may be," said he, "that I shall have no opportunity to relate to you in person the statement that I propose, but, in that case, I will convey it to you in writing. But, Blanche, it is not at all probable that we shall meet more than once again. May I ask that when I have gone, you will strive to recollect me only as your guardian—forgetting everything else."
               "Oh! sir, I do forget everything else. Let us both do so, and go back to the old time again."
               "It is impossible, Blanche. You do not know all. When you do you will perceive how right I am in my course of conduct. There come your friends. Let me say good night, and not withdraw you from them again. Yet, one word—this frivolous, artificial, shallow life—"
               "I already begin to loathe it."
               "Ah! it is unlike the earnest one we led at the Clove. I did not know its character when I introduced you here. But I think you are too steadfast in higher purposes to be swept away by it."
               "Do not doubt me. But come again, sir—come frequently. Alas! alas! why—"
               "Dear me, Blanche, you are forever getting in corners. Here are Mr. Poppin and Mr. Darlen dead in love, and sighing for a flirtation with you."
               Blanche blushed deeply, and looking a farewell to her guardian, permitted herself to be led away, annoyed and shocked by the familiarity and frivolity with which every subject and every emotion were treated by her hosts.
               "We are forming a whist party, and Mr. Poppin requests you for a partner," cried out Louisa to Blanche as Alice was leading her away from Mr. Waldron.
               The party consisted of Mr. Poppin and Blanche, Susan and Mr. Darlen, and they seated themselves for the game Blanche protested that she was but an indifferent player, as in truth she was, her only experience consisting of a little practice with Mr. Elwood while a member of that gentleman's family.
               "We have never seen you at Saratoga," said Mr. Poppin to Blanche, in one of the pauses of the game. Blanche replied that she never visited watering-places.
               "Dear me," said Mr. Poppin, "how sad!"
               Mr. Poppin was a little gentleman laboring under the burden of an overwhelming toilet. He was very ornamentally gotten up—picked out after an exceedingly delicate fashion, and set forth with many brave devices. His beard was a study. It was trimmed and cut into shapes as odd and fantastic as Dutch gardeners delighted in a century ago. His skin was unwholesomely dark, and his hair macassared to such a state that one could not help being reminded by it of cold gravy—the grease was all through it in little coagulated masses. Mr. Poppin wore an astounding vest, and a cravat to match. They had been conceived in emulation of the rainbow, and certainly in vividness of color did no dishonor to their great prototype. Mr. Poppin wore pantaloons that were strapped down to so marvellous a tightness that he was forced to bend a little from the waist, in order to get breath, and as a precaution against catastrophes. But Mr. Poppin thought that his most undoubted claim to elegance was this favored bend to his body. He was, indeed, so enamored of it, that he lost no opportunity to display it, and daily promenaded Broadway, his arms suspended, with out-turned elbows, in perpendicular lines from his shoulders. His walk, it is true, was something mincing, but Mr. Poppin thought it fascinating.
               Mr. Poppin was a man of many accomplishments. He frequented the opera, and cried "Bravo" in the wrong place! He officiously turned over the music for his lady favorites—and blundered at it. He danced out of time— paid awkward compliments—dropped ices on the ladies' dresses—and made clumsy jokes. Mr. Poppin's idea of exalted society was Saratoga—of felicity, Broadway—of heaven, the Polka.
               Mr. Poppin, upon the occasion when he met our heroine, was endeavoring to be facetious, and with the customary delicacy, refinement, and good taste of his class, was amusing himself by endeavoring to play on the credulity and ignorance of his companion. This had proceeded for some time, when Susan, whom we have mentioned as far deeper and truer than her sisters, determined that he should suffer a little by his own weapons.
               "You spent a month last summer at Saratoga, Mr. Poppin," said she, bringing the conversation back to his favorite subject.
               "Y-e-s," was the drawling simpering reply. "Such fascination, wit, elegance in the society."
               "You must, then, have been acting upon the political principle of supply and demand, Mr. Poppin," replied Susan.
               "Eh?" Mr. Poppin looked puzzled and uncertain as to Susan's meaning.
               "Oh!" said he with an effort to be facetious, and throwing himself back with an assumption of elegance, "you see I was fishing for an heiress."
               "Good lord!" was the lightning reply, "with what bait?"
               The blankest of looks settled down upon Mr. Poppin. Mr. Poppin could scarcely believe his senses—he, the subject of a joke—he, the victim of a repartee. Impossible!
               "The game is ours," cried Susan, flinging down the four honors, "we were eight, you know. Dear me, I am wearied of this. Don't you think it stupid, Mr. Poppin?"
               Mr. Popping, down-hearted and disconsolate, did not venture a reply.
               In this way passed the evening, and when the guests had withdrawn, and Blanche had at last retired to the privacy of her own apartment, she looked back upon the whole day as one of frivolous pleasure, distasteful bustle, and vulgar excitement; and she could not remember of one hour passed in a way that was pleasurable to recall. Every idea that she had of happiness was as far removed from this mode of life as it is possible for extremes to be opposed to each other. It was to the heart, to emotions, to fancy, imagination, thought, to sympathetic contact with mind and soul, the awakening of emotions by the contemplation of the Beautiful—the exercise of all the functions of mind and body—the supplying of the sentiment by poetry, whether the inspiration of genius, or the poetry of things familiar—it was to these things, in all their various modifications and forms, when in their highest development, that she had ever looked for happiness.
               In the midst of a profound reverie, in which there mingled thoughts like these, with many others, she was aroused by a slight tap upon her door. Upon opening it she found Amelia without. Heartily glad of this, for she felt the want of a little of the old calm intercourse, Blanche led her in, and they took seats side by side.
               "Amelia," said Blanche, "I long for the Clove already. Would that we were back there again."
               "Ah! Blanche, for years and years that wish lay close and heavily upon me."
               "But why, Amelia, was the Clove abandoned? Why for so many years did you never go near it?"
               "It is a history that my brother will doubtless unfold to you—I must not. Circumstances drove my brother from it, and I went forth, with the resolve never to be its inmate while my poor brother wats an exile from its roof. But he came back and restored the old place. We took up our abode there again, with deep joy and full hope—but see, see how brief was the joy, and false the hope!"
               "We will go back again."
               "Alone, if we do go. My brother condemns himself to exile again."
               "Ah!" exclaimed Blanche, with deep feeling, "if I could but know all—whether wrong or guilt—"
               "Guilt!" Amelia's mild eyes opened wide and wonderingly.
               "Amelia, Amelia, there is mystery and suspicion about the history of Clove House—more of mystery and suspicion than you know, but into which I have caught glimpses that fill me with pain and wretchedness. I wish that I could tell you—I wish that I had some friend in whom I might confide, and who would guide me."
               "Can I not be your friend?"
               "No, no, no. I am bound not to reveal. And yet, Amelia, tell me—your brother, Mr. Waldron, had he—a son?"
               "Hush! hush! Blanche. There lies my brother's grief. That is the cancer that is eating at his heart. It is a subject I do not permit myself to discuss."
               "But, Amelia, if you would but unfold to me the history—the circumstances—"
               "Blanche, I cannot speak of my brother's shame."
               "Then there was guilt."
               Amelia rose up gravely. "I do not know, and I will not ask you," said she, "by what means you came in possession of any part of my brother's history. But, hereafter, let us be silent on the subject. It is late, and you are weary; so I will leave you."
               She kissed Blanche's brow, and then calmly and gravely left the room. When she was gone, Blanche, shocked by this new appearance of evidence against her guardian and further confirmation of Rodman's dishonorable birth, flung herself upon her knees and prayed—prayed for her guardian and for Rodman—for-the restoration of father and son, and for the washing away of whatever guilt that now held them asunder. She arose with a serene look, but with moistened eyes and tremulous lips, and seated herself musingly by a table.
               She fell to thinking of her guardian and Rodman, and of their strange position to each other. With a calmer and clearer judgment than usual she recalled all the circumstances of the father's conduct to the son, and from this subject her mind Naturally reverted to the one painful remembrance of her life. Suddenly, as if a new light had, burst upon her, she sprang upon her feet with an exclamation of joy and surprise. She almost laughed outright, and with excited visions of happiness in store, paced her room with an exulting step and beaming eye.
               "If it should be so—if, indeed, it should!" exclaimed she, it accounts for everything—his bitter words on that fearful night—for his strange repugnance. He did not know him—did not recognize him—no father could have acted so towards a son—he saw in him only a supposed—"
               She paused with the word unspoken. But the thought that had so suddenly broke upon her mind was a glimmering of the truth. She, for the first time, saw how Mr. Waldron's conduct to Rodman might have been prompted by the bitter feelings of a rival.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               THE PLAY.
               THE next evening was set apart for the play, and as they were to see the Keans in "As You Like It," Blanche looked forward to the entertainment with agreeable expectations. "As You Like It" was, of all Shakspeare's comedies, Blanche's favorite. She, however, had never seen its dramatic representation. As a poem she was familiar with it, and had always taken an especial delight in reading it in the midst of her woodland haunts at the Clove. As an exquisite pastoral and Arcadian picture it was her delight. To her it breathed so of the forest and wild wood, it was so vivid and full of the glade, the flowers, the woodland shade, the rippling brook, the bending corn, golden in the sunlight; antlered deer, ancient oaks, with peeping roots and moss-hung limbs, the melody of birds, and the air laden with treasure exhaled from ten thousand blossoms—its poetry was so, eloquent of all these things—it was so perfect a rural picture, idealized with the golden touch of poetry and fancy, that Blanche had imbibed the spirit that breathed through it, and loved it as if it had been a fond creation of her own fancy.
               Ah! "Sweet Will," what a fame is thine, to live as deeply in the hearts of thy race as thou dost, as thou hast, and as thou ever wilt!
               Some few moments before the rise of the curtain, the Hopewells, in company with Blanche, entered their box. It was Blanche's first visit to the theatre, and everything, therefore, possessed the charm of novelty. The brilliancy of the scene that first presented itself—the blazing, theatre crowded with its gay assemblage, the crash of music that resounded through the house, the hum of many voices and the bursts of, joyous laughter, the nodding plumes, glittering diamonds, and the rustle of gorgeous silks—the perfect panorama, of intermingling colors, and the ten thousand glances that shot pleasure and happiness around—the radiant faces mantling with loveliness and flushed with the consciousness of admiration,—all this presented a picture so animated, gay and brilliant, that Blanche caught the infection of the scene, and felt, in her bosom a thrill of excited pleasure.
               But the rise of the curtain diverted her attention from every other object, and concentrated her interest upon the moving scene, upon which she soon found herself hanging with suspended breath and entranced fascination.
               It was not in the mise en scène, that to most novices proves so alluring, that Blanche found the peculiar charm of the stage. Her fine imagination, which had often taken pleasure in peopling the forests of the Clove with the characters of the play, felt keenly enough that the painted canvas before her but poorly realized the glorious beauties and grand features of the forest of Arden. But, inasmuch, with a taste and knowledge not often exhibited on the stage, no attempt was made to represent the forest, but rather to suggest it—so arranging the canvas that the imagination filled out and extended the scene, and was not thrown back upon itself by any apparent limitation to the boundaries of the stage—the ideal forest, if not perfectly realized to Blanche's mind, was certainly brought to her imagination with greater vividness than she had any conception the stage was capable of.
               But the greatest charm of the play was the realization of the characters. And say what we may about the imagination being able to picture with greater vividness than art can realize, we all of us eagerly seek for the personification of a dramatic ideal, and take pleasure in the acted representation. This principle, of course, only holds good when the personification is an artistic perfection, and more particularly is not applicable to supernatural creations, which necessarily cannot be presented vividly or truthfully. Blanche experienced its truth in the personification of Rosalind by Mrs. Kean. Those who had the good fortune to see this lady in that part, can understand well enough how completely the ideal of the poet was filled, and how much more vivid the auditor's idea of the character was made, than it otherwise could have hoped to be. It was, in truth, Rosalind. The imagination desired no more. The whole mind was filled with the matchless charm of her being. The play of her fancy, the sallies of her wit, the unguarded outbreaks of her emotion, all, in glorious reality, lived and moved in flesh and blood. Blanche felt that it was giving vitality to what was before merely an idea, and that Rosalind, in the person of her representative, lived a reality and a fact.
               But while her imagination and sensibilities were thus aroused with new power—while she confessed that not even while gazing upon the grandest scenes of nature, had the spirits of poetry stirred such depths or awakened emotions of such intenseness, as the little mimic scene before her, in which was concentrated the interest of a life-time—wide and grasping sympathies, emotional responses to wit, poetry, and passions of love, sorrow, melancholy, ambition—while before her moved a panorama of ideal life, into whose every heart she was admitted to read its inmost workings—while filled to the full with all the swelling thoughts and glowing fervor that such a scene was so well calculated to arouse and stimulate into active life—while yielding herself up to the poetic inspiration of the moment, she was continually dragged down to earth, and distracted from its full pleasure, by the superficial gaiety, and shallow, noisy merriment of her friends.
               The Hopewells were in their happiest humor, and attracted no little attention to their box. In the intervals of the acts they talked incessantly, and, to Blanche's annoyance, frequently withdrew her attention from the stage by untimely comments. Susan, who was seated next to her, was the only one who appeared to take anything more than a superficial interest in the performance. She more than once turned a look full of meaning upon Blanche, and exchanged with her expressions of sincere admiration and pleasure.
               "Isn't it all beautiful?" exclaimed Susan, in one of the intervals of the play; "Oh! I do love the theatre. Do you know," aside, and in a low voice, "do you know that if I were poor, and had no family to oppose me, I'd go on the stage."
               Blanche, quite ignorant of the art and its professors, had no opinion to express to Susan upon the matter.
               "I'm really stage-struck," resumed she, "there's no denying it."
               "Blanche, don't you think Dickinson's a beautiful character," calls out Louisa over the shoulders of Alice and Mr. Hopewell. That word "beautiful" was their pet phrase. They all used it indiscriminately—from a new ribbon bon to a mountain—from a favorite dish at dinner to a passage in Shakspeare.
               "Now, Blanche, which character do you like best?"
               "Oh! I'm sure she'll say Jones' is the best."
               "I like Elder's."
               "But Mrs. Kean's is the sweetest, though I do think Mrs. Abbott is lovely."
               With a good deal of surprise Blanche looked from one to, the other, unable to understand to whom they were referring. Edward Hopewell observed her puzzled look, and laughingly placing a "bill" in her hand, pointed to the cast. Glancing at it the puzzle was solved at once. Her learned and tasteful friends, ignoring Shakspeare altogether had dubbed the characters with the names of the actors who represented them. Exquisite sensibility! To which Rosalind, Jaques, Orlando, and the others, were only so many Joneses, Dickinsons, et cetera.
               The conversation at no time rose above the specimens we have given. At one time an animated discussion sprang up as to the personal attractions of Mrs. Kean.
               Alice thought her really pretty.
               Louisa couldn't see how anybody could say so. Her voice, though, certainly was very sweet and expressive.
               Susan admitted that her face was not pretty, but that her form, carriage, and expression were admirable.
               Mr. Hopewell, as usual with all persons who have first impressions to recall, thought she was not nearly so good as formerly. When she was Miss Ellen Tree, ten years before, then, she was not only pretty, but a much better artist.
               So passed on the play, Blanche all the while eager for a sympathizing friend, but obliged to content herself with what little interchange of thought she could obtain from her companions.
               She could not help thinking how enhanced her pleasure would have been if Mr. Waldron or Rodman had been seated by her side.
               At the close of the play, as they were standing up and shawling themselves, Louisa suddenly cried out:
               "Blanche, look, who is that young fellow who is staring at us so? He has been watching you for these five minutes."
               Blanche turned to the direction in which Louisa was looking, and with a start and a suppressed cry, her eye fell on Rodman. Their glances met, and Rodman lifted his hat to her, and then turning abruptly, disappeared in the crowd. Agitated and confused, Blanche followed her companions from the box, and as they passed out into the lobby she eagerly scanned every countenance with the hope of again seeing him. She longed to speak with him, if only to exchange at single word.
               As they were slowly urging their way through the crowded lobby, Blanche chanced to fall a little behind her companions, when suddenly she felt her hand touched, and at the same time the well-known voice whispered her name in her ear.
               "I am astonished to find you in New York," said he, still whispering; "has anything serious occurred? Where is—you know whom I mean, Blanche?"
               "I have much to say to you, Rodman. I cannot explain now. We must meet again."
               At this juncture, the Hopewells turned back to gather together the whole party, preparatory to entering the carriage. Blanche saw their look of surprise at the sight of Rodman, and, though blushing deeply, she hastened to introduce him.
               
               The young ladies bowed gravely, and threw mischievous glances at Blanche from behind their fans.
               "Our carriage is called," cried out young Edward; "are you ready, girls?"
               "Mr. Moore, will you see Miss Dearwood to her carriage?" said Alice, with another glance at Blanche.
               Rodman instantly offered his arm, and they followed out a few yards behind.
               "I am bewildered, dear Blanche," exclaimed Rodman in a low tone. "Your appearance here surprises me beyond expression."
               "I long to see you, Rodman."
               "May I call upon you?"
               "Yes, I think you may. At No. —, Tenth street."
               "To-morrow?"
               "Yes."
               They pressed each other's hands, and Blanche sprang into the carriage, waving him a good night. In an instant the vehicle whirled off, and Rodman stood for a moment upon the curb-stone, abstractedly watching it disappear amid the maze of carriages that filled the street.
               Suddenly a hand clapped him on the shoulder, and a well-known voice exclaimed:
               "Why Rod, my boy, melancholy? Ah! those ancient gentlemen who painted. Love a child were guilty of a sad mistake. They should have made him a giant, sitting upon clouds, the great disturbing spirit of the world. That sentiment, however, Rod, is not mine. Croly sets it down in very fair blank verse."
               "Mr. Knowlton!"
               "Why so surly, Rod?"
               "Mr. Knowlton, you have a very odd way of appearing at strange times, and upon unexpected occasions."
               "Something of a harlequin, eh? Dancing through life, tripping, up the heels of stupidity, disappearing through keyholes, and turning somersets out of windows."
               "You draw a facetious picture; I do not."
               "Well, Rod, let us see what kind of a one you do draw."
               "There is a dramatic character that expresses all I would wish to say."
               "Well?"
               "Paul Pry!"
               "Ha, ha, ha! admirable! The likeness is exquisite. Paul overflowed with good nature: so do I. Paul esteemed a good dinner: I esteem him for it. Paul evinced an affectionate and fraternal interest in the welfare of his fellow-beings. His heart was so deeply enlisted in the affairs of his brothers and sisters of the great human family, that he oftentimes sacrificed his own comfort in endeavoring to advance their interests. I emulate my prototype, believe me. I like the picture. It is admirable."
               "You do not choose to be serious upon the subject."
               "No, nor upon any other. If I did I were a worthy candidate for a lunatic asylum. Serious! Pish! My friend tries to wound me, hunts up and down for the word that he thinks will pierce the keenest—thrusts the word at me, and watches to see it rankle. If I were serious his friendly office would be rewarded—a laugh turns off the poison. I always appreciate my friends, Rod, as I appreciate the world—and never give either the power to touch or sting me."
               "You are a strange man, Mr. Knowlton."
               "Not because of my virtues, though."
               "Are you so because of your faults?"
               "No; for I defy the ingenuity of man to become strange in that way. Be vicious as you may, you will find your peers, You know Poor Tom's frightful category: false of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand, hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey: loving wine deeply, dice dearly, and in woman out-paramouring, the Turk. I am all this because I am human—and what more or less because I am Robert Knowlton."
               They had walked on together, and crossing the Park had reached Chambers street.
               "I am going to take supper, Rod," said Knowlton, "and if your good digestion waits on appetite, will you break crust with me?"
               "No, sir."
               "That's bluntly said, my boy. Keep an edge to your manners by all means, and don't let every peevish humor rust your breeding. Well, you'll to Mrs. Carlton's—I to my hotel. Good night, Rod; but don't dream yourself an Orlando, and wake yourself with rhyming to your mistress."
               "That's one subject, Mr. Knowlton—"
               "That shrinks at a breath. Anything so exquisitely delicate is in danger, isn't it, of being blown away at the first sturdy blast? But I jest at-wounds, who never bore a scar. Cupid's hurts are an evil for which I never needed surgery. Ah! Rod, try balm and plaster, but by all means extract the poison."
               "Mr. Knowlton."
               "Don't be angry, my dear Rod. Every man must play his part, you know, and mine is the jester's. Motley is my wear. Will you say good night to Mrs. Carlton for me?"
               Rodman turned angrily on his heel, and strode away, but Knowlton came up to him.
               "Rod, Rod," said he, "take my hand." He came up closer, and bent down to him. "Do so, Rod, for you will know me better some day yet."
               With surprise, Rodman turned towards him, but instantly falling back upon his old manner, he waved his hand and walked away.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXX.
               RIVAL PURPOSES.
               "BLANCHE DEARWOOD is in town."
               Mrs. Carlton looked up to the speaker suddenly, and pushed the desk away at which she had been writing.
               "Is he with her?"
               "Not as I can learn, ma chère. She is a guest of the Hopewells. You know them?"
               "Yes, I was once on their invitation list."
               "They give a ball on Friday night. It would be an opportunity for you to see the girl. By St. Paul, Rod has taste. She is pretty—in fact, a very exquisite looking creature."
               "Have they met?"
               "For two minutes, in the lobby of the theatre, last night."
               "Robert, if they come together every hope I have is shattered. We must devise some way to keep them apart—to crush out of Rodman's heart every remnant of passion for her."
               "A delightful task, I must confess. I've crammed him already with a tolerably fair supply of hatred for every thing human, and before I'm through, if he don't doubt the honesty of his own shadow, it's because he's proof against my poison. These romantic minds cling to their early delusions with wonderful tenacity."
               "But you do not labor for me earnestly, as you once did."
               "You think so because your appetite grows on what it feeds. Once you were contented with a fair degree of affection on the part of the boy—now you pant for his undivided heart. It occurs to me, ma chère, that you are slightly extravagant in your expectations."
               "You are heedless, Robert. See how near you were wrecking my hopes entirely, when you allowed him to go with Elwood."
               "But who the deuce would have thought that that eccentric old fellow was Waldron's attorney? He was not so formerly. And there still lies our greatest danger. Elwood is watching us with tiger-like closeness. The boy fortunately, for some unexplained reason, avoids him. But Elwood must have been mole-blind to have had him in his office two years, and never have detected the secret. Rodman, though, bears but a slight resemblance to his father."
               "I fear, I fear the worst."
               "Don't lose the battle before it's fought, I beseech you. But as it is best for us to know every danger let me tell you that I saw yesterday, together, Elwood, Arden and Waldron—a mischievous trio—but if Robert Knowlton has not more wit in his composition than the whole three can sum, let him turn haberdasher."
               "But this ball, Robert, I do desire a sight of Blanche."
               "Nothing easier. I know the ladies, and once paid court to them. I'll drop in to-day and renew my devoirs—the result, of course, an invitation."
               "Serve me but a while longer, Robert. My heart is fixed upon my one great purpose, and sometimes, in wild moments, I feel impelled to desperate measures to obtain what I seek."
               "Command me, madam. You are a sort of Prospero and I am your Ariel. Don't laugh at the absurdity of the comparison. But it would not be so far removed from the truth to call me an enlarged edition of Puck. I can't put a girdle around the earth in forty minutes, but I will serve you 'thorough bush, thorough brier, thorough flood, thorough fire.' But, my dear madam, nothing in the world must keep me from my morning promenade. Au revoir. Keep up your cheerfulness and alacrity of mind, I beseech you. Above all things don't get low-spirited. There's nothing so intolerable and beyond endurance. But au revoir, au revoir."
               So saying, he sauntered out with elegant indolence, and Mrs, Carlton drew the desk before her, and resumed the occupation in which she had been interrupted.
               At the same hour the above conversation was taking place, Mr. Elwood and Mr. Waldron were closeted in Elwood's private office in a secret conference.
               Elwood was seated uprightly and stiffly at his desk, while Mr. Waldron was walking the floor with an agitated and impatient step.
               "You've seen Arden, then," said he, in response to some assertion of Elwood's, and pausing abruptly before the lawyer's desk.
               "To please you, sir. But of no use. He knows nothing. The boy ran away. That's all. What we knew before. The fact is, my dear sir. Nothing is to be gained by hunting up the past. Nothing. We have only to do with the present. The boy has been wheedled. Undoubtedly. By the lady."
               "I will go to her and implore his restoration to me. If she refuse I will exercise a father's authority. He is my son—nothing in the world shall keep us apart."
               "Mr. Waldron. My dear sir—"
               "I tell you, Elwood, that I've done with half-measures. I am not as I was. There's a storm within me which defies philosophy. I've lost command over it. I only know that my heart yearns for my son—that if she has robbed me of his affection, she has topped her pyramid of wrong—and I will confront her."
               "It is unfortunate, sir. That so many years, sir."
               "Do not taunt me, Elwood. Bury the past. Do not refer to it. It is one fearful record of passion, doubt, shame, and misery. Why should I love him the less now because I doubted once that he was of my flesh? Why, because I abandoned him once, can I not now restore him to my heart?"
               "Certainly, sir. But this lady. Her fascinations."
               "Aye, and her marvellous cunning. I know, I know how she will work with heart and brain to bind him to her. Unscrupulous, daring, capable, what will she not do? Think of the cunning that deceived me with a belief of her death—of the cunning that first so bound and fascinated me! Oh! she has struck at me relentlessly, and would compel me to linger on through life unloved, avoided, abandoned. She will almost have her purpose. My, heart I had schooled once into a dead repose—I called it philosophy—and strove to be contented. But recently an awakening came—every pulse sprang into quickened being—my heart overflowed with love and passion. It was thrown back upon itself, but I have no philosophy left now to support it. I stagger under the blow—my son alone can give me help—he alone can save me from a fate dark and hopeless, indeed."
               
               "Mr. Waldron!"
               Mr. Elwood was in utter astonishment. He could scarcely believe his senses. Mr. Waldron, his client—so swayed by passion, so plunged in helpless grief. The mild, genial, philosophical, although somewhat melancholy, Mr. Waldron!
               "Elwood, Elwood, I yearn for him that I may make amends for the past—that I may pour out upon him the gathered affection of years. We must work, Elwood—we must devise. Cunning for her cunning, subtlety for her subtlety. But oh! the unutterable anguish of remembering that for two years, unknown to us all, he was so near to us, and might then have been linked to us forever."
               "Robert Orthers, sir. The name he bore here. I have learned. Is not his rightful one."
               "Eh?"
               "Arden declares. That he called him Rodman. Nothing else. No family name. How could he? He had no family."
               "Rodman? Strange! That name is familiar. I can't tell—but I have heard it somewhere."
               He placed his fingers upon his temples bewilderingly but his memory could not recall where he had heard the name before.
               "It's not a common name," resumed he, "and it is singular, therefore, than I cannot tell where I've met it—but it sounds in my ear like an echo."
               "So much agitation, sir. So much excitement, sir. No wonder. It would be strange otherwise."
               "But where did Arden derive the name? I remember that I placed him under his control, with no clue to what his family might be, and never called him by any name."
               "Arden's fancy. Had to call him something. Quite necessary. Rodman turned up first. But you visited. Sometimes?"
               "Yes, for I was tossed between belief and doubt—sometimes fancying I detected my features in his face—at others, overwhelmed with the apparent certainty of his disgraceful existence."
               "But all that has been before, I shut from my view. I think only of the present. Elwood, I must snatch my boy from her embrace."
               "Pardon me, but the proof, that he is your son."
               "This—such as it is. When I was abroad I received a letter which purported to be her dying epistle—and which with passionate, vehemence declared that the boy was mine. With equal earnestness of language it asserted her innocence of any crime. It implored me to acknowledge him—pictured how he was alone in the world without friend or kindred near him—how he was cut off from every affection, every tie of love, every sympathy—and ended by solemnly declaring by her hope in heaven, that he was of my blood. I believed her. I was already hastening to America to assume the guardianship of Miss Dearwood, and I began to dwell hopefully upon the promise of a son's devotion. But ere I departed, a letter, many months behind its date, announced to me his disappearance—his flight from Arden's roof. But I did not doubt but that he could be traced. Arrived, I sent for Arden, who met me in town. The boy had disappeared two years before, seduced away by a stranger who had been hovering about, and who was, no doubt, a member of her family. Nothing had been discovered of his retreat. He was, doubtless, I thought, among her friends in the South, and then there came back upon me my old doubts and suspicions—and in the contemplation, of the new office I was to assume, I began to think of him as I had formerly done. To you I related my story. You know the rest—how you suddenly discovered that a youth in your employ was the very boy I had been in search of—and when I learned this from you, and learned, too, the sad story he had confided to you, I flew to clasp him in my arms. I believed once more her dying protestations—I resolved to bury every doubt, and to take him to my heart as a cherished son. But he had fled. Then came the hopeless search—the torturing remorse at my conduct in thrusting him away, which was augmented at the relation you repeated to me of his long, passionate search for his father. And now see what a strange end it is? Her reported death proves false, and she steps between me and my hope—shuts out the little sun-light that promised to fall upon my path, and robs me of the last bloom in my heart."
               "Her death. Falsely reported. You know the law—falsus uno, falsus omni. Why believe the rest?"
               "I cannot doubt it now if I would. I've staked my happiness upon that hope—my heart feels that he is my son, it matters not whether it can be proved to my reason."
               "Your case, sir. Legally speaking. Is not promising. The law. Unfortunately. Offers no redress. None, whatever, sir."
               "I will drag him from her. She shall not trample, and wound, and stab me for ever."
               He threw open the door, and with his hand pressed hard upon his heart, strode out into the street.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXI.
               INTRIGUE—SUSPICION—A COLLISION.
               THE morning after the play, Blanche found herself exposed at the breakfast-table to a brisk discharge of raillery from the entire Hopewell family. Even Mr. Hopewell threw in a rattling fire, over the top of his newspaper, and Mrs. Hopewell delivered herself of a stately joke, which had been handed down from the last century as a family heir-loom. Blanche bore this good-humored jesting with the best possible grace, although the boundaries of good taste and delicacy were often overstepped.
               After breakfast, when seated with the three sisters in the drawing-room, a systematic and combined attack was made upon her by the whole three. Who was Mr. Moore? Where did he come from? How long had she known him? Was he really her beau? Was his acquaintance very particular? Would she invite him to the ball?
               These, and a hundred other questions, rattled thick and fast around poor Blanche, who, deeply embarrassed, could only stammer out confused responses.
               "I think he is very handsome," said Louisa.
               "Very young," said Alice.
               "A very romantic-looking youth," said Susan.
               "I hope he is rich," said the politic Alice.
               "I do long to see him again," said Susan.
               
               Simultaneous with Susan's exclamation, the hall-bell rang.
               "There he is," exclaimed they all at once, jumping up and bustling about.
               "Now we shall see him."
               "I'll tell you whether he is really handsome, Blanche," said Alice.
               "And agreeable," said Louisa.
               The door was thrown open, and Rodman was ushered in. The Hopewells responded to his formal bow with their stereotyped smile, but Blanche rose up and quietly placed her hand in his, bestowing upon him an earnest look from her full, rounded eyes.
               The three sisters dashed off at once—upon the play—the theatre—the opera—amusements—the last ball—the next ball—the latest fashionable song and dance—in fact, commenced and ran through every subject they thought, cared, or knew about.
               Did not Mr. Moore think Mrs. Kean delightful? So sweet! And wasn't Mrs. A— a superb woman? And what a handsome man Mr. C— was! Which did Mr. Moore like best?—comedy or tragedy? Comedy was their preference—they did so hate to feel melancholy.
               "Ah! I do love the theatre," said Susan. "I could go every night. I feast upon it."
               Did Mr. Moore go much in society? Was he at Mrs. L—'s ball? Did he like the last schottish! Oh, it was lovely! They could dance it for ever. They did so love dancing. They never wanted a party to break up—music always inspired them so they couldn't keep off the floor! In the midst of these brilliant coruscations, Mr. Poppin and Mr. Darlen were announced.
               These gentlemen were for ever together. They might have been compared to substance and shadow, if it had been possible to decide which possessed any claim to the substance. They once were called mental Siamese twins—a great stretch of the imagination. It was positively absurd to use the word mental in connection with any operation that they were capable of. There was this difference between them: Mr. Poppin talked a great deal—Mr. Darlen very little. And yet, after all, the difference even on this point was more apparent than real—for Mr. Poppin's talk, in fact, amounted to nothing.
               The arrival of these gentlemen soon broke up the little party into groups. Mr. Poppin and Louisa sauntered into the adjoining parlor, and Susan seated herself at the piano. Mr. Darlen was dragged off by Alice to the conservatory to examine some new blossoms—aristocratic conservatory plants Mr. Darlen was exceedingly fond of, but your plebeian flowers of the wild-wood, whose nasty dew would soil his immaculate gloves, Mr. Darlen proudly disdained.
               Susan having gone over to join Louisa, Blanche and Rodman now found themselves alone, and enabled to say a few words together. Blanche was sitting on an ottomon by one of the windows, and Rodman walked over and seated himself near her.
               "I am all surprise, dear Blanche," said he, in a low voice, "to find you here. But I do not know your position among your new friends."
               "Mrs. Hopewell is an aunt—my father's sister."
               "But, Blanche, your presence here—the absence of—of your guardian—something strange must have occurred. The privilege, too, that you gave me to visit you—when he—you know what I mean."
               "Strange things have, indeed, occurred, Rodman. Your presence here, I know, is in violation of Mr. Waldron's wishes, but I consented from what I considered good reasons. Rodman, he is no longer my guardian."
               Rodman stared with the greatest astonishment.
               "No longer your guardian, Blanche? I cannot understand."
               "Nor I, Rodman. There has some poignant sorrow lately befallen him—some overwhelming grief—which, acting upon other causes, led him to this step. And do you know, Rodman, he returns to Europe—sails in less than a week."
               "Impossible!"
               "Hush! Do not speak so loud, Rodman. We are not now in the forests of the Clove."
               "You fill me with consternation, Blanche. Abroad! Abroad! How that word shatters every hope? He will never, never own me. But I have been a fool to build trust upon it. I might have known, after what has happened, that it was not possible for any favorable change to come."
               "Rodman," said Blanche, looking into his face with an expression of cheerful hope, "I cannot tell you—not now—some painful events that have occurred since last we met, nor explain to you how those very events are filling me with high hopes for you. Rodman, I do believe, that ere three days have passed, I shall be the means of restoring you to your father."
               He stared at her bewilderingly.
               "Trust me, Rodman, that I would not excite your hopes to prostrate them. I cannot tell you what I know—or how I hope—but Mr. Waldron has promised to confide in me his history—and, Rodman, I am sure, very sure, that you shall yet bear his name."
               "False hope, I fear. You remember my last night at the Clove?"
               "Alas! I do."
               "How he spurned me on account of—"
               "No! no! Rodman. There was another cause. I know it—see it now."
               "Another cause?"
               "Trust in me, dear Rodman. I cannot explain—but if what I believe prove true—"
               "Blanche," interrupted Louisa's voice, from the inner room, "won't you sing for Mr. Poppin?"
               "You are through your tête-à-tête, I see," at the same moment, said Alice, coming forward upon a gentleman's arm, "so let me present to you Mr. Knowlton."
               Rodman leapt upon his feet in the greatest surprise. True enough there was Mr. Knowlton, self-possessed, elegant, and with his highly-polished and fascinating air, bowing profoundly to Blanche, who, quite unconscious of the commotion the stranger's appearance was exciting in Rodman, was returning his salutation in a reserved, but calm, graceful manner.
               "Really, Miss Hopewell," said Knowlton, bowing again to Blanche, "you have transplanted to your city garden a flower of rare loveliness. Pardon me," said he to Blanche, seeing a flush mount her cheek, "if I were guilty of any offence. We cannot always, Miss Dearwood, suppress our admiration."
               "I do not concede that, sir," said Blanche, with a burning cheek, and a firm glance from her eye, as she stood up erect, and looked straight into his face.
               Without being in the least disconcerted at Blanche's rebuff, he turned in his gayest manner towards Rodman.
               "Why, Rod," said he, "I am delighted to find you so fortunate in your friends. Miss Hopewell," addressing Alice, "I hope you know Mr. Moore."
               
               It was now Blanche's turn to be surprised. She looked from Knowlton to Rodman with no little wonder, and she could not help observing that Rodman was in a great state of irritation and vexation. He was scowling darkly at Knowlton, and paying no attention to that gentleman's proffered hand.
               Alice, meanwhile, in a gay, flippant manner was expressing her pleasure at the discovery of acquaintance between the two gentlemen.
               "But really, Mr. Knowlton," said she, "it is more than a year since we have seen you. Where have you been? Oh, you men! The strangest creatures!"
               "I believe you, Miss Hopewell. Miserable monsters! To think of a rational being voluntarily exiling himself from delights like those that flourish in this society!"
               "Now don't, now positively don't, Mr. Knowlton. You know very well that I can't endure compliments."
               "I appreciate, madam, the delicacy that prompts that sentiment."
               "Oh, you incorrigible!"
               At this juncture Susan came up, and more bantering like the preceding ensued, and then they sauntered off, leaving Blanche and Rodman together.
               "Who is that gentleman, Rodman?"
               "Do you not remember Knowlton in my relation of my early life—?"
               "Yes; I do remember."
               "Whether my enemy or my friend I am as much at a loss to determine now as ever. But I am astonished at his appearance here. He never fails, Blanche, by some insidious means, of discovering my resorts, and he is continually appearing at unlooked for moments in unexpected places. I can't make him out."
               "Avoid him, Rodman. I cannot believe that he means you good. He is insincere, I feel assured."
               "But, Blanche, I am compelled to leave you now. Ah! it is not here as it was at the Clove. We have no such interchange of thought."
               "I would be weary of this town life, dear Rodman, but for one hope. Ah! Rodman, Rodman, there may be now so much happiness in store for us."
               "When can I see you again?"
               "You will come to the ball to-morrow night?"
               "Yes, if you desire it."
               "I do; and then we will appoint for the next meeting."
               Rodman looked hurriedly around, and finding they were not observed; he caught her hand, pressed it to his lips, and then hastily withdrew.
               "Is Mr. Moore going?" cried out Alice, as he got to the door.
               Rodman apologised for the necessity that called him away, and then bowed himself out.
               He had not proceeded but a square or two when he heard a step close behind him, and immediately afterwards the hand of Knowlton was laid on his shoulder.
               "Excellent, Rod," exclaimed that gentleman, "excellent— 
                     
                        'Run Orlando, run, carve on every tree—
                        The fair, the chaste, the unexpressive she.'
                     
                   A most exquisite creature, Rod—excellently done, if God did all."
               "You are for ever quoting Shakspeare, Mr. Knowlton," said Rodman in a surly tone.
               "Why not, Rod? Is he not the epitome of all thought? Why should I quote from others when I can always find the same thought better expressed by him? Beshrew me, Rod, but a man need read no one else. There's no phase of life, no shade of character, no matter of philosophy, or passion—no foible, humor or excellence, that he has not punctured with his pen, and showed us its innermost quality."
               "I dare say you are right, but I certainly think that he is unfortunate in the posthumous society of some very bad company."
               "Bravo, Rod. You'll be master of carte and tierce yet, and even now you know how to send in a home thrust. Since I first tumbled into this mad world, I've received a good many sharp cuts, but when you strike, Rod, I'm tempted to cry out, 'Thou, too, Brutus.'"
               "Why did you follow me to the Hopewells to-day? Why do you follow me everywhere? By heaven, Knowlton, I will not stand it."
               "Rod, you'd make an acceptable gladiator. That look now, for fierceness, could not be equalled by the intensest heavy man in any theatre in the country. It was admirable."
               "Mr. Knowlton, I don't know what your object of life may be—"
               "Ha, ha, ha!—my object of life—my destiny—why that of the world's; Rod—that of yours and your lady's, and of all these butterflies that flap their gaudy wings around us—to ripe and ripe, and then to rot and rot. The category is a simple one, and we all fill it."
               "This is an evasion. It is your usual way. You throw off the responsibility of your conduct from yourself upon the world."
               "That's because the world bespatters me with its filth."
               "But in this instance, at least, sir, you cannot shift the responsibility. You have obtained admission into the society of Miss Dearwood—"
               "Your respectable father's ward—"
               Rodman stopped abruptly in the street, and stared his companion full in the face.
               "You have, Knowlton, a marvellous power of worming out everything. But I want you to understand what I am going to say."
               "Put it in the King's English, Rod, and I've no doubt I shall."
               "It is this. I will not permit your interference, in any way, between me and Miss Dearwood. I cannot help but suspect the cause of your visit there to day. I have learned that you do not usually take a step without an object."
               "Right, Rod. I'm too constitutionally lazy for anything without being pricked forward by a motive. I wanted to see a young lady who was in the peculiarly novel situation of having for suitors, at the same time, father and son."
               "What do you mean?"
               "Dear me, Rod, nothing but my good nature would respond to so peremptory a demand. But let me whisper in your ear a bit of family history. Do you think, O! unsophisticated youth, that Waldron took Miss Dearwood to his secluded country-home—shut her out from every semblance of society—devoted himself exclusively to her cultivation—educated her to a sympathy with his tastes—do you suppose that he did all this with any other object than of moulding her young, ignorant heart to his? I haven't the remotest idea who the lady in truth favors, but Gilbert Waldron, old as he is, has been trying to educate for himself a young wife."
               "This is vilely—"
               "Tut, tut, Rod, don't deal in imprecations. Wait and see if it isn't all true. As for the lady, she no doubt loves one of you profoundly—next to her bonnet. Ah! Rod, it is a mad world, mad composition."
               "By heaven, Knowlton—"
               "My dear Rod, if the lady prove true, I will rejoice at it with you. But if not—"
               "You shall not imply a doubt."
               "No? By Jove I've never seen the human thing, including myself, that I could trust. We're all arrant knaves, all; and for this lady—"
               Rodman, with a fierce oath, sprang upon Knowlton, and dashed his fist in his breast. But Knowlton caught him by the arm fiercely, and brought him suddenly around in front of him.
               "Stand back, Knowlton," exclaimed Rodman, "I'll tear—"
               "You'd better tear the devil," was Knowlton's rejoinder.
               It was the first time Rodman had seen him in a passion, and his look was terrific. It was mastered in a moment, however.
               "Pish!" said he, "a beardless boy! You don't know your friends, Rodman. A good day to you until your blood is a little cooler."
               So saying, he turned upon his heel, and walked away.
               Rodman, bewildered and convulsed with passion, rushed off in the opposite direction, but when his excitement cooled, and he recalled all of Knowltons insinuations, he became filled with wonder. Was it possible that it was all true? What fearful horrors appeared to be accumulating upon him? What extraordinary features his peculiar situation was receiving? His father's rival! The thought was monstrous. And if it were so, then Blanche had been deceiving him—then there was a page in the Clove history which he had not been permitted to read. But stop! Knowlton had not intimated, directly, that Blanche knew anything about her guardian's purposes. There was certainly nothing in the facts he mentioned to impeach her truthfulness. Facts? How came Knowlton to be acquainted with all this? What secrets, indeed, had he not probed? Mysterious and inscrutable, who could he be? Perhaps it was all invention! For what object? To sow discord between him and Blanche, perhaps. And yet he spoke with such bold confidence. The more Rodman reflected the more bewildered he grew, until recalling Blanche's hopeful words, he gradually attained a calmer state of feeling.
               Meanwhile, Knowlton, proceeded to Mrs. Carlton's house, and being admitted, was ushered at once into her presence. She was seated in the little cabinet apartment already described, with several discarded volumes at her feet, and her brow pensively resting upon her hand, while her gaze was abstractedly fixed upon the floor. She looked up inquiringly as Knowlton entered, but did not speak.
               "Well, ma chère," said he, "I've seen Rodman's flame, and certainly I must commend the young rogue's taste. She is pretty; of that I had ocular proof, and sensible I profoundly believe, for she received my compliments with a look of disdain. Rod met me there, and, as usual, attributed to me sinister motives—he begins to feel that I turn up in his path too often for any good to himself."
               "He does not express any suspicions?"
               "Pardon me, but he does—and very boldly too. We parted just now in high blood. Now, the fact is, I like Rod a little too well to feel positively comfortable under his suspicions. I would a little rather he shouldn't think me a villain, even if I can't convince myself I'm not one."
               "He will know some day, Robert, that you have been serving me. He will know, too, that our motives have been worthy ones."
               "I'm not so sure of that. Ain't we planning now to throw discord between him and Blanche?"
               "No, Robert, no. I have not wished discord between them. I only hoped that it was a mere fancy of Rodman's which might be obliterated. If their love is sincere, I cannot win him by violently wrenching their hearts apart. I feel that—yet I have striven, and do strive, to wean him from her. If she were not Waldron's ward, I would rather wish, to unite than separate them."
               "She is not his ward. Their connection is annulled. He sails for Europe shortly. I learned all this at the Hopewells."
               "Then we have an easy task before us. We need no longer fear his influence—and for the girl—I am jealous and selfish, and would have Rodman all my own, but if his heart sets that way, his happiness must not be destroyed."
               "I cannot say that I regret the new features of the case. I should have chafed rather at a necessity of separating Rodman and Blanche. The task would have been difficult, for her heart is true, and would not easily be dazzled. Some amiable friends of mine have called me a libertine. It may be so, but certainly I never played with an earnest heart—never toyed with one whose shallow vanity did not rather like the game."
               "That you are a truer and a better man, Robert—"
               "Oh! madam, give me no virtues, for I have more offences at my back than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. I am not sure what I might not do, and I've no doubt I could find it in me to throw a fire-brand in Blanche's heart—to drain every honest thought out of her, and make her like the rest, vain, bold, and giddy, with her virtue a thing of name and appearance only. I have a tongue that can wheedle the devil, and like Crooked Dick, if I wooed I'd win her. She read my few compliments to-day, through and through, but I were a fool and she a paragon, if I could find no point wherein to instil a little flattery—a poison that no blood is proof against, however pure."
               "Robert, I learned a long while ago not to believe all the evil you report of yourself."
               "O! madam, do not think that I believe myself worse than my neighbors. Distil my virtue, and I have no doubt it would balance that of many parsons—but weigh it against a feather, and it would kick the beam. Pish! I never like to talk about myself. There's too much black blood in my veins to bear thinking of complacently. Give me something to do; I shall not weigh its morality nicely, and I'll be content, in forgetting myself and searching and prying among the rusty passages of other people's hearts. Will you go to the ball? I promised the Hopewells to introduce a distinguished Southern lady."
               "Yes, I will go. But I wonder as to the cause that sends Waldron abroad again."
               "Why be curious? Pray heaven that Europe may keep him. Isn't it exactly what you desire?"
               "But you know the cause, Robert?"
               "Only what I suspect. I told you the circumstances that led me to believe Waldron had been educating his ward with the hope of making her his wife—his disappointment in finding she fancied some one else, is probably the cause of his abrupt departure."
               "But I cannot understand how he and Rodman never met."
               "I think they did, and Rodman was not recognized. Such a supposition accounts for Rodman's agitation on the night I met him fleeing so frantically from Clove-house."
               "But your reasons for suspecting Waldron's purpose with his ward. Do you think them plausible?"
               "It was the common gossip among the Clove neighbors—everybody was of that opinion—and now his sudden termination of the relationship certainly looks as if he did have some such motive. At least it is convenient to think so, and that is always aa good enough reason for believing anything."
               "Ah! Robert, will the day never come when I shall attain my hope?"
               "I'm sure I trust so. I'm heartily tired of scheming, and planning, and watching. I did not think that I was so excellent a diplomatist."
               "Robert, you should do something. You have ability, and those peculiar qualities that rule the crowd."
               "But I like mine ease too well. It's more agreeable to sit and watch the tumbling, jostling, fighting, tearing world, than to scramble and roll in the dust one's self."
               "You could attain political success, I'm sure of it."
               "I dare say I could—and would if it were only gentlemanly."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXII.
               THE BALL.
               THE evening of the ball had arrived, and the rooms of the Hopewell mansion blazed with light. A suite of three rooms was thrown open, and the third room communicated with a conservatory of moderate dimensions, which upon this occasion was illuminated by a few colored lamps. The rooms were rich in upholstery and decoration, and sumptuously furnished. The ceiling was tinted a delicate blue, and the walls were covered with a rich Parisian paper, that served to prevent any effect of vacancy, which the want of pictures might otherwise have produced. The third room was in crimson, and as seen, looking down the vista of the other rooms in their lighter tints, was novel, and not unpleasing in effect. And the farther back ground, with its dark hues of foliage, and gleams of colored light shooting athwart it, served also to enhance the beauty of the picture, and give it contrast and vividness.
               At an early hour in the evening Blanche descended to the drawing-room, with the hope of meeting either Mr. Waldron or Rodman before the assemblage of the guests. She found no one there but Amelia, who had with some difficulty been persuaded to appear during the evening. This lady no sooner saw Blanche than she came up to her and kissed her brow.
               
               "Ah! Blanche, you are looking beautiful," said she, surveying her with an admiring gaze.
               Blanche was dressed simply in white, with loose and flowing sleeves, looped up so as to display her beautifully-rounded arm, while at the neck the muslin was parted just sufficiently low to afford a glimpse of her bosom, white and dazzling. Blanche's form at this period was just assuming the rounded fullness of womanhood, and was at that stage of budding development so highly fascinating. Her bust was delicately outlined, and vibrative to each passing emotion.
               To complete our mention of her toilet, we must add, that her hair was gathered together and looped behind, allowing a clustering mass of curls to fall upon her shoulders. The only ornaments that she wore were a diamond upon her finger, and a white rose-bud in her hair. Her neck, exquisitely beautiful in shape, was not broken in its classic outline by either chain or ribbon.
               But what rendered Blanche's simplicity of toilet an advantage rather than otherwise, was the more than usual brilliancy of her beauty. Her face was suffused with a delicate glow, and her eyes were beaming with lustrous eloquence. The excitement of anticipated pleasure was giving a heightened bloom to her cheek, and the fullness of her heart in its joyful presage of happiness—in its fond hope of dawning peace to all her friends—was lighting up her eye with rich beams of gladness.
               "You look not only beautiful, but happy," said Amelia, looking into her blooming face.
               "I am happy, Amelia, yet I cannot tell you why. I am full of hope, for to-morrow may prove a blessing to us all. But have you seen Mr. Waldron?"
               "No," was the reply, "he has not come."
               Alice and her sisters now entered, and almost simultaneously the hall-door was thrown open for the entrance of the first comers.
               "You look charming, Blanche," cried out Alice.
               "Lovely!" "Beautiful!" repeated the other sisters, running up their scale of exclamations as usual.
               "White does become you so, Blanche," said Alice. "Such conquests as you will make."
               "Conquests! Of course she will, and Mr. Moore will be jealous—and then perhaps there will be a duel—and I shouldn't wonder if we couldn't get up quite a romance. Mr. Moore, too, is so romantic-looking."
               "You shan't torment, Blanche, so," exclaims Susan, seizing her arm; "come, Blanche, let's take a survey of the rooms. Ain't they beautiful? Do you know that this is my taste? There comes mama—doesn't she enter like a queen? I wish that I had mama's air. I think it splendid—don't you?"
               "It's very noble; I quite agree with you."
               "Knowlton calls it quite Siddonian. I should so love to be called Siddonian!"
               "Ah! Blanche," said Mrs. Hopewell, coming up to her, "you must allow me to congratulate you on your toilet. You look fairly pastoral by the side of my girls."
               The Misses Hopewell were certainly as ornate as Blanche was simple, but out of the abundance of their good nature they could feel an admiration for Blanche's taste, even while they adhered to their own. Nor was it Blanche's taste either that they admired so much, as it was that they liked Blanche herself, and their partiality being unaccompanied with judgment, they would probably have cried out "Beautiful," if she had appeared in a turban, and with colors as various as the rainbow.
               
               The arrivals now were frequent, and the rooms began to fill. Blanche felt herself embarrassed at the rapidly increasing number of gay and dazzling groups that passed into the rooms. Unused to scenes of so much display and brilliancy, dazzled by the glittering array of splendid toilets, she shrunk back from the thousand glances, and the admiring compliments that were showered upon her. Standing by Mrs. Hopewell's side, the arrivals were duly presented, and Blanche, innocent as she was, could not help observing the admiration her appearance excited. Everybody knew that the ball was given by Mrs. Hopewell in honor of her niece, and everybody seeing at a glance that Mrs. Hopewell's niece was very lovely, and everybody hearing vague rumors about Mrs. Hopewell's niece being an heiress, why of course everybody was very profuse in their attentions, and very profound in their homage. Then came the struggle who should have her hand in the first dance, and the envy with which the victor was watched as he led her out upon the floor; then there was the surrounding crowd, who hovered about her steps, when she was not dancing, eager for a smile or a word, then the painful necessity of declining importunities to dance which were more numerous than a dozen evenings would have the capacity to satisfy—the unceasing formal presentations, for there seemed to be no end to those who desired an introduction to Mrs. Hopewell's lovely niece—and, added to all this, the compulsion of listening and responding to compliments that were not always in good taste, and which sometimes would send the blood mounting in a scarlet glow to her cheek.
               In this giddy whirl and excitement she had not seen either Mr. Waldron or Rodman, and scarcely had an opportunity to look for them. But as the evening advanced, and her friends grew less persecuting in their attentions, she began to watch for them, and at last she thought she caught a glimpse of Mr. Waldron passing into the conservatory. She followed with a quick step, and had scarcely entered when she heard her name uttered. She turned quickly, and saw Mr. Waldron standing in the shadow of an orange-tree. She ran up to him at once, and offered her hand. When he took it his own was slightly trembling, and he held it for some moments in agitated silence. Even in his shadowy retreat Blanche could perceive that his face was very pale, and expressive of suffering.
               "Oh, Blanche," said he, "you are looking so very beautiful to-night."
               He held her hand in his, and smoothed it tenderly, and with ill-concealed agitation put the curls back from her brow, and looked wistfully into her face.
               "Beautiful! beautiful!" was his trembling and secret heart-utterance. "Why could not my heart have experienced this joy! Alas! the glorious images that I erect and worship, that stern iconoclast—my destiny—pulls down and destroys. Oh, Blanche, Blanche! my dream was ravishing, and it floats about me still."
               He leaned back against a pillar for support, and trembled visibly. Blanche, observing his agitation, with an intuitive perception of the cause, hastened, by the assumption of a vivacious manner, to change the current of his thoughts.
               "Mr. Waldron," said she, looking playfully into his face, "You have promised me your history, and I want to ask you if you will come to-morrow and relate it. And after you have told it to me, sir, I shall want to make a confidant of you. I think that I have got something to tell you that will surprise—perhaps delight you. Will you come to-morrow?"
               "Yes, Blanche."
               
               "Will you come early?"
               "You'll be fatigued, and cannot see me early."
               "Oh! no, sir. I, am too much used to exertion."
               "Thanks to your mountain exercises, Blanche. You have much more bloom than before you went to the Clove. You have grown far more beautiful."
               "Ah! sir, not flattery from you."
               "Blanche, Blanche Dearwood," from within.
               "There, I'm called. Will you come to-morrow—and early? Do not disappoint me!"
               "I promise you."
               "Why, Blanche," broke in Alice, who had caught a glimpse of her through the shrubbery, and came running up to her, "Mr. Poppin says that you are engaged to him for the quadrille. Ah! Mr. Waldron," bowing to him, then turning to Blanche again, "there's the music—and Poppin is frantically hunting for you."
               "I wish Mr. Poppin hadn't so good a memory," said Blanche, half poutingly, as they emerged from the conservatory.
               "Mr. Poppin will be anything you command," said that gentleman stepping up, having overheard the remark.
               "Impossible," cried out Susan, who was passing; and then whispering in Blanche's ear, concluded the sentence. "Nothing could change him from a donkey to a man."
               Mr. Poppin seemed to suspect that he was a victim in some way to Susan's sarcasm, and looked very uncomfortable. He had taken his stand with Blanche in the quadrille, and the sudden striking up of the music afforded him, in the mazes of the dance, a retreat from Susan's shafts. But when the figure was finished, and they came back to their places, they found Susan standing near, and Blanche, for the first time, observed that she was leaning upon the arm of Knowlton. As their eyes met, Knowlton bowed profoundly, and then immediately solicited her hand in a dance. She was about framing an excuse, when Susan hastened to accept for her. Although not a little annoyed and disconcerted, as, for some reason not quite clear to her own mind, she shrunk from Knowlton, yet she felt herself obliged to accede to his request when supported by the voice of Susan.
               They had not, however, been together long, when she could not help acknowledging that he was an exceedingly agreeable and fascinating man. He did not venture upon any of those impertinent compliments, which in their first brief interview had so displeased her; his whole manner to her had an air of great sincerity, and all the while he was paying her one of the most acceptable compliments that can be offered—a silent, but profound respect and admiration, which showed themselves in the tone of his voice, and in deference and earnestness of manner. His air was so polished, his style so finished, his language so vivacious and almost spiritual, and his thoughts so comprehensive and genial, that Blanche could not help experiencing a very lively and sincere pleasure in his society. Knowlton, indeed, was exerting himself to please—and there were but few human hearts whose stops he could not sound.
               He praised Rodman, too. He took the trouble to say a great many pleasant things about him, all of which made Blanche's heart expand and leap with happiness.
               When the dance was ended, Blanche very readily yielded to his request to promenade with her, and they walked up and down the length of the rooms, she leaning upon his arm, and evidently falling under the charm of his genial and agreeable manner.
               At last they paused, near where a somewhat tall, and melancholy-looking lady was standing, with one arm upon the mantel. She was dressed with rich but severe simplicity, A delicately-tinted silk dress that fitted her form to perfection, and which fell, either by the grace of the wearer, or by the skill of its manufacture, into full and sweeping folds, appeared to solely constitute her toilet. She wore no ornament, her hair was brushed back smooth and straight, but the light fell upon it in a wavy lustre, and gave it a peculiarly rich effect. The perfect simplicity of her dress, and the perfect repose of her manner, were striking. But upon her brow there seemed to rest not the calmness of peace, but of strength; not the repose, but the mastery of emotion. She stood in the position she had chosen, motionless and calm, her Grecian head turned towards the assemblage, but immovable, and her form, draperied with artistic effect, rigid as any statue. But those who took a second glance, and felt but for a brief instant the glance that shot from her dark, burning, cavernous eyes, would start and look again with wonder, and almost awe.
               "Permit me, Miss Dearwood," said Knowlton, "to make you acquainted with Mrs. Carlton. Rodman, I dare say, has spoken to you of her."
               Blanche was quite surprised to find that this distinguished-looking lady was Mrs. Carlton. She looked at her with a great deal of interest, in which were mingled feelings of admiration for her noble beauty, and gratitude for the warm friendship she had evinced for Rodman.
               Mrs. Carlton bent her dark eye upon Blanche scrutinizingly, and said:
               "I am glad to meet you, Blanche. Pardon me for addressing you so familiarly, but my young friend, Rodman has spoken so often of you, that—"
               "Do not apologise, Mrs. Carlton; I was very glad to hear you call me Blanche. It is a proof that I, too, as well as Rodman, may be your friend. But I have not seen Rodman during the whole evening. He is present I hope."
               "I can vouch for that, Miss Dearwood," said Knowlton, "for I have seen him a dozen times—retired into corners, and absorbed in admiring contemplation of the Evening Star."
               He bowed to Blanche with graceful deference.
               "I saw him not five minutes since," said Mrs. Carlton.
               "By-the-by," said Knowlton as the music struck up, "I believe that I am pledged to a polka with Miss Hopewell. Miss Dearwood; I am unfortunate enough to have the reputation of saying very few sincere things. I wish most earnestly that you would put confidence in me, for I want to tell you before I withdraw, how much I admire you."
               A flush mounted Blanche's cheek, but Knowlton's manner was so earnest, that she could not help feeling he was speaking from the heart, and she acknowledged his compliment with a rewarding smile.
               When Knowlton had withdrawn, Mrs. Carlton entered at once into conversation with Blanche, and she soon felt herself compelled to admit the superior charms of our heroine. Her person pleased her, the sweet melodiousness of her voice fell pleasantly upon her heart; the confiding earnestness of her manner, the grace of her movements, the purity and repose of her language, which was vivacious without being affected, and light without being flippant, were all qualities that pleased her fastidious taste.
               They had conversed together for about five minutes, during which Mrs. Carlton succeeded in introducing several subjects, for the purpose of sounding the depth of Blanche's understanding, when Rodman stepped up, and bowed to them.
               
               "I hope," said he, "that I have Miss Dearwood's pardon for not earlier paying my respects to her."
               "It was hardly kind, Rodman, not to come near me."
               "You were surrounded by such a host of admirers, that I did not think you would miss one, who, if not so clamorous in his homage, was not less sincere."
               "Let me implore you, Rodman, not to fall into the common style. You know we have always talked straightforward English to each other."
               "Will you dance with me? That is straightforward, I hope."
               "Yes. Mrs. Carlton will excuse us, I trust," looking up with a smiling vivacity.
               Mrs. Carlton bowed a consent, and if Blanche had observed more closely, at that moment, she would have seen a fleeting shadow of pain cross her brow, and a quick spasm in her throat, as if experiencing a choking sensation.
               "Ah! Blanche," said Rodman, as they walked off together, "I have watched my father the whole evening. How pale he is. He looks as if he were a great sufferer."
               "He is, Rodman."
               "My heart yearns to him. Oh! I am sure that if he would open his arms to me, my love would compensate him for all the shame I would cause him. Look, Blanche, there he stands, so sad, so very sad."
               Blanche looked in the direction Rodman indicated, and her eyes embraced in one glance a picture that startled her, and which set her heart beating violently.
               Mr. Waldron was standing upright and motionless, with his face pallidly white, and eyes fixed in a kind of vacant stare upon—Mrs. Carlton. And in the same position in which she had first seen her was Mrs. Carlton, with her face turned with its fixed immobility towards Mr. Waldron. Blanche only saw these two faces amid the hundred others that flitted before her sight. They seemed to stand out from the living scene with startling distinctiveness. Her position only commanded a partial view of Mrs. Carlton's features, but while she stood looking at them, with a face scarcely paler than theirs, for some reason Mrs. Carlton suddenly turned her head, bringing her full face directly before Blanche's eyes. As she did so Blanche uttered a suppressed cry, and turned rapidly to look at Rodman, and then as quickly again to 
                     obesrve
                     observe
                   Mrs. Carlton. With inexpressible agitation her eye now wandered from face to face, from Rodman's to Mrs. Carlton's, and to Mr. Waldron's—and then abruptly clasping Rodman's arm, she turned, and hurried away with bewildered and staggering steps. A light seemed suddenly to have burst upon her brain—a revelation to have been unfolded to her heart.
               "Why, Blanche," exclaimed Rodman, surprised at the strangeness of her conduct, "are you ill? What is the matter?"
               "I cannot dance, Rodman—excuse me, indeed I cannot. My brain is in a whirl."
               "But tell me, dear Blanche, what so agitates you?"
               "I cannot, Rodman—not now. Forgive me—do not think that I mean to offend you—but leave me, dear Rodman, I will be better presently."
               "Leave you? Blanche that is not kind. Rather come, and walk with me in the conservatory. There is a cool draught of air there, that will revive you. Come."
               She complied, and when they had reached its seclusion, she leaned upon Rodman's shoulder in extreme agitation.
               "Why will you not tell me, Blanche, what concerns you so?"
               
               "To-morrow—not now—to-morrow. I cannot understand—I cannot think—nor feel now. Bring me water, Rodman. I am faint."
               Rodman flew to obey her behest. When he was gone Blanche convulsively clasped her hands to her face, and murmured:
               "Almighty Father, if it indeed be true, teach me how to forgive him. If he possessed the wickedness to have sought for one love ere he was freed from another, in whom can I trust? And Rodman—his father—his mother—strange—I cannot understand—"
               The return of Rodman, panting with haste, interrupted the expression of her chaotic feelings and thoughts—and as he stood by her side bathing her brow, and striving to animate her with lively talk, her emotion gradually grew more calm.
               Meanwhile Mr. Waldron, abruptly starting from his position of paralized volition, had turned hastily away from the object on which he had been gazing, and was endeavoring to escape from a presence which, by his manner, seemed to have plunged him into the greatest agitation. With an almost blind impetuosity he was hurrying away, when Alice Hopewell ran up directly in his path, and accosted him.
               "I declare, Mr. Waldron," exclaimed she, "how grave you look! and I haven't seen you dance once this evening!"
               "I rarely dance, Miss Hopewell," replied Mr. Waldron, with a painful attempt at a smile.
               '"Dear me! Is it possible? But don't you think Blanche looks beautiful to-night? Everybody thinks so. I have heard a hundred compliments—perhaps more—and I'm trying to remember the best of them to tell Blanche by-and-by. I am so glad that we brought her out. It would have been a shame to have kept her up there forever at that horridly-dull Clove—what a queer name? Would you like to dance with me? I am disengaged the third set from this. But, dear me—do you know, Mr. Knowlton? Such a genius! There is a very distinguished Southern lady with him. Wouldn't you like an introduction? I'm sure you would. She would dance with you the next set I dare say, for I don't believe she's engaged. I'll introduce you. Come. There she is standing by the mantel. I call her handsome. Don't you?"
               Rattling away at this rapid rate, Alice drew Mr. Waldron in the direction of Mrs. Carlton.
               "Miss Hopewell, I implore you," exclaimed he with considerable consternation, as he suddenly discovered to whom Alice was proposing to introduce him, and endeavoring to disengage his arm, "I cannot—I prefer not—"
               "Oh! yes; but I want you to know her. Very distinguished—you'll be delighted. Mrs. Carlton," calling out at some distance, "won't you dance? I've brought you a partner. Mrs. Carlton, Mr. Waldron—our Blanche's guardian!"
               And before Mr. Waldron could recover from the confusion in which the proposal of Alice had thrown him, he found himself standing before Mrs. Carlton, and bowing to her with bewildered distraction. Mrs. Carlton had stepped a step or two forward, and stood with dilated nostril, and almost suspended breath, looking with her burning eyes into the face of Waldron.
               Alice, who did not observe the consternation she had caused in both lady and gentleman, rattled away the same as ever.
               "Well, I declare," said she, "if it isn't supper-time, and half the company have marched off already. Dear me, I'm engaged to go with Mr. Poppin. Mrs. Carlton, you have no gentleman—Mr. Waldron will you escort Mrs. Carlton—and excuse me? There's Mr. Poppin now—I wonder who's taken Blanche down. Mr. Poppin, your arm if you please. Mr. Waldron will you come—there goes Blanche now, and I want to speak a word to her," and so hurrying Mr. Poppin along, and tossing a parting nod over her shoulder, she left them standing together. Waldron started, and nervously pressed his hand to his heart as he found himself standing before the flushed face, and deep, passionate glance of Mrs. Carlton.
               "Madam! madam!" said he in hurried and broken utterance, "this painful accident—I know not how it happened."
               "Gilbert."
               "Yet, madam, I've desired—I must see you—once again."
               He turned away, as if to suddenly escape, but a hand was laid upon his shoulder, and Knowlton stepped directly before him—confronting him with a look of strange sternness, and something like a fierce glow in his eye.
               "Who are you?" said Waldron, drawing his hand across his brow, with a vague look, as if endeavoring to recollect him.
               "You do not remember me. It is quite likely. I was a boy when we should have met. Afterwards you were abroad, and I could not reach you. When you returned, my blood had lost a little of its heat—had grown politic, and cunning, and subtle, smacking of the world's hollowness and falsehood, and scornful of either good or evil. It was policy to avoid you, and I was a man of the world, and did so. But this meeting here, somehow, has stirred up what little honest blood I have."
               "Who are you? I do not know you."
               The guests had passed out into the supper-room, leaving only these three together. Mrs. Carlton, alarmed and trembling, had sunk into a chair, while Knowlton with his indolent air and gay manner entirely gone, stood with a fiery eye and sneering lip, looking into the face of Mr. Waldron.
               "Stand aside, sir, and let me pass," said Waldron, with a strong effort, assuming his usual collected and composed manner. "I do not know you, and this molestation is unaccountable."
               "Perhaps it is. I'm no very nice reasoner in these matters. I have a way of acting as I please, whether right or wrong."
               "What do you wish with me?"
               "Humph! I hardly know. Justice is impossible, and revenge troublesome."
               "If you decline acquainting me with your name or business, I command you not to molest me."
               "It is not possible that you do not know me?"
               "I see no reason why I should."
               "Ah?"
               "No, sir."
               Waldron stepped aside as if to pass on, but Knowlton quickly caught his arm.
               "But there is a reason."
               "Withdraw your hand, sir."
               "Pish! there, you are free. But we must meet again—must, Gilbert Waldron."
               "You know me. You are more fortunate than I am."
               "HER BROTHER! You know me now."
               Waldron fell back, and looked at him for a moment with a vacant stare, and then abruptly turning upon his heel rushed from the room. But no sooner was he alone than he beat at his brow, and clasped his hands, and walked up and down with a wildly irregular step. He was in the toilet-room, which was vacated, but some approaching voices threatening an invasion of its privacy, he seized his hat and cloak, and hurried from the house. The night air felt refreshing to his hot brow, and as he walked on with rapid steps, his turbulent feelings gradually subsided.
               A carriage was summoned immediately after Waldron's abrupt escape from the drawing-room, and Mrs. Carlton and Knowlton, without waiting to exchange a parting word with their host, hastily left the house. Mrs. Carlton, indeed, was in a nervous state of excitement that precluded her from seeing any one, and her departure was accomplished as secretly as possible.
               After the return from the supper-room, Blanche kept furtively watching for Waldron and Mrs. Carlton, and with an indescribable nervous dread learned that they had withdrawn. She longed now for the conclusion of the entertainment, and even to Rodman was unable to give the attention he demanded. And at last, when the guests had departed, when the last carriage had driven off, and she was enabled to escape from the many congratulations of her friends at her triumphs of the evening, she sought her own apartment, and there gave way to her turbulent feelings. If the supposed discovery that she had made revealed any part of the mystery that surrounded her guardian—and busy speculation, could easily, on the basis of the single fact she had caught a glimpse of, imagine much of what his history was—then what extenuation, what circumstances could erase from his heart, the stain of a premeditated crime? In a single glance she had grasped what seemed to be a vast truth—a resemblance between Rodman and Mrs. Carlton, and a repellant antagonism between the mother and father. It was a discovery, too, fraught with many speculations, and many anxious fears of the future; and so, hour after hour, Blanche, with throbbing brain and beating heart, brooded and thought, until at last exhaustion overcame her, and she sought her pillow.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXIII.
               A REVELATION.
               THE reader has probably observed an apparent change in the manner of Mr. Waldron, since his first introduction at the Clove, the gradations of which have not been noted by the author. It may appear as if the wise, calm, philosophical guardian of Blanche, with his high cultivation, his genial grace, and his gentle melancholy, was inconsistent with the passion-tossed heart which the progress of the story has developed But if the true characteristics of Mr. Waldron will be borne in mind, every apparent inconsistency in his character will disappear, or it will prove to be the inconsistency of human nature—the weakness that underlies the strongest natures, the fallibility that exists in the finest judgments, and which opens the purest hearts to the sway of passion.
               Mr. Waldron was a man of a highly impressible temperament—keenly susceptible to every emotion, to every passion, to every beauty—the strong excess of his early youth tamed and strewn with "repentant ashes,"—his mind stored with rare acquirements, his fancy vivid and creative, a philosophy born of sorrow and suffering, breathing from his being, and giving to his imagination geniality, and to his passions repose—a man, in brief, who was emotional and ideal, therefore full of love; passionate and ideal, therefore abounding in fancy, and geniality; in repose, vibrating with gentleness and peacefulness to every touch; in storm, turbulent and convulsed. He seems to present a picture of cultivated gentleness on the one hand, and vehement passion on the other. He was a man whose animal and intellectual—whose worldly and spiritual being, were each highly developed. Hence we see him wise, gentle, true, just—and grow from these to be 
                     irrascible
                     irascible
                  , severe, jealous, and full of hate.
               But, at the present period of our story, another change was manifested in Mr. Waldron. His repose and quiet grace of manner that formerly were so marked, seemed to have entirely disappeared, and were succeeded by a shrinking nervousness and agitation that were peculiar. His form was not so erect as it was, his face was much thinner and paler, his chest had grown somewhat hollowed, and his hands were continually wandering with a nervous trembling to his heart. It appeared as if all the old griefs that had overwhelmed him in his youth, were rushing back upon his heart again, and prostrating him to the earth. Nor was he bearing up against them with any show of courage or fortitude. His heart shrunk and trembled, and bowed itself to the dust beneath their weight.
               But the one desire that now possessed him—the one frantic hope—the passionate yearning of his torn heart to clasp his son to his arms—to pour out upon him the concentrated power of his pent up affections—filled him with desperate purposes, with mingled despair, hope, and anguish.
               The position in which he stood in this matter was inexpressibly painful. Regrets filled his moments of fondest hope, and remorse added poignancy to his hours of despondency. He could not help but remember that he had himself thrust away his son—had excluded him from his heart —had afforded to others the opportunity of which they had availed themselves, of weaning his boy from him—of sundering the ties between them. And to think that now, when he would clasp him to his heart with eager fervor, another claimed him—another had wound her heart—tendrils around his—and if he should demand him, would silence him with the reply, "when you forsook him I did not; when you discarded, branded, disgraced him, I nurtured, loved, and cherished him!"
               He had all along dreaded meeting Mrs. Carlton, and sought to accomplish his purpose by attorney. To Mr. Elwood's applications for an interview Mrs. Carlton, however, had responded by referring him to her attorney, Mr. Oswald. The interviews between these gentlemen were consumed in legal quibbles, and side issues, and as they only established one thing, namely: that Mrs. Carlton would cling to her son to the last gasp of her heart, the conviction had been growing upon Mr. Waldron's mind that his only hope was a direct appeal to his son himself. This belief took the form of a resolve, as he hastened along the streets on the night of the ball, after his brief encounter with Mrs. Carlton and her brother. Stung by Knowlton's words, maddened by the recollection of the wrongs he believed himself to have suffered, his stronger passions came swelling up in his bosom—rage succeeded sorrow, determination despondency. He started up the strong man, with all his material forces at command—a man seeking to conquer by the power of vehement purpose and strong will—casting off his finer and more subtle emotions, and rising up in the simple majesty of resolution and will.
               As this change in his feelings became more decided, he began to pant for action. He would indulge in no more dreaming—no more sorrow that fed itself upon a delicate susceptibility to impressions—no more philosophy, which by its keenness gave edge to remorse—no more indulgence in a fine imagination which only gave poignancy to his emotions! Henceforth the obdurate, blunt, man of action!
               As this mood grew upon him—and we trust the reader appreciates how a man like Mr. Waldron was open to such fitful changes of temper—his purposes grew fixed, and his conduct determined upon. He resolved on the very morrow to meet Mrs. Carlton—to force himself into her presence if he were denied—and to demand by virtue of his early wrongs a restoration of his unknown son.
               He reached his chambers full of this resolve. As he was pacing his room brooding upon his purpose, he remembered that he had made a promise with Blanche for the morning—and with the remembrance came the feeling of the difficulty and embarassment he would experience in personally relating a story like that of his. He saw how much it would save both Blanche and himself if it were written instead of narrated—and acting at once upon this impression, he seated himself at his desk, and, addressing it to Blanche, commenced his history.
               The minute recording of all the circumstances connected with the events of his youth, heightened the mood in which his mind was cast, and nerved him to the execution of his purpose. As all his seeing wrongs came one by one before his mind—all that he had undergone in the one epoch of his life, which ever loomed up behind with all its terrible features—as they all came up to him there in the midnight stillness of his room, with a vividness and distinctness that was absolutely startling, his brow grew dark, and his eye fiery in their passionate remembrance.
               The night was nearly spent before he laid down his pen. Flinging himself upon his pillow he obtained a few hours' sleep, and awoke to see the sun streaming into his window.
               He had scarcely completed his toilet, when Elwood's name was brought up, and in a moment afterwards the gentleman himself followed it.
               "Fine day, sir," exclaimed he, as he entered; "sweet air. Salubrious. Fresh."
               "You've something to tell me, Elwood, or you would not be here."
               "True sir. But not important. Saw Oswald yesterday. Nothing out of him. But what do you think the boy is in his office—"
               "Ah! what?"
               "Completing his studies, sir. Unfortunate auspices. No profundity. No comprehensiveness."
               "A student in Oswald's office?"
               "Strange, sir. But true."
               "Elwood, I burn with impatience to see him. I long—Oh, how deeply!—to look upon him, even if he should know me not. And yet, how could I contain myself? Find a way to bring us together, Elwood, or at least afford me an opportunity of gazing, upon my long, long lost son. Oh! it is madness to reflect that he is too probably lost to me for ever—and yet, if he were within arm's reach—if I could but see him once—if he could hear my heart's appeal—"
               "Your pardon, sir. The lady has tried appeals. No doubt she has his ear. Tears. Pathos. Wrongs. You know their effect with a fine woman."
               "She shall not come between me and this hope. He loved me ever. His story to you is witness of that. Oh, Father in Heaven! what fatality was it that held us asunder, when we might have been so united?"
               "The lady's cunning, sir. Wonderful."
               "I will confront and overpower her."
               "I will see her to-day, Elwood—this very morning."
               "Unwise, unwise, sir."
               "What you harp on incessantly, Elwood. I will not listen to you longer. I will fling every thing upon one throw."
               "Mr. Waldron, I beseech you."
               "Have done, Elwood. I am resolved."
               He strode towards the door.
               "I'm your attorney, sir. Your adviser."
               "I will hear nothing—heed nothing. I will see her."
               He flung open the door, and, regardless of the urgent solicitations of Elwood, descended the stairway, and emerged into the street. Elwood was close at his elbow. A hack was standing before the hotel, and Mr. Waldron called to it, entered, and directed the hackman where to drive. The man sprang upon his box, and in an instant, the carriage rolled off, leaving Mr. Elwood standing upon the sidewalk, looking after it, with his little red face puffing over. the rim of his black stock and his wiry neck vibrating with exceeding activity.
               It was about ten o'clock in the morning, and Mrs. Carlton, was seated in her little cabinet, with her cheek upon her hand, and an open book before her, upon which her eyes, were fixed, but not their sense. She saw the printed page, but her wandering thoughts could not be concentrated upon it. They were afar off, travelling through many scenes, and dwelling upon events of past occurrence.
               She was so rapt, that she did not hear a carriage dash up to the house, nor a loud ring, nor the fall of a stranger's footstep. The servant that brought the intelligence of a visitor, spoke twice before she heard him; and then, half mechanically, she arose to answer the summons.
               
               The drawing-room was dimly lit, and as she entered, she only saw the dark figure of a stranger. She stood for an instant, looking at the visitor, as if expecting to be addressed. As he remained silent, she was on the point of speaking herself, when he suddenly rose up, and came a step or two forward, bringing his person and features fully into the light.
               "Gilbert!"
               She staggered back as the exclamation escaped her, and leaned for support upon a chair.
               "Madam," said Mr. Waldron, in a low but slightly trembling voice, "I have been induced to break a vow I once made to myself—a vow never to see you again."
               "It would have been better for my happiness, Gilbert, if you had kept it. I feel but too sensibly the motive that brings you here," replied Mrs. Carlton, in a low, but agitated voice.
               "You recognise my rights, then, and are ready to allow them."
               "No, Gilbert, no—I am only conscious of my own. How strongly you may believe in yours, or how they may be supported by authority or the world, I do not know."
               "Madam, your heart tells you that, wronged and betrayed as I have been, the world will support me."
               "Gilbert, Gilbert, you come to rob me of my son. I have felt that it would be so—this is only the consummation of that against which I have hoped and prayed."
               "I come to demand of you his restoration to me. I come to clasp my long-lost son."
               "You abandoned him—cast him off—thrust him from you. You refused him your heart—stigmatized him with a dishonorable name—compelled him to a life that was barren of affection and full of lonely wretchedness—you did all this, whilst I found him, nurtured him, watched over him! Whose right is the strongest, Gilbert? Is not mine?"
               "I came not here to argue with you, madam. You now very well that you yourself was the cause of all that he was compelled to suffer. You stabbed at my peace—you wronged me with a wrong that no expiation can undo. If in that terrible hour I doubted that he was mine—if then I shrunk from him, believing him to be the offspring of crime—was the fault mine? And because I suspected then—because I was torn and tossed between alternating feelings of yearning and abhorrence—at one time shrinking from him with the belief that his birth was stained—at another, longing to clasp him to my heart as the only solace of life—because I experienced this conflict, it does not follow now that I can have no claim in his affection, no right to his heart!"
               "Will the hour never come when you will do me justice, Gilbert? You speak of wrongs! Oh, mine have been beyond belief!"
               "You plead innocence, of course. But do I not know—"
               "Nothing. Upon my soul, nothing. You proceeded upon most insufficient reasons. Your evidence, Gilbert, should not have blinded a child. But I will not stand here to plead my cause. You know that since the all-passionate, appeal I made to your justice and mercy, on that fearful day, that I have not opened my lips to you, except to plead for my child."
               "Which you garnished, madam, with a little romance. You reported yourself upon your death-bed."
               "I thought I was. I believed my last hour had come. That letter I signed, as I supposed, upon the utmost verge of the grave. I was saved—but if it were not for his sake, I would wish that it had not been. My wrongs—"
               
               "Do not speak of wrongs, madam. Look what my life has been. Oh! Margaret, there never was devotion like that of mine. I knelt to you, poured out at your feet the wild worship of an enthusiastic boy—every sense bowed to you, every thought was centered in you. You turned from the fullness of my devotion, trampled upon the heart that looked up to you, betrayed me in my hour of blind and passionate fondness. Your pledges of faithfulness were yet warm upon your lips—your marriage vows had scarcely ceased to echo in my ears—when the awakening came. Oh, that hour! The misery, the despair, the unutterable anguish that followed! But I have not come to upbraid—I have not come here to recall the past. My son, Margaret, my son! I have not seen him since he was a child. I would not know him if I found him in the street. But my heart yearns for him—my only hope of happiness is in him. I am alone, Margaret, keep him not from me!"
               "And am not I, too, alone? Have you not planted a stigma upon me, by which I dare not appear under my rightful name? Am I not compelled to deceive even him? I love him, oh, how well! but have not dared to call him son, for fear he would turn from me!"
               "He does not know you?"
               She started with a quick fear. It was an unfortunate confession, and she saw how near she was losing all.
               "He loves me, Gilbert, I have only to speak the word, mother, and he would fling himself upon my heart."
               "'Tis, vain, madam, vain. He must be mine. He has loved his father always secretly—for I know his story—and he will cling to me, madam. He is mine. He is mine. No power shall keep him from me!"
               During all this interview Mrs. Carlton had been the pleading, not the proud woman—the heart breathing anguish, not fiance. Her usual cold reserve was not observable, but with a flushed cheek, clasped hands, and heaving bosom her words had been uttered with trembling fervor, and simple earnestness. But now she rose up with proud stateliness, and her deep eye burned with the concentration of her purpose.
               "I have wound my heart's tendrils around him," said she speaking slowly, but with a fixed and emphatic earnestness, more effective than any vehement passion could have been, "and I tell you, Gilbert Waldron, that I will not lose my hold with life."
               "I am his father—"
               "What if I should say you are not."
               "I'd not believe you. It would be a trick."
               "You thought so once. Think so again. Call me what name you will, but do not come between me and my son."
               "He does not call himself your son. He longs for his father's recognition. You know it, woman, and have instilled doubt in him, have taught him evil, wrong, crime of me. But I will see him. I will hold out my arms to him. He shall choose between us."
               He walked the floor with swelling veins and trembling limbs.
               "If I were to kneel to you," exclaimed Mrs. Carlton, rushing before him, with a bewildered despair, but suddenly she drew up, erect and proud again.
               "I knelt to you once," exclaimed he, passing close to her side; "you remember the time. I knelt to you imploring you to desist from your dissipation—to forsake the attractions of the world, for the one heart that was devoted to you. You laughed at me. Kneel now, and I will laugh in turn."
               
               "Gilbert Waldron!"
               "Madam, I have a son. He is mine. I have no other hope—no other thought, no other purpose than to live for him. It matters not how circumstances compelled me once to forsake him. I will make reparation now."
               "Can a joyless childhood—a childhood without affection, without sympathy, prematurely sorrowing, and never knowing the glow, the hopefulness, the buoyant happiness of youth—can there be any reparation for a childhood so wronged?"
               "Do not taunt me, madam."
               "Why should I be tender of you?"
               "Because I was the victim equally with him, and you the cause. What he suffered comes up in judgment against yourself."
               "Oh! implacable falsehood. It is untrue, Waldron, I was not the cause."
               "Madam—"
               "Gilbert, I will swear—"
               "Margaret, do not blaspheme. There's crime enough upon your soul already."
               "If you come here, sir, merely to accuse and upbraid me, withdraw. This is my house. Here, at least, I will be absolved from insult."
               Her eye blazed up angrily, and a scarlet tinge deepened in her cheek.
               "Then come not between me and my purpose."
               "Your purpose? Are you not striving to rob me of that which I possess?"
               "Beware, Margaret, how you tamper with me, for I am desperate and reckless. I am indifferent to everything but my one desire. If you cross me, I'll tear asunder the veil under which you are concealed—I'll proclaim you—publish your infamy to the world—cover you with ignominy—pursue you everywhere—"
               He stopped from excess of agitation. The barriers were all now broken down, and his passions rushed sweeping and foaming along with resistless fury. He resumed again with a broken utterance:
               "You shall not keep my son from me. If you dare attempt it he shall know all—know and shudderingly shrink from his mother's infamy. I tell you that I am resolved. I have determined to own him—who shall prevent me? I claim that which is mine—what power shall deter me?"
               "A mother's love—her deep love—her cunning, subtle love, when cunning and subtlety are necessary to combat force and wrong."
               "Madam, you do not dare."
               "There's nothing I do not dare, Gilbert Waldron."
               He shook with convulsed rage and agitation.
               "Margaret—"
               He stopped suddenly, and hastily pressed a handkerchief to his lips.
               "Let this scene be ended," said Mrs. Carlton. "Do not cover me with insult in my own house."
               He turned abruptly upon his heel, and still pressing the handkerchief to his lips, rushed from the room and from the house.
               As he sprang into the carriage, he threw the handkerchief away. It was clotted with blood.
               No sooner was Mrs. Carlton alone than she throw up her hands with an involuntary motion, as of pain. She brushed the hair back from her brow with a nervous movement, and with a wild, irregular step staggered rather than walked from the room. The door of her cabinet was open, and she saw Knowlton within standing by the window. She hurried towards him, just as he turned to greet her.
               "You have had a visitor!" said he.
               "Knowlton, Knowlton, where is Rodman?—bring him to me—fly—I implore you—I must see him."
               "Has Waldron been here?"
               "Bring Rodman to me—fly to Oswald's! Ask me nothing—say nothing—only bring Rodman to me."
               With unwonted alacrity Knowlton seized his hat, and hurried off upon his commission. But he had not been gone many minutes before Rodman entered the house, and quietly sauntered into the drawing-room. Mrs. Carlton heard his entrance, and with impassioned eagerness flew to meet him. As she entered the room she closed the door, and with outstretched hands staggered forward, and flung her arms around his neck.
               "Rodman! Rodman!"
               It was all she could utter.
               "Madam," exclaimed Rodman with inexpressible surprise, endeavoring mildly to withdraw from her wild embrace.
               But her head fell upon his breast, her knees tottered under her, and she gradually sunk down to the floor, with her arms clasping his waist, and her face upturned to his. She was struggling with the effort to speak, and at last found voice.
               "Rodman, do not forsake me—do not cast me off, Rodman, Rodman—I am, I am your mother!"
               He fell back in speechless wonder. But she followed him up, and clung to him still.
               "Heaven knows, Rodman, how wildly I have longed to own you—how deeply I have desired to call you my son! But I did not dare do it. I was cast off, Rodman, as you were—I was accused of crime—overwhelmed with calumny. But I was innocent. Rodman, I was innocent, They tore you from me—they hid you from my sight. But after long years of suffering I found you—but did not dare to own you. I was afraid that you would not love me—that you would believe the dark crimes they accused me of. So I sought to win your heart first—to show you how much I loved you—to bind your affections to me ere I revealed myself."
               All this was uttered with a frantic earnestness-kneeling still, and winding her arms around him, and looking up to him with a wild eagerness.
               "Rodman, they are seeking now to separate us. You must have seen how much I love you—you must have seen how my heart has been absorbed in you. Rodman, Rodman, you are my son—I swear it—my own, my only son. Look down upon me—love me—say that you will—say that you will not forsake me as your father did! Gracious Father, turn his heart to me, in the name of mercy!"
               Her last words were uttered frantically to heaven, and then she sunk down, clinging to his knees still, but with her head upon her breast.
               Rodman stood as if paralyzed during all this vehement appeal. The tumultuous rush of emotions upon his heart that this discovery caused, deprived him of the power of speech. He could not even think. His brain was in a whirl. He could not grasp the mighty truth that had been revealed to him. It was too much like a wild dream to be real. The light that blazed into his soul blinded him with its power. The in-rushing flood of tenderness and love upon his heart, held him with suspended breath, and gasping ing utterance, staring at the kneeling pleader at his feet. But as the words grew more defined to his sense—as his imagination began to comprehend the revelation in all its vastness—there was a bound to his heart such as he had never known before. The blood rushed wildly through his veins. The tears gushed from his eyes. His arms were outstretched. The sacred name of mother hung tremblingly upon his lips.
               The word was caught up with a quick cry, and in an instant they were locked in each other's arms.
               The all-mighty power of kindred! Rodman had never experienced it before. It was the first time he had ever felt a parental kiss. It was the first time his aims ever encircled one in whose veins rolled the same blood as his own. The thought was an exquisite one, and thrilled him through and through.
               His mother! There was too much happiness in the word. He held her to his heart, and kissed her brow, and knelt down to receive her blessing.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXIV.
               MOTHER AND SON.
               THE tumultuous joy had subsided in the hearts of the mother and son, and with serener sensations of happiness, they were seated together, clasping each others hands. It is impossible to follow Rodman through all the transitions of feeling that this discovery caused him. His heart was completely revolutionized. A new world was opened before him—a new life opened out its hopeful scroll at his feet. He could scarcely comprehend the vast change his fortunes had so suddenly assumed. It seemed as if he were another being—treading another world—experiencing sensations of a different humanity—living in another atmosphere.
               Mrs. Carlton had always inspired him with profound admiration. Her superb beauty and noble accomplishments; her grace, elegance, superiority, talent—all these things had combined to exact a kind of worship from him. And now it was a matter of pride to find such a woman his mother. He looked upon her with delight; and, mingled with other feelings that were produced by this strange revelation, was exultation at finding himself the offspring of one so magnificent—of one who realized every ideal of what he could have wished his mother to be.
               He was seated by her side listening to her story. She hastily sketched her history to him—the history of her wrongs, and with scarlet cheek, related to him how infamy and calumny had been heaped upon her. She watched to see the responsive glow of indignation upon his cheek. She feared yet the influence of his old devotion to his father, and her victory could only be complete and secure, by arousing his indignant sympathy—by bringing him to recognise her as the victim of his father's injustice.
               "I was accused and condemned, Rodman, most foully, most wrongfully. I was cast out—I was abandoned. And yet I swear to you that I was innocent. You must believe me, Rodman. It would be more than I could bear to have you doubt me with the faintest doubt. Trust in me—in your mother! Trust in her with a perfect faith, for, oh! she is pure and true, although traduced, and spat upon, and calumniated I and pursued with dark falsehood, and wronged; Heaven knows with what malignancy! Believe in her, Rodman."
               "I do, madam, I do."
               You were torn from me, Rodman, and I was consigned to perpetual infamy; for it is the terrible misfortune of our sex that we cannot even be suspected, however innocent, without a taint for ever after clinging to us. I was condemned most cruelly and most unjustly. My worst fault was indiscretion. I was a fiery, high-spirited girl, and I rebelled at the authority my husband attempted to exercise—spurned at his commands, because I thought them too arbitrary in their character—and with giddy but proud independence, conducted myself in accordance merely with my own inclinations. These were my faults, Rodman—these only. But out of these they framed their story—out of mere folly and weakness. Rodman, I do not ask for revenge for reparation—I have not sought them; I do not ask for reconciliation—it is too late. I have sought for nothing but your love, my son. You. were for many years hidden from my knowledge. By accident you were discovered, and since then I've watched and waited for the hour when I might claim you—claim you by right and by affection. Rodman, shall we not be united? I have wealth—my father's wealth. A fair domain is ours in the South. There you would be master of all—wealth, station, rank! There we might live for each other—there, Rodman, you might convey your young and beautiful Blanche!"
               "Ah, madam!"
               "She was his ward once, and when I knew that you had met and loved her I feared then that every hope of mine was lost. It is not so now. You are mine, my own happy, my long worshipped boy, and I will open my heart to that to which yours so clings."
               "You saw her, mother, and you must confess that she is lovely."
               "She is. But, Oh Rodman! do not forsake me even for her. She cannot love you half so well as I do."
               "She is an orphan. There are no claims upon her. She will, I hope, join her destiny with ours. But, madam, what—what name shall I now bear?"
               "Carlton was my mother's maiden name. I have adopted it, and shall retain it. We will think further of what your's shall be. Rodman was my father's name, and I gave it to you—my father, who died when I was a little girl. He worshipped me, and it was well that he did die ere his daughter came to bear all that I have borne. Before you were born, in a mothers' fond anticipation, I worked a scarf with the name of Rodman embroidered upon it. My heart told me that my child would be a boy, and I wanted to give him my father's name. That scarf must have been in the wardrobe robe which they took away with you—and, by the blessing of Providence, have been the means of giving you the very name my heart had selected. Oh! Rodman, if you but knew the anguish of those long years—if you but knew how I suffered, my heart wild with its desire to find and embrace my son—if you but knew all, you would cling to me through everything."
               "My mother, nothing shall separate us."
               "Your father will strive to accomplish it, with cunning and with power. I know him, and I know what he will attempt. Rodman, put my heart to rest on that fear. Pledge me that you will not be seduced by him—pledge me, Rodman, that you will turn from the parent who forsook you, to the one who has followed you always."
               She flung her arms around his neck, and looked into his face beseechingly. He could not reply. With extreme agitation he released himself from her embrace, and, rising up, began to pace the floor.
               Through all this interview, at intervals, there had flashed through his mind vivid remembrances of his father—of a father who had been an Idea all perfect and all grand—an Idea, that, however, temporarily dimmed in moments of exasperated hatred and despair, still shone out bright and glorious, through all that he had undergone—through contumely, insult, injustice, and too evident hatred. And could he abandon this Idea even for her—could he pull down and root out ruthlessly and relentlessly this passion, that had grown with his growth, and wound its tendrils around every fibre of his heart? Could he abandon the hope of his life—put an impassible gulf between him and his father? And yet was there not already an impassable gulf between them? Had he not within his grasp a mother's affection, and should he endanger that in his devotion to a mere ideal love?
               Mrs. Carlton saw the struggle that was going on in Rodman's mind. She knew but too well how Rodman had always been a proud idolizer of his mysterious father, and it was this that restrained her from revealing herself to him during their long intercourse. With the most poignant suffering she had watched him absorbed in this one devotion—as eager to press him to her heart as he was eager for the embrace of his father, but condemned to an agonized silence in the consciousness that he felt no love for her, and would but too probably forsake one parent in his passionate yearning for another. It was for this reason that she struggled, as we have seen, to bind him to her, to obtain access to his heart through his sympathies, to so gradually link his affections to hers, fibre by fibre, thread by thread, that when the revelation came, her love would conquer over that of every other.
               The moment had come when she must obtain complete mastery over him—when the chain must be riveted beyond the power of anything thereafter to sever.
               She stretched her arms out to him with passionate earnestness. "Rodman, have I not loved you better than he—loved you when he was heaping infamy upon you?"
               The romantic and grand character of her beauty was enhanced by the power of her emotions. She looked like one to worship—like one whom it would be a glory to serve and love. His heart was thrilled with a chivalrous devotion. He looked upon her with growing rapture. His heart was not only deeply stirred, but his imagination was fascinated. A mother, and such a mother! He turned towards her. She stepped forward with extended arms. Her appeal could not be resisted. He sprang forward, wound his arms around her, flung himself at her feet, and in the overflowing fullness of his emotions, he pledged himself to abide by her, to defend her, to love her in the face of every calumny, and in defiance of every power.
               Oh! the rush of joy upon that mother's heart! Her happiness was complete now, broad as the universe, "general as the casing air!"
               And Rodman! In the midst of his happiness there was a weight as if some calamity had befallen him. Even as he knelt and solemnly abjured his father, there rushed upon him with sudden vividness the remembrance of that hour in his early youth, when he stood with panting heart within arm's length of his father, but did not dare to speak the name that hung upon his lips.
               While yet upon his knees a step was heard without, and a hand was placed on the door-knob. Rodman started up as Knowlton entered. Knowlton saw at a glance how matters stood.
               "I think," said he, turning to Mrs. Carlton, "that I may break my wand and bury my book. There's no more use for incantation."
               "There is not, indeed. Rodman, you must know Robert hereafter differently. He is my brother."
               Rodman was almost shocked at this intelligence. His faith in Knowlton at this period was less than it ever was—his doubts more confirmed. It seemed to dim the lustre of her character to have such a brother. In spite of himself a thousand fears and suspicions rushed upon his mind. Had he not been inveigled, tricked, played upon—brought to this position by cunning and subtlety? And if so how could he look upon his mother with that perfect faith that he desired to do? How could he feel that she was the soul of honor and of truth?
               Knowlton divined the thoughts that passed through Rodman's mind, and hastened to remove them.
               "My dear Rod," coming over and taking his hand, "the devil, you know, after all may not be so black as he is painted. I defy chemistry to find any virtue in me, but you may live long enough to discover that I have been doing you less harm than good, all this while. To tell the truth, Rod, I rather like you. You have given me some little trouble, and I have felt somehow as if you were a kind of bantling of my own. I don't believe that even your mother's solicitations could have kept me on the scent if there hadn't been something in you worthy of the hunt."
               "And you then—"
               "Have played the hound, and the fox, and, heaven save the mark! the foul fiend himself. I have chatted with clowns, eaten bad suppers at bad inns, perspired over dusty roads, and got bespattered over muddy ones, studied Machiavelli with sinister industry, lost an abundance of rosy slumber—for which Morpheus stands in debt to me—the only credit, by the way, against a pleasant array of figures on the other side; lost my appetite with scheming, talked more folly than I hope I shall ever be called upon to answer for, added to the sum total of the world's depravity by sundry bribes, invented mischief—in short acted out an agreeable sort of Iago life—and, what's more, found pleasure in all my dark turnings, and grew not a little charmed with the weapons I used."
               "Do not, Rodman, believe, all that he tells of himself."
               Knowlton's frank manner dispelled Rodman's doubts. He saw that he had been laboring in the cause of his sister, and he was ready to forgive a devotion like his, even if it were sometimes unscrupulous as to its means.
               "But, Mr. Knowlton," said he, "I wish to inquire of you one thing. When we last were together you spoke of—of Mr. Waldron's attachment—"
               
               "To his ward. Exactly. My assertions, I have reason to believe were true. He did have some such design—now, however, abandoned."
               "Is it possible? While his, that is, your sister was living?"
               "He possibly, Rod, may have contemplated obtaining, or trying to obtain a divorce. At least, we might as well give him the benefit of that supposition."
               Rodman leaned his brow upon his hand. How the long worshipped Idea was dissolving—how the bright being of his youthful worship was fast assuming the lineaments of depravity and wretchedness. His father, so worshipped, so long loved, proving at last to be so unworthy. The thought was terrible. And yet, did it not all accord with what he had himself experienced at his hands? Had he not himself suffered monstrous wrong, degradation, and insult from him? Better banish the remembrance of him for ever. He had enough to live for now—Blanche and his mother.
               "Don't grow sad, my good Hamlet," exclaimed Knowlton, "bury old sorrows deeper than ever plummet sounded, and begin life anew and freshly. There's nothing in this world worth a sigh—excepting a too hearty dinner."
               "Ah! Mr. Knowlton, you are not always going to adhere to such doctrines?"
               "Why not, Rod?"
               "Fame is worth striving for."
               "Why, yes; and so is a ribbon. I tell you, my dear Rod, Epicurus was the only sane man that ever lived."
               "We will induce him, Rodman, to live worthy of his talents."
               "Worthy! So I have. I reply in the words of the gay cavalier. 'Ask my creditors?'"
               "This is affectation, Robert. You know that I have enough."
               "While I, like the prodigal, have wasted mine. Well, I've had mine ease. Robert Knowlton must change his composition before he can slave himself to the yellow tyrant. I shall never bend the pregnant hinges of my knees to the universal god, believe me. I shall be happy in the sun, laughing at the antics of the world—the world, the stage where every man plays a comic part, to those who can see behind the masks. It will be amusement—"
               "Shooting folly as it flies?"
               "My dear Rod, folly as it flies has been shot at ever since the time of Solomon—and hasn't been brought down yet."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXV.
               MR. WALDRON'S HISTORY.
               "THIS is the first time, Blanche, that I have ever confided to any human being the full history of a period of my life, which, to all who know me, is sacred from comment or approach."
               These words commenced the written narrative of Mr. Waldron. Blanche was seated in her private apartment, with closed doors, and the manuscript opened on the table before her. With no little trepidation she prepared to peruse the pages. Her heart beat fast, her fingers trembled, and she was experiencing that peculiar excitement we all feel when anticipating some matter of moment and uncertainty. After an instant's hesitation she resumed.
               It continued:
               "I have made this full confession to you, because recent circumstances have revealed to me that I was once nearly guilty of a serious crime, and it is necessary for my own honor to explain to you how it happened. It is impossible to make this explanation without going into the details of a history that is profoundly painful, but perhaps, Blanche, you will find in it extenuating circumstances that will go far to lighten your judgment of conduct, that now appears to you without excuse and beyond pardon.
               "My youth, Blanche, was one of ardent hopes, strong passions, and keen sensibilities. My nature vibrated to every emotion, and was responsive to every enjoyment. I was quick, subtle, impressible, passionate, earnest; fascinated with the world, enraptured with society, and enamored of myself. My temperament was buoyant and happy, my wit not contemptible, my person pleasing, and I found myself at an early age the centre of a giddy circle—the courted, praised, admired, and, I may add, the proud, selfish, and vain Gilbert Waldron. I have said this much to let you understand my position, my passions in their youthful vigor, and my weaknesses.
               "At a brilliant assembly one night, I met a distinguished looking and very beautiful southern lady. Her cheek was of a warm olive tint, her eyes profoundly dark and deeply burning, her brow and features Grecian in their outline. I was fascinated by her beauty, and charmed by her manner. There was a deep, but calm earnestness in her expression, a stately grace in her motion, an eloquent fullness in her low, soft voice—a something romantic and glorious in her grand beauty, that pleased and excited my imagination. I withdrew from the assembly in a state of great excitement. All night long I walked my room in a wild ecstasy. The beautiful southerner had enraptured me beyond expression. My blood was on fire, my brain was in a whirl. I was passionately and violently in love.
               "The very next night we met again. I intruded myself into her society, and while intoxicated by her beauty, I was sufficiently master of myself to know the necessity of exertion in order to please her. I had always been called agreeable, and I now brought into action every power that I possessed. I talked excitedly and almost wildly. My imagination was unusually vivid, and I drew upon all subjects freely, and my language possessed an earnest, nervous vigor. My flights of fancy she rewarded, and she bestowed upon all I said the most profound attention. It was evident that I had made a favorable impression, and disordered visions of bliss and love filled my brain, and sent my blood rushing in turbulent violence through my veins.
               "I will not relate the progress of my passion. It was reciprocated—at least, so I fondly believed. We were married. Unwise, headlong, mad, why did I not perceive that I was rushing to fearful and boundless wretchedness? Why did I not see the precipice upon which I was standing—the dark destruction to which I was plunging? We were married. And then came the awakening—then fled every vision of bliss—then were the flowers in my path turned to scorpions—then did my heart in a single bound leap from youth, hope, and happiness, to unspeakable misery.
               "It was not long after my marriage before I observed that my wife was surrounded by a crowd of admirers. Her fondness for society was so great that not even her duties to her husband could induce her to refrain from its enjoyment. She seemed to consider her marriage only as a passport to all kinds of dissipation. I hinted my wishes for a reform. They were not heeded. I expressed more distinctly my desire that she would not entertain so many friends of my sex. She heard me with evident surprise, and replied somewhat angrily. I left her without responding, and with a full heart. The feeling had been gradually growing upon me that I was not loved, and now its too great probability rushed upon me with fearful force. I had loved her with devotion—with a boyish worship—for I was very young—and I felt, with sensations that I cannot describe, with agony, such as I trust, Blanche, you may never know, that the idol I adored was a false one.
               "I watched her for some days from a moody seclusion. She appeared to be acting in defiance of me. She entertained tained her friends with a more lavish hospitality than ever. A score of gentlemen visitors were continually at the house, and with them she projected unceasing pleasures. They rode, walked, danced, sailed, feasted, and surrendered themselves up to unrestrained enjoyment.
               "I determined to make one more effort to reclaim her—one more effort to reinstate myself in the position towards her that I once held. We met, but our interview proved a stormy one. I had not the command of temper I should have had, and she was equally disposed to violence and opposition. My remonstrances were met with taunts, and at last, when I grew passionate and heated, she flung back my words, defied my authority, and with vehement rage spurned and derided me.
               "I flew from her presence convulsed with fury, and tormented by a thousand doubts and suspicions. Her beauty still exercised its sway over me. Even in the midst of the angry scene I have just described it thrilled me with admiration—grand and startling under the influence of passion. I felt at moments as if I could fling myself upon the ground in wild devotion to her, if she would but render up to me some portion of love in return. But when the scene was ended and I was alone, how shall I describe all that I experienced then—all the despair, prostration, keen suffering that racked and pierced my heart through and through? It is impossible—words cannot convey or picture it. I raved, and stormed, and wept—beating my brow with frantic violence, gnashing my teeth with concentrated rage, and tearing my locks with abandoned despair. There were hidden and slumbering fires in my bosom that before I knew not of, but which now rushed with devastating fury through me, and consumed me with their power.
               "Time passed on, and she bore a child. Her illness for a time interrupted the flow of gay visitors, and I began to hope that new duties and new affections would prove of more attraction than the glitter and brilliancy of fashionable friends. But she had scarcely recovered ere the doors were thrown open, and troops of visitors once more filled my house. She was soon surrounded, as before, with a crowd of admirers, who ignored the existence of her husband, and in his very sight, with eager emulation, struggled for the prize of her smile.
               "I endeavored to bear it all with philosophy, and sought for solace in hopeful dreams connected with my child.
               "There was among her favorite companions one of superior parts—a man able, subtle, agreeable, and unscrupulous. His attentions to her were unremitting, and it was but too evident that his devotion and admiration were acceptable. This man I grew to suspect. I became convinced that his designs were not honorable—that he either had wounded my honor, or sought to do so. I watched him, determined upon the slightest evidence of guilt to hold him to a fearful account.
               "One day as I was walking in the garden I heard a noise of rustling silk and low voices from a natural bower a little distance from me. I darted forward in the direction whence the sounds came, when I suddenly encountered, my wife, breaking through a screen of shrubbery, her hair dishevelled, her face flushed, and her dress disordered. She saw me, turned from my path, and sped rapidly towards the house. The wild thought rushed upon me that it was a guilty flight. I sprang forward, and in an instant I was in the bower. As I had vaguely suspected it was occupied—and by the one of all others I most suspected. I did not wait for any further confirmation of my fears, but with words that were almost inaudible from excess of fury, I accused him of dishonoring me. He laughed scornfully, and turned to depart, but I sprang before him and barred his way.
               "'You have wronged me,' was all I had power to utter.
               "'I am of the world, sir, and I taste what is offered me,' he replied; 'you yourself would not do less.'
               I struck him upon the word a sudden, furious blow, and he fell. In the frenzy of the moment I leaped upon his prostrate body, and ground my heel into his face, and then darkly and raving fled from the scene.
               "I will not relate to you, Blanche, what followed. It was all too terrible. I cast her off—tore her child from her arms—which I now believed was no offspring of mine—and secretly bore it away. I first thought of obtaining a legal separation, but my proud spirit could not bear the public exposure. I forsook the Clove, and despatched word that I should require her to abandon it also. She sent me a letter in return. I burned it without reading, and caused her to be informed that I had done so.
               "The child was first placed in suitable nurses' hands, and when grown to about three years old, it was removed to the household of a Mr. Arden. Here I occasionally visited it—filled with conflicting doubts and hopes—longing to clasp him to my arms and call him son, but shrinking from him for fear that in his veins flowed the hated blood of the fiend who had wronged me."
               The narrative here proceeded to relate matters that the reader is already acquainted with—Waldron's departure for Europe, and sojourn there—the philosophical repose that sprung from, and was nurtured by, his secluded life—his yearning for an exalted sympathy—the guardianship devolved upon him—the receipt of a letter from his wife that reported her dying, and which most solemnly declared the legitimacy of her child's birth—the hopefulness of his return—the disappearance of the boy—the sudden trace of him discovered by Elwood—the fruitless search—and then it came to speak of his love for Blanche.
               "It is with great diffidence and delicacy, Blanche, that I come to speak of this part of my misdirected life. But it is necessary that I should do so, and you will presently understand the reason why. When I assumed your guardianship, I was filled with but one hope—that of becoming a father to you, and of winning an affection from you equal to that of a fond daughter's. My heart was full of hopeful anticipations of our relationship. So long without sympathy or love, I pictured out to myself a serene and happy life at the Clove, in the pure pursuit of simple pleasures, and in the calm enjoyment of intellectual occupations. I thought that upon the declining years of my life the mellowed sunlight would fall in tempered beams. But Destiny laughs at our poor struggles to fashion existence to please ourselves—and mars our brightest pictures for mere pastime.
               "It would be, too painful for me to relate the progress of the affection that grew up in my heart for you. I struggled against it, I prayed that it might not be, I sought by every means to crush the passion in its germ, but your beauty, your gentleness, your innumerable nameless graces that stirred up emotions fitful and violent—these fell upon my heart with a strange power. It is not always the young who alone can experience love. Older men perhaps rarely feel its spell, but when full of weariness, and melancholy, and sad memories, and earnest longings, they do awaken to the influence of love, youth rolls back its golden freshness upon their hearts.
               "I do not wish to pause upon this portion of my story. Consideration for you as well as for myself impels me to be brief. In a mad hour, when stung by the favor bestowed upon a nameless adventurer, I poured out my passion—and not till then awoke to a full consciousness of its hopelessness and its guilt.
               "I was filled with remorse and horror at my impetuous blindness. I would have given worlds if I could have recalled all that I had said. In the midst of my regrets, and while feeling the necessity of terminating a connection the sanctity of which I had violated, I was overwhelmed one night by intelligence which I received from Elwood—the reputed death of my wife was false—she was still living. In addition to this intelligence I was dismayed to learn that my earnestly sought-for son had been discovered by her, and that she was availing herself of every means to link him close and firmly in her affections.
               "I implore you to believe me, Blanche, when I most earnestly assure you that when I, in my unwise passion, sought to obtain your hand, I never dreamed that I was not morally and legally entitled to do so. I thought that I was a widower. Whether I was led to believe this designedly or not, I do not know.
               "This intelligence made it necessary at once for me to withdraw from the position which I held towards you. Rumors of my intentions of marriage towards you were already rife, and if it became known that those intentions existed at a time when I had a wife living, my honor would become blackened in general estimation beyond redress. Separation alone could silence such a scandal. Nor could I remain your guardian with this fact against me, however forcibly I might feel that I was innocent of any crime, inasmuch as even you would have no assurance of that innocence excepting by my word of mouth, and would but too probably bably feel a want of confidence in the truth of one, who, aside from this, had betrayed his trust in the mere thought of love. Moreover, I loved you still. It was impossible to go back to our old feelings. You could not have helped mistrusting and shrinking from me—and I would have lived in the remorse and the misery of a remembered crime, and a hopeless passion. It was better, many times better, that we should part."
               The remaining part of the narrative was occupied mostly with the narration of the events already described. It related the particulars of his earnest search for his son, and dwelt at length upon his eager desire to fold him to his heart. It referred to the knowledge he obtained through Elwood of that son's youthful and romantic devotion to him, and almost with wild vehemence it dwelt upon the strange freaks of Destiny, which had flung his boy in the path of his mother, and thus but too probably robbed him of him for ever.
               "I have but one hope now, Blanche—my son! If it would please Providence to extend me the boon of his love, in peacefulness and quiet I would pass on to eternity. If otherwise, a few more years of deep suffering—a few more years to carry a burdened heart—and then the shades that gather about the tomb will receive all, and end all."
               Blanche's sensations of joy upon the conclusion of Mr. Waldron's narrative were rapturous and deep. It was in her power to bring together, and restore to each other, the father and son, so peculiarly situated, and by the mysterious workings of fate so strangely kept apart. She was eager to see them—eager to confide in Mr. Waldron who his son was, and what his position was to her—eager to pour in Rodman's ear the rapturous news that his father indeed loved him, and with outstretched arms stood ready to embrace him.
               But what a strangely-involved history it was—how, indeed, it seemed as if they had all been the sport of a mischievous destiny. How extraordinary was Rodman's position—how strangely in the interwoven web had father and son crossed each other—each striving after a common end, and each unconsciously thwarting the other's efforts to accomplish it! And how peculiar, too, stood matters even then. As Blanche reflected, and recalled all the circumstances of the case—as she remembered that Rodman's mother was living—that Mrs. Carlton was undoubtedly that mother—for on the night of the ball she had detected the resemblance—and that Mrs. Carlton's influence over Rodman was great, which she would unquestionably use to keep him from his father, making herself known and arousing in Rodman's heart divided desires—as Blanche remembered all this, her joy somewhat subsided, and she began to feel that there were still obstacles in the way of the desired end.
               Mr. Waldron's story, it should be mentioned, had set her heart at ease upon one question. His love for her at a time when there existed legal ties between him and another, was satisfactorily explained. Blanche remembered the night of Elwood's arrival—her guardian's appearance on the following morning—the communication by Mr. Elwood of his resolve to resign his office and return to Europe. It was all now made clear.
               Blanche felt impelled to confide in some one the important secret she held, and starting up from the reverie into which Mr. Waldron's painful story had cast her, she went in search of Amelia.
               Blanche found Amelia alone, seated in her own apartment ment, and running up to her she flung her arms around her neck, and laid her cheek next to hers.
               "Why, Blanche!"
               "Ah! Amelia, I have so much to tell you—such strange matters."
               "Sit down, my dear, and I will listen to you."
               Blanche dropped down upon a foot-stool at Amelia's feet, and began her story.
               Amelia listened with boundless astonishment, and when Blanche ceased she was trembling nervously.
               "What!" exclaimed she, "Rodman Moore—your betrothed—who was with us at the Clove so much—he my brother's son—his lost son? Ah! who can compass the ways of Heaven? Blanche, I do not know how to speak, nor what to say, nor how to conduct myself upon this matter? My brother, my poor brother, I pray that his heart may be at rest at last!"
               "That is my prayer, too, Amelia."
               "But to think his father did not know him—that I did not know him. The resemblance is not much."
               "I could not detect any at first, but now when I look at Rodman I can see in the curve of his mouth, and in the arch of his brow, a marked similarity."
               "Strange, strange," exclaimed Amelia, shaking her head. "It's all like a wild romance. But it fills me with joy, dear Blanche, to think that your betrothed is so near to us—to think that your hopeful love now promises so much happiness."
               "Ah! Amelia, we all shall go back to the Clove, and be so very happy again. We shall, indeed!"
               Tears of pleasure sprang to Blanche's eyes, and she flung her arms around Amelia's neck, and laid her wet cheek upon bosom. Amelia pressed her closer to her heart, and their tears mingled together.
               Blanche remained for some moments in a silent peacefulness clasped in her friend's embrace, when a knock at the aroused her from the sweet reverie into which she was falling. It was a summons from the drawing-room. Mr. Moore would see Miss Dearwood.
               With no little trepidation Blanche flew down stairs, eager to greet him. She entered the room with extended hands, and as she placed them in his, she looked up into his face with that smile of hers, so full of sweetness, and love, and gentleness—that smile which shot its warm radiance into the hearts of all upon whom it fell.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXVI.
               FOUND AND LOST.
               WHEN Mr. Waldron entered the carriage after his interview with Mrs. Carlton, he ordered himself to be driven to Elwood's. He found that gentleman strutting up and down his office with long strides, and with great energy rubbing the back of his smooth head. He paused abruptly as his client entered, and started as if with alarm. There was a blood-spot upon Mr. Waldron's lip, and his face was of a deathly whiteness.
               "I have seen her," exclaimed he, panting as if for breath.
               "And—"
               "To Oswald's with me, Elwood—quick! It is a struggle between us. Quick—bring me to the boy!"
               "But, sir—"
               "Do not stop to talk, Elwood. The carriage is at the door—come."
               Elwood caught up his hat, and Waldron led the way to the street.
               "Fly!" cried Waldron, as he completed his directions to the hackman. They were driven rapidly, and in a few moments drew up at Oswald's quarters.
               "Let me lean on you," said Waldron to Elwood, as they ascended the stairs together. They entered Oswald's offices ces, and Waldron's gaze scanned the assembled clerks, wandering furtively from face to face, vainly trying to find one upon which it might fix as his son. He looked at Elwood anxiously.
               "Not here. We must see Oswald," was that gentleman's solicitous response to the inquiring glance.
               They were ushered into Oswald's office, who received them with his characteristic restless pomposity.
               Nothing resulted from the interview. Oswald was wary and would give no information of Rodman's movements. Once Oswald spoke of him as Rodman Moore, but Mr. Waldron's excited state was so great that the name did not attract his notice.
               Mr. Waldron's impatience could not brook to be bandying words with Oswald, and he terminated the interview by abruptly turning upon his heel, and hurrying from the apartment.
               "He is with her before this, and all is lost," exclaimed he as they entered the carriage.
               "My dear sir. The boy's fondness for you. Trust to that."
               "Which way now, sir?" said the hackman, standing upon the curb-stone, and looking in at the carriage-window.
               "Would that fortune could direct us," exclaimed Mr. Waldron, with great uncertainty.
               Elwood opened the carriage-door, and sprang out upon the walk. To Mr. Waldron's inquiry as to what he intended to do, he replied that he had a plan. Mr. Waldron must go home. Quiet was necessary for his nerves. Meanwhile, he would arrange to see the young gentleman—would bring them together that very night. They must appeal to him. There was no other way. The chance should be afforded. Mr. Waldron might trust in him.
               
               Mr. Waldron acceded, and sank back into the carriage.
               To the coachman's second inquiry as to his destination, he gave Mr. Hopewell's number.
               Meanwhile, in the Hopewell drawing-room were seated Rodman and Blanche. They had unfolded to each other their respective stories. Rodman was pale and solemn, and Blanche was weeping. Her bright hopes had been but too premature; the happiness she so fondly believed was in store, had flown.
               "Rodman," Blanche was saying, "it is impossible! You cannot mean to reject your father."
               "I must do so or reject my mother, that mother who has followed me always with love, tenderness, and devotion—unknown to me hovering around my path, and rescuing me from a life of desolate misery. My mother, Blanche, who has suffered at his hands contumely, shame, cruel tyranny, and heartless wrong. I have found her, and I have sworn to abide by her for ever, to cherish, to protect her."
               "But your father?"
               "It is too late."
               "Too late! Alas! alas! why did I not reveal everything to him at the Clove? I felt that I was doing wrong, and now I see how great the wrong was! But you will not forsake him. His heart is almost breaking under its weight of woe. Rodman, remember your boyhood—recall your sweet dreams of him, and then coldly turn away from him if you can."
               "I have awakened from that illusion. Why call it back?"
               "An illusion!"
               "Yes, for that cherished ideal has vanished. The virtue, goodness, and greatness that I worshipped, I now see existed only in my imagination."
               "Rodman, how can you say this?"
               "Did he not wrong my mother, my noble mother?"
               "He thought himself wronged, Rodman."
               "Look at my position, Blanche. My parents are separated, and I can only adhere to one. For years I have nursed a romantic fondness for my father, because in my childhood the mystery that surrounded him stimulated my imagination into an extravagant adoration; but now I suddenly discover another parent, who had been as silently and deeply devoted to me as I was to him. My heart bounds with joy at the discovery; but I soon find that in gaining one parent, I've lost for ever the other. I find, Blanche, that it was an idea I had been loving so fondly all this while—that the reality—it is painful beyond expression to speak of this, Blanche. I must not think of him. I have sworn to maintain the cause of my mother."
               "But does not your father's history make everything clear?"
               "His conduct to me—yes. But it does not excuse his injustice to my mother."
               "He believed that he had good cause."
               "Blanche, if you could experience the wild joy I felt as for the first time I found myself in my mother's arms, you would not expect me to forego her certain love for his which is doubtful. And how many times have I thought, if I only had such a mother! I know her heart, dear Blanche, and I know that it is good."
               "Alas! my poor guardian! I fear, I fear the end."
               "And can you think his love for you—"
               "Why speak of it? It filled me with horror then. I thought I was betrayed—I wept passionate tears—I shrunk from him, and in my heart accused him of crime and wickedness. But since then, I've thought better of it—have learned to forgive—have found for him many, many pleading excuses. I see him now tortured with remorse at its remembrance. It is because his affections have been cast so many times where they have not been returned, that I long to see his path brightened by your devotion. Ah! Rodman, is there nothing in our love, nothing in our sweet hopes of happiness, that will soften your heart to him?"
               Rodman trembled excessively, and the perspiration beaded his forehead.
               "Remember, Blanche, remember I have a mother. I've sworn to love her. I do love her. I cannot serve both."
               "But if they could be—"
               A carriage at this juncture drove rapidly up to the door. Blanche, with a suspicion as to who it might be, started, and, with the sentence unfinished, hastened to the window. It was as she expected. Mr. Waldron was alighting from the carriage.
               "It is your father, Rodman."
               "I cannot, must not see him, Blanche. Let me escape."
               With a sudden movement she sprang forward, and flung herself between him and the door.
               "You must not go, Rodman."
               "Blanche."
               "You must see him."
               "No, no, Blanche. Not now. Some other time. I am pledged not to—"
               "He is your father. He has the best right to your pledges."
               He made a motion to pass her, but she flung her arms around him, and looked up into his face beseechingly.
               "For my sake, Rodman. For the sake of the love that is between us."
               The door was opened, and Blanche hastily escaped from his arms. Mr. Waldron uttered an exclamation of surprise as he entered and found himself in the presence of Rodman, whom he remembered as a suspicious intruder upon the society of Blanche at the Clove.
               "Mr. Moore!" exclaimed he. Then turning to Blanche he observed her flushed and excited manner. His brow grew dark.
               "Is this person, Blanche, visiting you in opposition to your wishes? Is his presence here an intrusion? If I mistake not, sir"—to Rodman—"you have been guilty of some—"
               "Oh, sir! you know not to whom you are speaking. You—"
               "Blanche, I beseech you," broke in Rodman.
               "Blanche! So familiar! Is this flippant impertinence?—"
               "Mr. Waldron, you know not what you say. He is—"
               She hesitated. She feared to speak too suddenly the word that would solve all. But Rodman, trembling at the threatened revelation, started towards the door. Blanche saw it, and cried out impetuously:
               "No, no, Rodman! Mr. Waldron! Stop him—quick. He is—he is your son!"
               "Oh, God!"
               The word seemed fairly to open the ground at Mr. Waldron's feet. He staggered back, gasping, and dropped speechless in a chair. Rodman, arrested in his course by the profound interest of the moment, stood still and breathless. Blanche, with her hair dishevelled, and her manner alarmed, flew to Mr. Waldron, and began to chafe his hands. He had become entirely insensible. Blanche called eagerly to Rodman for help, but the young man stood, as if deprived of volition, with folded arms, and a trembling frame. His face was fearfully white, and covered with a damp moisture. It was a terrible scene for him to undergo, and so intense were his contending feelings that his brain swam, and he was near sinking upon the floor. He would have given life itself to have been able to prostrate himself there at his father's feet. But he was solemnly pledged to his mother. Was not the world out of joint? His whole life long he had been hoping, praying, frantically longing for this moment; and now, when it was come, there was a depth between them that could not be crossed.
               "Rodman, help—your father!" cried out Blanche, in great alarm at Mr. Waldron's continued insensibility.
               "My father!" exclaimed Rodman, starting forward. "My father! Oh, misery, misery! I dare not, cannot call him so."
               Mr. Waldron slowly began to revive. Rodman saw it, and abruptly turned and fled from the room. Blanche called after him. Mr. Waldron started at the sound of the voice, and lifting up his head gazed vacantly around. Blanche left his side, and followed Rodman into the hall. Her lips were compressed, and there was a strange expression in her expanded eye. She came up close to him, and spoke in a low voice that shook with emotion.
               "Rodman, you must accept your father, or cast off me!"
               "Blanche! Blanche!"
               "I am resolved. My heart may break, but I am resolved."
               "Have mercy, Blanche. My mother! I am pledged. I am pledged!"
               "Your father, Rodman!"
               "O Heaven! Would that I were dead!"
               She moved to go back. He called out to her imploringly.
               "I have but this one thing to say, Rodman."
               He pulled his hat over his brow, and with a cry of pain, rushed out into the open air. Blanche, with one quick gasp, turned and hurried back to Mr. Waldron. He had risen up, and was standing, rubbing his brow with his hand, and looking wonderingly around, as if endeavoring to recover his scattered senses, and comprehend his position. As Blanche came up to his side, he caught her hand, and exclaimed:
               "I cannot understand. I am confused. My son! O, Heaven, hold my heart! He my son, whom I have insulted—hated—it cannot be! This is a wild dream—a mockery—some fearful delusion. My son!"
               He sat down again and covered his face with his hands.
               "Almighty Heaven! why did I not know this before? Why? Oh! why?"
               "My guardian, my guardian," exclaimed Blanche, throwing her arms around his neck, and pouring out her tears upon his breast.
               "Miserable, miserable nature, that knew not its own offspring! O, heaven! I spurned him from my side at the very moment my heart was panting to clasp him! Besotted blindness! Monstrous insensibility! But, Blanche, I am bewildered yet. Tell me what it all means. Rodman Moore—my son? Explain! It is beyond belief."
               Rapidly Blanche recounted to him all the circumstances of her acquaintance with Rodman, and the strange events that followed.
               "Your betrothed?" exclaimed Mr. Waldron, when she had finished. "Oh! fatal tissue of errors. Mysterious Providence, how inscrutable are thy workings! But now, Blanche, why has he flown? Why will he not believe that I knew him not when we met at the Clove—that the indignities nities he suffered at my hands, were inflicted ignorantly—most ignorantly of his kindred to me—unjustly inflicted in misguided passion at the best?"
               "He does believe it, sir, but—his mother, he will not abandon her!"
               "His mother! Merciful Father! I am too late. He is lost to me for ever. Oh! this is the terrible expiation of some crime! Rodman! My son! I cannot survive your loss."
               "Oh! sir, sir," murmured Blanche, with blinding tears.
               He rose up and moved towards the door.
               "Where are you going, dear sir?"
               "To her. To him. I tell you, Blanche, it is her work. His heart is mine. I feel that it is. She has fascinated him—thrown the spell around him, that she once threw around me. But I will drag him from her. He must be mine. She is robbing him of you and me, Blanche. She shall not keep him from us;" he was growing wild and vehement; "she shall not! she shall not!"
               He struggled with her arms that were clasping him, and she released him. She thought it wiser not to oppose him. With blind and impetuous frenzy, he rushed from the room. But as the carriage bore him away from the house, his handkerchief was repeatedly applied to his mouth, and taken away again suffused with blood.
               When he was gone, Blanche hastened to her apartment, and there upon her knees gave vent to her suffering. An agonized cry went up from her bosom. Had she not flung away the dearest hope of her heart? Had she not trampled upon all the blossoms of her young love?
            
            
               CHAPTER XXXVII.
               THE LAST PARTING.
               TWO hours had elapsed, and Blanche still remained kneeling, her face buried in her pillow, low sobs breaking from her bosom, and convulsive tremors running through her frame. Her young heart, so pure and golden, was bowed to the dust. Darkness had come down and surrounded her. There was not one ray of light, one gleam of radiance. She could find no comfort anywhere. There was no consolation in any thought she could summon. Gloom and misery were around and before her.
               Two hours had elapsed, when a rapid, loud knock upon the door started her to her feet. Before she could open it, it was repeated. A servant stood without, with an urgent message from a gentleman in the drawing-room, who desired to see her immediately on an important matter.
               Hastily bathing her weeping eyes in water, and smoothing her dishevelled locks, she descended. As she entered the room, Mr. Knowlton rose up from a chair and came towards her. She stopped short, and with inexpressible alarm, held her hand against her heart.
               "Miss Dearwood," said he, "I am the unfortunate bearer of sad news."
               "Well, sir."
               "Let me induce you, Miss Dearwood, to take a chair."
               
               She complied mechanically.
               "You will pardon me, Miss Dearwood," he continued, "if I urge upon you, the necessity of being prepared for somewhat alarming intelligence. I do not desire to shock you suddenly."
               "Go on, sir, go on."
               "A little less than an hour ago, when my sister, Mrs. Carlton, and her son were together, they were suddenly interrupted by the violent entrance into their presence of Mr. Waldron. Mr. Waldron's manner was strangely excited. There were blood spots upon his face, and other evidences of some unusual passion. He flew to Rodman, flung himself on his knees at his feet, attempted to pour out some passionate words, but a sudden gush of blood from his mouth prevented him. He struggled to his feet. The exertion caused the blood to flow more violently. He staggered, and before be could be aided, fell prostrate."
               "Good Heaven!"
               "I was fortunately present, and flew for a physician. When I returned—but you are faint, Miss Dearwood."
               "No, no," faintly ejaculated Blanche, as her arms fell down by her side, and her head dropped back. Knowlton flew to the bell and rang it violently, and then ran to support her. She revived almost instantly, and stood up, but her limbs trembled, and she supported herself against the chair back. Motioning the servant to withdraw, who had responded to the call, she turned to Knowlton, and requested him to proceed.
               "He desires, Miss Dearwood, to see you and his sister, and he commissioned me to bring you. I have a carriage at the door."
               "Tell me truly, sir. Is he dying?"
               "The hemorrhage was very violent. I fear the worst."
               "Quick, then, let us go to him."
               She hastened up-stairs with a feverish eagerness, and sought out Amelia. That lady received the intelligence of her brother's illness with painful emotion. Her manner did not lose its composure, but she shaded her eyes with her hands for several moments, and then rose up prepared to depart. Her frame was bowed, and her countenance full of anguish and woe.
               Poor Amelia! Her life had been devoted to her brother, and every hope she had clustered around his being. If his sun went down, there would be no more light in her lonely heart.
               Knowlton handed the ladies into the carriage with great deference, and as he seated himself opposite to them, he gave orders to be driven rapidly.
               Nothing was said during the ride. Knowlton had too much respect for the grief of his companions to intrude his conversation upon them. Amelia's eyes were closed, and one hand was pressed upon her brow, while the other was convulsively clasped by Blanche's from whom there broke an occasional sob, but Amelia maintained a death-like and almost awful stillness.
               Upon their arrival at Mrs. Carlton's, they were met at the door by the physician.
               "Speak!" exclaimed Blanche, breathlessly; "Mr. Waldron?—"
               "Alas! young lady, I fear the worst."
               "O Father in Heaven, spare him!"
               Amelia leaned against Blanche for support, but did not speak.
               "Will you lead us to him?" said Blanche, finding utterance with difficulty.
               The physician replied, that as Mr. Waldron desired so strongly to see them, they could go to him. But it was necessary that they should use the utmost discretion, and by all means avoid exciting him.
               They were ushered into the partially darkened parlor. Upon a sofa, bolstered up with some pillows, was stretched Mr. Waldron, and at his side, with his head upon his father's breast, knelt Rodman Moore. The sick man's arms were encircling him, and folding him tighter and tighter to his heart. Both were silent. The crowd of emotions upon them were too great for speech—beyond the power of utterance.
               They were united! Oh, mockery of hope, at what a time!
               Mr. Waldron's face was very white, and looked ghastly through the partial darkness. His breathing was difficult, and at brief intervals his handkerchief was applied to his mouth, and taken away again suffused with blood.
               Seated by one of the windows, with her face averted, was Mrs. Carlton. She was motionless, and apparently cold and calm; but if any one had stood by her side they would have seen in the swollen vein that crossed her forehead, and in the quick beat of her heart, that she, scarcely less than others, was a sufferer in the scene.
               As Blanche and Amelia entered, Mr. Waldron lifted his eyes, and seeing them, motioned them to come to him.
               "This is the end," said he. "Life has been a cheat to me. I taste its greatest joy now, here upon the confines of the grave."
               "My father, my father," sobbed out Rodman.
               "Oh, sir," exclaimed Blanche, through her tears, "you will not die!"
               "My sister," resumed he, drawing Amelia down, and kissing her brow, "my sister, cherish these, my children. I have found a son and a daughter. Rodman, give me your hand; and you, Blanche, yours. There; may you be happier than your father has been!"
               He joined their hands together, and held them there.
               "My father!" cried Blanche, "live to see us happy!"
               "Oh, my children, if you had but told me all! How little did I dream that my sought-for son was my Blanche's betrothed! Rodman, if you had but uttered my name!"
               "Father, I shall die if you reproach me. Heaven knows how I have longed for your love."
               "I will not reproach, my children. I bless you, I bless you."
               His voice died away from exhaustion; but he drew Blanche and Rodman down to his breast.
               "Father! father!" was the choking utterance that broke from each.
               Amelia wound her arms around him, and laid her cheek upon his brow.
               Knowlton, who was standing a little removed, by the side of the physician, looked at him inquiringly.
               "He is failing," was the whispered response.
               "We are such stuff as dreams are made of," was Knowlton's muttered exclamation, as he turned away, and walked to the window.
               But suddenly there was a rushing sound through the room, and Mrs. Carlton was standing by her husband's side, with trembling and outstretched hands.
               "Gilbert, Gilbert! my son will curse me—I shall lose him forever, if you die with no word for me. Oh! why, even at this late hour, may we not be reconciled?"
               He revived, and raised himself partially up.
               "I am innocent, Gilbert, most innocent. Here, at this awful hour, I will swear it."
               "Overton! He confessed," gasped out the dying man.
               
               "My husband, he did me a foul wrong. When you met me flying through the garden, I was escaping from his infamous designs. He had seized my arm, and, holding me fast, had poured in my ear the tale of his passion. I spurned him, struggled with him, broke from him, and escaped. If he admitted a crime, then his purpose was to ruin me, and so accomplish his end. Oh, Gilbert, will you believe me? Do not die thinking I have wronged you!"
               His eyes were fixed upon her wildly.
               "Is this all true?"
               "It is! It is! I know, Gilbert, that I was guilty of much heartlessness and many sins, but of no crime. I loved society—feasted on admiration—courted praise. I surrounded myself with those who would administer to these weaknesses. But I never, no never, in thought or act, was false to you. Gilbert, for your son's sake, believe me. I have been proud, I have been obstinate, but I implore you with all humility—Gilbert, do you hear me?"
               He stretched out his hand to her. She grasped it, and dropping upon her knees at his side, kissed it passionately. Mr. Waldron did not speak, but oh! what a rush of agonizing thoughts filled his breast. Was it true, then—was it possible—that he had been the ruthless destroyer of his own happiness? Had he himself indeed been the cause of his long years of suffering? Was it his own hand that struck so fearfully at his peace—that tore out and threw away recklessly and madly the love that, if nourished, would have sweetened all his life? Then his fate was a retribution—and a just one! He shuddered at the thought. But oh! the expiation was terrible beyond expression! When his new-found son was thrilling him with joy—when the love of his youth was rushing back upon his heart—when visions of exquisite earthly happiness floated before him—when sounds of affection and love were in his ears, that were rapture to hear—when life assumed to him charms and attractions, such as it had not done before for many, many years—at the very moment of all this, the grave was opening to receive in its dark depths his new sprung joys, and to annihilate for ever his earthly hopes.
               "Will you not forgive me, Gilbert?" cried out Mrs. Carlton, still holding his hand. "Speak one word to me, I beseech you."
               "Margaret! Ah, see how error deceives us all! Our son, Margaret, love him. And oh! remember that our passions are our greatest enemies. The evils that we suffer mostly spring from them."
               "Alas! Alas! How little did I dream my thoughtless conduct would lead to this."
               "Farewell!" murmured the dying man.
               Rodman looked up in his face and started. A marked and terrible change was taking place. A shadow had fallen upon his features and changed their aspect fearfully.
               "Father!" cried Rodman; "O, my God, father!"
               A suppressed cry broke from every bosom.
               "My children!"
               He smiled. A spasm shook his frame.
               The rest was silence.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXXVIII.
               CONCLUSION.
               IN the month of May succeeding the death of Mr. Waldron, near the close of the day, a carriage was driven along the river road towards the Clove, and just as the sun took his last stand on the western hills, it drew up before the porch of the Clove mansion. It contained Mrs. Carlton—whom we shall hereafter call Mrs. Waldron—Amelia, Blanche, and Rodman. The entire group were dressed in black, and upon each face there rested an expression of profound sadness.
               Mrs. Waldron and Amelia passed into the house, but Blanche and Rodman lingered without to take a view of the familiar scene. Blanche's hand was resting in Rodman's, and for some moments they stood together, silent with the rush of painful thoughts that every object around them called up. Blanche was the first to speak.
               "It is less than a year," said she, "since I first saw the Clove. I was full of buoyant happiness then. Alas! what sad, sad events have followed!"
               "To you, Blanche, my father's memory will be associated with every haunt about the place."
               "It will, Rodman."
               "But you must not allow your remembrance of him to sadden you too deeply. Every hour some new thing will tend to recall him to your mind. Let them do so, Blanche, without causing in you too much sorrow. Keep up your cheerfulness, will you not?"
               "I will strive to do so, Rodman. I might succeed if you were always to be with me."
               "But I must finish my law-studies. Though to tell the truth, Blanche, I am losing all taste for them. My highest ambition now is to settle down here with you at the Clove, and be a country gentleman. The only happy hours I ever knew were passed here. I have no heart for the world. It is impossible to tell you, Blanche, how painfully its noisy gaiety and clamorous mirth ring in my ears, now with the ever-present memory of my poor, poor father weighing upon me."
               "Rodman, let us walk down the lawn. There is a rustic seat beneath a cluster of trees where your father led me the first evening of my arrival. It was at the sunset hour just as this is. Let us go there, and we will talk together of him, and of our future."
               They walked down to the spot designated by Blanche, and seated themselves side by side upon the rustic bench. There they remained until the shadows gathered darkly around them, and the last tint had faded from the western sky. Their talk was low, and broken by intervals of silent melancholy. To Blanche the remembrance of her first hour at the Clove, passed upon that very spot by the side of Mr. Waldron, overpowered her with tenderness. Her tears gushed out and rolled down her cheeks, and her words became choked and broken from emotion.
               Rodman, to whom the scene had no such associations, sympathized with Blanche's peculiar grief, and endeavored to assuage it, by introducing other matters of conversation.
               
               "No, no, Rodman," said Blanche, "let us talk of him. May we never cease dear Rodman, to shed such tears as mine upon his memory; they are not bitter ones; they relieve rather than oppress the heart."
               They talked of their father—so they in common called him—and though subdued, and tearful, and overcome by the many recollections that crowded upon them, there was, a sweetness in their grief, that rendered their task pleasurable, though sad. They also conversed of their future.
               At the termination of two years from the death of Mr. Waldron, they were to be married. The Clove was to be their home. There was an estate in the South which Rodman would inherit from his mother, and at Mrs. Waldron's solicitation it was agreed that several months of every year should be passed upon it. During the interval before their marriage, Blanche was to pursue her studies at the Clove, under a tutor to be secured and Rodman was to finish his course of reading in the law. The practice of the profession would be a matter of choice, but it was thought advisable for him to take a diploma, to be availed of afterwards as circumstances might determine. Rodman's inclinations tended to a quiet country life at the Clove, he and Blanche together, leading a gentle and unexcitable life, with their books, their drawings, and the elegant and agreeable occupations which two refined minds would naturally adopt in such a life. And then if Rodman should grow ambitious, there was the political arena, which his professional reading would fit him to enter.
               It was a sweet picture they drew of their future. It was colored with many glowing tints. But Blanche shuddered. Sometimes as she recalled how equally hopeful were the anticipations of happiness indulged in by Mr. Waldron and herself in her first days at the Clove.
               The next day after their arrival they received a message from good old Captain Dartan. The veteran was failing fast. The death of Mr. Waldron had been a severe blow to him, but the circumstances that produced it he was not fully acquainted with. He had been told of Mr. Waldron's discovery of a son, in the person of Rodman Moore, but his wandering senses could not quite comprehend the intelligence. His memory deed was in a state of confusion. Events were oddly jumbled in his mind. Circumstances and people widely separated, he was continually associating together.
               Blanche and Rodman rode over on horseback. This was their former mode of visiting the Captain, and they desired to do so upon this occasion. Their ride was an agreeable one in recalling the familiar scenes in which they had passed so many happy hours together the preceding summer, in all the sweet enjoyment of their young love. But as occasionally Blanche would come suddenly upon some spot consecrated by the memory of her guardian, the tears would start to her eyes, and they would both arrest the progress of their steeds, and allow in silence their melancholy feelings to have sway.
               As they rode up to the gate that opened into Captain Dartan's little enclosure, Angelica came out to meet them. The veteran, she said, talked of them continually, but wanderingly and in a manner confused. She feared that his hours were rapidly drawing to a close.
               Blanche and Rodman entered the sick man's chamber softly. But their steps caught his ear. He raised himself upon his pillow, and as his eye fell upon them he recognized them at once. He spoke their names, and put out his hand for them to come nearer.
               "Blanche Dearwood, said he "beautiful Blanche! General Dearwood! and there's Rodman Willow! How cold and damp the ground is—they lie around me thick—white, white, white!"
               "Dear Captain Dartan, don't you remember Rodman Moore, your lodger, whom you liked so well?"
               "It was at Germantown—they killed him there, and I was dying with the moon smiling upon me. Sally Clare, sweet Sally Clare," looking at Blanche, "how the snow is piled up on her grave!"
               "Alas! poor Captain Dartan. He will join my father soon."
               "Don't you know us, dear sir?"
               "Yes, you are Blanche, and this is Rodman—glorious Rodman Willow's grandson."
               "Do you not know that he is Mr. Waldron's son—your old Colonel's great-grandson."
               "Colonel Waldron's grandson!" He put his hand on Rodman's forehead and smoothed back his hair, "Not Rodman Willow's—Colonel Waldron's?"
               "Yes, dear Captain."
               "Huzza! That's glorious!" He waved his hand in the air. "Glorious! I always knew—he was—somebody's—grandson—I always knew—"
               He sunk back exhausted, and when they spoke to him again, his face brightened a little, but he made no response. He lay thus for a long while, and, as Angelica declared, it was only a periodical return of exhaustion, and not indicative of immediate danger, Blanche and Rodman withdrew, and promised to ride over early next morning.
               But the next morning, while at breakfast, word was brought that the old man was dead.
               Blanche and Rodman stood side by side over his grave, and shed heartfelt tears as they saw the turf heaped up over his big heart.
               At the termination of ar week Rodman returned to town to resume his studies. It was arranged that once a fortnight he was to spend a Sunday at the Clove; and also the whole term of the August vacation.
               "Do not allow yourself to grow too melancholy," were his parting words to Blanche, "but 
                     rememember
                     remember
                   that we are something to this world, and not all to the grave."
               "For your sake, Rodman, I will not."
               And so they parted.
               The first day Rodman was in town Knowlton came to his chambers.
               "Rod," said he, "do you think I am sane?"
               "Shrewdness, Mr. Knowlton, has always been accounted one of your qualities."
               "So I prided myself, but now I am fallen under a strange sickness, either of the blood or the brain, I know not which."
               "Why what's the matter, sir?"
               "There's a whim got into my head that I can't get rid of—and what do you think it is? Matrimony, by all mild oaths!"
               "Impossible?"
               "That's exactly what I say. But the devil that's in me, will neither be laughed, coaxed, nor beaten out of me. You see, my dear Rod, Othello's occupation's gone, and so I've waxed lonely. I have lacked excitement, and the foul fiend, you know, always hunts about for an empty pate in which to pour mischief. I don't like work. Nothing could induce me to study. I hate travelling. So I thought of matrimony as an occupation."
               "With whom, sir?"
               "One of three silly sisters—Susan Hopewell. It strikes me that Susan has too much good sense at bottom, and too shrewd a wit, to flourish in the soil where she now is. If she were transplanted I have no doubt she would become, in time, a sensible woman. Wit I know she has—and I should like a witty wife."
               "I congratulate you, Mr. Knowlton."
               "I am not sure that I want you to do that. If by this step I should lose my independence now, I should go into black at once."
               "What do you propose to do? Live as you have, or go into the country, quietly—"
               "And stupidly. No, no, Rodman, I must have the world beneath my parlor window, where I can make mouths at it at my pleasure. But we will spend an occasional week with you at the Clove, where I will sleep over sonnets at noonday, and try what kind of sermons there are in your stones, and books in your running brooks."
               "Your occupation shall be when you come, as you like it. You 
                     may may
                     may
                   quote Shakspeare as you please, and imagine yourself bodily in the forest of Arden."
               "And I the clown, eh? What would Susan say, think you, to pass as Audrey?"
               "She would be more likely to ring her wit about your ears, until you confessed her a Beatrice."
               "Heaven save me! I must look again before I leap."
               The two years have passed over, and Blanche and Rodman stand together at their bridal hour.
               The ceremony has been performed at Mrs. Waldron's town residence, and a brilliant assemblage is gathered to do honor to the occasion.
               Blanche looks rarely beautiful; and as the guests gather closely around, murmurs of praise and admiration fall from every lip.
               Rodman looks into her face, mantling with soft blushes, and his bosom is thrilled through and through with exquisite sensations of happiness. So lovely, so noble, so golden-blooded! Ah, rosy, rosy glows the future for him, and his heart overflows with the fullness of his joy!
               On the morrow, they are to depart for a southern tour—to visit Mrs. Waldron's relations, whom they have not yet seen, and to see the home which henceforth, for a part of each year, they are to call their own.
               It is a later hour in the evening, and in the midst of the mirth and merriment that prevail, Blanche has, unobserved, glided into Mrs. Waldron's cabinet. She stands alone, pensively leaning against the mantel, and a tear hangs upon her fringed eyelids. But Rodman follows her, and tenderly inquires why she is dejected.
               "Our father, Rodman! do not let us forget him!"
               "Ah, Blanche, his memory will temper every joy, and often every adversity. We will remember him as a cherished dream, which, if it saddens, saddens sweetly."
            
            THE END.
