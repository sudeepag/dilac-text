            TO THE PUBLIC.
            
               
                  DEAR PUBLIC:
               
               Once more come we, knocking at your door, to beg the crumbs of your charity.
               Twice before, indeed, have you taken us in, and twice, going out, have our
                  grateful tears besprinkled the flags of your threshold. But then it was our own
                  cause we pleaded; now we plead the cause of another; we bring to your arms a
                  desolate orphan, not three days old, and without a relative in the world. Its
                  dying parent bequeathed it to you, in the strong hope, that slender as its claim
                  was on your sympathy, you would not have the heart to reject it. After the many
                  favors we ourselves have received at your hands, it would be indelicate in us to
                  do more than submit the case without word or comment to your benevolent
                  consideration. The following letters will best explain the melancholy
                  circumstances which brought the little adventurer to employ so poor an advocate,
                  and one, alas! in every respect, so unworthy the sacred trust.
               
                  Your grateful servant,
                  P. PEPPERGRASS.
               
            
            
               
                  DEAR PAUL:
               
               After many weary voyages by land and sea, here I am laid up. Here I am, stretched
                  on a straw pallet in Gooseberry Lane, with my last dollar in my pocket, and my old
                  leather bag under my pillow. O Paul, my faithful college chum, what a desperate
                  effort I made to reach you! Somehow I always fancied, if I could only have
                     another sight of your honest, "sonsie"
                  face, and the promise of a quiet little corner in your family grave lot, I should
                  die the happier. Besides, as I never belonged to any one in particular, I felt you
                  had a sort of claim on my remains. But it's all over with me now, and so God's
                  will be done! I'm a crazy, good-for-nothing, ill-tempered creature, any way, and
                  the sooner I'm put out of the way of decent, useful people, the better. I suppose
                  I needn't tell you what I'm dying of—the rheumatism, of course: what else could it
                  be? The villain knocked me down twice before, you remember, and then compromised
                  it; but this time he has fairly got death's grip of me, and refuses, point blank,
                  to let me off on any terms. The priest and doctor were both here this morning, and
                  shook hands with me at parting. So my time, you see, is but short. Well, at all
                  events I'm prepared—that is, in a kind of fashion, not so well as I ought of
                  course, but still better than I deserve to be, considering the Edie Ochiltree life
                  I led since I abandoned theology and the cassock. As for the world, I forgive it
                  for all the shabby treatment I ever received at its hands, and upon my word, Paul,
                  I received my share. It's of no use, though, to carry our grudges with us to the
                  grave; and, indeed, even if it were, I never felt much disposed that way. Besides,
                  the world has sins enough to answer for, God knows, without adding the injuries it
                  has done me to the account. So I shake hands, and forgive it. And now, Paul,
                  there's one request I have to make, and for the sake of the old times, I hope
                  you'll not refuse it, namely: When you come here and find me dead and gone, don't
                  mind asking any questions, for nobody knows me but as the lame pilgrim, who
                  frightened the children, and lived in a garret in Gooseberry Lane. Say nothing,
                  but just ask the apple woman, who lets me the room, for the black leather bag I
                  kept under my pillow. Put your hand down to the bottom, and draw out "Mary Lee."
                  It's the last of the collection, and, for aught I know to the contrary, the best
                  of them all. Take it home with you, brush it up a little, and give it to some
                  charitable publisher, if you happen to know or hear of any such person in that
                  part of the world. Should the little thing bring a few dollars, buy me a modest
                  head-stone of gray marble and inscribe my name on the corner—Peter Pinkie—no more.
                  For the rest, I bequeath you all my worldly goods, to wit: my silver snuff-box
                  (but by the way, now that I think of it, the half of that same belongs to you
                  already) and my ivory-headed crab-tree staff, both which Father Mahony (by the
                  same token he's first cousin to Father Prout of the Prout Papers) will deliver you
                  on presenting this letter. And now, dear Paul, before I bid good by, let me
                  entreat you to say a few prayers for me, once and again, when you have leisure—for
                  alas! alas! I need them sadly. Say them quietly, just as we used to say them
                  together long ago at the Virgin altar in the college chapel, and say them away by
                  yourself in some lonely corner of the church, where the shadow falls deepest. God
                  be with you, Paul.
               
                  Yours as ever,
                  P. PINKIE.
               
            
            
               On reaching New Orleans we hastened with all possible speed to Gooseberry Lane,
                  hoping to find our venerable friend still alive; but alas! we came too late. Early
                  that morning the remains of a stranger whom nobody knew, but who went by the name
                  of Peter Pinkie, were carried out to their final resting place, and deposited in a
                  shady little corner of the Catholic cemetery. Intending to visit the grave next
                  day, and leave directions for the head-stone of gray marble, we took occasion in
                  the interval to call on the Rev. Mr. Mahony, and after tendering our most grateful
                  thanks for his kindness to our dear old friend and fellow-student, received from
                  his venerable hands the silver snuff-box, the crab-tree staff, and the following
                  letter of explanation, written apparently but a few hours before his death.
               
                  P. P.
               
            
            
               
                  DEAR PAUL:
               
               I have some remarks to make about "Mary Lee," and can't compose myself to die
                  happy without making them. So I just swallowed an anodyne, and had the apple woman
                  fix up the foot-board for a writing desk.
               I know well when you read the opening paragraph you'll shrug up your shoulders in
                  the old way, and pitch the manuscript across the table to your friend Dr.
                  Grippinlip, with a "Psaugh! nonsense! what does the silly fellow mean by such an
                  introduction as that?" But think what you please, Paul; I can't help it. It was
                  always my way, you know, to go straight to the point; or, as our first Latin
                  master, Terence Hardiman, used to say, to dive in medias
                     res plump as a pearl fisher! I wouldn't think of Terry now either, I
                  suspect, only the silver snuffbox he left us is here before me on the foot-board,
                  and the curly-headed cobbler on the lid is looking straight in my face. But
                  independently of that, my early memories crowd on me now faster and clearer than
                  ever. Sometimes I catch myself thinking of old Sangrado at the college, and old
                  Etty at the infirmary coming in coughing every morning, with her pharmacopœia
                  under her arm. And what do you think? I was dreaming all last night about the rush
                  crosses we used to weave at Michaelmas, and
                  the segging boats we sailed in partnership on the round pond before my father's
                  door. They looked to me just as green and natural as the leaves I saw yesterday. I
                  don't know how it happens, but my thoughts are ever stumbling over old times and
                  old places; do what I will, I can't control them. I half suspect it's the usual
                  sign of death—the parting look which the spirit casts back on the opening scenes
                  of its young and joyous life, ere it sinks and is swallowed up forever in the
                  source of its being—just like the setting sun taking his farewell look of
                  earth—the last one, the brightest and fondest of all. But I fear I'm
                  digressing.
               I was going to observe that if you expected me to write a preface to "Mary Lee"
                  according to the ordinary standards made and provided, you will be entirely
                  disappointed; for I may as well tell you, first as last, that I cherish a most
                  inveterate horror for the whole prologomena
                  family—prefaces, prologues, introductions, and explanations; and this, I feel in
                  duty bound to tell you before I proceed a step farther, has ever been my
                  unfortunate weakness since I went to study theology, five and twenty years ago, at
                  Louvain, under the celebrated Father Brenengo. He was the most
                  tedious man in coming to a point that ever shaped a syllogism. He often spent two
                  mortal hours laying down the state of the question, and found himself then just as
                  far from the difficulty as ever. Every thing having the slightest fibre of
                  connection with the subject was drawn in to complicate it. No chancery lawyer
                  could hold a candle to him in that respect. Old as I am now, Paul, and near as I
                  creep to the grave, the sound of that man's voice rings as distinctly in my ear as
                  when I last sat listening to it in Louvain. I never catch the noise of a spinning
                  wheel, or a moth ticking in the bed-post, but I hear Father Brenengo as plainly as
                  ever. He never tired; there was nothing of him to tire but bone and sinew, and
                  very little of that to spare either; but what did remain was brought by a practice
                  of forty years to work like machinery. Talking was no trouble to him—the words
                  rolled out from his thin lips like sounds from an automaton mandarin. On the
                  occasion, however, to which I would particularly refer, the question before the
                  class was the Sacrifice of Abraham, and the difficulty as usual in the Thomistic
                  distinction of the divine wills. Never did man speak as he spoke that day, laying
                  down his preliminaries, and yet never venturing within sight of the question at
                  issue. The class fell asleep, but, parum refert;
                  on he drove through it, shrugging his shoulders till you could almost hear the
                  friction of the bones, and rapping the desk all the while with his terrible
                  knuckles. For the first hour I bore it with patience; an hour and a half passed,
                  and still, though my nerves were considerably excited, I managed to control them
                  sufficiently to sit quiet. At last, however, I was overpowered by a sort of
                  delirium; my head grew dizzy, my breath came thick and short, like one after a
                  long race, and yelling like a maniac, I sprang at one bound across the desk, and
                  hurled a quarto volume of Bellarmine at the lecturer's venerable head. "Hold him!"
                  I cried; "hold him! stop him or he'll kill me, he'll murder me!" His squeaking
                  voice acting like a rasp on my nerves, hour after hour, drove me, in fact, to
                  desperation. Heaven forgive me, Paul, I could have cloven him that instant to the
                  brisket. One of my classmates laid hold of my collar to drag me back, but I flung
                  him from me as I would an infant, and rushing from the hall, fled down the
                  corridor, my long hair floating back on my collar, and my eyes leaping from their
                  sockets in my eagerness to escape. That act of mine, dear Paul, sealed my fate
                  forever. In the evening the physician called at my room, and politely ordered me
                  three tumblers of valerian to settle my nerves; next day the dean handed me forty
                  dollars to pay my travelling expenses to Buncrana, and a letter of explanation to
                  my worthy bishop; and in two hours after, just as the bells of the city rang out
                  the Angelus, I bid adieu to Louvain, Father Brenengo, and theology forever. Since
                  that unfortunate day, it's needless to tell you, I regard every thing in the shape
                  of introductions with indescribable horror. And where's the wonder? Have they not,
                  at one blow, annihilated all my cherished hopes, stripped me of stole and cassock,
                  driven me out a wanderer on the face of the earth, and consigned me at last to
                  isolation, snuff-taking, poverty, and a garret?
            
            
               Here the manuscript grows so shaky, owing, no doubt, to the increasing violence of
                  the rheumatism, as to be entirely illegible. It is generally supposed, however, by
                  his friends in Ireland most familiar with his handwriting, that the closing
                  sentences were meant for a humble apology to the public for having ever presumed
                  to occupy a moment of its valuable time, and especially for the many faults and
                  anachronisms in Mary Lee.
               The following note was found, some days after the editor's departure, in a corner
                  of the old black bag, and carefully forwarded to his address by the apple woman
                  above mentioned. In her very remarkable epistle enclosing the relic, she candidly
                  admits never having imagined for one moment that the "bit o' ritin" could be of any earthly use to any
                  body, and as for his "spirit" coming back in search of it, she hadn't the least
                  fear of that in the world; for the truth was, she didn't believe in ghosts
                  herself, nor one belonging to her; but still every body had a right to their own,
                  and besides, Mr. Pinkie being the strange kind of man he was, she didn't fancy
                  much retaining any part of his property in her possession, and would just sleep as
                  sound, perhaps, after clearing her skirts of him, bag and baggage. The note ran as
                  follows:—
            
            
               POSTSCRIPT.
               As my time draws near, I begin to feel more and more uneasy about the spot where
                  the strangers will lay my remains. Of course you'll laugh at me for this, Paul,
                  and no wonder either, for upon my word I never once thought I should feel so
                  particular about it. But it's only another proof, I suppose, that the poor body
                  must always be our greatest trouble even to the very last. And so I made some
                  inquiries about the burial ground this morning of Father Mahony's clerk. His
                  description, I assure you, is by no means satisfactory. He tells me there's not an
                  ivy wall, nor a mouldering ruin, nor an old hawthorn, nor in fact any other shred
                  of Christianity, to be seen in the place—what's more, there's not a fern to
                  shelter a grave, and even the grass of the field is as wiry and sparse as the hair
                  on my head. By all accounts, dear Paul, it's a very uncomfortable and
                  "unchristianable" place to be buried, and so I would take it as a great personal
                  favor, and one I'll not forget in the land I'm going to, if you could just manage
                  in some way to take my bones home with you to your own quiet lot, or, what would
                  please me a thousand times better, send them back to Ireland again by the first
                  trusty Innishowen man you hear of returning to Buncrana. But do as you will, bring
                  them or send them; I bequeath them to you.

                  rather below his Expectations.—Lanty Hanlon looks on, and indulges in most

               CHAPTER V. Mr. Weeks is introduced to Captain Tom Petersham, and is invited by
                  that Gentleman to spend a Day at Castle Gregory.—He also has the good Luck to

                  after all, and rather unsafe for Matrimonial Speculations 96
               
               CHAPTER VIII. Lanty acknowledges his Weakness for Fishing and Field Sports, but
                  thinks Father Brennan's Table nothing the worse for that.—Dr. Henshaw is suddenly
                  presented to the Reader, and Uncle Jerry discovered in the Bottom of a Boat,

               CHAPTER XIII. Dr. Henshaw's Pride is deeply wounded.—To be taken for a Burglar,

               CHAPTER I.
               
                  Introductory.
               
               DEAR reader, have the goodness to run your finger down the map of Ireland to its
                  northernmost point, or, if that be inconvenient, let your imagination run down
                  without it to the easternmost promontory of the County Donegal; you shall then
                  have transported yourself without trouble or expense, and in a manner suitable
                  enough for our purpose, to the spot where our story commences.
               It may happen, however, in this rambling age, that one day or other you would grow
                  tired of travelling by the map and hand-book, and make up your mind to quit the
                  fireside and see the world for yourself—preferring your own eyes to your
                  neighbors' spectacles. After a long tour through Europe you may yet, some fine
                  evening in August or September, find yourself standing on the pier of Leith or
                  Dunbarton heights, looking across the channel, and wishing you were in Ireland.
                  Don't resist the temptation, we pray thee, but leaving your national prejudices
                  behind you with your Scotch landlord, book yourself for Dublin, in the first
                  packet, and with a good conscience and an honest heart take a trip over the water,
                  and visit, were it only for a week, the land of poverty, gallantry, and song.
               If, however, you happen to be one of those very respectable young gentlemen who go
                  over to make pictures of Irish-life, with the view of being stared at and lionized
                  in village drawing rooms on their return—one of those extremely talented ented and promising young men, who voyage
                  in crowds every year, for a supply of Irish barbarisms and Romish
                  superstitions,—if you happen, we say, to be of that class, let us remind you, dear
                  reader, that the Mull of Cantyre is a dangerous sea, worse by all odds than the
                  Bay of Biscay. Don't venture through it by any means, but like a prudent young
                  man, finish your tour with Ben-Lomond and the Trossachs, and return home to the
                  States with as little delay as possible. As for the Irish peculiarities you would
                  go in quest of, they are now very scarce and difficult to procure—we mean fresh
                  ones, of course, for the old sets are bruised so much in the handling as to be
                  entirely valueless; even the manufacturers of the article, who made so jolly a
                  living on the simplicity of stripling tourists twenty years ago, are no longer in
                  existence. They have passed away as an effete race, and are now dead, gone, and
                  forgotten. Pictures of Irish life are indeed very difficult to dispose of, at
                  present, either to the pulpit, the Sunday newspapers, or even the Foreign
                  Benevolent Societies; unless they happen to be drawn by master hands. Such
                  pictures, for instance, as the "Priest and the Bottle," the "Fiddler and the
                  Beggars," the "Confessor and the Nun," have lost all point, since Mr. Thackeray's
                  visit to that country, and are now grown as stale and flat as small beer drippings
                  off a pot-house counter. Twenty years ago, however, the case was very different.
                  An Irishman then, in certain sections of the United States, was as great a wonder
                  as a Bengal tiger, or an Abyssinian elephant; and he felt so far below the
                  ordinary standard of humanity in those days, as to be considered unaccountable to
                  human laws. We have ourselves been assured on most excellent authority, that
                  certain ladies of Maine, even within the time mentioned, actually went as a
                  delegation to an unfortunate Irishman, who strayed into their neighborhood, and
                  set about manipulating his head all over, in order to ascertain, by personal
                  inspection, whether his horns grew on the fore or hind part of his cranium. The
                  manner of their reception, by the courteous and gallant barbarian, is still
                  related by some of the actors in the little melo-drama, and though quite
                  characteristic of his race, would hardly be accounted edifying in this simple
                  narrative. This much, however, we may venture to affirm, that since the event took
                  place, there has been but one opinion on the subject in that locality—that the
                  Irish wear no horns of any description whatever, either behind or before—are
                  endowed with the ordinary feelings and senses peculiar to the human family—and
                  exhibit arms and legs, hands and hair, precisely like their Norman and Anglo-Saxon
                  neighbors.
               But whilst they assimilate thus in all their physical developments, there are
                  still certain national peculiarities, which distinguish them from the people of
                  all other nations. In the first place, the brogue is very peculiar. It differs from that of the Scotch
                  Highlander, the Vermonter, and the German in what is called intensity of
                  accentuation—and it is very remarkable that this peculiar intensity of
                  accentuation is most striking when they speak on subjects in any way connected
                  with religion—the broad sound of the vowels, which they have still retained since
                  their old classic days, exhibiting a striking contrast with the reformed method of
                  pronunciation. The collocation of their words, too, sounding so strange to
                  unclassic ears, (though admirable in the Italian and French,) contributes perhaps
                  in some degree to aggravate the barbarism. But we must not venture on details, or
                  we should never have done; suffice it to say, that according to all accounts, and
                  particularly the accounts of American tourists, the Irish are, one and all, the
                  strangest people on the face of the earth. They never do any thing, we are told,
                  like other people. Whatever they put their hands to, from peeling a potato to
                  shooting a landlord, they have their own peculiar way of doing it. Whether they
                  eat or drink, walk or sleep, tie their shoes or pick their teeth, they are noted
                  for their wonderful originality. And it is not the people only, but, strange to
                     say, the very cows and horses in that
                  remarkable country, bellow and neigh quite differently from those of other
                  nations—the tone and style being quite unique, or, in other words, "peculiarly
                  Irish." It's but a few weeks ago since a certain Mr. Gustavus Theodore Simpkings,
                  of Boston, returned from Ireland with the startling discovery that hens laid their
                  eggs there in a manner quite different from that adopted by the hens of other
                  countries. We may be allowed also to add, by way of appendix to the fact, that in
                  consequence of the important nature of the discovery, a board of commissioners
                  will shortly be sent over to investigate the matter, in order that the poultry
                  fanciers of New England may take measures accordingly to promote the interests of
                  their excellent associations. Whether the country at large, however, will approve
                  this new method is still a disputed question. Our own opinion is, the New
                  Englanders will reject it, not solely because it's Irish, though that indeed would
                  seem reason sufficient, but rather on account of the danger of propagating Popery
                  in that peculiar way. We have heard of "treason" eggs, (Mr. O'Connell and Marcus
                  Costello were arrested over two pair of them in Horne's Coffee Room, Dublin, five
                  and twenty years ago avowing their guilt,) and if treason could be propagated in
                  that fashion, we ask, why not Popery?
               Now, after all this nicety to which certain things are carried, simply because
                  they are Irish, it is quite needless to say that the national peculiarities of
                  that people are all but exhausted, and consequently the young tourist fresh from
                  the counting-room can expect little there to requite him for the fatigue and
                  expense of such a journey.
               But, dear reader mine, if your heart be in the right place and above the reach of
                  paltry prejudice, if you be man enough to think for yourself, and instead of
                  viewing Ireland in print-shop and pantomime, look at her face to face with your
                  own honest eyes,—if you be determined to see things in their true colors and to
                  avoid the vulgar blunder of mistaking the Irish brogue for inveterate barbarism, and gold watch chains for genuine
                  civilization—if you be one of that stamp—then in Heaven's name step aboard as soon
                  as possible, for a crime it would be against your conscience to turn back within
                  sight of the green old Isle where Moore and Griffin "wept and sang."
               Once there, pass not hurriedly over it, for every inch is classic ground. Not a
                  mountain or valley from Cape Clear to the Giant's Causeway but has its old
                  tradition. If you ever read Banim or Morgan, Callinan or Griffin, ask the guide at
                  your elbow to point out, as you ride along, the scenes they describe and the
                  monuments they chronicle. If you ever listened to the songs of Moore, and felt the
                  sadness they inspire, stop for a moment and gaze on the venerable ruins to which
                  they are consecrated, and they will seem to you more sad and plaintive than ever.
                  You may not weep over those mouldering walls and ruined shrines, like the
                  returning exile revisiting once more the haunts of his boyhood, but still,
                  stranger as you are, the very sight of them will do you good; the tottering tower,
                  and the crumbling wall, and the holy well, and the broken cross, will bring you
                  salutary reflections—will teach you that every country, to deserve a place in the
                  record of nations, must have a past, and that, flourishing as the republic of
                  Washington is now, its whole history up to this hour would hardly cover a single
                  page in the future annals of the world.
               But, dear reader, whenever you ramble through the old place, forget not to visit
                  the scene of our story. It may not be so grand as the Alleghanies, nor so
                  picturesque as the Hudson; but it will repay you well, nevertheless, for your
                  trouble. Moreover, it lies directly in your way from the mountains of the west to
                  the famous Giant's Causeway—a wild, solitary spot to the east of those blue hills
                  that shelter the fertile valleys of Donegal from the storms of the Northern
                  Ocean.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER II.
               
                  Is in a slight Degree illustrative of Incidents in Irish Life.
               
               THE country between Fanit or Araheera lighthouse and the village of Rathmullen, on
                  the Lough Swilly, is an extremely wild and mountainous district, being indeed
                  little more than a succession of hills rising one above the other, and terminating
                  at last in the bald and towering scalp of Benraven. Standing on this elevated
                  spot, the traveller has a full view of the country for a distance of some twenty
                  miles around. Beyond Araheera Point appears Malin Head, the northern extremity of
                  the far-famed barony of Innishowen, running far out into the ocean, and heaving
                  back the billows in white foam, as they break against his dark and sulky form.
                  Westward looms up the majestic brow of Horn Head, under whose frown a thousand
                  vessels have perished, and close by its side the famous opening in the rock called
                  McSwine's Gun, thundering like the roar of a hundred cannon when the storm comes
                  in from the west. Between these two landmarks, standing out there like huge
                  sentinels guarding the coast, stretches the long white shore called Ballyhernam
                  Strand, and between that and Benraven, the beautiful quiet little sea of Mulroy,
                  with its countless islets lying under the long, deep shadows of the mountains.
                  Close by the broad base of the latter—so close indeed that you can hurl a stone
                  from the top into the water below—is the calm, quiet lake called Lough Ely, so
                  celebrated for its silvery char and golden trout. As the traveller looks down from
                  the summit of Benraven, there is hardly a sign of human habitation to be seen
                  below, if, indeed, we except the lighthouse itself, whose white tower rises just
                  visible over the heads of the lessening hills. But when he begins to descend and
                  pursue his way along the manor road, winding as it runs through the dark and deep
                  recesses of the mountains, many a comfortable little homestead suddenly meets his
                  view, and many a green meadow and wavy cornfield helps to relieve the barren and
                  desolate character of the surrounding scene.
               It was a fine evening in June, 185-; the sheep after browsing all day long, were
                  lying on the green, sunny slopes of the glens, and the hoodie crows, after their
                  rambling flight, sat dozing here and there on huge rocks by the road side, which
                  the winter torrents had detached from the mountains, when a man might be seen
                  wending his way slowly down the road towards Araheera lighthouse. He wore a short
                  jacket and trousers, somewhat sailor fashion, and kept his hands thrust into his
                  side pockets as he jogged along, whistling and singing by turns to keep himself
                  company. Still, though he looked at first not unlike a seafaring man, there was
                  that in his gait and general deportment which smacked too strongly of the hill
                  side, to mistake him for one accustomed to walk the deck of a ship, or even to ply
                  the oar in search of a livelihood. Moreover, he wore a rabbit skin cap jantily set
                  on the side of his head, and carried a stout blackthorn under his arm—both which
                  indicated clearly enough, that his habits of life were more landward grown than
                  his dress and near proximity to the sea might have at first suggested. But
                  whatever might have been his occupation in general, he appeared to have little to
                  engage him this evening, in particular, for he loitered long on his way, seemingly
                  quite disposed to take the world easy, and break no bones in his hurry to
                  accomplish his journey. More than once did he stop to clap his hands and gaze
                  after a hare startled from her form by his noisy approach, or fling a stone at a
                  hoodie crow dozing on the rocks. In this careless manner he jogged along whistling
                  and singing as the humor touched him. At first the words of his song were confused
                  by the echoes of the glens, but grew more distinct and intelligible as he
                  descended nearer to the shore, till at
                  length the following verse of a very popular ditty rang out clear and strong upon
                  the ear:— 
                     
                        "Och! the Sassanach villains—de'il tare them!—
                        They stripped us as bare as the 'poles;'
                        But there's one thing we just couldn't spare them—
                        The 'Kidug' that covers our souls.
                        Right folderolol, la la, di di,
                        Right fala la, lee," &c., &c.
                     
                  
               
               He sang this verse at least half a dozen times, at different intervals, and had
                  just commenced to sing it once more, when all of a sudden the song and the singer
                  came both to a full stop. Had a highwayman leaped from a hedge and held a pistol
                  to the traveller's head, he could not have halted more abruptly. In an instant he
                  stood still, gazing at something he saw round the angle of the road, and then
                  buttoning his jacket and clutching his blackthorn, made a step forward in a
                  belligerent attitude, as if an unlooked-for enemy had appeared and offered him
                  battle. And so it was. The antagonist he so suddenly encountered had taken his
                  position in the very middle of the road, and by his motions seemed resolved to
                  maintain that position at every hazard. The traveller, on the other hand, was by
                  no means slow to commence hostilities; for twirling his staff, without further
                  parley he struck his adversary such a blow on the sconce as might have been heard
                  ringing sharp and hard for half a mile and more along the echoing glen. That blow,
                  however, was his first and last; for the next instant he lay sprawling in the
                  dust, struck down by the superior force of his enemy's weapon. Still, though
                  prostrate, he parried off the blows of his assailant with remarkable adroitness,
                  and would, in all likelihood, have soon risen and fully avenged his fall, had not
                  a third party interfered to terminate the battle. The latter, roughly seizing the
                  staff from behind, commanded the fallen man to forbear, and then, in a milder and
                  more friendly voice, bade him get up on his feet, and not lie there, like a partaun.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               
                  Mr. Weeks tries his Hand at Fly-fishing, but finds the Sport rather below his
                     Expectations.—Lanty Hanlon looks on, and indulges in most indignant Criticisms
                     on Mr. Weeks's Manner of playing the Fish.
               
               "GET up, Lanty," said the new comer, "get up, man. Why, you must be ravin mad to
                  strike the poor witless crathur that way. Sure, it's only ould Nannie. Get up,
                  man!"
               "Nannie, or grannie!" ejaculated Lanty,—for so it seems the traveller was
                  named,—"Nannie or grannie," he cried, turning short and shaking himself free of
                  the speaker, "she's an ould limb o' Satan,—'the curse o' Cromwell on her!'"
               "Pooh! nonsense man! never mind her; it's only a way she has."
               "A way she has! bedad, thin it's a very oncivil way she has; let me tell you that.
                  The villanous ould schamer can't let any body pass without a quarrel. There's that
                  Methody preacher, she pounded almost to death last week,—one o' the civilest sowls
                  in the whole parish. What kind a thratement is that, I'd like to know, for any
                  dacent man to get; or is it neighborly in you, Else Curley, to keep such a baste
                  of a goat about yer place to murther people without rhyme or raisin?"
               "Musha thin, how can I help her, Lanty?"
               "Kill her if ye can't—hang her—shoot her—drown her—bad luck to her, she ought to
                  be shot long ago."
               "Och, as for that, she'll soon die, any way. It's failing fast she is, poor
                  thing."
               "Die!" repeated Lanty, brushing the dust off his clothes "die! she'll niver die,
                  and it's a mystery to me if iver she came into the world right at all."
               
               "Arrah, whist with yer nonsense," exclaimed Else, "and don't talk such
                  foolishness. Come away up to the house here, and take a draw iv the pipe if you
                  don't take any thing better."
               "I'll tell you what it is, Else Curley," continued the discomfited Lanty; "there's
                  not a man or woman in the town-land of Crowres but knows that my father was chased
                  by that same goat—that very identical ould rascal there, the year before he was
                  married, and that's jist thirty good years ago, and more by the same token, he
                  bears the marks of her horns on a part of his body to this day; and it's no great
                  secret either, Else, that she was every bit as ould then as she's now. It's not
                  even'n any thing bad to ye I am, Else, but one thing is sartin as the sun's in the
                  sky—that goat don't belong to this world."
               The old woman looked sharp at her companion, as if to read in his countenance his
                  real thoughts on a subject that concerned her so nearly, and about which she
                  lately heard so many unpleasant surmises, but she could gather nothing from his
                  looks. She saw he was excited by the fall, but she knew him also to be one of the
                  slyest rogues that ever put on a sober face—as full of deviltry as an egg was full
                  of meat; and she doubted, therefore, whether he meant to plague or offend her.
               "Lanty Hanlon," said she at last, "I don't know whether you spoke that word in
                  joke or in earnest; if ye spoke in joke I forgive ye, knowing well what ye are,
                  and yer father afore ye; but if ye spoke in earnest, I tell ye niver to say the
                  word again in my hearin', for if ye do, by the blessed Cairn above there, I'll be
                  revenged for it, dead or alive."
               "Pheugh!" exclaimed Lanty, when the old woman had finished, "by the powers o' war,
                  but you'd frighten a body out o' their wits this evening! What's the matter,
                  woman? or are you so easy vexed as that with an ould friend?" and he shook her
                  familiarly by the arm as he spoke, and pushed her on towards the cabin to which
                  she had just invited him. "If you want to quarrel with me, Else," he continued,
                  "you must take another day for it, as at present I'm engaged on particular
                  business. So up with you to the house there, and bring me out a coal to light my
                  pipe."
               Though Lanty spoke in banter, there was still something in the expression of his
                  face and tone of his voice that indicated misgivings of Else Curley after such a
                  show of indignation. Not that he suspected her, for a moment, of any secret
                  connection with the nether world, nor of keeping "Nannie" for any unholy purpose;
                  but nevertheless he was accustomed to hear strange reports about her, ever since
                  he remembered to hear any thing, and was taught to regard her as a woman above the
                  common, and one whose anger was to be propitiated at any sacrifice. Hence, if
                  Lanty had his doubts of Else, they were doubts rather of the woman than of her
                  acts, of her capacity to work mischief rather than of her actual guilt. In a word,
                  he never heard or saw aught of her but what was right and proper, and yet somehow
                  he always fancied she was "uncanny," and could be dangerous if she pleased.
                  Perhaps the sharp, thin features and large gray eyes of the tall, shrivelled old
                  creature, as she gazed steadily into Lanty's face, helped at that moment to
                  aggravate his suspicions. But be that as it may, he lost no time in trying to
                  conciliate her, and his experience had already taught him, that his usual
                  rollicking familiarity of manner would accomplish that end more effectually than
                  any formal apology he could offer.
               The house or cabin to which Lanty and his companion now directed their steps
                  (Nannie still following her mistress at a respectful distance) was built on the
                  southern side of a little green hill, called the "Cairn," named after a pile of
                  stones upon its summit, which tradition says were thrown there to mark the spot
                  where a priest had been murdered in the troublous times of Cromwell or
                  Elizabeth.
               From the top of this hill, which rises only a few rods above the roof of the cabin, a full view is had of the
                  lighthouse, and Lough Ely from its eastern to its western extremity. The lake, in
                  fact, at one of its bends touches the base of the hill, and thence stretches to
                  the lighthouse, a distance of little more than half a mile.
               "And now, Else, avourneen," began Lanty, taking his seat on a flag outside the
                  cabin door, (for the evening was warm,) "now that we settled that little
                  difference, how is Batt himself, and how does the world use him?"
               "Well, indeed then, we can't complain much as times go," responded Else, drawing
                  her stocking from her pocket, and beginning to knit in her usual slow, quiet way;
                  for she was old, and her hands trembled as she plied the needles. "As for Batt,
                  poor ould man, he's idle the most of his time, and barrin that he goes down to the
                  shore there of an evenin to ketch a trout or so for the supper, it's little else
                  he has to throuble him."
               "Still he gets an odd call now and then, I'll warrant," observed Lanty, knocking
                  the ashes from his pipe, and preparing to replenish it with fresh tobacco. "A man
                  like Batt Curley can't want a job long if there's any goin."
               "O, he gets his share, to be sure; but where's the benefit o' that, when there's
                  nothing to be made by it?"
               "Well, he makes a trifle over the price o' the tibakky and the dram any way; and
                  what more does he want? Fiddlin's now not what it used to be in ould times,
                  Else."
               "Indeed, thin, you may well say that," she replied, "when half a crown a weddin's
                  the highest he made this twelve-month. The Lord luck down on us, I don'na how poor
                  people can stan it at that rate."
               "It's mighty hard," assented Lanty, handing the old woman the pipe, after wiping
                  it on the breast of his jacket. "I mind the time myself when we cudn't shake a fut
                  at a weddin short of a shillin apiece to the fiddler. But sure the people's hearts
                  is broke out and out, Else—why, they haven't the courage to dance, even if they
                  had the mains."
               "It's not that, Lanty, acushla! it's not that, but their hearts is gone out in
                  thim althegither. They're not the same people they used to be at all at all.
                  Nothin shutes thim now sure but waltzin and pokin, and sailin over the flure like
                  so many childer playin cutche-cutchoo, and with no more spirit in thim than so
                  many puppets at a show."
               "Ledad, it's no wondher you say it, Else—it's disgraceful, so it is."
               "Disgraceful! No; but it's a scandal to the country, that's what it is. There's
                  big Jamie's daughter, of Drumfad, that was married last Thursday; and lo, and
                  behould ye, sir, when young Tom Connolly asked her out, she cudn't venture on a
                  reel or a country dance at all at all; O, no, no more than if she was born in the
                  skies; let alone at the hip of Graffey Mountain."
               "Musha, bad luck to her impudince," exclaimed Lanty; "isn't she cockin? and her
                  aunt beggin her bit and sup through the parish."
               "Feen a word o' lie in it thin. She turned up her nose at the Foxhunter's Jig and
                  the Rosses Batther, just as if she niver heard iv the like in her born life—and
                  nothin would do her, savin yer favor, but go skatin over the room like a doll on
                  stilts. Faith, it's well come up with the pack of thim."
               "And as for poor Batt," observed Lanty, "sich tunes are too new-fangled for his
                  ould fingers. He couldn't plaze her av course; O, no, he's too ould-fashioned for
                  that."
               "Plaze her! Ay indeed; after dancing in Derry City with her grand cousins, the
                  manti-makers. Plaze her! No, Pegeliny himself, the great Dublin fiddler, couldn't
                  plaze her. But it's the same all over the country; a man can't show a jug and
                  glass in his windy nowadays, but his girls take airs on thimsilves aqual to my
                  Lady Leitrem—all merchants' daughters, if you plaze;" and Else laughed a dry, hard
                  laugh, and gave the leg of her stocking another hitch under her arm.
               As she was yet speaking, a stranger passed down the road carrying a fishing rod in his hand, and stepping
                  over a low fence, made his way slowly to a narrow tongue of land that stretched
                  far out into Lough Elg, a spot much frequented by anglers, and particularly at
                  that season of the year. He was a man apparently about thirty years of age, and
                  wore a gray sporting frock, with cap and gaiters to match.
               "That's the strange gentleman," said Else, "that comes down here from Crohan to
                  fish so often."
               "I saw him before," replied Lanty; "and bedad, if he knows as little about the
                  gentleman as he does about the fisherman he's no great affair. I came across him
                  yesterday at Kindrum, and he cast his line, for all the world, like a smith
                  swinging a sledge hammer. Who is he?"
               "Indeed, thin, myself doesn't know, Lanty; but I'm tould he's come here from
                  furrin parts for the good of his health, and is some far out friend to the
                  Hardwrinkles of Crohan."
               "I wouldn't doubt it in the laste, for he's thin and sneaky, like the rest of the
                  breed. Still he may be a dacent man, after all that."
               "He's a quate, easy-spoken man, any way, whativer else he is."
               "And plenty o' money to spend, I'll bail ye."
               "In troth has he, and not a miser about it aither, Lanty."
               "Humph! I see you're acquent."
               "Och! ay, he draps in here sometimes when he comes a fishin."
               "And opens his purse when he goes out, eh, Else?"
               "O, thin, dear knows the gentleman id be welkim if he niver had a purse," replied
                  Else. "It's not for that, but the quate, motherate way he has. He comes in just
                  like a child, and looks as modest as a lady, and sits there chattin ithout a bit
                  pride in him more nor one of oursels."
               "Now d'ye tell me so? He's fond of a shanahas, I see, furriner and
                  all as he is."
               "Indeed, thin he's jist that same, Lanty; he's mighty fond intirely of say
                  stories, and likes to hear tell of the 'Saldana,' how she was wracked here below,
                  and the crew, how they were all buried in one grave in the ould churchyard in
                  Ramulla, and about Captain Pecnam's ghost, that used to be seen on moonlight
                  nights dressed all in white with a goolden sword by his side sittin on the Swilly
                  Rock. And thin he'll be sure to ask me something about Mr. Lee and his niece, and
                  who they are, and how they came here, and how long since, and so on, and so on,
                  till I'm a most tired of him myself sometimes."
               "Humph! Tired!" repeated Lanty; "bedad, thin he must run you mighty hard, Else,
                  for may I niver——"
               "Hould yer whist now," interrupted the old woman; "I don't want any iv yer side
                  wipes;" and she pushed him playfully away with her thin, skeleton hand.
               "Sure I didn't mane the laste offence in life," muttered Lanty, leering round at
                  his companion, and taking a smack from the pipe loud enough to be heard at the
                  road below; "no, but I was only jist saying that if the gentleman tired you out
                  talkin, why, he ought to be proud iv it, for after talkin six covenanter
                  ministers, besides a dancin master and two tailors, out iv yer house——"
               "Hould yer tongue now, I tell ye," exclaimed Else; "hould yer tongue, or I'll slap
                  ye in the face. Y'er niver aisy but whin yer at some divilmint. So, as I was
                  tellin ye, he wanted to know all about the light-keeper here and his niece, and
                  the wrack of the Saldana, though, bedad, he seems to know himself more about it
                  nor me. Why sure, Lanty, he tells me that Mr. Lee had a brother, or cousin, or
                  some very near frind lost in that same ship, for he niver was heerd tell of, livin
                  or dead, since the vessel sailed from Bristol; and more nor that, Lanty, he was a
                  high up officer, if you plaze, and a fine darin bould gentleman to boot."
               "Ha! see that now! Bedad, and it's only what I always thought myself of the same
                  Mr. Lee, since the first day I laid my eyes on him; for he has the look of a
                  gentleman in his very face, even if he
                     is only a light-keeper; and what's better nor all that, Else
                  Curley, he has the feelins of a gentleman in his heart."
               "Ha, ha—look!" exclaimed Else, laying one hand suddenly on Lanty's shoulder, and
                  pointing with the stocking in the other to the angler below; "ha, ha—he's in a
                  mighty pucker, poor man."
               "O, the bungler, the bungler!" exclaimed Lanty; "he's got his hooks tangled in the
                  weeds at the very first cast; look how he pulls! Why, it's a sin and a shame to
                  let him use such beautiful tackling in that lubberly way. But whist! see! by the
                  powers iv pewter, it's a trout he has, and a three pounder into the bargain—there
                  he jumps like a salmon! O, meel-a-murther! did iver mortal man see the like! He'll
                  smash every thing—bad scran to him, the omedhawn, why don't he give the fish fair
                  play—he pulls, for all the world, as if he'd a grampus on a jack line;" and the
                  speaker grew so indignant that he threatened to run down and snatch the rod from
                  the stranger's hands; but Else Curley counselled him to "take it aisy, and
                  interfere in nobody's business till he was asked; if the trout breaks the man's
                  gear," she added, "he has money enough to buy more."
               By this time the fish had run out the greater part of the line, and kept backing
                  and tugging with all its might, like a fettered partridge making a last effort to
                  escape on the approach of the snarer. The whole strength of the trout was made to
                  bear on the casting line; for the rod, instead of being held in a vertical
                  position, allowing its supple point to play up and down as the fish plunged, was,
                  on the contrary, grasped in both hands as horizontally as if he had caught a shark
                  with a boat hook, and was actually dragging it ashore by main strength.
               "The man's castin line," cried Lanty, "if he has any on at all, must be made of
                  fiddler's catgut, or it never could stand that usage."
               The trout, after thus endeavoring to shake itself free of the hook, now dived, and
                  making a desperate sheer, ran out the line apparently to its last turn on the
                  wheel; and Lanty felt full sure the trout had broken loose at last, and carried
                  flies and casting line away with him into the deep. But he was mistaken; for
                  hardly had the exhausted fish been down a moment, when he rose again, and
                  sputtered on the surface like a wounded water hen. At this instant an object came
                  suddenly into view which gave an entirely new feature to the scene. A little boat,
                  carrying a small, light sprit-sail as white as snow, shot round the point, and
                  passed within two fathoms' length of the angler before he perceived it.
               "Hilloa!" cried Lanty; "there goes Mary Lee. There she is in the stern sheets,
                  handling her cockle shell like a water spirit. And there goes Drake, too, sittin
                  in the bows, with his cold black nose over the gunwale."
               Old Else laid by her knitting and wiped her bleared eyes to look down at the
                  scene. "Musha, thin, may I niver do harm but that's jist the darling herself,
                  Lanty," she muttered; "there she is in her blue jacket and white straw hat, the
                  best and gentlest girl iver sailed on Ely water."
               Hardly had Else spoken, and raised up her fleshless hands to support her pointed
                  chin, that she might gaze down more steadily on the scene below, when Drake,
                  mistaking the sputtering fish for a wounded bird, sprang from the bows, seized it
                  by the back before his mistress could prevent him, and then, snapping both rod and
                  line at a single jerk, turned away from the confounded and astonished sportsman,
                  and swam after the boat, snuffing the air and wagging his tail in an ecstasy of
                  delight.
               "Well done, Drake," cried Lanty, starting up from his seat, and clapping his hands
                  in such glee that the pipe fell from his mouth unobserved, and broke in pieces at
                  his feet. "Well done, ould dog! well done, my gallant ould fellow—that's it,
                  Drake!—that's just what he deserves, the blundering gawkie, to abuse such a fish
                  in that way."
               
               The light breeze from the south-east had been gaining for the last half hour or
                  so, and now blew so fresh round the point that the little boat lay down almost
                  gunwale under, and swept past, before her fair pilot could bring her within
                  speaking distance of the stranger. Once she tried to jam her up to windward,
                  probably with the intention of apologizing for Drake's uncivil behavior; but the
                  little craft refused to obey, and then, waving her hand, she let her fall off
                  towards the opposite shore, and was soon lost sight of behind the point.
               All this took place in much less time than we have taken to describe it, the boat
                  appearing and disappearing as suddenly as a moving picture in a panorama.
               The bewildered stranger gazed after the fair occupant of the little boat as long
                  as she remained in sight, and then, peering stealthily round to see if any one had
                  witnessed his discomfiture, disjointed the remainder of his fishing rod, and
                  throwing it carelessly on his shoulder, walked away slowly and sadly from the
                  shore.
               "There he goes," said Lanty, buttoning his green jacket; "there he goes, sneaking
                  off like a fox from a hen roost. O, that he may niver come back, I pray! Begorra,
                  it's ducked he ought to be, if iver he has the assurance to cast a line in the
                  wather again. But I must be off myself to the lighthouse, and coax Mr. Lee for a
                  mallard wing for Uncle Jerry."
               "O, ay! to be sure, Uncle Jerry! there's no one like Uncle Jerry. E' thin may be
                  if the gentleman you're for ducking in the lough there was as free to you with his
                  purse as Uncle Jerry, he'd just be as great a favorite, every bit. But it's an
                  ould sayin and a true one, Lanty—Praise the fool as you find him."
               "Don't say that, Else Curley," replied Lanty, laying his hand on her shoulder, and
                  speaking more earnestly than usual,—"don't say that, for the heavens knows I
                  wouldn't give one kind word of Uncle Jerry's lips, or one kindly feeling of his
                  ginerous fine ould heart; for a million like him. And listen to me, Else Curley,
                  for I'm going to tell ye a secret. I know that man off an on for a month and
                  more,—not that I was iver much in his company; but I watched him, and watched him
                  too for a raisin o' my own,—and I tell you plainly, Else, if he opened his purse
                  to me ivery day in the year, and it full o' goold guineas, I cudn't feel it in my
                  heart to touch one o' thim."
               "Arrah, you cudn't, now!" responded Else, in a half-incredulous, half-jeering
                  tone. "By my word, it's mighty big spoken of you, Mr. Hanlon. E' thin might a body
                  make so bould as to ax yer raisins; faith, they must be powerful ones
                  intirely."
               "I have no particklar raisins," replied Lanty; "he niver did harm to me nor mine,
                  that I know of. But I don't like him. There's something wrong about him, and I
                  feel it somehow when I'm near him; there's a dark spot in him somewhere that the
                  bright light niver reached yit, Else."
               "Humph!" ejaculated the old woman, looking sharply at her companion; "you suspect
                  him of something?"
               "I do."
               "And what is it, Lanty?"
               "I can't tell; it's a mysthery to myself. But he has that in his eye that's not
                  lucky. What brings him down here so often, I'd like to know?"
               "Why, trout fishin, av coorse—what else?" replied his companion.
               "Pshaugh! nonsense, Else Curley; you can't run 'Donal' on me that way, cute and
                  all as ye are. That man don't care a brass farthin for the best fishin in Donegal,
                  from Onea River to Malin Head. I see it in his very motions. There's not a dhrap
                  o' sportman's blood in his body."
               "O, no! not a dhrap, because he don't go into the doldrums, like Uncle Jerry, at
                  every fin he sees rising above the water. Humph! pity but he wud."
               
               "The fish he's after don't live in wather, Else Curley, and you know it," said
                  Lanty, laying his finger on the old woman's shoulder, and whispering the words
                  into her ear.
               "Me!"
               "Ay, in troth, jist yourself, Else, and sorra much iv a parish wondher it id be
                  aither, some o' these days, if it turned out that he was trying to buy one Else
                  Curley o' the 'Cairn' to bait his hook for him into the bargain."
               The old woman endeavored to look astonished at the accusation, but there was a
                  faint smile in the corner of her mouth she could not entirely suppress. A stranger
                  would possibly have called it a contortion of the lips; but Lanty Hanlon was an
                  old acquaintance, and knew her better.
               "You needn't try to consale it, Else," replied Lanty, "for do yer best you cudn't
                  consale it from me. I know ye too well, ould woman. There's a sacret about that
                  man and the Lees, and no mortal in this neighborhood knows it but yerself."
               "A sacret! tut, you're dhramin," replied Else, turning away and laying her thumb
                  on the latch of the door; "a sacret, indeed! arrah, what in the wide world put
                  that in yer head?"
               "The fairies."
               "Indeed, then, Mr. Hanlon, one id think ye come from that same respectable stock
                  yerself, ye know so much more nor yer neighbors," retorted Else.
               "Well, good evenin, Else Curley. I must go, for I've business to do, and I find my
                  company's growin troublesome, besides. But take a word o' warnin before I start.
                  If yer bent on makin money out iv this stranger, and if he's willin to spend it on
                  you and yer sacrets, well and good; I'm content. But listen to me, Else. Make the
                     laste offer to thrifle wid a sartin person you know of,—say but a
                  wrong word,—breathe but a single bad breath, was it as low as the very
                  weasels,—and my hand on my conscience, Else Curley, from that minute I'll forget
                  that we were iver acquaint, and my vengeance will purshue ye till the clay covers
                  ye."
               "Why, the heavens presarve us, Lanty Hanlon; what d'ye mane? You cudn't think I'd
                  betray——"
               "Think!" repeated Lanty; "well, no matter what I think; I've said my say;" and
                  again wishing her fair thoughts and a pleasant evening, he turned from the
                  door.
               "Ah, the ould schamer," he muttered to himself, as he jerked his blackthorn under
                  his arm, and tossed his rabbit-skin cap on the side of his head once more, "the
                  ould schamer, she'd betray the pope if the bribe was big enough. And still she
                  loves her—av coorse she does—and small blame to her aither; for there's no
                  Christian crathur iver saw God's good light that shouldn't love her; and after
                  all, I b'lieve in my conscience she's the only livin thing, barring ould Nannie,
                  she iver did love before, in her life. But love her or hate her, there's one small
                  raisin she can't harm her, and that's just this—there's a sartain Misther Lanty
                  Hanlon, iv these parts, won't let her—even set in case she'd be wicked enough to
                  thry it. So, rattle away, Lanty; the world's big enough for ye—ay, and good
                  enough, too, ye thief, if ye only go through it as ye ought, with a stout heart
                  and an honest conscience. Don't fear, my boy; ye have neither house or land, cow
                  or calf, penny or purse, and who cares!—ye have clothes on yer back, strength in
                  yer arm, a heart without spot or flaw in it, and wid the blessin o' God to back
                  ye, what more d'ye want? So, dance away, Lanty, and as ye hop through the figures,
                  don't forget to keep your eye on the fiddler;" and thus the reckless,
                  light-hearted fellow tripped along the glen, still singing the old ditty as he
                  went:— 
                     
                        "The Sassanach villains—de'il tare them!—
                        They stripped us as bare as the 'poles;'
                        But there's one thing we just couldn't spare them—
                        The 'Kidug' that covers our souls.
                        Right fol de lol ol," &c.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IV.
               
                  Lanty's Propensities.—Weeks introduces himself into the Lighthouse.—Finds the
                     Keeper engaged shooting Holland Hawks.—Takes a Crack at one himself.—Assures
                     the Keeper Yankee Boys can hit Swallows with a Rifle Ball.—Recommends the
                     Importation of Yankee Lecturers to smarten the Irish Nation.
               
               IT wanted still two hours of sunset, when Lanty Hanlon left the lighthouse with
                  the mallard wing in his pocket for Uncle Jerry. His pace was now more hurried and
                  purpose-like than when last seen wending his way through the dark glens. His song
                  too had entirely ceased, and he held his blackthorn staff no longer carelessly
                  under his arm, but grasped it firmly in his hand, like a traveller resolved to let
                  no grass grow under his feet till he had accomplished his journey.
               On passing the road below Else Curley's cabin, however, he looked up to see if the
                  old woman was in sight, that he might make her a sign of friendly recognition; or
                  perhaps it was a wholesome dread of a second unceremonious visit from Nannie, that
                  made him turn his eyes in that direction. Be that as it may, neither Nannie nor
                  her mistress could be seen, but in their stead, and much to Lanty's surprise,
                  appeared the tall figure of the stranger, issuing from the door of the little mud
                  cabin, and making his way down the hill in the direction of the light house. Lanty
                  stopped suddenly, not well knowing what to think of this. He had seen the
                  stranger, a full half hour before, quitting Lough Ely, and setting off towards
                  Crohan, and naturally concluded he was by that time far on his way home. A
                  moment's reflection, however, convinced him that the man must have hid himself
                  behind some rock or hillock, and waited there till he could venture up unobserved,
                  to pay his usual visit to Else Curley. This manœuvring was by no means
                  satisfactory to Lanty; on the contrary, it served greatly to confirm the bad
                  opinion he had begun to entertain of his purpose in hovering so constantly about
                  Araheera Point. Lanty Hanlon was not a man remarkable for an extra amount of
                  shrewdness—it was the very reverse with him; shrewdness was not an ingredient to
                  mix with the mercury of his nature at all. But the stranger's conduct was so
                  palpably suspicious, that he could not for an instant resist the idea of some plot
                  between him and Else Curley. In the first place, the man had been only two days in
                  the country when he found the old woman out—nay, went as straight to her cabin as
                  if he had been sent there on a message, and since that time visited her every day,
                  remaining with her often whole hours together. As for his pretext of fishing, it
                  was the flimsiest in the world; for no one who saw him cast a line in water could
                  ever imagine he cared a gray groat for the pleasure it afforded. Then his close
                  and frequent inquiries about the Lees, and his knowledge of certain private
                  affairs of the family, already communicated to Else Curley,—these, we say, put
                  together, were clearly suggestive of some secret purpose on his part, and quite
                  enough to raise suspicion in minds far less constructive than Lanty Hanlon's.
                  Besides, Mr. Lee was himself a stranger in the place, having resided but eighteen
                  months at the lighthouse, and during that time had seen but little company. The
                  peasantry of the neighborhood, indeed, looked upon him at first as one who
                  disliked society, preferring a quiet life at home to making and receiving visits.
                  Hence they seldom troubled him, except on matters of business, and then only as
                  little as possible. To be sure, the officers of the ballast board called on him
                  three or four times a year, but that was on their tours of inspection round the
                  coast; and Father John was seen, too, sometimes trotting down in that direction
                  with his saddle-bags bobbing behind him;
                  but Mr. Lee was a Catholic, and Father John was the priest of the parish. All this
                  was very natural. But it soon began to be whispered about that Captain Petersham,
                  of Castle Gregory, was seen occasionally stepping ashore at the point when out
                  yachting on Lough Swilly, and, what looked stranger still, taking Miss Lee with
                  him up the lough to visit his sister. This latter circumstance led the good
                  people, by degrees, to regard Mr. Lee as somewhat above the rank of a common
                  light-keeper, for Tom Petersham was the crack gentleman of the county, and (though
                  somewhat reduced himself) always felt a peg or two above associating with the
                  squires and newly-fledged baronets of the district. So they concluded, after
                  various speculations and gossip on the matter, that Mr. Lee must have been once a
                  real gentleman, whom reverse of fortune had obliged to accept his present humble
                  situation as a last resource. And so they continued ever after to regard him,
                  saluting him with every mark of respect when they happened to meet about the
                  lighthouse, and never presuming to intrude on his privacy except to settle their
                  little business transactions, or when he chose to employ their services about the
                  lighthouse yard.
               Now, Lanty Hanlon saw all this long ago, and regulated his intercourse with the
                  family to suit the case precisely. He asked no questions, made no apologies, came
                  and went just as he pleased; and yet, as he often was heard to say himself, knew
                  as little about Mr. Lee, or his private affairs, as the blackest stranger in the
                  kingdom!
               Young, active, and fond of recreation, Lanty always found Araheera Head a capital
                  spot to indulge in his favorite pastime of gunning and fishing, and shortly after
                  Mr. Lee's arrival found that gentleman quite as fond of the sport as himself. And
                  thus an intimacy grew up between them all at once—an intimacy, by the way, which
                  each felt it his interest to cultivate; Lanty for the sake of the light-keeper's
                  influence with the neighboring gentry, in whose power he often unfortunately found
                  himself, and the light-keeper for the sake of Lanty's skill as a sportsman, in his
                  frequent excursions on Lough Swilly. Besides, Lanty kept a pair of black
                  greyhounds, the best ever ran on four feet, and the terror of all the game-keepers
                  in the three baronies. These enabled him to supply his friend with "hare's ear"
                  for his flies, and if the truth must be told, with haunches for his table too,
                  occasionally, without troubling his conscience greatly about the infraction of the
                  game laws. Then he was moreover an excellent shot with either rifle or birding
                  piece, and could bag a brace of grouse or wild ducks on sea-side or mountain as
                  prettily as the best landlord's son in the parish—always remembering to reserve
                  the wings for Mr. Lee's and Uncle Jerry's fly hooks. Sometimes, too, the
                  light-keeper would find a white trout for breakfast of a morning, or a salmon for
                  dinner, without any distinct recollection of having caught them himself, or bought
                  them from any particular fish-hawker of the neighborhood. For reasons such as
                  these, and others quite unnecessary to mention, Lanty soon became a constant and
                  welcome visitor at Araheera Head, and indeed finally grew to be so special a
                  favorite with the light-keeper that he could hardly prevail on himself to take his
                  boat or his gun without Lanty at his elbow. He even offered him a salary larger
                  than his limited means could well afford, to live with him altogether; but, Lanty
                  invariably refused, preferring a free foot on the hill side after his dogs, and a
                  ramble on the sea shore with his rifle, to all the inducements he could offer.
                  These rambles, however, often brought him into trouble; but if they did, he always
                  depended on Mr. Lee to get him out of it. On such occasions the honest
                  light-keeper would bluster and swear as stoutly as a Dutch burgomaster never to
                  speak another word in the villain's behalf, should it save him from the gallows,
                  and often even went so far as to order the members of his family never to let the
                  scoundrel inside his doors again; but somehow or other these resolutions tions never held out—all his indignation
                  seemed to vanish in his sleep; and before the sun got up on the following morning,
                  he was sure to despatch a note to Tom Petersham, or some other gentleman of the
                  neighborhood, to beg their interest in the unfortunate fellow's behalf. Lanty, in
                  fact, was never out of scrapes for a week together since Mr. Lee first saw him. He
                  had either fallen foul of a bailiff, or beaten a policeman, or cudgelled a game
                  keeper, or spread a salmon by torchlight, or stole a game cock, or—something was
                  always sure to be wrong, whenever he was absent three days at a time from Araheera
                  lighthouse.
               Intimate, however, as Lanty was with the family, he knew nothing of their history
                  save what he picked up from an odd word dropped now and then between Mary Lee and
                  the light-keeper, or between himself and old Roger O'Shaughnessy, when they went
                  up the tower of an evening to chat and trim the lamps together. What he learned
                  from the latter, however, was never very satisfactory, for Roger considered
                  himself too respectable and important a personage to hold much confidential
                  intercourse with a light-headed scatterbrain like Lanty Hanlon. But whilst Roger
                  said little of the family connections directly, he indulged frequently in little
                  sneers at the pretensions of the Donegal aristocracy, wondered where in the world
                  they found the arms on their carriage panels, and if they didn't one and all
                  inherit their gentle blood from "Shemus Sallagh" or Oliver Cromwell. This
                  contemptuous way of speaking about his neighbors was plain enough, and Lanty
                  understood it. The nobler families of the south was a subject on which Roger loved
                  very much to descant in a sort of soliloquial tone, when he sat down of a summer's
                  evening in the lantern to burnish up the reflectors with Lanty at his side. Many a
                  long sigh would he draw, talking over the olden times, when real lords and ladies
                  used to throng the halls of a certain castle in the south (surrounded by their
                  servants in splendid liveries) to drink the choicest wines or dance to the music
                  of the old family harp; and if his companion ventured to inquire the name of the
                  castle or of its owner, little information would he get from Roger O'Shaughnessy.
                  Still, studiously averse as Roger was to the revelation of family secrets, he
                  could not hide from his quick-witted companion the conclusion warranted by his
                  frequent though indirect allusions. Besides, Roger always wore a curious
                  old-fashioned coat when serving dinner, which contributed more, perhaps, than any
                  thing else to enlighten Lanty as to the antecedents of the family. This coat was
                  once a bottle-green of fine texture, as might be seen by those shady little
                  corners here and there, where the sun had not been able to peep, nor the wear and
                  tear of half a century entirely to reach. With a few redeeming spots like these,
                  however, excepted, the rest of the garment was faded, threadbare, and polished as
                  the cuff of a sailor's jacket. The high, stiff collar, the buff facings, and the
                  long tails would have plainly showed it had once been livery, even if the two
                  lonely gilt buttons on the high waist behind, bearing the family crest, had been
                  lost and gone with the rest of the brotherhood. Every day, before the little bell
                  rang for dinner, did Roger divest himself of his working dress, brush over the few
                  white hairs that still remained to cover his polished scalp, and then put on his
                  bottle-green livery with as much care and tenderness as if it had been wove of
                  spider's web. Poor Roger! many a scold he got from Mr. Lee for keeping up his
                  ridiculous old notions, and many a laugh had Mr. Petersham at his profound
                  salutations, when he came to visit the family; but laugh or scold, it was the same
                  to Roger: on he went, practising the same old habits, despite every
                  remonstrance.
               This obscurity in which the history of the Lees was involved, coupled with the
                  mysterious conduct of the stranger, led Lanty Hanlon to suspect some deep plotting
                  between him and Else Curley. As for the latter, he had little fear she would take
                  part in any thing directly tending to bring misfortune tune on the light-keeper or his family; but still
                  she might meddle so far with the danger as to bring them into trouble without
                  actually intending it,—and all for the sake of gold, to obtain which he supposed
                  the miserly old creature was prepared to run any risk, even that of her salvation.
                  "Hooh!" he muttered, "for that matther, she'd go to the de'il's door and singe her
                  ould beard at the key hole to earn a sixpence; and as for you, my
                  augeuaugh," he continued, gazing after the retreating figure of the stranger,
                  "ye've the cut of a schamer about ye, any way. Be all that's bad, I niver saw ye
                  with a fishin rod in yer hand yet, but ye put me in mind iv one i' them big long
                  nosed cranes down there standing up to their knees in the wather, watchin round
                  for the little innocent shiners to make a pounce on them. F'eth, may be it's some
                  sworn inemy i' the family ye are, keeping their thrail all the time since they
                  left the south; or may be its a sheriff's officer ye'd be in purshuit of an ould
                  debt; or, by jaminy king, who knows but yer some discarded sweetheart sneakin
                  afther Mary Lee. If yer that, I'd advise ye lave the country or buy yer coffin.
                  But whatsomever ye are, yer a chate any way, that's sartin; and so, may sweet bad
                  luck attind ye, achushla, and that's my prayer for ye, night and
                  mornin, sleepin and wakin;" and Lanty shook his fist at the stranger as he
                  disappeared over the brow of the hill, "and since ould Else has tuck ye in tow,"
                  he concluded, spitting on his stick and again heading for the mountains, "I'll
                  just stand by and look on; but one thing I'll be bould to tell ye both, cute and
                  all as ye are, that by the powers o' pewther ye'll have to rise early and thravel
                  fast if ye hope to get the blind side iv one Lanty Hanlon."
               Leaving Lanty to pursue his journey across Benraven, we return to the stranger.
                  After examining for some time the structure of the narrow iron bridge over the
                  chasm called the "Devil's Gulsh," he raised the latch of the gate, and finding it
                  unlocked, pushed it open. The light-keeper's lodge, facing him directly as he
                  entered, was a long low cottage fronting full on the sea. The light tower rose up
                  close by its side, with its great round lantern on top, to the height of a hundred
                  and fifty feet from the rock, as smooth and white as marble. The doors, walls, and
                  window sashes of the lodge were also white and clean as human hands could make
                  them; even the black stone steps by which he ascended to the hall door shone
                  bright and spotless as polished ebony. The place, however, notwithstanding the
                  care and trouble it cost, looked still and deserted. For full ten minutes the
                  stranger stood in front of the house gazing round him, and yet no one came to bid
                  him welcome. A little white bantam on the grass plot before the door, scraping up
                  the greensward and calling his family round him, was the only sign of life to be
                  seen. In such a remote spot he naturally hoped the presence of a stranger in his
                  garb would draw some one from the house; but he was mistaken. At length, tired of
                  waiting, he advanced to the door and knocked; still there was no answer: he
                  knocked again, and yet no one came. Then turning the handle and opening the door,
                  he stepped over the threshold, and found himself all at once in a long passage or
                  entrance hall. On either side of this hall hung several spears and fowling pieces,
                  here and there, fishing rods resting in brass sockets against the wall, and
                  suspended from the ceiling, half a dozen or more reels of jack lines, with hooks
                  and leads attached, ready for use. It was evident from their superior quality, and
                  the excellent condition in which they were kept, these articles were used more for
                  amusement than profit. Beyond, however, and near the opposite extremity of the
                  passage, hung two light oars of beautiful finish, and close beside them a small
                  sail of Russia duck, with its little sheet coiled carefully round it, and, if one
                  might judge from its appearance, but recently used. The stranger seemed to notice
                  this last-mentioned article with special interest; and the cold smile that
                  overspread his long face as he looked at it plainly showed he knew well by
                     whose delicate fingers it was handled
                  last. Proceeding along the hall like a connoisseur in a picture gallery, he came
                  at last to an open door opening into a spacious parlor, and entering without
                  further ceremony, sat down on the first chair he saw, and carelessly throwing up
                  his feet on the seat of another, began to gaze about him, like a man quite
                  resolved to await the coming of some one, should he wait till morning.
               About this apartment, in which the stranger now found himself seated all alone,
                  there was a general air of comfort and taste, which at once suggested the idea of
                  a lady mistress far above what he might expect to find at a light-keeper's lodge,
                  and especially at so remote a point as Araheera Head. Nevertheless, though the
                  room looked comfortable, and every thing arranged in excellent taste, there was
                  still nothing in it either new or fashionable. Massive picture frames with grim
                  looking faces in the background hung here and there round the apartment; but their
                  rich gilding was gone, and their edges, stripped and black, made sad contrast with
                  the newly-painted walls. The harpsichord in the corner had lost its silver
                  handles, by which in olden times it was so often drawn out into the merry circle,
                  and the ancient clock opposite, now silent as a tombstone, glared over at its once
                  light-hearted companion with a melancholy expression of countenance. They had,
                  doubtless, been friends together for many a year, and in their early days had oft
                  conversed pleasantly from opposite corners—each after his own fashion. But age,
                  alas! had now left his mark on both. The clock's open good natured face was
                  bleared and wrinkled, so much sc indeed that its early associates could scarcely
                  have recognized it; and the harpsichord's once burnished case had lost all its
                  polish, and its edges were stripped and lean, like the elbows of an old coat.
                  Still, though both were broken down and somewhat shabby, they were clean and
                  decent, like old gentlemen who had seen better days. And there, too, near the
                  fireplace, was the high-backed sofa with its heavily-carved feet and double rows
                  of brass nails along the edges. But conspicuous above all appeared the old family
                  Bible lying in state upon the centre table, under its vellum cover and iron
                  clasps. Every thing in the room spoke eloquently of the past, for every thing
                  looked ancient and venerable, even to the bird cage over the window, where the
                  gray linnet sat dozing with his head under his wing.
               That apartment, dear reader, was an epitome of the history of Ireland, and might
                  have furnished materials for a finer allegorical picture than ever Claude Lorraine
                  drew—her heroes without a name or monument save those poor rotting shreds of
                  canvas—the fire of her music dying out day by day, nay—alas that we should say
                  it!—almost as cold and dead as the blackened embers on her desolate shrines—her
                  once brave and stalwart sons now wrapping their emaciated limbs in their tattered
                  garments and resigning themselves, without a struggle, to serfdom and the grave.
                  Had the author of the "Giaour," who could see even in the fair but lifeless form
                  of woman the picture of "Greece, but living Greece no more,"—had he lived to sit
                  there and gaze around him, how much more sublime the inspiration he had drawn from
                  those sad, crumbling relics! Yes, the nation was still living, but all her
                  glories, save the glory of her faith, had departed.
               But the stranger's heart was not one of that mould. On the contrary, he scanned
                  every article of furniture in the room with a cold, prying curiosity, that
                  accorded ill with the fashionable sporting dress he wore, and having at last
                  completed his survey, drew his chair to the centre table, and opened the sacred
                  volume.
               Had he been a lover of old books, he might have paused to examine the title page
                  before he proceeded farther, and the curiously illuminated letters it exhibited,
                  but especially an ancient and copious note in the margin purporting to show that
                  the book was printed at Madrid in the year 1467, by a native of Mentz, at royal
                  request—a fact which might have greatly
                  surprised those French and German littérateurs
                  who claim for Louis XIV. and Frederic II. the honor of having been the only
                  patrons of the art before that period. But the gentleman was either not of that
                  class, or ignorant of the Latin tongue, in which it was printed, for he ran his
                  eye hastily over the page, without seeming to notice either date or language.
               Without pausing a moment, he turned over leaf after leaf, glancing merely at the
                  top and bottom of the pages, and evidently in search of something he understood
                  was to be found there. He spent some five or six minutes in this search, and at
                  last, having discovered what he sought, drew from his breast pocket a small book
                  of tablets, copied what items he thought necessary, and then, hastily closing the
                  Bible, (stealthily watching the doors of the apartment all the while,) clasped it
                  as before.
               It happened in replacing the book he dropped something on the floor, and instantly
                  picking it up, found it to be a silver beaded rosary, with a gold crucifix
                  attached, and of exquisite workmanship. The image was of the purest gold, the
                  nails in the hands and feet were diamonds of great brilliancy, and the cross, on
                  which the figure hung, ivory inlaid with some precious metal, and bordered with
                  small but costly pearls. It was evidently the relic of some pious ancestor, for
                  the beads were much worn, and the edges of the cross had lost their original
                  sharpness, and grown round and smooth from the wear and tear of years. It was
                  curious to see how the stranger smiled as he held up the sacred trinket between
                  his finger and thumb. A child could have read in his countenance how little he
                  respected either the image or the reality—the cross or the crucified. Whilst
                  engaged, however, in this contemptuous inspection of the venerable and precious
                  relic,—the sneer on his face growing deeper as he gazed,—he was startled by a
                  shadow suddenly darkening the window, and turning to see what it was, beheld the
                  same countenance which smiled on him from the stern of the little boat an hour
                  before, peeping through the glass. The face was so close to the window that the
                  stranger might have seen, from its peculiar expression, he had been mistaken for
                  some familiar friend, whose visit had been expected. The side light troubled her
                  so much at first that she could see nothing distinctly in the room, and raising
                  both hands to shade it off, happened to throw back the broad brimmed hat she wore,
                  and thus revealed in full view to the stranger, now advanced within arm's length
                  of the window, a countenance of extraordinary beauty. But there was little leisure
                  left him to gaze upon it—for in another second the laughing girl had discovered
                  her mistake, and startled by the close proximity of a man so utterly unknown to
                  her, and trembling with shame and confusion at her apparent levity, bounded back
                  as if a spectre had confronted her, and flew away from the window like an
                  affrighted bird.
               The stranger called to her to stop and listen to his apology; he knocked on the
                  glass, and even attempted to raise the sash and follow her; but all was in vain:
                  away she ran over the green lawn, her tresses streaming back on the gentle breeze,
                  and disappeared over the edge of the precipice. For an instant the disappointed
                  sportsman stood spell-bound, hardly able to tell whether the form was a vision or
                  a reality. And no wonder. Her figure so light and airy, her extreme grace of
                  motion even in the confusion and hurry of her flight, and the exquisite beauty of
                  her modest face, might well indeed have raised such an illusion in minds far more
                  philosophic than the stranger's.
               And now again all was still as before; not a sound was to be heard but the sullen
                  break of the sluggish wave against the rocks, or the occasional call of the little
                  proud bantam still scraping on the green.
               The sun had sunk by this time within an hour of his setting, and crowned the
                  far-off summit of Benraven with his golden light. The sky was cloudless, and the
                  air as balmy as the zephyrs that play round the base of the Himalayas and fan the banks of the ancient Hydaspes.
                  Stealing out from under the shadows of the island appeared the white sails of the
                  coasting vessels, with scarce wind enough to give them motion,—so calm had it
                  grown for the last hour; and away beyond them in the west rose the dark form of
                  the Horn, round whose top the wings of countless sea birds might be seen wheeling
                  and glinting in the rays of the setting sun. The scene was as grand and
                  picturesque as one might care to look upon, and yet it seemed to awaken but little
                  interest in the stranger. Indeed, the sullen look of disappointment on his face,
                  as he gazed through the window on the world without, showed but slight relish for
                  the poetry of nature. At last, turning away abruptly from the casement when he saw
                  there was no likelihood of the young lady returning, he retraced his steps to the
                  hall door, and was just about to follow the visionary form to the edge of the
                  rock, when, to his great relief, he heard the sharp crack of a rifle, within
                  twenty paces of where he stood. Looking in the direction of the sound, he saw
                  smoke curling slowly up from the sea; then a water spaniel sprang on the bank, and
                  began to shake the brine from his dripping sides; and finally a man in a pea
                  jacket, with his pantaloons rolled up over the tops of his boots, and a gun in his
                  hand, suddenly made his appearance. He was apparently about fifty years of age,
                  stout and hearty looking, and carried in his face, as he approached the stranger,
                  a look of welcome which it was impossible for a moment to mistake.
               "Good evening, sir," said he, touching his hat to his visitor, hardly able to
                  utter the words, so exhausted was he in climbing up the rock.
               The stranger slowly introduced his arms under his coat tails, and made a grave and
                  respectful inclination of his head.
               "Sorry you found no one in the house to bid you welcome," said the stout
                  gentleman, wiping the perspiration from his face.
               "Rayther think the apology should come the other way," replied the stranger,
                  drawling out his words.
               "O, don't mind that, sir; when you found nobody in the house, you did perfectly
                  right to make yourself as much at home as possible."
               "Mr. Lee, I presume—the gentleman here in charge?"
               "The same, sir, and quite at your service—that is, as soon as I can manage to
                  catch breath again. Heigh-ho! By George, I haven't gone through as much these ten
                  years before. That confounded Holland hawk has the nine lives of a cat—and—and I
                  verily believe a few to spare besides. Pheugh! heugh!"
               "Been gunning, I perceive."
               "Yes; fired fourteen balls—nine of them clean into his body, and there he is, yet,
                  sound as ever."
               "Well, now, that's rayther uncommon—ain't it?" said the stranger, without moving
                  an inch from his position; "should think one was enough."
               "The bird's not natural, sir," replied Mr. Lee; "that's the best explanation I can
                  give."
               "Just so," said the stranger, nodding a stinted assent—"not natural."
               "Besides," added Mr. Lee, "though he looks large in the water, the fellow is
                  really as light as a feather. I believe in my soul, sir, you can no more pierce
                  that bird with a ball than you can a piece of floating corkwood."
               "Can't, eh?"
               "No, sir, it's impossible. I'm living here eighteen months, or thereabouts, and
                  during that time I can safely say I wasted more powder on him than would blow up
                  the tower."
               "Well, look here, why not snare him?"
               "Snare him!"
               "Why, yes, trap him by night, since you can't shoot him by day."
               "O, tut, tut! no, sir, the bird's game. Moreover, you might as well try to snare a
                  fox in a market place."
               "Well, take him flying, and meet him with the ball," said the stranger, now thrusting his hands
                  deep into his breeches pockets, and hitching up his cap behind with the collar of
                  his coat; "seen swallows killed that way."
               "What, swallows with a ball?"
               "Yes, sir; boys can do it in the section of the country I was raised in."
               The light-keeper turned a sharp, searching eye on the stranger, and scanned him
                  from head to foot without saying a syllable in reply. The last word sounded odd to
                  his ear. In fact, it suggested a sort of vegetable idea, and the figure of the man
                  who uttered it helped to give that idea, ridiculous as it was, something of a
                  specific form. Or, rather, his tall, lithe figure, freckled face, and long,
                  straight, sandy hair, made up a parsnip kind of personality that tickled the
                  light-keeper's fancy very much, and made him laugh.
               "Well," said the stranger, mistaking the laugh, "it requires considerable
                  experience, I allow; but still our boys can do it, and as to that creetur there, I
                  guess I can hit him flying myself."
               "Flying! ha! ha! My dear sir, the bird never flies."
               "He's got wings—hain't he?"
               "Can't certify as to that," responded the light-keeper; "never saw any, at
                  least—and what's still more remarkable, he never quits this shore."
               "Why, you don't mean that there particular bird, do you?"
               "That identical bird, sir."
               "He's got a mate, I reckon, and goes off once in a while—don't he?"
               "No, sir, he has no mate—never had any."
               "Excuse, me," said the stranger, attempting a smile; "I'm not long in this section
                  of the world, I allow, but I guess I've been raised too near one Phineas Barnum,
                  you might hear of, to believe such a story as that;" and the speaker thrust his
                  hands down lower still into his pockets, and looked knowingly at the
                  light-keeper.
               "I know nothing of Phineas Barnum," responded Mr. Lee, grounding his rifle and
                  resting on the muzzle, "but I repeat to you, nevertheless, that the bird you see
                  floating on the water there before your eyes has never been out of this bay for
                  the last eighteen months, and during that time was never seen in any other
                  creature's company, man, bird, or beast."
               "Shoh! you don't say so—summer or winter? Why, I rayther think that's
                  impossible—ain't it?"
               "Summer and winter are all the same to him," replied the light-keeper. "I have
                  seen him in January, when the storm threatened to blow the lantern off the tower,
                  and the sea to wash this little island and all it contains into the deep,—I have
                  seen him at such times sitting as calm and composed on the swells of the sea as a
                  Turk on an ottoman smoking his pipe. He's the sauciest villain that ever swam,
                  sir—look at him now beyond the boat there—see how the rascal comes sailing up to
                  us like a swan, with his arched neck and look of proud defiance."
               "Is the piece loaded?" inquired the stranger, in a quiet, modest tone of
                  voice.
               "No, sir; load to suit yourself; there's the gun, and here's the powder and ball.
                  By George, if you kill him, I'll say you're the best marksman in Donegal."
               "My name is Weeks," said the stranger, slowly drawing the ramrod—"Mr. Ephraim
                  Weeks."
               "Weeks," repeated the light-keeper; "rather a scarce name in this part of the
                  world."
               "Well, yes; I guess so—Ephraim C. B. Weeks," he added; "Mr. Robert Hardwrinkle of
                  Crohan's my cousin, sir. You're acquainted less or more with the family, I
                  presume."
               "Have heard of them, sir; and quite a respectable family they are, by all
                  accounts."
               "Well, yes; pretty much so, I reckon, for this part of the country—should be happy to see you at Crohan, Mr.
                  Lee, whenever you've a leisure hour to spend. My cousins often wonder you hain't
                  called and brought Miss Lee with you of an evening."
               "Your cousins are said to be very pious, and of high literary acquirements,"
                  observed Mr. Lee, not appearing to value over-much the invitation so unexpectedly
                  and patronizingly tendered, "and I fear quite out of Miss Lee's sphere and mine.
                  We are plain people here, sir, unambitious of further intercourse with the world
                  than what chance sends in our way. Are you ready, sir?"
               "All ready; and now have the goodness to remain just where you stand, and look
                  straight in the bird's eye, whilst I take aim." So saying, Weeks knelt down, and
                  resting the muzzle of the rifle on a projecting rock, waited in that position for
                  nearly five minutes, giving the bird time, as he said, to forget there was a
                  second party in the play. "Now, then," he cried, at last, "hold your hand up, to
                  attract his attention;" and as Mr. Lee complied, he took deliberate aim and
                  fired.
               "Capital shot!" exclaimed the light-keeper. "Capital shot, by George—not the first
                  time you handled a rifle, I suspect."
               "We-ell, no—not exactly the first," drawled out Mr. Weeks, with a modest
                  complacency that well became his grave, sallow countenance; "I've handled the
                  article more than once, I guess."
               Both now looked anxiously around, where the bird might be likely to rise; but no
                  bird came up to dot the smooth surface of the water.
               "Down rather longer than usual," said the light-keeper, at length breaking
                  silence, "and that's a sure sign you haven't touched a feather of him."
               "Guess you're mistaken," responded Weeks; "he's floating out there somewhere as
                  dead as a door nail. Ah! by cracky! there he is, lying flat on the water:
                  see!"—and he pointed with one hand while he shaded his eyes with the other—"see,
                  there he is!"
               "Where? Ah, yes! by George! and there he is, sure enough; well, now, who could
                  have thought it!" exclaimed the light-keeper, seemingly much delighted with the
                  discovery.
               The object, however, to which the stranger pointed happened to be a little whitish
                  colored buoy, a few fathoms beyond a boat, that lay anchored within gun-shot of
                  the island. As it rose and fell on the light swells of the sea, it looked by no
                  means unlike a dead bird floating on its back. Mr. Lee saw the mistake in an
                  instant, and resolved to humor it.
               "Dead as a herring!" he exclaimed, taking off his hat and rubbing up his gray hair
                  in an ecstasy of delight. "Ha, ha! the villain! he's caught at last."
               "He'll never trouble you again, I'll bet," continued Weeks, coolly handing over
                  the rifle. Then laying his hand quietly on Mr. Lee's shoulder, he added, "I make
                  you a present of the bird, my friend, for I really think you deserve it richly,
                  after such an almighty waste of powder."
               The light-keeper gravely bowed his thanks.
               "Well, there's one condition I would make, Mr. Lee, and I kinder think you'll not
                  object to it; namely, that you stuff the creetur, and hang it up here in the
                  passage among the fishing rods and jack lines."
               "Certainly, Mr. Weeks, most certainly, sir, your wishes must be gratified."
               "And look here; you'll have the goodness to use this for a label;" and he drew a
                  card from a richly chased silver case he carried in his breast pocket, and handed
                  it to the light-keeper; "affix this, if you please, to the upper mandible, that
                  your visitors may know who shot the bird—not that I care to make a personal boast
                  about it—for did you know me well, you would say if ever there was a
                  man who despised boasting, that man is Ephraim C. B. Weeks. But I've a notion, somehow, that it would be just as
                  well for the old European countries here to know what sorter people we are in the
                  new world beyond, and consequently think it's the duty of every free-born
                  American, wherever he goes, to enlighten mankind as to the character, enterprise,
                  social advancement, and universal intelligence of his countrymen. Yes, sir, it's a
                  duty our people owe to oppressed and suffering humanity to make their habits,
                  manners, customs, laws, government and policies known throughout universal
                  creation. If it be our duty, as a nation, to redeem the world from ignorance and
                  slavery, as it is, beyond all question, then I say it's the special duty of each
                  and every citizen of that nation to contribute his portion to the advancement and
                  final completion of the great work. We must be known, sir, in order to be
                  imitated."
               As the speaker went on to develop his views of the great scheme for promoting the
                  moral and social welfare of the human family, the light-keeper held the card out
                  before him, and read in bronzed copperplate the following address: Ephraim C. B.
                  Weeks, Ducksville, Connecticut.
               "Humph! By my word of honor," he muttered at last, "that's a very magnificent
                  affair." Then running his eye over the person of his visitor, he seemed somewhat
                  puzzled what to say. The card case protruding from his pocket, the rings on both
                  hands, and the massive watch chain round his neck, were all apparently of the
                  costliest description, and might well have adorned the person of the highest noble
                  in the realm; on the other hand, however, it struck him there was quite a contrast
                  between the gentleman's language and personal appearance. How that happened he was
                  at a loss to think, and therefore it was he made no reply, but kept glancing from
                  the card to the stranger, and from the stranger to the card.
               "I rather think, Mr. Lee, you haven't met many of our people in your time,
                  eh?"
               The light-keeper replied in the negative.
               "Well, sir, you now see before you a real American—a free-born American, sir—a
                  citizen of the great 'Model Republic;" and the speaker again thrust his hands into
                  his breeches pockets as deep as they could well go, shook up the silver at the
                  bottom, and with a self-complacent smile on his thin lips watched the
                  light-keeper's countenance for the effect of the startling announcement.
               But Mr. Lee did no more than merely compliment him on his birthplace, assuring
                  him, at the same time, he should always feel honored, as he did then, in making
                  the acquaintance of a citizen of the republic of Washington, the model republic of
                  the world. "But with respect to the stuffing," he continued, endeavoring to
                  restrain a smile, "I fear there is none to be found here who understands it."
               "Well, send it up to Crohan; I shall see to it myself; guess we Yankees know a
                  little more of those things than you do here in 'the Green
                  Isle.'"
               "No doubt of it, Mr. Weeks, no doubt of it. I'll send it immediately, and consider
                  it a very special favor indeed."
               "Now, then, talking of Americans," said Weeks, arresting the light-keeper by the
                  arm, as the latter began to move towards the lodge, "why don't you bring some of
                  our men over here to enlighten you, eh? You have natural talent enough, I guess,
                  if you'd only proper means to develop it. Could you only get up an association
                  with funds enough to pay Yankee lecturers, you would soon wake up to a sense of
                  your capabilities. Employ our lecturers, sir, and send them over the country here,
                  from town to town and village to village and I'll bet a fourpence they'll open
                  your eyes wider than ever they opened before."
               "Don't doubt it in the least," modestly replied the light-keeper; "but won't you
                  come in, and have some refreshment after your evening's exercise? Come in, sir,
                  and honor my little cabin with your presence at least."
               "Hold on," said the American, again detaining the lightkeeper keeper on the steps of the threshold. "Look here a
                  minute, if you're not in a killing hurry. I should like to say a word or two about
                  shooting that Holland hawk—it may serve to show you what kind of people we are in
                  the States. Well, to begin with, we calculate never to miss a shot at either man,
                  bird, or beast. You may smile, sir, but it's the fact, nevertheless. My mother had
                  a cousin once, called Nathan Bigelow——"
               "Excuse me, Mr. Weeks—let us step into my office, if you please; I've some orders
                  to give—allow me—just for an instant."
               "Well, look here," persisted the Yankee; "it's only a word or two. I was just a
                  going to say that my mother had a cousin once, called Nathan Bigelow, and a shrewd
                  man Nathan was. Well, he was said to be somewhere about the shrewdest in that
                  section of the country. So the folks thought all round. If there happened to be
                  town meeting, Nathan was sure to be chairman; if referees were appointed by the
                  district judge on a heavy case of damages or the like, Nathan was certain to be
                  one of them; or if the parson and deacon had a quarrel, Nathan was always called
                  in to settle it. Then he was consulted by half the farmers round, coming on seed
                  time, and by the selectmen about the taxes, and sometimes by the new minister
                  about the doctrine best suited to his congregation—though the fact is, Nathan
                  never cared much for any particular kind of religion himself—that's a fact. So, as
                  I was going to remark, cousin Nathan had a favorite saying of his own——"
               "Hilloa, there!" interrupted the light-keeper; "pray excuse me, Mr. Weeks—hilloa,
                  there, I say! Are you all dead? Roger, let some one see to the lantern; it's
                  almost lighting time. Come in, Mr. Weeks, and take a seat at least."
               "Wait a minute—well, as I was saying," he continued, still drawling out his words
                  slowly, "as I was saying, cousin Bigelow had a favorite saying of his own—'Take
                  good care, boy, and don't waste your powder.' It always came ready to him,
                  somehow, and he could apply it to every which thing in creation. Many a time, in
                  the long winter nights, when cousin Nathan used to sit by the log fire in his
                  great rocking chair, reading Tom Paine's 'Age of Reason,' and Martha Proudfut, his
                  wife, knitting her stocking right opposite, with the 'Pilgrim's Progress' open on
                  the table before her, and your humble servant in the corner, studying his
                  book-keeping,—many a time, I say, did cousin Nathan turn round to me, without the
                  least provocation in the world, and begin to illustrate the old maxim, 'Take good
                  aim, boy, and don't waste your powder.' He made a—well, he made it a kind of text
                  to spin a sermon from, and a better sermon he could preach—ay, by a long
                  chalk—than the best preacher in the district. He used to tell me, Nathan used,—and
                  if he did once he did a thousand times,—that the old saying, simple as it sounded,
                  had more genewine philosophy in it than Aristotle and Epictetus put together; and
                  let me tell you, Mr. Lee, cousin Nathan had a terrible regard for these same
                  authors—translations of course, for he was no great hand at the dead languages,
                  coming, as he did, from the old Puritan stock—his great grandfather being a true
                  blue May Flower. Well, Nathan, to be plain about it—was a caution, I tell
                     you, in the philosophy line. He never professed much admiration
                  for any but great men, and these were what he called ticklers,
                  because, as he said himself, they were the only men who ever tickled humanity in
                  the right place, namely, Tom Paine, Benjamin Franklin, and George Washington.
                  George, he thought, was the greatest man ever the world produced—and I guess, Mr.
                  Lee," said the speaker, with a knowing look, "if he didn't hit the mark, he hit
                  somewhere within a mile of that neighborhood."
               "Very true," assented the light-keeper, "he certainly did. Washington was a great
                  and a good man; all must admit that; and
                  I trust your nation, in the first flush of its prosperity, will not forget his
                  wise counsels either."
               "Hope not; well, what I was coming at: Nathan's old saying, 'Take good aim, boy,
                  and don't waste your powder,' so constantly repeated, made a lasting impression on
                  my mind. The fact is, Mr. Lee, he had a way of saying a thing that—well, kind of
                  burnt it into you, like. There was no forgetting it nohow; it was a sort of
                  searing of the——"
               "O, botheration to him!" exclaimed the light-keeper, no longer able to endure the
                  tiresome description, chained as he was to the speaker; "what matters it what he
                  was; he's dead long ago, I suppose, and gone to his account. But, excuse me, Mr.
                  Weeks," he added a moment after, "excuse me; I'm entirely ignorant, you know, of
                  your national characteristics. When longer acquainted, I shall understand you
                  better. And now, my dear friend, let us step into my room—but hold! who comes
                  here? By George, its Tom Petersham, in the Water Hen, to pay us a visit."
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               
                  Mr. Weeks is introduced to Captain Tom Petersham, and is invited by that
                     Gentleman to spend a Day at Castle Gregory.—He also has the good Luck to catch
                     a Glimpse of Mary Lee.
               
               THE little craft which so suddenly arrested the light-keeper's eye, as he turned
                  to enter the lodge, was already within five minutes' sail of the long flight of
                  steps leading up from the base of the rock to the lighthouse yard. She was a yacht
                  of small tonnage, but elegantly moulded. Her white hull, sunk almost to the
                  scuppers, and her light, raking spars, gave her a janty look, that seemed to
                  please the Yankee exceedingly.
               "Why, by cracky, that's an American boat, rig and hull!" he exclaimed. "Ha! I
                  swonnie!—had her built at one of our ship yards, I guess."
               "She was built in Cork harbor," replied the light-keeper. "Timber or plank, mast
                  or spar, there's not an American chip in her."
               "Not, eh?"
               "No, sir; she's Irish, every inch of her, from the truck to the keel. Tom
                  Petersham wouldn't own her if she was any thing else."
               "He wouldn't, eh?"
               The light-keeper, now seeing a boat approaching from the yacht, advanced to the
                  head of the stairs, and raised his hat to a gentleman who sat in the stern. The
                  latter, as soon as the boat touched, stepped ashore.
               "Hilloa, there, Master Lee," he shouted as he ascended the steps; "I couldn't pass
                  without calling to pay my respects to pretty Mary—to say nothing (O Lord! this is
                  worse than Loughdearg for Father John—deuce take them for steps; they don't leave
                  a breath in me)—not to speak of the numerous injunctions respecting a promised
                  visit from the saucy baggage. Heigh-ho! I say, Lee,—this is steeper than the face
                  of Gibraltar; and let me tell you—hugh!—you must provide falls and tackle in
                  future, if you'd have me visit here. Forty-three steps! monstrous! But who the
                  deuce!—eh, who is that?" he demanded, halting to take breath as he
                  reached the top, and wiping the perspiration from his face. "Who, in the name of
                  all the Malvolios, is he with all those gewgaws under his sporting jacket?"
               "Hush," said the light-keeper; "he's a foreigner."
               "Nonsense! He's a cockney tailor come down to rusticate—eh?"
               "No, sir; he's an American, and a real Yankee into the bargain."
               "A Yankee! The deuce he is!"
               "A native of Ducksville, State of Connecticut."
               
               "Ho, ho! now I understand you; he's the Crohan man—cousin, or nephew, or something
                  of that kind, to the Hardwrinkles. Very good; he's just the man I want to see;
                  present me forthwith. Kate wishes to see him too, of all things, and swears she'll
                  invite him to the castle herself, if I don't. Introduce me instantly; I'll see
                  what he's like, and then ask him to visit us."
               "O, the young scamp!" exclaimed the light-keeper, laughing; "she's got some
                  mischief in her mad pate, I warrant you. If the good gentleman only took a
                  friend's advice, he would stay at home, and keep clear of her company. But, come;
                  I'll introduce you, at all hazards."
               "Captain Petersham," said he, taking off his hat, and motioning with the grace of
                  a well-bred gentleman, "let me present to you Mr. Weeks, of Ducksville,
                  Connecticut, United States. Mr. Weeks, Captain Petersham, of Castle Gregory."
               The American bowed low, but without saying a word or changing his position in the
                  least. Not so Mr. Petersham, who despised in his heart all kind of formality, save
                  and except the formalities of the duel ground; and these he understood well, and
                  could practise to perfection.
               "What the plague, man!" he exclaimed, "don't be so stiff with me. Nonsense! you're
                  an American citizen, and that's enough, sir; give me your hand. Ducksville or
                  Drakesville—I don't care a barley-corn what ville you are, so you're a free
                  American. Come, sir, let us be friends at once, and make no more pother about
                  it."
               "Excuse me, Captain Petersham; you make a mistake. My name ain't Ducksville or
                  Drakesville; my name is Weeks—Ephraim C. B. Weeks."
               "O, hang the difference, man!—it's all the same—what matters it? Come, let's join
                  Lee in his office—he's gone to order some refreshments, and I'm as dry myself as a
                  whistle;" and running his arm into the astonished American's, he dragged him
                  along, speaking all the while with his usual rapidity. "Pshaugh! it's all
                  balderdash—what's in a name?—why, man, it don't signify a straw what you're
                  called."
               "Well, no, not much, I reckon; but if it's just the same to you, I'd rather be
                  called Weeks—Ephraim Weeks. Here's my card, sir, if you please——"
               "Card! psaugh—all humbug. Keep your cards, my dear sir, for those foolish enough
                  to use the toities. But if you choose to be called Weeks, I'll call you Weeks,
                  certainly, sir; and an excellent name it is for an American."
               "Well, it's sort o' handy like for a business man."
               "To be sure—to be sure—there's your secretary of legation, Mr.—Mr.—what the
                  plague! I can never remember names—Mr.—Mr.—O confound it—Linkimdoodle—or something
                  of that sort,—well, sir, he's a fine fellow, that Linkimdoodle, a right honest
                  thorough-going republican as I ever met in my life. He has an odd name, to be
                  sure; but what of that?—No one minds it—any thing, you know, will do in a country
                  like yours, where you've no houses yet, or pedigrees, or things of that
                  description to trouble you. And so you're staying at Crohan with the Hardwrinkles.
                  Well, I can only say I'm sorry for it—they'll ruin you, that's all—ruin you, sir,
                  body and soul."
               "The Hardwrinkles are my cousins, Captain Petersham."
               "Just so; I know; I understand all that—but you'll not be worth a rap farthing,
                  sir, if you stay with them many months longer, notwithstanding."
               "You don't say so!"
               "I do, sir. They'll first reduce you down with psalm singing, till you're as flat
                  as dish water and as weak as a wendle straw, and then finish you off with mock
                  piety, private scandal, and weak tea. Take my advice, sir, and stay with them as
                  little as possible. Come up to Castle Gregory, where there's some life to be had,
                  and come as often as you can, too—we'll be always glad to see you. So then here
                     we are in the light-keeper's sanctum,
                  and here comes Drake to welcome us. Hands off!—hands off, Drake—down, down, you
                  old rogue; you're as wet as an otter—away, and bring your mistress here; I want to
                  see her. But what's the matter?—how now! growling at your guest?—ah! Drake, Drake,
                  that's inhospitable—what has come over you, man? never saw you act so un-Irish
                  before. Excuse me, sir; but take a seat, take a seat, and don't be surprised to
                  see me make so free in another man's house—it's our custom here. Heigh-ho!" he
                  added, flinging himself down in an easy chair and his gold-banded sea-cap over his
                  shoulder; "it takes me a full half hour to recover breath after climbing those
                  villanous steps. Heigh-ho! and so you're an American citizen."
               "Well, yes; I have that honor, sir."
               "Right, sir,—and it is an honor—no doubt of it. But how warm it is—eh?" and he
                  snatched off his stock and wiped his face with his handkerchief. "It's those
                  outrageous stairs—eh! Besides, I'm not feather weight either, I suppose. Humph!"
                  he added, glancing over at his companion, "you have the advantage of me there,
                  sir—you're thin."
               "Yes, rather inclined that way," modestly replied Weeks, playing with his
                  watch-chain.
               "So much the better, sir, so much the better; you're in a more comfortable summer
                  condition."
               "Well, as to the Weeks side of the house," observed the American, by way of
                  explanation, "they were never what you might call fleshy people; but the Bigelows
                  were about the largest boned men in all Connecticut. There was my mother's cousin,
                  for example, one Nathan Bigelow——"
               "By the lord Harry, he's at Nathan again!" came rumbling along the hall, in the
                  deep tones of the burly light-keeper, as he hurried in from the tower to welcome
                  his guests.
               Fortunately, however, Mr. Weeks was at that moment in the act of speaking, so that
                  it was quite impossible for him to distinguish the words; otherwise he had
                  understood better the comic smile on Captain Petersham's face, as that gentleman
                  twirled his thumbs and gazed over at him from his easy chair.
               "Let me see; you're somewhere about five feet eleven inches—ain't you?"
               "Yes, thereabouts."
               "Well—now, as to the weight, I reckon you're two hundred, or chock up to it."
               "Very likely—I might be three, for aught I know," replied the captain,
                  laughing.
               "Well, cousin Nathan was taller by nearly two inches, and mother says before he
                  lost his eye on muster day he weighed close on two twenty-five. Still, cousin
                  Nathan——"
               "Hilloa, there! hilloa, Roger O'Shaughnessy," broke in the light-keeper again;
                  "are we never to see that brandy and water? Come along, man, only lift your feet,
                  and they'll fall themselves."
               "Ay, ay," muttered the old man, shambling into the room in his old bottle-green
                  livery with the faded lace and the two solitary buttons, carrying a massive silver
                  salver, on which appeared three tumblers and a decanter with something resembling
                  brandy on the bottom of it. "Ay, ay," said he, "it's always the same—just for all
                  the world as if he was at home in the ould castle. Heigh! heigh! It's nothing but
                  Roger here and Roger there—Roger, bring the venison; Roger, where's the champagne?
                  Roger, where's the Burgundy? Roger, order this lord's carriage, and Roger, order
                  that lady's barouche. Heigh, heigh, heigh!" Here he was seized by a fit of
                  coughing which had the good effect of terminating his catalogue of complaints.
                  "Och, och!" said he at length, when he recovered a little breath, "the Lord be
                  with the time, Captain Petersham," (bowing with great formality to that
                  gentleman,) "when Roger had plenty of servants to assist him. But sure there's no
                  help for it now, and as I burned the candle I must burn the inch;" and the old man
                  turned to quit the room.
               
               "Stop, Roger; hold on; what have you got here?" demanded the light-keeper, holding
                  up the decanter between him and the light.
               "There, sir?"
               "Yes, here, sir; look at it."
               "Why, it's brandy, av coorse—what else shud it be? But may be its wine yer honor
                  wants—ugh! ugh!—what kind iv wine id you like, sir? I'll bring it
                  immadiately."
               "Wine! you old schemer, you know there's not a drop of wine in the house."
               "Me!"
               "Ay, you; you know it well—nor hasn't been these twelve months."
               "Och, och, the Lord luck to us!" exclaimed Roger, raising his hands in grave
                  astonishment; "it's wondherful—wondherful, entirely. His mimory's clane gone, sir,
                  (turning to Captain Petersham.) It's only the matther of four weeks, or so, since
                  we got—let me see—ahem! ahem!—two pipes iv claret—one Madeira;" and he began to
                  count them on his fingers—"ahem! two iv claret—one Madeira—one——"
               "Don't mind him, don't mind him," said the captain, rising from his easy chair,
                  and good naturedly laying his hand on Roger's shoulder; "he's enough to vex a
                  saint. Well, Roger—let him do as he pleases; if he choose to refuse us a glass of
                  wine in this beggarly way, why, we can remember it to him—that's all."
               "O, my heart's broke wid him, yer honor."
               "To be sure it is—you're a living martyr, Roger. I declare, I don't see how you
                  can stand it—it's insufferable—quite insufferable."
               "Och, och! I wish to patience he was back in his own ould castle again, yer honor,
                  for since the docthors ordhered him down here for the benefit of his health,
                  there's no comfort to be had wid him, night or day—but sure, if he didn't lose his
                  mimory, it wouldn't be so bad, allthegither. And then I'm shamed out iv my life
                  wid him. Why, if you'd only hear to him, Mr. Petersham—ahem! that's if you were a
                  stranger, you know, sir, like that gentleman,—you're most obedient, sir,—and
                  didn't know the differ, ye'd think there wasn't a screed iv dacency left about
                  him, at all, at all;" and as he thus went on to make his private complaints to the
                  captain, still, however, in a voice loud enough to be heard by the American, he
                  kept ever and anon glancing at the great silver salver on the table, as if making
                  a silent appeal to it for testimony against his master.
               During this little conversation with Captain Petersham, the light-keeper called
                  him several times, but Roger was too much engaged to attend him.
               "Roger!—are you deaf? Roger!"
               "Sir, sir."
               "Is this all the brandy you have in the house? Answer me, yes or no."
               "Ahem! Answer you yes or no; why, av coorse I'll answer you—that is, if I only
                  knew what you mane."
               "Well, look here,"—and Mr. Lee stepped over to the old man, and shook the decanter
                  within an inch of his eyes—"you call this brandy?"
               "Sartinly, sir, the best cagniac; it cost just seven—"
               "Never mind the cost; you have here about three thimble-fulls or thereabouts—for
                  three gentlemen."
               "No, sir, there's a good half bottle, and more—ahem! ahem! it looks little, but
                  it's on broad bottom; hem, it's a broad bottom, sir."
               "Well, now, I want to know—if you've any more of the same left?—that's plain
                  enough, I think."
               "Why, dear me, such a question! Och, och—and two casks untouched in——"
               "Hold your lying tongue and answer me, sir; have you? yes or no."
               
               "Yes, yes, puncheons of it."
               "Go fetch it then, forthwith—go now instantly;" and he pushed him gently towards
                  the door.
               "Sartinly, sir, sartinly," replied Roger, moving off as fast as his old, shaky
                  limbs would carry him, the long skirts of his old bottle-green coat oscillating as
                  he went. "Most sartinly, sir; it's aisy enough to do that—why, if I only knew what
                  in the world ye were comin at, all the time, I'd have it here now."
               "He's the greatest old plague, that, in the whole universe," said the
                  light-keeper; "not a respectable visitor ever comes to see us, but he acts just in
                  the same way. He would make you believe, Mr. Weeks,—Captain Petersham here knows
                  all about him long ago,—he would make you believe his master as rich as Crœsus,
                  and staying down here only by advice of his physician. You observed the old
                  bottle-green livery he wears; well, he has worn that, to my own knowledge, five
                  and twenty years, and in all probability, his father before him, for as many more.
                  As for this antiquated piece of plate on the table, he brings it out on every
                  possible occasion. The old coat and the old salver are in fact his great
                  stand-bys, and with these he imagines he can make a show of 'dacency,' were the
                  house as bare and empty as the ruins of Baalbec."
               "Poor Roger," said the captain; "he's a regular Caleb Balderstone."
               "Precisely—the only difference, perhaps—that Caleb was a creation, and Roger a
                  reality."
               "Balderstone," said Weeks; "let me see; Balderstone—warn't he something to the
                  Balderstones of Skowhegan, down east?"
               "Ha, ha!" chuckled Captain Petersham; "can't say as to that."
               "Well, them Balderstones of Skowhegan were tremendous smart men, I tell you; and
                  cousin Nathan says they fought at Lexington like tigers and catamounts."
               "No no; Caleb was of quite another character," replied the light-keeper. "He was
                  born of a wizard, and shall live as long as the world lasts. Some, indeed, go so
                  far as to say, that he and Campbell's last man are destined to expire
                  together."
               "Well, he's not a mortal, I reckon."
               "No, sir, he's immortal as the gods."
               During this latter part of the conversation, Roger O'Shaughnessy had returned as
                  far as the room door, and remained standing on the threshold, for a minute or
                  more, looking in. In the attitude he assumed he presented a striking appearance.
                  His once tall and powerful frame, now bent and wasted with years,—the old laced
                  coat hanging from his attenuated shoulders in empty folds,—the white hairs that
                  still remained brushed up on each side, and meeting in a crest over his polished
                  scalp, gave him the look of a fine old ruin, tottering to its fall, with all its
                  friendly ivy dead in the dust, save a few weak but faithful tendrils clinging fast
                  to it still.
               "Excuse me, Mr. Lee, for interrupting you," said Weeks, "but the old gentleman
                  here at the door seems to want something."
               "What! Roger,—well, Roger, what's the matter?"
               "Ahem!" said Roger, "ahem! about the brandy, your honor."
               "Well—about the brandy—where is it? why don't you bring it in?"
               "The key—ahem! the key of the cellar, sir," said Roger, without venturing to look
                  at his master.
               "What of it?"
               "Ahem! It's not to be found, sir; you or Miss Mary must have it."
               "Me! I never touched the key in my life."
               "Dear me, then, what's to be done, your honor? The brandy's in the cellar, and
                  there's no key to open it."
               "I don't believe a word of it, but did you ask Miss Lee for the key?"
               
               "She's not to be found, either, sir."
               "Ha, ha!—I thought so. I knew all the time it would come to that at last."
               "If you could put up for this time with some of the best old Innishowen, that ever
                  was doubled," said Roger, "you can have a hogshead of it in a jiffey."
               "Innishowen!" cried the captain; "and put up with it, too! Nonsense! nonsense!
                  Roger, bring it in here instantly. Why, you old villain, it's worth its weight in
                  gold. Compare French brandy with Innishowen poteen, indeed! Why, the Irishman who
                  would do that should be sent to the stocks, and physicked with frogs and
                  assafœtida. Begone, and fetch it instanter. Away! my time's up."
               Roger soon returned with a bottle of excellent whiskey, of which we must not omit
                  to say, Mr. Weeks declined to partake—nay, absolutely rejected in the most
                  positive manner, as a thing entirely against his principles and habits of life.
                  But the light-keeper and his good neighbor, the lord of Castle Gregory, made no
                  pretensions to such principles or habits; they filled their glasses and drank to
                  each other, and to the success of the Stars and Stripes, as a compliment to Mr.
                  Weeks, in full bumpers of Irish grog, without fear or shame, reproach or
                  remorse.
               Captain Petersham had scarcely finished his draught, and flung the tumbler on the
                  table, loudly protesting against all state temperance laws and teetotal societies,
                  as being the provocation of half the drunkenness in the world, when a sailor, cap
                  in hand, presented himself at the door.
               "How now, Bradley—what's the matter?"
               "Mr. Ratlin says, there's a blow coming up from the westward, sir, and in half an
                  hour we'll have ebb tide. He waits orders."
               "Well, get the boat ready. I'll be with you in a second."
               He now approached the window, and glanced for an instant at the west. "There it
                  comes, Lee," he exclaimed, "tumbling bling up in lumps over Tory Island; you'll
                  have it whistling about your ears here in half an hour. I must get aboard the
                  Water Hen, and pack on sail, or she'll not fetch Ballymastocker to-night. But look
                  here; who's that under the rock, there, speaking to Mistress Mary? He's a devilish
                  fine-looking young fellow, eh!"
               The light-keeper hastened to the window. "Hah! by George," he exclaimed, muttering
                  the words to himself, the instant his eye rested on the person alluded to, "he is
                  back again."
               "Who is he, Lee—eh? surely I've seen that young man before—who is he?"
               Mr. Lee smiled and shook his head.
               "O, hoh, that's it, is it? Very well, if there's any thing particular about him,
                  keep it to yourself."
               And having requested Mr. Lee to make his apology to Mary for running away so
                  abruptly, and invited Weeks to visit him as soon as possible, he hurried off,
                  without further delay, to his yacht. The moment his foot touched her deck, she was
                  seen crowding on every stitch of canvas that would draw, and then gracefully
                  bending under the gentle pressure of the evening breeze, the little Water Hen
                  glided up the Swilly, and soon disappeared in the deepening shadows of Rathmullen
                  Bluffs.
               The light-keeper had accompanied his friend to the head of the steps to bid him
                  good by and a fair voyage, and the American, taking advantage of his absence,
                  instantly turned to the window, and there kept watching Mary Lee and her companion
                  so intently, and with so absorbing an interest, that old Roger had picked up his
                  silver card case which had fallen from his pocket, and laid it on his knee,
                  without his having noticed it in the least. The spot on which the young couple
                  stood conversing, was a small patch of greensward directly above the narrow
                  channel called the Devil's Gulsh, and canopied over by a long, flat, projecting
                  rock. The place was some seventy feet
                  above the roaring water, cut, as it were, in the face of the precipice, and nearly
                  on a level with the window at which the American sat looking at them so intently.
                  The distance between was not more than thirty feet; yet near as it was, Weeks
                  could have distinguished little more than their mere outlines, had not the great
                  lantern, now lit up, shed its flood of light full on their persons, revealing
                  every motion and feature distinctly to his gaze.
               A shade of melancholy overspread the handsome face of the young man as he leaned
                  on the boat hook, (with which he had climbed the rocks,) and conversed with his
                  fair companion. His black, waving hair fell in profusion over his blue jacket,
                  from the breast pockets of which the silver mountings of a brace of travelling
                  pistols glinted in the clear lamplight. His neck was entirely bare, as if the heat
                  of the day, or his previous exertions, had obliged him to remove his cravat, and
                  his whole bearing that of a brave, self-reliant, fearless young fellow, of honest
                  heart and ready hand. Mary Lee stood by his side, dressed in her blue kirtle and
                  straw hat, the picture of angelic loveliness. Her face, always smiling before, was
                  now pale and thoughtful, as if the melancholy which shadowed the countenance of
                  her companion had touched her heart. Her petite figure, as she leaned lightly
                  against the rock, her modest eyes bent on the green grass at her feet, her long
                  auburn ringlets falling in showers over her shoulders, and above all, her
                  unaffected simplicity of manner, gave her a striking resemblance to those
                  beautiful creatures which Raphael paints in his Espousals of the Virgin. Once or
                  twice she raised her eyes to those of her companion; but she as often turned them
                  away, as if the sadness of his looks gave her pain. His gestures and motions were
                  those of entreaty; but she, on her part, appeared to make no reply—save to shake
                  her head and look up sorrowfully in his face. At length the voice of the
                  light-keeper was heard round the house, calling her in from the approaching storm,
                  and she could stay no longer. As the moment of parting came, she drew from her
                  bosom something resembling a medal or locket and chain, and pressing it devoutly
                  to her lips, gently threw it over the young man's neck. She then gave him her
                  hand, and bidding him farewell, sprang round the edge of the rock with the
                  nimbleness of a fawn, and disappeared in an instant. Her companion followed her
                  with his eyes as long as she remained in sight, and then carefully concealing the
                  little treasure in his bosom, slowly turned and left the place.
               "Well," said Mr. Weeks to himself as he moved over from the window and leaned his
                  elbow on the table beside him, "she's a handsome gal, that—no mistake about it;
                  and that feller looks to be a purty smart kinder chap, too, and not ill lookin
                  either. But who in creation is he? There's some mystery about him, that's sartin.
                  I could see that by the light-keeper, when the captain asked his name. But hold on
                  for a bit; I'll soon learn the secret from Mother Curley. That was some sorter
                  charm, I'll bet a fourpence, that thing she put round his neck—some papistry, I
                  reckon. But ain't she all-fired brazen faced, to go up there right straight before
                  the window?—By cracky, they do up that kinder business sorter strange down here in
                  these diggins—they're ahead of New Jersey, by a long chalk. But after all, perhaps
                  it's her favorite retreat, and the feller found her there. She expected
                  him—sartin. I saw that by her face when she came peeking in at the window, and I
                  rather suspect she warn't aware of Captain Petersham's arrival either, or that
                  Ephraim Weeks was in the office with her uncle. Well, she's handsome—that's a
                  fact—and with those hundred and fifty thousand dollars I know of to back her up,
                  she's wife enough for any man. Ha, she little thinks what belongs to her tother
                  side the big pond—and she won't either—till she's got her nose up to the hitchin
                  post. She'll be skittish, I guess, at first; but I'll take the old woman's advice,
                  and coax her to it, gently. She can only
                  refuse, do her best; and when she does, why it's then time enough to put the
                  screws on. They're poor as poverty, that's clear, and it won't be very hard to
                  corner them up in a tight place. A month or two in limbo would settle the old
                  chap's light-keepin, and then the girl, all-fired proud and all as she is, might
                  be glad——"
               He was suddenly interrupted in his reflections by the entrance of the two persons
                  in whom he seemed to be so deeply interested.
               "Here's an impudent, saucy little baggage, Mr. Weeks, who desires to offer you an
                  apology for her dog's very bad behavior to-day," said the light-keeper, leading
                  Mary by the hand. "Miss Lee, sir. Mary, this gentleman is Mr. Weeks, of
                  Drakesville, Connecticut, United States."
               "Ducksville, if you please, Mr. Lee, not Drakesville," said Weeks, after one of
                  his profound inclinations to the young lady; "the difference ain't much, but
                  still——"
               "O, excuse me, excuse me, sir," said the light-keeper; "so it is—I made a
                  mistake—Ducksville, my dear, State of Connecticut."
               "Allow me to offer you my card," said Weeks, smiling faintly and patronizingly on
                  the young girl, as he drew it slowly out from the silver case.
               "Thank you, sir," she replied, modestly courtesying and accepting the favor,
                  without the least sign of surprise at the strangeness of the compliment.
               "I regret very much, sir, the loss of your fishing lines this evening," she said;
                  "but if you permit me, I shall replace them."
               "Pray, don't mention it," replied Weeks, interrupting her. "You're exceedingly
                  kind, Miss Lee, but I assure you I have lots of such traps to spare."
               "Drake is a very bold fellow in the water, sir, and don't mind his mistress in the
                  least, when there's any thing like game to be seen. But then, he's so good and
                  faithful that we must forgive him a great many faults. Drake, Drake," she cried,
                  "where are you?" and as the brown curly-haired old fellow came in, wagging his
                  tail, she ordered him to kneel down before the gentleman and ask his pardon. But
                  Drake, instead of kneeling, as, no doubt, he was taught to do on such occasions,
                  began to growl at the stranger, and would probably have sprung at him if Mr. Lee
                  had not promptly interposed his authority, and commanded him to leave the
                  room.
               "How very strange!" said Mary, speaking to her uncle; "I never saw him act so
                  rudely before."
               "Some kink the old fellow has got in his head. But I fear Mr. Weeks will find his
                  first visit to us down here a very disagreeable one, so many things have conspired
                  to make it so. The loss of his fishing tackle and his fine trout, to boot; then
                  the absence of the inmates here, and his having to sit so long alone before any
                  one came to bid him welcome; and finally, the unkind and ungenerous behavior of
                  Drake; why, upon my word, Mr. Weeks, you must think Araheera light a very
                  barbarous place."
               "O, don't mind—don't mind; I can get along, I guess, most any where. We'll make it
                  all right yet. As for the loss of the flies and casting line, I feel quite pleased
                  about it, since it has procured me the acquaintance of so lovely and accomplished
                  a young lady as Miss Lee."
               Mary blushed, hung down her head, and tried to say something; but her confusion at
                  so blunt and unexpected a compliment silenced her completely. The light-keeper,
                  however, came to her assistance.
               "If you talk to her in that style, Mr. Weeks," said he, "you'll play the deuce
                  with her—see, she's all over blushes already."
               "We-ell, I generally calculate to speak to the point, Mr. Lee. It was always my
                  habit to be frank with every one, and I can safely say, I should be most willing
                  to lose all the fishing tackle I ever owned, for the pleasure afforded me by this introduction; she's a most beautiful
                  and amiable girl,—there's no mistake about it,—and I'm not ashamed to say so,
                  though you are her uncle."
               "Mary, the gentleman will set you crazy, if you stay here much longer—away with
                  you," he added, patting her affectionately on the cheek; "away into some corner,
                  and hide your blushes; Mr. Weeks will excuse your further presence;" and dropping
                  her hand, he permitted her to shrink back and glide away like a fairy from the
                  room.
               "Well, I guess I shan't wait much longer, either," said Weeks, picking up his cap
                  and preparing to leave. "I see the storm's coming on, and I've got somewhat of a
                  walk before me; but I was just athinkin to come down here once in a while to have
                  a day's fishin or so, and a talk about the United States, at our leisure."
               The light-keeper smiled, and asured him he should be happy to see him at any time,
                  and cheerfully do all in his power to make his visit to the country, and
                  particularly to Araheera Head, as agreeable as possible.
               "And look'e here," said Weeks, buttoning his coat; "if there's any thing I can do
                  to oblige you, in the way of friendship, don't hesitate an instant, but tell me
                  right out. It may happen you'd want a friend's advice, a—well, no matter, you
                  understand me. I'm a single man, Mr. Lee, and have a leetle more at my banker's, I
                  guess, than I've any particular occasion to use. Good afternoon, sir."
               "Good by, and thank you for your good will," said the light-keeper, somewhat
                  surprised at the stranger's liberality. "I shall most assuredly consult with you,
                  Mr. Weeks, when occasion requires it."
               "I say—hold on!" said Weeks, again, turning back when half way down the avenue;
                  "that bird, you'll not forget to send it, eh?—all right; guess I can get it up for
                  you in pretty good shape." And waving his hand, he set out on his journey to
                  Crohan, the residence of the Hardwrinkles.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               
                  Uncle Jerry.—His Character.—The Shipwreck at Bally-hernan.
               
               "HA, ha! very well, I declare! and so there you are at last!" said Uncle Jerry,
                  raising his spectacles to his forehead and peering at Dr. Camberwell as he entered
                  the room, a few days after the events related in the last chapter.
               "Good morning, sir; how d'ye do?" said the doctor; "any calls since I left?"
               "No; none but Lanty Hanlon," replied Mr. Guirkie, pulling down his spectacles
                  again, and resuming his employment; "and there's a mallard wing he brought me,"
                  pointing at it sideways with his eye, "not worth a brass button."
               "Don't doubt it in the least; couldn't expect any thing better."
               "Why—just look at it. Mrs. Motherly's blue drake out in the yard there has got
                  better feathers for a June trout by all odds."
               "It looks like the wing of a young turkey; don't it?"
               "Upon my word it's a fact—the spots are as big as the point of my thumb, every one
                  of them."
               "Well, you'll find Lanty out yet, some day or other, I suspect," said the doctor,
                  sitting down on the sofa, apparently much fatigued.
               "It was about the child he came," resumed Mr. Guirkie; "I had almost forgotten
                  it—about that widow's child down at Ballymastocker."
               "What's the matter with it?"
               "The measles."
               "The measles!"
               
               "Yes, and I prescribed in your absence; so I suppose you'll scold me for it,
                  eh?"
               "Scold you! no. Why should I scold you? Upon my word, you know quite enough about
                  the profession to turn doctor yourself. And so you prescribed;—what did you give
                  him?"
               "Gin, of course—good Hollands, and to be taken freely."
               "Capital; the very best medicine you could order."
               "But only at a certain stage of the disease, eh?"
               "O, of course, at the incipient stage!"
               "Very true," said Uncle Jerry; "that's just it, precisely;" and he laid down the
                  fly he was dressing, to wax a silk thread, whilst he still continued the subject,
                  apparently much interested; "that's exactly the very thing; taken at the proper
                  time, it's the very best medicine in the world. It saved my life once, in
                  Trinidad, when attacked by the small pox."
               "Possible?"
               "Yes, sir, and I have invariably recommended it in similar cases ever since."
               "No other calls?"
               "None to speak of. That Mr. Weeks was here about his headache, or faceache, or
                  whatever ache you please to call it."
               "Neuralgia, I rather think; and a pretty troublesome acquaintance it is to get rid
                  of."
               "I declare," said Uncle Jerry, snapping the thread which he should have had the
                  patience to cut with the scissors, "I declare and vow, it matters very little
                  whether he ever gets rid of it. He's but a very poor concern, that same Mr.
                  Weeks."
               "O, I see you have been disputing again—ha! ha!"
               "Very well, it's not my fault if we have. I'm sure I never dispute with any one,
                  if I can help it."
               "No; but still you manage to do it, notwithstanding."
               "Never, upon my word and honor," replied Mr. Guirkie, "except when it's forced on
                  me.—There now, that hook's as blunt as the very beetle;" and he flung it pettishly
                  into the grate.—"I can't sit patiently by, and hear the man still contending that
                  a red hackle is the best in May and June. You wouldn't expect that, I suppose,
                  eh?"
               "He must be very unreasonable," yawned the doctor, his eyes half closed from
                  fatigue and want of sleep, for he had been up all night. "Yes, very
                  unreasonable."
               "It was actually presumptuous, considering all my experience to the contrary."
               The doctor made an effort to open his eyes and nod in reply.
               "I tried to reason him out of it. Upon my word, I reasoned with him as mildly as I
                  would with a child; but you might as well reason with a madman. Why, sir, he's as
                  wrong-headed as a mule, that man, humble and all as he seems. He's a cheat,
                  doctor—that's the whole sum and substance of it."
               "O, well," said the doctor, rousing himself a little, and speaking in a half
                  irritable, half conciliatory tone, "let him have his own way; the point, after
                  all, is not of vital interest to any body, I suppose."
               "No, it's of no great consequence, I allow," said Uncle Jerry, raising his
                  spectacles a second time to his forehead, and looking across the table at his
                  companion in a manner more impressive than usual. "No, sir, I admit that freely,
                  but the man is exceedingly presumptuous,—remarkably so, for a stranger,—and I'm
                  much mistaken, doctor, if you yourself, with all your stoicism, would surrender to
                  such a person without protest. Moreover, sir, the gentleman, if he be a gentleman,
                  should avoid provoking me to argument in my own house, where he knows he has me at
                  a disadvantage. I say, doctor, it was very indelicate of him, think what you
                  please about it."
               "And why do you let the man trouble you at all, if you think so poorly of
                  him?"
               
               "Trouble me? O, I declare," exclaimed Uncle Jerry, taking off his spectacles at
                  last and pitching them on the table with a very dissatisfied air, for he was
                  evidently disappointed in the little interest his friend seemed to take in the
                  subject. "Trouble me—why, I vow to goodness, he may go to Halifax and fish for
                  sculpins if he like, for aught I care one way or other. But am I bound to adopt
                  his blunders against both reason and conscience? am I?"
               "By no means; why should you?"
               "Very well, then," replied Mr. Guirkie, "that's all I want to know;" and as if
                  there was no more to be said on the subject, he reached over again for the
                  spectacles; "I know very well," he added, as he looked through them before he put
                  them on, "I know it's quite right that every man should choose whatever side of a
                  question pleases him best; it's republican, and has always been my way, and ever
                  shall be as long as I live; but still I have no hesitation in saying this much,
                  doctor, that it's morally impossible for the man who never ties a horn on a hare's
                  ear, because the natural fly don't wear horns except in July and August;—I say
                  that the man who maintains that doctrine, never caught better than graws or
                  shiners in his life. That's precisely what I think of it, and I shall take
                  occasion to tell the gentleman so at our next meeting."
               "Shall I bring in the breakfast?" said the housekeeper, opening the door softly,
                  and waiting till Uncle Jerry had finished before she interrupted the
                  conversation.
               "The breakfast!" repeated the latter, checking at once the current of his thoughts
                  and looking across at the doctor, now fairly a-doze on the sofa. "The breakfast! I
                  declare, that's a fact: well, now, upon my word, I'm the most selfish, thoughtless
                  man in the world. There he has been out at sick calls all night, and hasn't had a
                  morsel yet to break his fast. Certainly," he replied, nodding at the housekeeper,
                  "certainly, ma'am, send it in by all means."
               When the door closed, Mr. Guirkie again resumed his employment, making occasional
                  remarks, now and then, on the quality of the crottel, hare's ear, tinsel catgut,
                  and the other various requisites for fly-dressing; and, at length, having finished
                  his task, and put up the materials in their usual place, he came round and touched
                  the sleeper gently on the shoulder.
               "Wake up," said he, "and prepare for breakfast; it's just coming in. But how is
                  this, doctor? Why, dear me! now that I'm near you, one would think you were after
                  a week's march in the Indies. I declare, a Sepoy, after a three days' drill,
                  couldn't look worse. A tedious case, I suppose."
               "Very," muttered the doctor; "very bad, indeed."
               "Don't doubt it in the least; you look like it."
               "Shocking."
               "I declare! and it detained you since midnight?"
               "Yes, I left here a few minutes after twelve, with Father John," he replied,
                  yawning and rubbing his eyes. "You heard the dog bark at the time under your
                  chamber window, I suppose—I was afraid he might have disturbed you."
               "Heard him! why, he set all the dogs in the parish a-barking, and they didn't stop
                  for an hour after. I declare he's the most unreasonable animal in that respect I
                  ever heard, at home or abroad. Still, it's a conscientious matter with him, I
                  suppose, and we shouldn't blame him. Hah, indeed! and so it was a
                     very shocking case."
               "Fourteen of a crew cast ashore on Ballyhernan Beach," said Dr. Camberwell,
                  raising up his sleepy eyes sympathetically to those of his venerable
                  companion.
               "Fourteen of a crew! O, may the Lord have mercy on them!" exclaimed Uncle Jerry,
                  in pious astonishment. "That's awful."
               "A schooner from New York, bound for Dublin," continued the doctor. "She foundered
                  off Tory Island four days ago. The crew, with the exception of the first mate, who
                  went down with the vessel, took to the long boat, and after drifting about all that time were at length driven
                  ashore last night on Ballyhernan Strand."
               "May the Lord protect us!" exclaimed Uncle Jerry again, slapping his knees with
                  the palms of his hands, and looking terrified at the doctor—"all dead?"
               "No, no, not all. Six of them are still living; the rest were dead
                  before we reached the shore."
               "The Lord have mercy on them."
               "Were it not for the unwearied attention and devoted charity of Miss Lee, the
                  light-keeper's daughter, I verily believe every soul of them had perished."
               "Perished!—after reaching the shore—that's terrible to think of."
               "Well, under God, she was the principal means of saving their lives."
               "The angel!"
               "Upon my word, I believe she's more of an angel than any thing else."
               "She is one, I tell you—there's no doubt of it whatever—you can see
                  it in her face."
               "So you have seen her, then. I thought you had never called at the lighthouse
                  since this new keeper came."
               "Neither have I. 'Twas at the chapel I saw her—and that only for a second or two.
                  She was kneeling before the picture of the Virgin, and I declare, glancing from
                  one to the other, I could hardly tell which was the lovelier. I have never
                  forgotten that face since for a single day—it haunts me sleeping and waking; every
                  feature of it seems as familiar as my own."
               "It was really one of the most beautiful sights I ever saw, continued the doctor,
                  "her kneeling there on the cabin floor, administering relief to the poor
                  sufferers. She looked to me the very image of a young Sister of Mercy I used to
                  see long ago, gliding round the sick beds in the Dublin Hospital."
               "So full of piety, and so gentle!" said Uncle Jerry.
               "Yes, once, as she touched the parched lips of the little cabin boy with a
                  spoonful of wine and water, her tears fell on his face, and it was
                  impossible——"
               "I know it," said Uncle Jerry; "it was impossible to look at her,
                  without—hem—without feeling—hem—that is, I mean it was very affecting."
               "The warm drops as they fell made him raise his eyes to her face, and then such a
                  look of love and gratitude as he gave her I never saw on human face before."
               "It's the goodness of God, doctor, that sends us such creatures, now and again, to
                  reconcile us to our miserable humanity."
               "Certainly."
               "We should otherwise forget our destiny altogether."
               "No doubt of it."
               "He scatters them over the dark world, here and there, to brighten and beautify
                  it, as he scatters the stars over the clouded heavens."
               "But to return to the sufferers," said the doctor, afraid Mr. Guirkie should fly
                  off into one of his rhapsodies; "one poor fellow, a negro, was all but dead when I
                  left."
               "Dear me! all but dead!"
               "Yes, and had seven of his toes broken besides."
               "Lord save us!—seven toes broken!—that's frightful—seven toes!"
               "Four on one foot and three on the other."
               "Most shocking!—and what makes it still worse, he's of the despised race; but the
                  rest—where are they?"
               "In the cabin."
               "What!—all huddled up together, the living with the dead?"
               "Why, there was no other place to put them—no house, you know, within a mile of
                  the strand."
               "O, no! of course not; why should there?" exclaimed Uncle Jerry, not a little
                  irritated at the disappointment. "Why
                  should there? No, no, there's never any thing where it ought to be, sir. I believe
                  in my soul, sir, if there had been a house there, not a shipwreck would have
                  happened within leagues of it."
               "Don't doubt it in the least," assented the doctor.
               "Cross purposes, sir; that's it, cross purposes—every thing in creation pulling
                  against every other thing. It's outrageous, sir—no house there, where of all
                  places in the world it ought to be—I declare to my conscience it's
                  insufferable."
               "I know it," said the doctor; "it's too bad, to be sure, but so it chances to
                  be."
               "Chances! nonsense!—there's no such thing as chance—don't believe in that." And,
                  clasping his hands round his knee, he lifted up his little leg, and commenced
                  rocking away in his chair—a habit he had when any thing troubled him. He asked no
                  more questions either; what he heard already supplied him with materials enough
                  for a picture—and he drew it, and gazed at it, till the tears fell in big drops on
                  the carpet. He saw the poor wrecked sailors, stretched on the damp floor of the
                  warren-keeper's hut, as plainly as if he had been there in person standing over
                  them.
               "Well, there's no use in fretting about it," he said, at length, letting his leg
                  fall, and looking out at the rain pattering against the window panes; "it can't be
                  helped, I suppose. They'll die, every soul of them, for want of good fresh air and
                  kindly treatment. I know they will. Can nothing be done? I wish to Heaven I was
                  there myself; but where's the use of wishing? The doctor would never consent to it
                  in such a storm as this. So here, then, I must wait patiently, and make the best
                  of it. As for that negro, he'll die; there's no doubt of it in the world: he'll
                  die, just because he is a negro, and no one to care for him. As for Mary Lee, she
                  may be a tender-hearted, gentle creature as ever lived, and no one who ever saw
                  her once could think otherwise; but she's a timid, fawny thing, and won't venture
                  near enough to wet his lips with a spoonful of sangaree, or whisper a kind word in
                  his ear, to keep his heart from sinking. Ay, that's the effect of a black
                  skin—always, always. It was just so in St. Domingo and Alabama, and all over the
                  world. But never mind, never mind; there's a good time coming. It won't be so in
                  heaven;" and Mr. Guirkie rubbed his hands smartly together, and chuckled at the
                  thought; "no, no; that's one comfort, at least; it won't be so in heaven."
               "Why, dear me! there's the doctor fast asleep!" exclaimed the housekeeper, laying
                  down the tray with the breakfast on the table. "Please wake him up, Mr. Guirkie;
                  he needs some refreshment, and should take it hot."
               "Never mind him," replied Uncle Jerry, "never mind him. Go away, Mrs. Motherly, if
                  you please, and don't jar the door. I'll wake him the next time he turns over;"
                  and, wiping his spectacles with the tail of his morning gown, he commenced reading
                  a newspaper that lay on the table.
               Now, it happened the paper was a week old or more, and Mr. Guirkie had read it
                  over, advertisements and all, a good half dozen times already. For being the only
                  paper taken at the cottage, he always tried, as he said himself, to make the most
                  of it. It was not, therefore, with a view either to entertainment or information
                  that he snapped it up so suddenly as he did, but merely to divert his mind from
                  thinking of the wrecked sailors, and particularly the negro with the broken toes.
                  Mr. Guirkie, as the reader may have suspected, was gentle and full of tender
                  sympathies, and when a case with any thing peculiarly melancholy in it, like the
                  one in question, chanced to get hold of his heart, he never could manage very well
                  to shake it out of it. It was only then, with the desperate hope of excluding from
                  his imagination the picture he had drawn so vividly but a few minutes before, that
                  he clutched the paper so vigorously between his hands and ran his eye so rapidly
                  over the print. It happened, however
                  ever, notwithstanding the effort he made, that his success was by no means
                  complete, for he soon began a sort of low, dry whistle, without tune or music in
                  it, and evidently intended to help the newspaper. When he had read down half a
                  column or more with this accompaniment, he found it, as he always found it before,
                  to be a total failure, and that, do what he would, the picture kept always
                  breaking in upon him. At last, unable to resist any longer, he flung the newspaper
                  on the floor, and starting up in a sort of desperation, paced up and down the
                  room, his slippers clattering the while against his heels, and his hands as usual
                  clasped behind his back.
               "Mr. Guirkie," said the housekeeper, opening the door gently.
               "What," said Mr. Guirkie, turning on his step, and throwing up his spectacles from
                  his forehead till they were lost in his bushy, gray hair; "what's the matter?"
               "Lanty Hanlon's come for more of that medicine, sir, and says the child's doin
                  bravely; and, sir, he brought ye the other wing of the wild duck."
               "Mrs. Motherly," said Uncle Jerry, approaching the door, and drawing himself
                  primly up, "I'm engaged, ma'am."
               "Yes, sir, but——"
               "Well, but, ma'am, I'll have no buts; I'm not to be imposed on. That fellow has
                  had more gin already than would cure half the parish; quit the room, if you
                  please, and tell that scoundrel to quit the house."
               Again Mr. Guirkie turned to the window, and looked out on the stormy sky,
                  muttering to himself all the while in short, ejaculatory sentences. At first they
                  were low and hollow, but grew more audible in proportion as the picture before his
                  mind's eye grew darker.
               "O, nonsense!" said he at last, "Nonsense! nonsense! there's no use whatever in
                  attempting it. And what's more, there never was any use. It was just so always,
                  just the same old story over and over again; and I verily believe I'm a greater
                  fool now than I was twenty years ago. Last week I couldn't rest till I saw that
                  distressed widow, just as if it were my business to console widows—just as if it
                  ought to concern me a copper whether her landlord ejected her or not. But the
                  explanation of it all is, Mr. Jeremiah Guirkie,—since that's the name you like to
                  go by,—the explanation of it all is, that you're an incorrigible simpleton. Yes,
                  sir, that's the short and long of it. And I saw that very word, last Friday, on
                  the doctor's lips, when I gave Lanty the half crown for the hackle, as plain as
                  the light there, only he didn't let it drop. Well, he thought so, of course; why
                  shouldn't he? Forever meddling with other people's business, and neglecting my
                  own. And now, here comes this shipwreck just at the heels of the Weeks affair to
                  worry me again. Well, all we can say about it is, let the negro die—why not? he's
                  not the first that died neglected. And why should it concern you?" he continued,
                  stopping short and looking at himself in the mirror above the mantel; "why should
                  it concern you, sir, one way or other? Psaugh! You're mighty charitable, ar'n't
                  you? Take a friend's advice, sir, and mind your own business: you'll have plenty
                  to do; ay, and if the truth were told, more than ever you did do in your life,
                  sir. Of all the people in the world, sir, you're not the very man expected to keep
                  life in these sailors, or solder new toes on that unfortunate negro."
               Here the soliloquy was interrupted by the doctor speaking in his sleep. Mr.
                  Guirkie turned his head slowly around, and stood in a twisted position for a
                  second or two, looking at the dreamer, and waiting to catch the next words. There
                  was a wonderful deal of benevolence in his face as it thus appeared in profile.
                  The little round blue eyes, so full of soft and gentle expression—an expression
                  which his recent effort to steel his heart against the influence of pity had not
                  abated in the least; the small mouth, with the corners turned slightly up, like Uncle Toby's when listening to
                  Corporal Trim; the smooth, unwrinkled, rosy cheeks; and stiff gray hair standing
                  on end,—all tended to convince the beholder of Mr. Guirkie's eccentric habits and
                  kindly nature.
               Again the doctor muttered something, and then Mr. Guirkie moved gently over, and
                  bent his head down to catch the words.
               "The negro! the negro!" said the sleeper.
               "That's it—the negro, of course," repeated Uncle Jerry. "He must die—that's what
                  you mean."
               "Mary Lee," continued the dreamer, "warm blankets!—the decoction!" and abruptly
                  turning on his side, he concluded with a groan that told how fatigued he was after
                  the labors of the previous night.
               "Very well," said Mr. Guirkie, kicking off his slippers, "that puts an end to it.
                  I have no longer a shadow of doubt about my obligations. It's evidently my duty to
                  go down and visit them. That's as plain as the sun, and the doctor's dream is
                  clearly providential;" and so, sitting down on the chair, he put on his shoes, and
                  then drew over his leggings from the footstool. "As for the rain," he continued,
                  looking out of the window, "I don't care a farthing about it, one way or other.
                  Neither the heat of the Indies nor the cold of the Canadas has taken a feather out
                  of me yet. I'm just as good for all practical purposes as I ever was. To be sure
                  it rains and blows hard and fast; but I am no sugar loaf to melt in the rain, nor
                  a jack straw to be blown away with the wind."
               Talking in this strain, he put on his leggings. But he put them on, as he always
                  did, in a very careless, slovenly sort of way—omitting a button here and a button
                  there on his way up to the knees. This time especially he was in somewhat of a
                  hurry, and his thoughts had nothing whatever to do with the buttons. Next he
                  opened his desk as silently as possible, and took out what seemed to be a pocket
                  book, looking round stealthily at the doctor as he secured it under his vest, and
                  finally retired to his chamber to don his seal skin cap and drab surtout with the
                  double cape, a riding dress he never laid aside summer or winter, and from which
                  no one in the neighborhood ever thought of dissociating the idea of Uncle Jerry
                  Guirkie. These hasty preparations concluded, he stepped on tiptoe from the parlor,
                  and closed the door noiselessly behind him, leaving the doctor sleeping soundly on
                  the sofa, and the breakfast cooling beside him on the table.
               On reaching the housekeeper's door, however, great as his hurry was, he paused and
                  seemed to deliberate. He was thinking whether he should apprise her of his
                  intended journey, or steal out unobserved. There was danger both ways. If he told
                  her, she might wake up the doctor and detain him; if he did not, his absence in
                  such stormy weather might occasion alarm for his safety. Three or four times he
                  coughed and hemmed slightly at the threshold, bringing his knuckle each time
                  within an inch of the door, but as often drawing it back. At length, however, the
                  fear of giving alarm predominated, and summoning courage, he knocked—but it was a
                  knock in which there was no sign of authority—or rather it was the gentle tap of a
                  child coming to beg alms at a gentleman's back door.
               "Mrs. Motherly!" said he, putting his lips to the key-hole and speaking under his
                  breath, "Mrs. Motherly! I'm going out a little; but you needn't disturb yourself.
                  I don't require your services in the least—not in any possible way whatever."
               But Mrs. Motherly knew better. She had lived now nearly five years in the family,
                  and understood Mr. Guirkie well, and all about him. Her long residence and her
                  well-known fidelity gave her a respectable claim on his consideration, which
                  indeed, however inconvenient he often found it, he never failed to acknowledge.
                  For a long time after she came into the family, Mrs. Motherly kept continually
                     remonstrating with Mr. Guirkie on his
                  foolish ways, as she loved to call them, and frequently, when provoked, would
                  venture even to scold him sharply, but still in a respectful and affectionate
                  manner—sometimes for his reckless neglect of his health, sometimes for spending
                  his money on objects undeserving of charity, (for Uncle Jerry had the habit of
                  slipping a sixpence now and again to the beggars whom Mrs. Motherly thought it her
                  duty to drive from the door,) but most of all for his inveterate disregard of his
                  dress and personal appearance. Of late years, however, she had given him up in
                  despair, relinquishing all hopes of ever being able to correct him, and came at
                  last to the wise conclusion that destined as she was to remain a fixture in the
                  place, why, like a prudent woman, she would let him have his own way, and try to
                  do the best she could for him. Still there was one little peculiarity in Mr.
                  Guirkie's conduct, especially for the last year or so, which Mrs. Motherly
                  sometimes found it rather hard to put up with; and that was, his want of regard
                  for her feelings in presence of third parties—the doctor of course excepted: this
                  was particularly the case when company happened to be at the house, or when he
                  chanced to come across her any where beyond the walls of the cottage. Alone with
                  her at home, he was as tractable as a child; for the fact was,—and it may as well
                  be told now as again,—the fact was, he feared Mrs. Motherly. It's no doubt a
                  lamentable admission, but not the less true for all that. And the reason was
                  clear: Mrs. Motherly was a woman of such excellent qualities in her way, that
                  Uncle Jerry could not help entertaining a great respect for her; then she took
                  such a lively interest in his affairs that he felt she had a good right to his
                  confidence, and he yielded it accordingly; and last of all, with all her humility
                  she had such force of character, that he generally found it easier to submit than
                  quarrel with her. Whether our readers of the sterner sex—and we write down the
                  word sex in order to save it from growing entirely obsolete—whether
                  they shall ever agree to adopt Mr. Guirkie's rule of conduct in this respect as
                  the safest and the wisest is more than we dare predict; still, we might venture to
                  say, judging from the present aspect of things, and making all necessary allowance
                  for the progressive spirit of the age, that such a revolution in the ordinary
                  relations of life would not, after all, be so very extraordinary an event.
               In the house and alone with Mrs. Motherly, Uncle Jerry, as we have said already,
                  was generally as tractable as a child. He would turn back at her bidding, were his
                  very foot in the stirrup, and sit down to let her sew a button on his shirt or tie
                  a more becoming knot on his cravat—nay, sometimes, when hard pressed, would hand
                  her his purse for safe keeping—a precaution, by the way, she generally took when
                  she suspected him of going up to the Blind Fiddler's in the Cairn, or down to the
                  widow with the three twins at Ballymastocker. From home, however, or in presence
                  of strangers, he was quite another man. On such occasions, his whole bearing
                  towards her underwent a change. He would draw himself up to the very highest
                  stretch of his dignity, address her in a dictatorial tone, and otherwise deport
                  himself towards her as if he regarded her in no other light than that of an
                  ordinary waiting woman. When any one about the table chanced to make honorable
                  mention of Mrs. Motherly,—which indeed those who were aware of Uncle Jerry's
                  little weakness often did to plague him,—it was amusing to see how the old man
                  would pout his lips, throw himself back, and admit, with a patronizing air, that
                  she was—really was an honest, trustworthy servant—had her little whims, to be
                  sure, as every one had—but, nevertheless, was a right trusty and obedient
                  housekeeper.
               This change in Mr. Guirkie's conduct towards her, Mrs. Motherly was for a long
                  time unable to account for, and the anxiety she felt about the cause of it was far
                  more painful to her than the thing itself. The secret of all was, however,—and the reader must be told it by all
                  means,—the secret was, that Uncle Jerry's friends were in the habit of plaguing
                  him about Mrs. Motherly; that is to say, about certain little leanings in that
                  direction. They made no direct, specific charges—not one—but kept forever
                  indulging in sly winks and innuendoes, which mortified the poor man much more than
                  plain, downright accusations. Amongst these friends, Mr. Thomas Petersham, or
                  Captain Tom Petersham, as he was generally called, held a conspicuous place. The
                  captain, as the reader may have seen already, was a good natured, jolly sort of a
                  man as one might care to meet with any where. He cracked a good joke, rode a good
                  horse, kept a good table, sang a good song, sailed the fastest yacht between Fanit
                  Point and the Skerries, and never looked or felt happier in his life than when he
                  had Uncle Jerry at his elbow to hob-nob with him after dinner. This gentleman had
                  so often plagued Mr. Guirkie,—and he did it in a quiet, provoking way too, his
                  eyes sparkling the while with the spirit of the grape and mischief together,—that
                  the good little man at last thought it prudent to assume a cold and distant
                  reserve towards his respectable housekeeper in the presence of strangers, in
                  order, we suppose, to offset disagreeable suspicions. Now, of all men in the
                  world, Mr. Guirkie would be the last to think of such an attachment. The thing was
                  entirely out of the course of his thoughts; or if the idea ever could by any
                  chance cross his mind, he would, very probably, walk up to the looking glass, and
                  laugh himself out of countenance for entertaining it for an instant. He was now
                  sixty years of age, but as hale and hearty as he was at twenty-five—a wealthy,
                  happy old bachelor, who had travelled half the world over—been in all sorts of
                  society—studied men and books till he grew tired of both, and at last settled down
                  quietly at Greenmount, resolved to spend the remainder of his days and his money
                  as far away from city life as possible, without the remotest idea of ever changing
                  his condition of life.
               As for Mrs. Motherly, poor soul! if the thought of a nearer or holier relation
                  between them than that of an honest, faithful servant to a kind, indulgent master,
                  ever did enter her mind, why, it wasn't so much to be wondered at, after all. She
                  never looked on herself as an ordinary house servant. She was above that, both by
                  early education and household accomplishments, and she knew it; and every one else
                  knew it just as well, the moment she made her appearance. It was as plain as the
                  alphabet. Her clean white apron, her neat, well plaited cap, her bunch of polished
                  keys at her girdle, and above all, her intelligent, respectable countenance,
                  bespoke at once her authority and the right she had to exercise it. And so Uncle
                  Jerry and Mrs. Motherly lived very happily together, each well satisfied with the
                  other, the latter yielding a reasonable obedience, and the former exercising a
                  reasonable authority. If any thing ever did happen, once in a long time, to create
                  a little dryness between them, it was sure to be that unfortunate habit he had of
                  treating her unkindly before company. In vain did she try to shame him out of it,
                  when she had him to herself all alone of a quiet evening after tea—he with his
                  flies and she with her stocking sitting cosily together; in vain did she draw on
                  his nice sense of propriety to rebuke him,—nay, sometimes, when more than commonly
                  provoked, actually charge him to his face with having taken an ungentlemanly
                  advantage of her position to mortify her. All was in vain. To every complaint she
                  made on that head, Uncle Jerry, turning away his face to hide his confusion, and
                  making many a hem and hah, to clear his throat, would
                  invariably acknowledge that it might appear strange, but he had his own reasons
                  for it. This, indeed, was all the explanation he ever gave, and do what she would,
                  all Mrs. Motherly could ever get out of him. But to return.
               "Mrs. Motherly," whispered Uncle Jerry through the keyhole; "Mrs. Motherly," he
                  repeated in a hard under-breath. "I'm going out a little, but you needn't trouble
                  yourself in the least about it; and
                  please tell the doctor, when he wakes, that I'll return presently."
               But the good woman turned the key in the lock before he had quite done speaking,
                  and presented herself before him, her left hand pressed against her plump side,
                  and a look of astonishment, half affected, half real, pictured in her face.
               Uncle Jerry raised himself suddenly up from his stooping posture, and gazed at
                  Mrs. Motherly without saying a word,
               "Well," at length said the latter, breaking silence, "what's the matter?"
               "Why!" responded Mr. Guirkie, "what is the matter. It's no harm to go
                  out, I suppose."
               "No, but what does it mean?" inquired the matron, surveying the
                  diminutive figure of Mr. Guirkie from head to foot; "what does it mean, in such
                  weather as this?"
               "Well, that's it; it may look a little odd, to be sure, but I can't help it."
               "Why, good gracious, look at the rain streaming down the window. Is it crazy ye
                  are, to venture out in such a hurricane?"
               "O, it's not so bad as that, Mrs. Motherly."
               "Bad!—it's a downright waterspout."
               "Well, never mind—it won't signify. I'll return as soon as possible."
               "And where, may I ask, sir, do you propose to go?"
               "Go?"
               "Yes, it can't surely be any thing less than life and death that'd bring you out
                  such a day as this, after the racking cough you had yesterday."
               "Well, that's just it," replied Uncle Jerry—"it's a very serious affair; but you
                  need feel no concern about my catching cold. I'm now very prudent, I assure you,
                  in that respect;" and he buttoned another button in the breast of his coat.
               "Prudent! the Lord be about us, and save us; just listen to that! Well, may I
                  never do harm, if that don't beat Banagher out and out. Prudent, humph! were you
                  prudent when you gave your new under coat to the Blind Fiddler last week, and came
                  home to me shivering, like an old pensioner in an ague fit—were you?"
               "Hush! hush!—you needn't speak so loud, Mrs. Motherly," he replied, glancing at
                  the parlor door; "I acknowledge I was wrong in that instance."
               "And were you prudent when you gave the five shilling piece to that villain of an
                  old soldier, Manus McGillaway, till he got drunk and stole six of my geese, that
                  the like of them weren't to be seen in the parish."
               "And how could I foresee——"
               "Yes, sir, but you did, though; you knew in your heart and soul he was a thief,
                  and especially when he got drunk, that nothing was too hot or heavy for him. You
                  knew that well, sir. And what's more, Mr. Guirkie, you encourage the villain in
                  his thievery, to my own knowledge."
               "I encourage him?"
               "Yes, sir, you. When Captain Petersham sent him that wet day last
                  week for his coat to Castle Gregory, with a token to his sister, it was six
                  bottles of brandy he asked for, instead of the coat, and you gave him a shilling
                  out of your own very fingers, for playing the trick."
               "I declare!" exclaimed Uncle Jerry again, after a moment's reflection; "I believe
                  I must admit——"
               "O, admit—you're very good at admissions; but where's the use of them? Ar'n't you
                  just as bad as ever, after all your promises and admissions? God help me, any way;
                  my heart's broke with you; so it is."
               "Indeed," replied Uncle Jerry, tapping his lips with the but of his riding whip,
                  and looking as crest-fallen as a boy caught stealing apples, "indeed, it's nothing
                  but the truth; I'm very troublesome, I suppose, to every body I have any dealings
                  with. But you'll excuse me, Mrs. Motherly; it's time I was gone, if I mean to go at all;" and he
                  began to sidle off towards the hall door.
               "Stop," cried Mrs. Motherly, as he lifted the latch; "you're not going out that
                  way, are you?"
               "What way?"
               "Why, look at your leggings."
               "My leggings!"
               "Yes, don't you see you've buttoned them on the wrong legs."
               "That's nonsense!—the wrong legs!"
               "Nonsense or not, it's the fact, nevertheless; the tongues are both on the inside,
                  and the buttons too."
               "Well, I declare," said Uncle Jerry, turning his little leg round and round, as if
                  seeking for some pretext on which to justify the blunder; "I declare," he
                  repeated, "I declare upon my word and honor, it's very strange, but surely I must
                  have been asleep, when I put them on."
               "O, you needn't be trying to make any excuses about it—it's just of a piece with
                  all the rest," said Mrs. Motherly, handing him a chair to sit on, while she knelt
                  down to adjust the difficulty; "that's the first time you buttoned your own
                  leggings these five years," she continued, "and you buttoned them wrong. It ought
                  to be a lesson to you, Mr. Guirkie; it ought to teach you that you can do nothing
                  right."
               "Well," replied Mr. Guirkie, with a little more irritation in the tone of his
                  voice than usual, "I'm not so particular about the buttons, perhaps, as I ought to
                  be; but it's only a small matter after all—make your best of it."
               "Small matter, indeed! I would like to know what part of your dress you're
                  particular about, large or small."
               "Hush, Mrs. Motherly, hush, I say, or you'll wake the doctor."
               "I'll not hush, sir; I can't hush; I'm responsible for you, and I must speak."
               "And can't you speak without raising the town?" said Mr. Guirkie, slapping his
                  sealskin cap down on his knees, and scratching his gray head in utter perplexity;
                  "can't you speak with some sort of moderation, ma'am?"
               "No, I can't, for you won't let me—but no matter; you may go—you may go, sir," she
                  continued, rising from her kneeling posture, and shaking both hands at him, as if
                  she would shake herself clean and clear of him forevermore. "You may go—I'll not
                  be accountable for you any longer—not another hour, sir; and if you come back dead
                  to us, don't blame any one for it but yourself."
               Mr. Guirkie lost not a moment in quitting the house, as soon as Mrs. Motherly
                  withdrew her opposition, but rushed out through the rain, ambling his way, as fast
                  as his legs would carry him, to the stable, and mounted Scotchy, already saddled
                  and bridled for a journey.
               Hardly, however, had he got his foot in the stirrup, when Mrs. Motherly,
                  accompanied by Dr. Camberwell, whom she had just waked up, came running out to
                  detain him.
               But it was too late; Uncle Jerry was already in the saddle, and in the act of
                  gathering up the reins.
               "Let him go," he cried, as he saw the doctor approaching under an umbrella,
                  bare-headed, and blear-eyed for want of sleep; "let the horse go, you scoundrel,
                  let him go;" and giving Scotchy a cut on the flank, off he trotted down the avenue
                  towards Ballyhernan Beach, the rain pouring on him in torrents, and the cape of
                  his drab surtout flapping about his ears.
               "May the Lord pity you, poor man," exclaimed Mrs. Motherly, gazing after him till
                  he turned the corner; "may the Lord pity you."
               "Amen," said the doctor, closing his umbrella at the door, and retreating
                  backwards into the house; "he's an extraordinary individual."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VII.
               
                  Mr. Weeks begins to think Ireland not so very green a Country after all, and
                     rather unsafe for Matrimonial Speculations.
               
               QUITTING the lighthouse, apparently well pleased with his visit, Mr. Weeks threw
                  his broken fishing rod on his shoulder, and set out for Crohan with as much speed
                  as his long, shambling limbs and slow habits would admit of. It being already
                  dark, and the distance he had to walk some four good Irish miles, and that over
                  rough, mountainous roads, he resolved to travel somewhat faster than usual, in
                  order to reach Crohan before the family retired to rest.
               And here it should be remarked, that the Hardwrinkle family was a very grave and
                  orderly family; a family, in fact, guided by rule in every thing. They never sat
                  up later than nine o'clock on any occasion whatever. Even the night of Mr. Weeks's
                  arrival, as soon as the deep-toned clock in the great hall struck the appointed
                  hour, the seven sisters, in the order of seniority, rose up each in their turn,
                  and approaching their American cousin, bade him good night with a gravity of
                  deportment that well became the high reputation they had long acquired throughout
                  the parish for unostentatious piety and evangelical perfection.
               This strict mode of living was by no means new to Mr. Weeks, for he was bred and
                  born in the land of steady habits himself, and therefore could well understand the
                  value his cousins set upon that particular family regulation. This consideration,
                  added to the danger of being caught in the approaching storm amongst the wild
                  gorges of Benraven, prompted him to tax his physical energies a little more freely
                  than usual.
               He had not proceeded very far, however, on his journey, when he found his rapid
                  pace suddenly checked by a tall, muffled figure, that rose up before him on the
                  road, and commanded him to stop.
               "Who's there?" demanded Weeks, coming to a dead halt.
               "A friend."
               "What friend—Else Curley?"
               "Ay," said the old woman, wrapping her gray cloak round her head and shoulders,
                  and advancing from the rock where she had been sitting to the middle of the road.
                  "Ay, it's me. I stepped down to meet ye at yer up comin, to hear the news. Hem!
                  what's the good word, sir?"
               "Why, all's about right there, I guess," responded Weeks, grounding his fishing
                  rod, and resting his hands on the end of it.
               "Plazed with yer visit, I hope."
               "Well, yes—got along pretty slick."
               "Ye seen her?"
               "Well, can't say I saw much of her to speak of."
               "But ye think she'll suit ye, any way?"
               "Yes, reckon so; she's handsome enough, but kinder skittish, I guess."
               "O, av coorse; what else could ye expect at the first goin off?"
               "No, that's all right. Irish girls are generally somewhat shy at the beginning.
                  But I've no fear we'll bring her up to the hitchin post yet."
               "Humph!" ejaculated Else, "don't be too sure o' that. Remember she has the ould
                  blood in her veins."
               "Psaugh! humbug! old blood!"
               "Ye don't believe in that."
               "Not I; it's all sheer gammon."
               "Humph! see that now! E'then, sure we poor crathurs down there always heerd it
                  said that the blood of the Talbots was as hard to tame as the blood of the
                  aigles."
               
               "The Talbots?"
               "Ay."
               "And who are they?" demanded Weeks, looking sharply in the old woman's face.
               "The Talbots—why, musha, thin, did ye niver hear tell i' the Talbots?" said Else,
                  eyeing him with a very equivocal expression of countenance.
               "No—don't remember exactly."
               "Hoot! jog yer mimery a bit—the name's not so mighty scarce that ye niver heerd it
                  afore. But no matter; time enough to speak o' thim things whin we're betther
                  acquint."
               "Them things," repeated Weeks; "what things? By golly, you're quite mysterious
                  this evening, old lady; say, what am I to understand by them
                  things?"
               "O, nothin, nothin, worth a-talkin of," replied Else; "you're in a hurry now, ye
                  know; and besides, there's McSwine's gun tearing away like fury. Ye'd betther make
                  haste, sir, or the storm 'ill be on afore ye get home."
               As Else spoke, a thudding sound broke like a peal of distant thunder on the still
                  air, and echoed heavily and slowly along the shore, and then away among the deep
                  ravines of the mountains. A little, fleecy cloud, too, which but half an hour
                  gone, had been hardly perceptible on the western horizon, had now rolled up in
                  piles dark and dense to the eastward, and passing the lighthouse, spread far and
                  wide over the clear sky.
               "What's that?" demanded Weeks, turning to look in the direction of the sound.
                  "It's like a heavy broadside at sea, ain't it?"
               "Ay," responded Else, "it's not unlike it; but the reports of all the guns on the
                  say, and the channel batteries to boot, never carried fear to as many hearts as
                  that. God look to the poor vessels out there the night; they'll need good gear and
                  stout arms to win through Tory Island Gut, if this storm catches them within
                  thirty leagues of the coast."
               "And what means that bright light out there? It looks like the flame of a burning
                  ship reflected against the heavens."
               "O, that's only from the lantern of Tory light," said Else; "McSwine's gun is just
                  beyond it to the west;" and the old woman, in reply to her companion's inquiry,
                  explained the cause of its loud report, assigning it, of course, as all such
                  things are popularly assigned, to a supernatural agency. "It's said," she added,
                  "by the ould people, that it niver was heerd afore the Parliament was taken away
                  from us, and niver will stop firing the death gun of the nation till it comes
                  back."
               "Psaugh!" ejaculated Weeks; "what a notion! That's some of your old priests'
                  stories, I guess. But, see here,—about that Talbot——"
               "And there goes the Devil's Gulsh too," interrupted Else; "look at the spindrifts
                  as they begin to fly across the iron bridge. Take a friend's advice, Mr. Weeks,
                  and hurry home as fast as ye can; for my word on it, if ye don't, ye'll find a wet
                  jacket afore ye reach Crohan. Good night, sir, good night; and Else made another
                  motion to leave.
               "Say, hold on," cried Weeks, detaining her by the skirt of her cloak; "hold on; I
                  can wait long enough to hear what you've got to say about the Talbots. How can
                  they concern me—eh?"
               "O, not the laste in the world; how could they, since ye niver heerd tell o' them
                  afore?"
               "Well, but still I may have been connected with them somehow unknown to me."
               "Ha, ha!" laughed the old woman, gathering the scanty cloak still closer round her
                  emaciated shoulders, as she felt the first breath of the coming storm, and
                  chuckling within its folds, like one of Macbeth's witches gloating over her
                  boiling caldron. "Ha, ha! unbeknown to ye, indeed."
               "Come, come," said Weeks; "I want no more fooling just now. You kinder insinewate
                  I had some connection I hadn't ought to with folks name of Talbot."
               "Hush! don't spake so loud."
               
               "Nonsense! loud! I'm an American born, and ain't afraid to speak out before any
                  human in creation."
               "That's mighty bould," said Else; "but cowards sometimes spake the loudest."
               "Well, that's my way of doing things, nevertheless."
               "And a brave way it is too, sir, for them that can carry it through; but sacrets,
                  ye know, shud be spoke in whispers, and above all, deep, dark
                  sacrets;" and the old crone fixed her gray weasel eyes on the face of the Yankee,
                  and then added, "Don't mention that name again above yer breath, for somebody
                  might be listenin."
               "What name—Talbot?"
               "Whist! I say, the night's dark."
               "Dark! I don't care a brass cent, woman; nonsense! Well, I swonnie, if this ain't
                  the greatest attempt at humbug I met since I left——"
               "Ducksville," subjoined Else, in a low, stealthy tone, leering at him the while
                  from under her hood. "And so ye'd like to hear the sacret?"
               "Yes, out with it," said Weeks, confidently; "I ain't afraid. If you've got a
                  secret regarding me, tell it. For my part I know of no secret, and I dread none
                  either."
               "And might I make bould to ask ye what brought ye here then, if ye haven't?"
               "Why, I came to visit my cousins."
               "Humph! and are the Hardwrinkles yer cousins?" demanded Else; "eh! surely yer
                  cousins?"
               "Well, mother says so; she ought to know something about it, I guess, being the
                  only surviving sister of the late Mr. Hardwrinkle; and so, feeling rather disposed
                  to marry, I took a fancy to offer my hand and fortune to Mary Lee."
               "And what wud ye marry her for, if it's a fair question?"
               "Her beauty, of course; she has nothing else to recommend her, I reckon."
               "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Else, in hoarse, hollow tones, which sounded like the voice
                  of the dead from the depths of a charnel vault, her toothless gums mumbling the
                  words as she uttered them; "ha, ha! her beauty, indeed—the beauty of William
                  Talbot's gold'd be nearer the truth, I'm thinkin."
               Weeks heard the name distinctly, and the hearing of it seemed to paralyze him, for
                  the fishing rod fell from his hands without his seeming to notice it.
               "What!" said Else, pursuing her advantage, "marry Mary Lee for her beauty—a girl
                  ye niver set eyes on, till ye seen her, not three hours ago, on Lough Ely. Hoot,
                  toot, sir; don't be foolish; yer a quate aisy spoken man, to be sure, and might
                  pass for what ye plaze with the simple counthry gawkies here on the wild
                  mountains; but as for me, I'm a little too ould in the horn to be blindfolded in
                  that way."
               "You misunderstand me, old lady," said Weeks, picking up his fishing rod, and
                  endeavoring to compose himself.
               "Well, listen to me for a minute, and ye'll hear my raisons. Didn't ye bargain
                  with me for my good word with Mary Lee?"
               "Yes; guess so."
               "And didn't ye bargain with me moreover if my good word'd fail to delud-her her
                  with spells and charms, an that afore iver ye seen a faiture of her face?"
               "No, that's a mistake," responded Weeks; "I saw her at the Catholic Chapel before
                  I saw you, and determined to have her at any sacrifice."
               "Saw her! may be so, but ye didn't see her face; she was veiled."
               "Can't say as to that; saw enough at least to know she was a handsome gal. Why
                  should she be veiled—eh?"
               "Niver mind; she has her own raisons, I suppose; but this much I can tell ye, that
                  many's the little up settin squireen and purse proud budagh threw
                  themselves in her way the last twel'month and more, as she went in and out of
                  Massmount Chapel of a Sunday mornin, lanin on her uncle's arm, to stale a glimpse
                  at her 'bonny een,' and got little for their pains when all was done. No, no, sir; ye seen that
                  bright, sunny face this blissed day for the first time in yer life, or I'm far out
                  i' my recknin."
               "Well, saw enough to know she's a handsome gal," stammered out Weeks, hardly
                  knowing what to say in the face of Else's positive assertion.
               "And listen to me again," continued the latter, still following up her advantage;
                  "why didn't ye thry the girl yerself afore ye came my length? Yer not so handsome
                  that she'd be lakely to fall plump in love with ye, to be sure; but still yer not
                  so ill-lookin aither for a foreigner; and then to the back i' that, ye've as many
                  goold rings, chains, and gaglygaws about ye as might set any young crather's heart
                  a flutterin. Why, in the name i' wondher, I say, didn't ye thry what ye cud do
                  yerself afore ye'd go to the expense of engagin me?"
               "Why, I wanted to be spry about it," responded Weeks. "Time's money to me; I count
                  hours dollars, and minutes cents. I couldn't afford to wait, no how. But pray, how
                  does it concern you what my views and motives are, if I pay your price when the
                  job's done?"
               "Ay, ay," muttered Else; "that's it—that's it. Ye thought ye'd make short work of
                  it, for fear the sacret'd lake out. Humph! I see; and yer cousins, as ye call
                  them, the Hardwinkles, made ye believe I was a witch, I'll warrint, and could do
                  more with spells and charms than you with all yer fine airs and boasted riches.
                  Ay, ay, ye thought I was an ould hell-born divil 'ithout sowl or conscience, ready
                  to do yer dirty work, an ask no questions aither. But yer mistaken, Mr. Weeks;
                  cute as ye are, ye'll find me just as canny; and I tell ye what it is, may I niver
                  see the sun again, if all the dollars in America cud buy me over to move one
                  hair's breath in this dark plot, if it wasn't for the sake of Mary Lee
                  herself."
               Weeks paused for an instant before he spoke. The solemn declaration he had just
                  heard, and made with so much apparent ent sincerity, completely puzzled him. It
                  was a phase in the old woman's character he had never noticed before. Already,
                  indeed, he had penetration enough to see that she was by no means the kind of
                  person common report represented her, nor such as he took her for himself on his
                  first visit to the Cairn. Since that time, her character, it's true, had been
                  slowly and gradually developing itself, but still in such a manner as neither to
                  surprise nor startle him. Now he hardly knew what to make of her. Every mark,
                  every characteristic, of the original woman seemed to have gradually vanished one
                  by one. Her decrepitude, her stupidity, her peevishness, her deafness, her
                  blindness, had all disappeared day after day, and so completely, that at last he
                  could hardly believe in her very identity. The wretched being he found, but a
                  month gone, sitting over her peat fire, with her goat by her side, and looking as
                  stolid as if all her mental faculties had fled, now stood before him, an active,
                  shrewd, energetic woman. All about her was changed—all save the furrows of her
                  brown skin, and the gray elf locks which still stole out from under the band of
                  her ruffled cap. After such a metamorphosis, what wonder if Weeks began to suspect
                  (and especially after so solemn a declaration as he had just heard) that her
                  reputed lust of gold was false, like all the other charges made against her! And
                  how could he tell now, but it was her love of Mary Lee, rather than her love of
                  gold, that led her to take so lively an interest in his affairs? Be that as it
                  might, Weeks felt confused and puzzled to his wit's end, and finally resolved to
                  let Else have her own way, believe what she pleased of him, and carry out her own
                  views to benefit her protégée after her own
                  fashion.
               "So it's entirely for the girl's sake," he at length replied, "that you consent to
                  aid me in the matter of this marriage."
               "Humph! I love gold," responded Else, "but I love Mary Lee better."
               "Then you should relinquish your claim on the remaining three of the four hundred dollars I promised you,
                  since you serve her interests, not mine."
               "Not a brass copper of it," replied Else; "not a copper. No, no; so far from that,
                  I'll be expectin another hundred by this time next Thursday."
               "Another! whew! Well, well, you shall have it," said Weeks, promptly; "for after
                  all, it don't matter a punkin seed to me what your motives are, if you only secure
                  the girl."
               "Nor the girl's love or beauty a punkin seed aither, if ye can only make her yer
                  wife."
               "Well—don't know about that."
               "Hoot! sir, ye know, as well as the sowl's in yer body, that ye don't care a chaw
                  i' tabacky for her beauty. Yer afther somethin ye value more nor beauty, or I'm
                  not Else Curley o' the Cairn."
               "You're not what I once took you for, that's certain," replied Weeks. "You may be
                  the d—l for what I know—and just as like as any thing else, for all I can see to
                  the contrary."
               "Ha, ha! I'm not the dotin ould crone yer friends 'd make me out, that'd sell her
                  sowl to fill her pockets."
               "I required no such sacrifice," responded Weeks. "I employed you to serve me in a
                  perfectly lawful transaction, from which no injury could possibly result to either
                  party."
               "Humph! and suppose the girl was left a fortin by a friend in furrin parts," said
                  Else, "what then? Who'd be the gainer?"
               "Gainer? Why, I guess I'm good enough for her—any way you can fix it, fortune or
                  no fortune," said Weeks, thrusting his hands into his breeches pockets, and
                  hitching up his cap behind with the collar of his coat. "Yes, old lady, good
                  enough if she had fifty fortunes."
               "Good enough for her!" repeated Else, looking into his face—her thin, wrinkled
                  lips turning up in scorn as she spoke. "You good enough for Mary Lee!"
               "Ay, or for any other Irish girl, by crackie, ever stepped in shoe leather," cried
                  the Yankee, jingling up the silver change in his pockets.
               "Ha, ha!" laughed Else; "that's mighty modest."
               "Well, them's my sentiments."
               "Yer wakeness, ye mane."
               "No, ma'am, my solemn conviction. The son of an American revolutionist is good
                  enough, I take it, for the biggest—darndest old aristocrat's daughter in the land,
                  all-fired proud as they feel."
               "May be so, may be so," quietly replied Else. "But if that's yer way o' thinkin,
                  I'd advise ye keep it to yerself. Such talk as that may sound big in America, but
                  it won't go down here."
               "Here—and what the tarnation are ye, that an American born can't speak his
                  sentiments right out, just as he pleases?"
               "O, then indeed it's true for ye; bad scran to the much we are. But still ye know
                  we have our feelins as well as other people. And, between ourselves, Mr. Weeks,
                  it's not very seemly to hear a man like you, without a dhrop o' dacent blood in
                  his veins, comin over here and settin himself up as an aiqual for the best in the
                  land. Wow! wow! sir, it's mighty provokin to see a stranger takin sich airs on
                  himself afore he's a month in the country."
               "My dear woman, you're behind the age, I guess, two three centuries down here in
                  this section. If you only kept run of the times, you'd soon come to find, that an
                  American always makes himself at home wherever he goes—that his very name's a
                  passport to every which country in creation."
               "Bedad, thin, if ye thry that same passport here, I'm afeerd it won't take, barrin
                  ye spake a little modester nor ye do now. Little as ye think of the Irish abroad,
                  faith, there's some o' them at home here'd make ye keep a civil distance, if ye
                  don't keep a civil tongue in yer head. Mind that, sir, and don't forget it,
                  aither, as long as yer in the country."
               
               "Well," said Weeks, somewhat taken aback by Else's contemptuous disregard of a
                  claim which he thought irresistible all over the world, and especially in
                  poverty-stricken Ireland, "well, I was always taught to reckon a free-born
                  American good enough for any woman in creation; and I rather think, old lady,
                  you'll have to try hard before you unsettle that opinion. Cousin Nathan—I
                  mentioned his name once before, I guess—Cousin Nathan was considerable of a shrewd
                  man in his way—as shrewd, I presume, as most men in that section of the
                  country—well, he was a man that was always posted up in every thing relating to
                  Europe and European aristocracy, and he told me, often and often, that a free-born
                  American was good enough——"
               "Paugh! free-born fiddlesticks!" exclaimed Else. "What the plague do we care about
                  yer free-born Americans or yer Cousin Nathans aither. We're abliged to ye, to be
                  sure, for sendin us over what ye did in our time of need, an ill it 'd be
                     our common to forget it, or indeed our childher after us, for that
                  matter, but in the name o' patience have sense, and don't take the good out of all
                  ye do by boastin and puffin yer Americanism that way, like an auctioneer sellin
                  caligoes at a fair."
               "Boasting!" repeated Weeks; "well there! Boasting! why, if there's any thing in
                  this world I hate more than another, it's boasting. I never boast—never. The
                  people of these old reduced nations here may boast, and the poorer they happen to
                  be, the greater braggarts they are. But our nation is too dignified, too
                  intelligent, for that; she's too great to stoop to such trifles. No, no; I merely
                  stated a fact, and I repeat it again, that a free American, a son of the immortal
                  Washington, is good enough for the best and highest blood in creation."
               "Very good," said Else; "every body has a right to his own opinion, I suppose. But
                  don't talk that way to Edward Lee, if you don't want to pick a quarrel with him.
                  For never was flint fuller of fire than ye'll find him, if ye touch his family
                  pride, by such talk as that."
               "Well, hold on a bit. I've got an all-fired sure way of bringing down that same
                  family pride a peg or two, and without a quarrel either. See if I hain't."
               "Why, in deed an word," said Else, suddenly changing her tone to a confidential
                  whisper, "and to tell ye truth, may be that itself wudn't be the worst thing ye
                  cud do, after all, for I'm thinkin they'll have to be beggared before they're
                  betthered, the crathurs.
               "What does that mean?" demanded Weeks.
               "Why, that afther all our schamin, Mary Lee won't have ye till she finds there's
                  no other way to save herself and her uncle from the poorhouse or the jail."
               Whilst Else was yet speaking, the crack of a pistol made Weeks turn his eyes
                  quickly in the direction of the little cabin on the Cairn. The night, however, was
                  so pitchy dark, he could see nothing beyond the edge of the road; but judging from
                  the sharpness of the report, he thought the weapon must have been discharged
                  within a dozen paces of where he stood. Wondering what this could mean in a spot
                  so remote and a night so dark and threatening—for the evening breeze had now
                  changed into occasional gusts, and big drops of rain began to fall so heavily as
                  to disturb the dust under his feet,—wondering, and still keeping his eyes turned
                  towards the Cairn, he was again startled by a shrill whistle twice repeated, and
                  seemingly as close to him as if it had come from himself. Turning short to demand
                  from his companion what this signal meant, and why she replied to it, he found,
                  much to his surprise and vexation, that he stood alone—Else was gone. The moment
                  after, however, an answer came to his question, but in a form somewhat different
                  from what the astonished American expected; for hardly had he called the old woman
                  a second time to come back and explain the mystery, when a flash of lightning,
                  instantly followed lowed by a clap of
                  thunder, shot across the road and revealed for a second the form and face of the
                  handsome young sailor, whom he had seen conversing with Mary Lee but an hour
                  before, on the edge of the precipice. It was but a single flash, and lasted no
                  longer than the twinkling of an eye; and yet he saw the young man
                  distinctly—standing on a little knoll within a short call of him, and resting on
                  the boat-hook in the very position he had seen him last.
               Weeks's first impulse was to follow Else and demand an explanation. The presence
                  of the stranger, at such a time and place, appeared to him rather suspicious; and
                  being inquisitive by nature, as well as somewhat apprehensive of Else's fidelity,
                  he resolved to have the mystery cleared up at once, let the storm rage as it
                  might.
               With this magnanimous intention, he strode over the low fence on the road side,
                  and boldly advanced up the hill towards the Cairn. Breathless, as much from
                  agitation of mind as of body, he made his way within fifty paces of Else's cabin,
                  fully determined to have his mind satisfied at all hazards—when, alas for human
                  hopes! he was again destined to meet with disappointment; for just as he had
                  gained the top of the first slope, Nannie presented herself before him, right in
                  the middle of his path.
               "Well, there!" he exclaimed, gazing at the old white goat standing before him as
                  stiff and resolute as a sentry on guard—"there! you're ready for mischief again, I
                  see; but go ahead, old Beelzebub; I'll be darned if you stop me this time;" and
                  clutching his fishing rod Celtic fashon, he straightway put himself on his
                  defence.
               Nannie, true to the well-known habits and instincts of her species, backed slowly
                  away, till she had receded some ten or twelve paces, and then rearing on her hind
                  feet, made a rush full against the intruder, and would probably have upset him,
                  but Weeks, who had had some experience of the animal already, evaded the blow by
                  stepping aside at the critical moment, and as she passed struck her on the horns.
                  The goat, however, seemed not to notice it in the least; for immediately turning
                  and running up the hill to intercept him, she again drew herself up in a position
                  to renew the encounter. It should here be said, perhaps, that Nannie had somewhat
                  the advantage of Mr. Weeks, inasmuch as the latter was a stranger in the country,
                  and had but a very indifferent knowledge of the use of his weapon; whereas Nannie,
                  according to common report, was already the "hero of a hundred battles." Besides,
                  she knew her ground better and could see more distinctly in the darkness. With
                  such odds against him, however, Mr. Weeks did his devoir bravely, and showed no
                  lack of courage in addressing himself to so strange a combat. At length Nannie
                  again rose up, and plunged forward as before, with a furious rush, and again
                  missing her aim, received a second blow on the horns as violent as the first.
               "Come, old she-devil,—half catamount, half Lucifer,—fire up again; I'll teach you
                  a Yankee trick or two; come on, old rattlesnake." But Nannie, it seemed, was not
                  disposed to renew the encounter so readily as he expected. Taking it for granted,
                  nevertheless, she would a third time repeat her manœuvre of running on before him
                  and heading him off, he resolved to benefit by her loss of time, and have the
                  start of her for the Cairn. With this object in view, he made all possible haste
                  up the hill, and had gained on her a considerable distance, when all of a sudden,
                  and without the slightest anticipation of it on his part, something struck him
                  from behind, and threw him back head foremost, down the hill. A statue of marble
                  thrust back from its pedestal down an inclined plain could not have fallen more
                  helplessly than did Ephraim Weeks. The thud of his body on the beaten foot path
                  might have been heard distinctly at the cabin. He was now completely at the mercy
                  of his enemy. Twice he essayed to regain his feet, and twice did Nannie lay him
                  flat on his back. At length, however, he succeeded so far as to scramble up on his knees, and—as the goat, now in
                  the heat of encounter, closed in upon him, no longer retreating and advancing, as
                  before—he finally seized her by the horns, and speechless, breathless, furious,
                  there he held her. But what was he to do now? He could not remain kneeling, in
                  that attitude, looking in his enemy's face, all night, amid the rain and
                  lightning. He was sorely perplexed, for never was he between two such horns of a
                  dilemma before. To let go his hold, and strike with the but of his fishing rod,
                  would only enrage her the more, without in the least extricating him from his
                  embarrassment; and to hold her with one hand, whilst he drew out his pocket pistol
                  (a weapon he always carried about him) with the other, was more than he could
                  accomplish. In either case, he was likely to find himself as helpless and
                  prostrate as ever before he could strike a blow or draw a trigger.
               "Tarnation seize ye," he cried, looking into the animal's face, and shaking her by
                  the horns; "are you man, or beast. or devil, or what are ye?"
               Nannie bleated a reply. It was her defiance a
                     l'outrance.
               
               "O, good heavens!" cried Weeks, in accents of despair, "is there such another
                  country as this in all almighty creation? Here I am on my knees, pelted with rain,
                  half singed with lightning, and nearly beaten to a mummy by a goat, the very first
                  day I entered on my plans and speculations."
               But this condition of things could not long endure; and so Mr. Weeks, at last,
                  prudently determined to run for it, since he could see no other way of terminating
                  the fight. It was the resource of the coward, to be sure, but what else could be
                  done? Making a desperate effort, therefore, he threw the goat on her side by a
                  sudden wrench of the horns, and then, jumping on his feet, fled down the hill,
                  over the fence, and along the road, as fast as his long legs could carry him,
                  cursing lustily, as he ran, the unlucky day he ever had the misfortune to meet
                  Else Curley of the Cairn. And here we must leave him to pursue his dreary journey,
                  and return to other actors in the play.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               
                  Lanty acknowledges his Weakness for Fishing and Field Sports, but thinks Father
                     Brennan's Table nothing the worse for that. Dr. Henshaw is suddenly presented
                     to the Reader, and Uncle Jerry discovered in the Bottom of a Boat, supporting
                     the Negro with the broken Toes.
               
               CASTLE GREGORY, the family seat of the Petershams, on the banks of Lough Swilly,
                  was an odd-fashioned place as could be seen any where in Ireland or out of it.
                  Standing all alone, cold and bare, against the side of a mountain, it looked more
                  like a Rhenish fortress, or soldier's barrack, than a gentleman's residence. To
                  the traveller, whether he approached it by sea or land, it presented a bleak and
                  desolate appearance. There was neither tree to shelter it from the storm, nor
                  portico to break the blast from the hall door. It consisted of several piles of
                  buildings, erected at different periods, and jumbled together without the least
                  ornament or the slightest regard to congruity of outline. High dormer-windows and
                  tall brick chimneys rose up in remarkable confusion, and so closely packed
                  together that all the swallows and jackdaws of the parish seemed to gather there
                  in the season to build their nests. As to the pleasure grounds, if indeed they
                  should be so called, they had neither gate nor stone wall to enclose them. All
                  round about the place was open and bare; indeed, save a few acres of green lawn
                  before the hall door, where the old sun dial stood between the two lions couchant, there was nothing to be seen any where but
                     bent and sand hills. In front of the castle, Ballymastocker strand
                  and rabbit warren stretched away to Rathmullen Head, from the brow of which Dunree
                  battery pointed its guns across the narrows of the frith, and behind it Sugar Loaf Hill rose up like a pyramid
                  with its little coastguard station and flagstaff on top.
               Approaching Castle Gregory by water, from the direction of Araheera Point, the
                  immense precipices, which line the southern shore, completely hide it from the
                  traveller's view, till he comes within an oar's length or two of the usual landing
                  place. It was on this account, probably, that the occupants of a small sailing
                  boat, which glided up the channel the evening after the painful events related in
                  the preceding chapter, seemed quite unconscious of their near proximity to the
                  place, for the steersman put up his helm, and sent the boat sheering away in an
                  opposite direction, just as she had almost touched the nose of the quay.
               "Hilloa, there!" exclaimed one of the passengers. "Where away, now? You're taking
                  us over to Innishowen instead of Ballymastocker. Put her about, man; put her about
                  directly."
               "Why, sir, you must be mistaken," said the man at the rudder.
               "Not very likely. After boating about here nearly every week of my life for the
                  last fifteen years, I should know the lay of the land at least."
               "Well, there's Doughmore, where you see the smoke; and there's Buncrana——"
               "Nonsense, sir; don't you see the spars of the Water Hen here over the rocks
                  behind us? Round with her, sir, and let us ashore."
               "Begorra, I believe you're right," muttered the skipper, giving the helm a jerk
                  when he saw his mistake. "You're parfectly right, Father John—what in the world
                  could I be thinkin of!"
               "Some deviltry, I suppose—what you're always thinking of."
               "O, don't be so hard on me, yer riverince; you can't expect every one to know the
                  place as well as yourself, after cruisin about here on sick calls so many
                  years."
               "Hut, tut, sir; you're a pretty pilot, to carry us through these rocks and
                  currents," continued the priest, in a half-bantering, half-serious tone. "If you
                  knew only half as much about piloting as you do about poaching, you wouldn't be
                  amiss. There now—take care of the shoals here—steady that, steady; and the tide
                  will set us into the basin."
               When the boat touched the ground, the steersman stepped ashore, and drew up her
                  bows as far as he was able on the hard beach, (for it seemed the regular landing
                  place at that time of tide was rather inconvenient for his purpose,) and then
                  prepared to land his passengers.
               "Lane on me, yer riverince," said he, as the priest stood with his foot on the
                  gunwale, ready to jump; "lane on me; the shore's rough."
               "Yes; lean on you, till you break my neck, as you came within an inch of doing
                  last week. Away—I'll never trust you again."
               "But you'll hurt yer feet, Father John," persisted the skipper, with more concern
                  for the clergyman's safety than the danger seemed to warrant.
               "Never mind my feet—stand off—I'll none of your help."
               "Why, these hard, rough paving stones—they're terrible on the g—on tinder feet, I
                  mane; plaze your riverince, just lane on me once more."
               The priest, as he stood there with his foot on the gunwale, appeared to be a man
                  of middle age and stature, and active enough, one would suppose, to jump twice the
                  distance; but the skipper, who was evidently a humorous fellow in his way, had
                  probably discovered his weak point, and seemed disposed to tease him about it in
                  requital for the rebuke he gave him in the presence of strangers.
               "You may take my word for it, I'll lean upon you some of these days, my good
                  fellow," said the priest, pushing the skipper aside, and stepping ashore with the
                  greatest ease imaginable; "I'll lean upon you the right way, too."
               
               "But sure, yer riverince, accordin to yer own words, we're all bound to forgive
                  one another."
               "Never mind, sir; I have a crow to pluck with you, notwithstanding."
               "A crow!" retorted the skipper; "bedad, sir, that's tough pickin. But sure if ye'd
                  accept of a brace of grouse or wild duck, I'd bring them up——"
               "Hold your peace, Lanty Hanlon," exclaimed the priest,—for the skipper was no
                  other than our quondam friend,—"hold your peace; you're growing quite too malapert
                  of late. Perhaps if you thought I heard all about your treatment of Mr. Johnston's
                  gamekeeper, last Monday night, you would hardly be so bold."
               "Me! sir."
               "Ay, you, sir."
               "Why, now just listen to that, gentlemen. May I niver do harm, if it don't beat
                  Banagher out and out. Upon my conscience it's the most astonishin——"
               "O, you needn't affect all that innocent surprise," said the priest, interrupting
                  him. "I know you too well to be hoodwinked in that way, Mr. Hanlon. So not another
                  word now, but make haste to land your passengers."
               "O, to be sure—af coorse—that's always the way with ye," muttered Lanty, making a
                  show of hauling up the boat's side to the beach. "O, no, why shud I be allowed to
                  clear myself. Av coorse nobody in the whole parish does the laste harm in life,
                  from Monday mornin till Saturday night, but Lanty Hanlon. But isn't it mighty
                  odd," he continued, winking slyly at one of the occupants of the boat, "how bad
                  entirely he feels about the gamekeeper, when, if report be true, he was himself,
                  once in his days, the terror of all the gamekeepers in the barony! But it's not
                  that ails him—there's somethin else in the win. I'll wager he's angry about that
                  salmon I sent him last week;" and closing one eye hard, he looked with the other
                  at a little man seated in the bottom of the boat. "Sure if I cud only be sartint
                  it was that, I'd ask his pardon and promise niver to do the lake again."
               "Ha! ha! Capital! capital! Lanty," ejaculated the little man from under the
                  thwarts—"promise never to send him a salmon again if he only forgives you; he! he!
                  excellent, I declare!"
               "Salmon! What salmon, sir, do you mean?" demanded the priest.
               "O, nothin worth speakin of, yer riverince," replied Lanty, pushing up his
                  rabbit-skin cap from his eyes, and giving the boat another pull; "nothin but a
                  small twenty poundher I speared under Mr. Watts's milldam, and sent up to the
                  housekeeper for your last Friday's dinner; but af coorse yer riverince niver
                  suspected how it came, or ye wudn't taste a morsel of it for the world."
               "Ha! ha!" laughed the same voice; "that's it; give it to him, Lanty—that's just
                  his deserving."
               "Lanty Hanlon," exclaimed the priest, laughing at the joke himself—for he saw in
                  an instant he had been made unwittingly to entertain those very friends now
                  sitting in the boat to a stolen salmon, last Friday at dinner, despite all his
                  public threats and denunciations against so unjust and mischievous a
                  practice,—"Lanty Hanlon," he repeated, "should you attempt such a trick again, you
                  may depend on it I shall report you to the constabulary."
               "Ha! Lanty, listen to that—eh, how very big spoken he is! why, I yow and declare,
                  Lanty, I haven't seen a bit of game at his table these five years but he
                  threatened to throw out of the window."
               "O, it's wondherful, yer honor, how mighty tender his conscience is in regard of
                  game! But isn't it quare, sir, this weakness niver comes over his riverince while
                  there's a bone of it to be seen on the table afore him?"
               
               "Hold your scandalous tongue," cried the good-natured priest, raising his cane, at
                  last, over Lanty's head; "hold your impudent tongue, I say, or I'll be tempted to
                  make this acquainted with your ears;" and shaking the weapon at the provoking
                  fellow, he moved away from the shore, out of hearing of his voice.
               "Mr. Henshaw," said Lanty, (now that Father John had gone off beyond earshot,) and
                  changing his voice from the long drawl of the dry humorist to a more business-like
                  tone,—"Mr. Henshaw, be plazed, sir, to step ashore, till we thry and lift that
                  crathur of a blackamoor out; he looks like a mummy, poor sowl, he's so quate and
                  peaceable."
               The individual named Henshaw had been attentively reading a book, through a pair
                  of gold spectacles, all the time since the boat came in sight. So absorbed indeed
                  was he in the subject, that he never raised his eyes even for an instant, during
                  all the previous conversation, not even when the boat first struck the beach and
                  shook him in his seat.
               "Come, sir," repeated Lanty, touching him on the shoulder, "step out, if ye plaze;
                  we must hurry, or we'll be late."
               "What's the matter now?" demanded the individual in question, in a deep, gruff
                  voice, raising his eyes, and looking about him, as he spoke.
               Lanty again repeated his request.
               "Humph!" ejaculated the other, growling out his dissatisfaction at being
                  disturbed; and limiting his reply to the monosyllable, he rose slowly up from his
                  seat, and stalked over the boat's side, with the book under his arm.
               It may be as well to say a word or two here respecting this gentleman, since he
                  happens to be somewhat concerned,—though it be indirectly,—in the moral of our
                  story.
               He was now a man about forty-five years of age, a Scotchman by birth, and an old
                  college chum of Father John's. They had passed several years together at Oxford,
                  where they lived on the most intimate terms of friendship, till the latter
                  relinquished his studies for the bar, and returned home to prepare himself for the
                  priesthood. Since that time, Father Brennan had entirely lost sight of his
                  fellow-student, and probably never should have thought of renewing their former
                  intimacy, had he not chanced to see, one day, in an English newspaper, a notice of
                  the conversion to the Catholic church of David Henshaw, Esq., L. L. D., Barrister
                  at Law, and a distinguished contributor to the Edinburgh Review. This led to the
                  formation of a close and intimate correspondence between them, which, after a
                  continuance of two or three years, at length resulted in the doctor's present
                  visit to his old college friend and classmate. But the good priest was both
                  disappointed and shocked at the first interview; for he found his old acquaintance
                  not only a "stronger and sterner" Catholic after three years' matriculation, than
                  he was himself, though brought up almost within the sanctuary, but so ultra in all
                  his views of religion, that he began seriously to doubt whether the church had
                  lost or gained by the conversion. Henshaw was yet but a novice in the church, and
                  only saw her doctrine under its severest aspect. Her dogmas and anathemas were the
                  only signs of her divine power he could discover, whilst the more gentle and
                  delicate operations of her spirit on the hearts of men were entirely hidden from
                  his view. The consequence was, that he regarded her only in her coercive capacity,
                  and entirely overlooked the charity with which she exercised it. Hence Dr. Henshaw
                  became a very despot in religion. Without the least pity for those who had grown
                  up in the midst of hereditary prejudices against Catholicity, or compassion for
                  those who would willingly have embraced it, if they could only be made to see
                  their error, he consigned all beyond the pale of the church—all, without
                  exception—to unutterable destruction. Such was Dr. Henshaw. His head was Catholic,
                  but his heart was that of a pagan philosopher—as cold and unfeeling as a
                  stone.
               
               After gazing about him for a minute or two, he walked slowly up to where the
                  priest was standing, and folding his arms on his breast, turned his face again to
                  the beach, and began to converse with his reverend companion. The attitude he
                  assumed, and the air of self-complacency with which he pursed out his lips when he
                  spoke, could hardly fail to impress the most careless observer with the conviction
                  that he was a man quite conscious of his mental powers, and fully alive to a sense
                  of his personal importance. But we must leave him, for the present, with the
                  priest, and return to the remaining occupants of the boat.
               "It's a bad case," said the little man under the thwarts; "a very bad case. I'm
                  afraid one great toe and two little ones are gone entirely."
               "O, well, sure, if they're gone atself, your honor, he can do very well without
                  them," replied Lanty; "two or three toes is neither here nor there."
               "No; certainly not, in one respect, I admit—but this is an extraordinary case,
                  Lanty—you can't deny that. It's a a very deplorable case, and calls for a world of
                  sympathy;" and as the speaker raised his eyes up to Lanty's face, now bent over
                  him, there could be no mistaking the mild, benevolent countenance of Uncle Jerrie
                  Guirkie."
               Lanty looked kindly down for an instant on Uncle Jerry's upturned face. Not a word
                  he said, for there was no need of saying any thing; but the smile on his honest
                  countenance was more eloquent than words. It seemed to say, as plainly as looks
                  could say it, "God Almighty bless you for your kind heart—you're the best sowl in
                  the whole world."
               "I hope," said Uncle Jerry, endeavoring to draw up his little gaitered legs from
                  their painful posture, stretched out as they had been so long in the bottom of the
                  boat,—"I hope the poor fellow may be nothing the worse for the long voyage."
               "O, begorra, there's not a bit fear of him," replied Lanty; "the crathur's as
                  strong as a bullock. But isn't it mighty strange, sir, ye tuck such a liking to
                  him all at once; why, one'd think you had Christians enough down there at the
                  wreck to take your pick and choice iv, instead of carrying away a blackamoor like
                  that."
               "Why, the difference is only in the skin, Lanty."
               "The skin! Bedad, sir, and that atself's no thrifle."
               "Well, but he's a Christian."
               "That fellow?"
               "Yes, indeed, that very negro; and perhaps a better Christion, too, than a great
                  many of us."
               "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Lanty, in spite of his stoic gravity,—for he had never seen
                  a negro before in his life,—"ha, ha! Mr. Guirkie, I see you can joke as well as
                  another. But come, sir, there's no time to lose now; we must thry to lift him out
                  any way, whatever he is."
               "I don't joke, upon my honor, Lanty. He's really a Christian."
               "O, it's no matter; sure I don't care a pin about it; he's good enough in his own
                  way, I'll warrant. Let me help you out first, sir."
               "Nonsense, Lanty; you don't seem to believe me; I tell you again he's a Christian,
                  like yourself; and perhaps, if the truth were known, a much better one too,"
                  repeated Uncle Jerry, slightly vexed at Lanty's incredulity.
               "Well, bedad, yer honor," replied the incredulous Lanty, scratching his head, "I
                  can't say the compliment's very flattherrin, any way. Feth, maybe it's in regard
                  of his strength of religion you like him so much, sir."
               "No, not for that, either. It's because one of his race saved my life once in
                  Alabama, at the imminent risk of his own; and I made a vow then never to forget it
                  to the poor fellows wherever I met them. There's another reason, besides. I know
                  their natures better than most of my neighbors bors here, and think I can nurse him with greater
                  comfort to himself and pleasure to me."
               The unfortunate African, of whom Dr. Camberwell had told so pitiful a story, was
                  there indeed in proprio colore, sitting down low
                  in the boat, and resting his back against Uncle Jerry's breast, while the
                  kind-hearted little man's arms encircled the sufferer's breast with as much
                  tenderness as if it were his own son he had rescued from the jaws of death, and
                  was now bringing back in triumph to his paternal home. In this affectionate manner
                  he supported the poor invalid all the way round Araheera Point from Balleyhernan
                  to Castle Gregory, a distance of nearly ten miles. Often did he speak to him
                  during the voyage in the kindest and most soothing tones. Carefully did he wrap
                  the blankets closer and closer round his all but naked shoulders and stiffened
                  limbs, and pour into his parched lips a mouthful of cordial from his leathern
                  pocket flask. Once only did the party stop on their way, and that was at the
                  lighthouse, to exchange courtesies with Mr. Lee and his fair niece, and inquire
                  after the little cabin boy, whom the latter had carried home with her that morning
                  in her cockle shell over Lough Ely. At the priest's signal, Mary came running down
                  the steps to greet him, and receive his blessing,—which indeed the good man seemed
                  to give with all the fervor of his heart,—whilst Uncle Jerry looked lovingly up in
                  her face, stole her hand back, and kissed it with a tender respect that was in
                  admirable keeping with his own modest character and the maiden's gentle nature.
                  When the boat shoved off, the fair girl ran up the steps again, and stood for a
                  while on the edge of the precipice, under which the boat passed, her face radiant
                  with smiles, and her uplifted hand waving an adieu like a spirit about to ascend
                  into the regions of air.
               During the remainder of the voyage hardly a word was spoken. The priest and
                  Henshaw had been discussing literary subjects, all the way from Ballyhernan to the
                  lighthouse, and now, on resuming their journey, seemed to think they had said
                  enough for the present, and turned to occupy the remaining time each after his own
                  fashion. Father John opened his breviary and began to read his office. Dr. Henshaw
                  drew out a number of the "Edinburgh Review," and pulled down his gold spectacles
                  from the top of his head, where he had put them out of his way. Uncle Jerry gave
                  the negro a mouthful of wine, and gathered the blankets closer round him, and
                  Lanty Hanlon took another hitch on the running sheet, and laid himself over
                  quietly in the stern. In this way the little party composed themselves to rest
                  after the fatigues of the morning, while the boat glided slowly up the lough. As
                  they rounded Rathmullen Head, however, an accident occurred which might have
                  proved of serious consequence to the whole party.
               At this point Rathmullen Mountain runs out into the frith till it almost butts
                  against Dundrem Bluff, on the opposite shore. On each of these headlands a battery
                  of some ten or twelve guns protects the narrow channel, and so strong is the
                  current here, particularly at half tide, that it is quite impossible for a sail
                  boat to stem it, except under a strong breeze from the mouth of the lough. Lanty
                  saw the ebb tide was beginning to tell upon him as he reached this spot, and
                  making the helm and sheet fast, he stepped forward and shipped the bow oars to
                  help him against the stream; but hardly had he pulled half a dozen strokes, when a
                  large boat, rowed by four stout men and steered by a tall old woman, wrapped in a
                  gray cloak, shot out from one of the dark corners under the headland, and passing
                  the jutting rock, round which he was endeavoring to make his way, struck his
                  little craft so violently as almost to jerk his unsuspecting passengers into the
                  sea. As it was, he lost one of his oars, which, breaking the thowl pins, came
                  within an inch of breaking his own head, as it swept round and fell overboard.
               
               "Hah!" cried Lanty, when the boat righted again after the stem of the other had
                  shaved its way down her side, and fell off across her stern into the stream,—"that
                  was near nickin."
               "Who are they?" demanded the priest, turning suddenly to look after the boat.
               "If she's living, that's Else Curley, of the Cairn, in the stern sheets," replied
                  Lanty.
               "What, is it possible?"
               "The very woman, sir; and that's young Barry, the rebel, beside her."
               "He is a very foolish young man, I fear," said the priest; "he must certainly be
                  caught if he stay here."
               After some little exertion, Mr. Guirkie succeeded in extricating his limbs from
                  their disagreeable position, and, with Lanty's help, found himself safe at last on
                     terra firma. The three gentlemen then came
                  together, to consult about transporting the negro to Greenmount. Uncle Jerry was
                  for sending immediately to the next village for a horse and cart, and stretching
                  him on a mattress laid on the bottom of it. Dr. Henshaw, on the other hand,
                  thought he might do very well in the boat house, for the night, with some clean
                  straw, and Lanty to watch with him; more especially as the boat house was close at
                  hand, and the night pleasant and warm; while they could return home themselves,
                  and send over an easy conveyance next morning. But the priest was of a different
                  opinion from both, and thought it much better for all parties to sleep at Castle
                  Gregory. "The night would be very dark," he said, "the roads both deep and rutty
                  after the late rains, and, besides, 'twould take two hours, at least, to procure a
                  suitable conveyance for the negro if they carried him home, or for themselves if
                  they left him behind." As to accommodations for the invalid, he had no doubt
                  Captain Petersham would cheerfully order him a comfortable berth, and send his
                  servants vants to carry him up to the castle. After some objections, on the part
                  of Uncle Jerry, on the score of delay and the immediate necessity for medical
                  attendance,—objections which we fear very much were a little aggravated by the
                  dread of Mrs. Motherly's grave displeasure at his long absence,—and on the part of
                  Dr. Henshaw, against what he called an unpardonable intrusion into a gentleman's
                  family, particularly at so late an hour, and accompanied, as they were, by a
                  notorious poacher and a half-dead negro, "hawking the latter aboot all day," he
                  added, gruffly, "in a most absurd and redeeculous manner, from house to house and
                  rock to rock, till he expected the whole country round should ring with it for the
                  next twalve-month to come"—after these objections, we say, were made and disposed
                  of, the party, at last, concluded to leave the negro with Lanty, in the boat
                  house, and put up at Castle Gregory for the night. Accordingly, they advanced to
                  the house, and Father John, raising the knocker, knocked loudly on the door.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               
                  Being the shortest Chapter in the Book, is devoted exclusively to Mr.
                     Weeks.
               
               MR. EPHRAIM WEEKS, as the reader may have already suspected, came to Ireland to
                  speculate in matrimony. He left home with a cigar in his mouth, and stepped aboard
                  the packet as she moved past the wharf, with as careless and indifferent an air as
                  if he were dropping down to Sandy Hook to visit a friend. As to meeting with any
                  serious obstacle, in a country whose inhabitants, to take them in the lump, were
                  no better than South Sea Islanders, he never dreamed of it for a moment: why
                  should he? He knew what the Irish were,
                  every soul of them, and could read them through as he could the alphabet. He met
                  them on the wharves, on the railroads, on the steamboats, in the police offices,
                  saw them dramatized on the stage, tried at the bar, and dissected in the pulpit.
                  In a word, he knew what they were at home in Ireland, just as well as if he had
                  been living with them there all his lifetime. What had he to fear? He had
                  succeeded so far in various speculations in New England, and how could he possibly
                  fail in a land of such ignorance and beggary as Ireland? To be sure, there must
                  necessarily be some intelligent men in the country—it could not well be
                  otherwise—but what of that? there were no smart men amongst them.
                     Smartness to him was every thing. It was the embodiment of all the
                  virtues, moral and intellectual—the only quality for which man deserved admiration
                  or respect. The estimate he formed of his neighbor's moral worth was not in
                  proportion to his integrity of character, but to his ability for speculating and
                  driving hard bargains. The man who contented himself with a competence and a quiet
                  life at home he despised; but the jobber in stocks, who was smart enough to make a
                  lucky hit on 'change, though he risked half a dozen men's fortunes on the chance,
                  was the man after his heart. Such were Mr. Weeks's sentiments. Nor was he much to
                  blame for them either; for he was bred and born in the midst of speculators. Every
                  man he met in the street, from the newsboy to the judge, from the policeman to the
                  governor, was a speculator in something. He began himself, in his very infancy, to
                  speculate in marbles and hobby-horses; and if he made but a cent a week, his
                  father patted him on the head, and prophesied his future greatness. When arrived
                  at man's estate, he found himself in the company of young men, whose sole study
                  was to make money in the easiest manner and shortest time. He saw them every where
                  engaged in some kind of traffic,—no matter what, if it only happened to be
                  profitable. Whilst in other countries each grade in the community had its own
                  legitimate trades and occupations, it was the very reverse in the States. There it
                  was a universal scramble, in which every body snatched at what came handiest. The
                  tailor dropped his needle and mounted the stump; the lawyer burned his briefs to
                  trade in molasses; the shoemaker stuck his awl in the bench and ascended the
                  pulpit; and the shopboy flung his yardstick on the counter and went off to edit a
                  Sunday newspaper. Surrounded on all sides by such influences, what could Mr. Weeks
                  have possibly been but what he was—a speculator in chances—a man of one idea—one
                  object—one aspiration—money? Learning was nothing in his estimation, if it failed
                  to realize money; nay, the highest mental accomplishment was not only valueless,
                  but contemptible without money. In this respect Mr. Weeks represented a large
                  class of his countrymen of New England;—we say a class, for it would be unjust to
                  say more. He was not an American gentleman, by any means, either in habits or
                  education. That was plain the instant he spoke a word or moved a muscle, and those
                  of his fellow-citizens who could rightfully claim that distinction would never
                  have recognized him as one of their number. He was, in short, a Yankee,—a man to
                  be met with every day and every where—on the side-walks—at the banks—in the
                  theatre—in the cars—standing at hotel doors picking his teeth—selling soap at
                  cattle shows—or lobbying for a patent right behind his agent's back in the Senate
                  House. But to return.
               With such views and sentiments as we have here ascribed to Mr. Weeks, it may be
                  easily conceived with what assurance of success he landed in Ireland, and with
                  what confidence he entered on his plans and speculations. The possession of Mary
                  Lee as his lawful wedded wife was the great secret of his journey. Why it was so
                  the sequel must tell. It appears, however, he had but a limited time to accomplish
                  his designs; for hardly had he reached Crohan, when he called to see Else Curley.
                  The reputation she had acquired, all the country round, and the wonderful stories told of her power
                  over the spirits of the nether world, led him to think he could win her to his
                  interest by tempting her cupidity, and that she, as a secret agent, might do what
                  it would otherwise require a long courtship to effect. How his expectations were
                  met, in this respect, will be seen in due course of the story. For the present, we
                  must leave him to battle with the storm as best he may, after his desperate but
                  disastrous rencontre with "Nannie," and follow Else and the stranger to the
                  "Cairn."
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               
                  The Outlaw's Interview with Else Curley.—Her Hatred of the Hardwrinkles, and
                     its Cause.—Barry evades the detective Officers.
               
               WHEN Else had placed a rush light in the wooden candlestick affixed to her
                  spinning wheel, and thrown off her gray cloak, she drew a small silver-mounted
                  pistol from her bosom, and laying it on the table, motioned the young man to a
                  seat.
               "How come ye here, Master Randall, at this hour?" she demanded.
               "The fates drove me, I suppose," replied her guest, smiling.
               "Psaugh!—this is no time to play the fool;—why are ye here, I say?" drawing down
                  her shaggy eyebrows, and looking sternly at him as she spoke.
               "Why, how now!" exclaimed the stranger; "is Nannie sick, or old Bat's fiddle
                  broke, that you're so much out of sorts?"
               "Master Randall, look at that weapon," said Else. "I risked my life for yer sake
                  and hers within this very hour, and carried that with me to defend it. I made this
                  Yankee feel he was in my power, and for that raison didn't know the minute he'd
                  silence my tongue forever with a pistol ball or a dirk knife. Now, I ask ye, is it
                  manly in ye, after this, to come back here again to idle away yer time, tryin to
                  get a word or a look at this silly girl, when it's in Dublin or Cork ye'd ought to
                  be strivin to keep her and her uncle out iv the walls of a jail. Hoot, toot, sir,
                  I thought there was more i' the man in ye."
               "Well, of that," replied Randall, (for we must call him so in future,) "of that I
                  can say little; but be assured, Else, no trifling obstacle could balk me on such
                  an errand. Nothing but absolute necessity compelled me to return."
               "Necessity!"
               "Yes. The police headed me off below Burnfoot, after landing from the ferry, at
                  Rathmullan, and chased me through Buncrana to Lambert's Point, where you brought
                  the boat to my relief."
               "So ye escaped in the skiff, yesterday, I suppose, from Dunree."
               "Yes; just had time to jump in, cut the painter, and shove off, when three of my
                  pursuers sprang down after me on the beach."
               "And fired?"
               "One of them, only. The ball hit me on the head, but did no harm."
               "Humph!" said Else, sitting down slowly on her low "creepie stool," "and so the
                  bloodhounds got on yer trail, after all."
               "Yes, fairly started me," responded Randall; "when they'll run me down, however,
                  remains yet to be seen."
               "It looks strange," said Else, half speaking to herself.
               "What?"
               "How they knew ye in that disguise."
               
               "It does look a little strange, I must confess," replied Randall; "for I thought
                  it impenetrable to every eye but those of Else Curley and Mary Lee. Judge of my
                  astonishment, then, when I beheld straight before me, on the first public house
                  door I passed, a full length figure of myself in this very dress."
               "Tell me," said Else, after a moment's reflection, "didn't ye wear that dress
                  ornst at Father John's?"
               "I did; but it was night then, and no one saw me except the priest and his
                  housekeeper."
               "Don't be too sure i' that, Master Randall."
               "Quite sure."
               "Humph! didn't ye tell me about passin somebody that night, on the road near
                  Crohan gate house, that seemed to look sharp at ye?"
               "Crohan gate house—let me see. Yes, I remember now. O, that was some traveller—I
                  suspect."
               "Was he a tall, thin, dark lookin man?
               "Yes, rather."
               "Wore crape on his hat?"
               "Yes."
               "I thought so."
               "Who was he?"
               "Robert Hardwrinkle, of Crohan."
               "What! your great enemy—this Yankee's cousin?"
               "That very Yankee's cousin. He's the man that bethrayed ye."
               "No, no, Else, you must be mistaken. Mr. Hardwrinkle's a gentleman, and could
                  never be guilty of so treacherous an act."
               "Cudn't he?"
               "No, Else, it's nothing but your inveterate hatred of the man makes you suspect
                  him."
               "Hoot, toot, Master Randall; don't be foolish," replied Else.
               "I know what he is, kith and kin, for threescore years an more. Ay, ay, to my own
                  grief I know him. But let him look to himself, for the time's not far away when
                  the long recknin atween him and me must be settled—let him look to himself."
               "Do the man no harm on my account," said Randall: "if he has really sent these
                  officers on my track, it's only what a thousand others had done with as little
                  shame or scruple. For my part, I forgive him, nor would I hurt a hair of his head
                  this moment if he lay at my feet."
               "O, forgive him, an welcome," said Else, "since yer so good a Christian; forgive
                  him, by all manes. I'm sure it's none o' my business if ye forgive him, and marry
                  his lean sister Rebecca, the psalm-singer, too, into the bargain. All I say is,
                  let him be ready; for there's an account atween him and me that nothing but his
                  cowardly blood can settle."
               "Why, Else, this is sheer madness," said Randall, reprovingly. "How is it the very
                  thought of this man inflames your resentment so much?"
               "So well it might," responded Else, raising her head and folding her arms on her
                  hard, weather-beaten breast, as she looked across the table at her companion. "So
                  well it might. Listen to me, Randall Barry. If this man's father first brought
                  your only sister to sin an shame, and then sent yer brother to die with irons on
                  his limbs in a strange land, for no other earthly raison than because he demanded
                  satisfaction for the injury done his own flesh an blood—if he turned out yer
                  mother, ould and helpless, from the homestead she was born in, and her people
                  afore her, for three generations—when the father died, if the son sent yerself to
                  jail twist in five years on false charges—when ye came out and built with yer own
                  hands a sheelin to shelter ye from the storms on these blake mountains, if he
                  burnt it over yer head—ay, and if he driv ye at last, Randall Barry, as he druv
                  me, to burrow here lake the 'brock' on
                  the crags of Benraven,—I ask ye, would ye forgive him, if he did that to you an
                  yours? An ye felt his neck undher yer heel, wudn't ye crush it down—down in the
                  dust with as little pity as ye'd feel for the wasp that stung ye?"
               "Not I," replied Randall, "not I. To kill even an enemy, whom you happen to find
                  in your power, is an act of cowardly murder. And, believe me, Else, your own sleep
                  would be none the sounder in the grave for having this man's blood upon your
                  hands."
               "And yet," retorted Else, "you and yer companions id stain yer hands with the
                  blood iv thousands, that did ye far less wrong than he did me."
               "Perhaps so; but in broad daylight, at least; not assassin-like, in the dark."
               "I see no difference," replied Else, "night or day—it's only death."
               "Ay, but surely it's a less crime to put the enemies of your country and of human
                  liberty to death in a fair field and open fight, than to commit a midnight murder
                  like a cut-throat or incendiary, with the dirk or the brand."
               "Who spoke of dirk or brand?" demanded Else.
               "You did," replied Randall, promptly. "You did a dozen times within the month. And
                  now my fear is, your new charge against this man will bring down your
                  long-threatened vengeance on his head sooner than I anticipated. But hear me, Else
                  Curley,——"
               "Hould yer tongue, Randall Barry," interrupted the old woman, "hould yer tongue;
                  yer but a silly boy. Pshaugh! it's little ye know iv Else Curley 'i the 'Cairn.'
                  What! ye think after waitin and watchin for my hour of revenge so many long years,
                  I'd bungle it now for your sake? Ha! ha! poor foolish boy! D'ye think a woman like
                  me, that fursaked God an salvation thirty odd years ago, for fear they'd come
                  atween her and her dark thoughts—a woman whose hopes iv vengeance geance, day
                  after day, were like draps iv new life blood to her withered heart—d'ye think an
                  outcast like me, a bein that men dread to look on, an women spake of undher their
                  breath, wud drag out life as I did, for no other raison or motive, but waitin
                  patiently for my hour to come? D'ye think, I say, Randall Barry, I'd let the
                  paltry matter of his bethrayin you to the spies of the Castle bring down the blow
                  one minute sooner than it ought to fall? Pshaugh! man, ye don't know me yet."
               "I know you to be a dangerous woman," responded Randall, rising from his chair,
                  and buckling his belt tighter round his waist, as if preparing to leave. "But I
                  warn you," he continued, "I warn you I shall be no party to this contemplated
                  murder; and, much as you have befriended me, Else Curley, I shall, nevertheless,
                  do all in my power to thwart your wicked designs. Rebel and felon as I am, I shall
                  never abet or connive at murder, notwithstanding."
               "And what then?" again demanded Else—"wud ye turn informer?"
               "Assuredly—the instant you attempt to execute your hellish purpose."
               "Then," cried Else, snatching the pistol from the table, and raising up her tall
                  form from the low stool on which she sat, till she stood erect as a statue before
                  the young outlaw, her gray eyes flashing fire and the muscles of her face
                  qnivering with emotion as she spoke, "I swear to ye," she cried, holding up the
                  weapon in her fleshless hand, "I swear by them heavens I niver expect to enther,
                  if ye were my own born son, Randall Barry, an attempt to save that man from the
                  clutches i' my vengeance, ye'll die the death."
               "Tigress," muttered Randall between his teeth, as he threw on his sea cap and
                  turned to quit the cabin. "Tigress, I despise your threats."
               "Stop," said Else, stepping back and leaning against the door; "stop, young man,
                  and listen to me. It's now fifty long
                  years since yer grandfather, Lieutenant Dick Barry, saved my life at the risk of
                  his own. It was the day Colonel Clinton took Madeira. He carried me in his own
                  arms from the spot where my husband fell. I made a vow then on my knees afore God,
                  if iver it come in my way to befriend him or his, I'd do it."
               "I release you from your vow," said Randall; "let me pass."
               "Be silent, boy, and listen to me again," cried Else. "You'll not pass here till I
                  spake. Listen to me. I love Mary Lee more nor iver I loved woman afore, barin the
                  sister that died from me, in shame an a broken heart. Ay, she died in these
                  withered arms; she died laughin, Randall Barry, for she died mad—mad—mad; she died
                  with the bloom of seventeen still on her cheeks. Listen to me. I love Mary Lee
                  more nor iver I loved woman but her; and well I might too, for it was these hands
                  saved her from the wrack of the Saldana; it was these hands untwisted her arms
                  from her dead mother's neck, among the rocks of Araheera; and it was these hands
                  nursed her on Nannie's milk for eighteen months, till them came to claim her that
                  had the right to claim her. O, no wondher she's dear t' me; no wondher I'd watch
                  her an guard her like the apple of my eye. But still, much as I love her, an much
                  as I love yerself, Randall Barry, for yer granfather's sake, still, I say, as
                  there's a heaven above me, I'd rather see ye both dead at my feet this minute,
                  than part with the hope of payin back the Hardwrinkles, mother an son, for the
                  wrongs they did to me an mine. Ha, ha!" laughed the old woman bitterly, as she
                  grew more and more excited; "ha! ha! they burned my cabin twiste to the groun, and
                  driv me out to sleep at night with the black cock an the plover, an to wandher by
                  day over the dreary mountains, hungry and barefoot; but their hour'll soon come.
                  Ay, ay, I'll be even with them yit. Ha! ha! let them look to themselves; the blind
                  fiddler's wife, the worker of spells and charms, the woman that'd sell her soul
                  for money, ould Else Curley i' the 'Cairn,' has strength an courage enough left
                  yit to handle a dirk or fire a fagot."
               Randall gazed at her with astonishment as she spoke. Her person seemed to dilate
                  and grow younger as her face swelled with passion. She had broken, with a sudden
                  snap, the string that confined her cap, to relieve her throat from a sense of
                  suffocation; and now, as her short gray hair fell in tufts over her forehead and
                  cheeks, she looked like a pythoness, breathless under the frenzy of
                  inspiration.
               "My God," said Randall, still gazing at her as she stood before him, "is it
                  possible that so much gratitude and love can exist in the same breast with such
                  demoniac hatred for a fellow-creature? Here is a woman—ay, a very woman—who has
                  lived since before I was born on the bare hope of being one day able to revenge
                  her wrongs. That hope was the only ray of consolation that ever fell on her
                  desolate heart. How great must have been her injuries to have earned so terrible a
                  resentment! And yet this creature loves Mary Lee like a mother, and already has
                  risked her life, more than once, to save mine."
               "Else," said he, at length, laying his hand kindly on her shoulder, "I pity you
                  from my heart. Sit down and compose yourself. I would speak with you more
                  reasonably on this subject."
               She obeyed him instantly, for the touch of his friendly hand softened her more
                  than words could have done.
               "Tell me," said Randall, "is this Yankee, this cousin of the Hardwrinkles, to be
                  included in the catastrophe?"
               "No," replied Else.
               "What business have you with him, then?"
               "I make use iv him to sarve my own ends—nothin more."
               "And these are——"
               
               "First, that he'd supply me with money for thravelin expenses; an, secondly, that
                  he'd be an excuse for drawin me about Crohan, to watch my chances."
               "Ha! I understand you. But the travelling expenses—where——?"
               "Connecticut, or wheriver else he came from. We must send a thrusty messenger to
                  make out where he lives, and ye may be sure Edward Talbot's not far from
                  that."
               "So you'll employ his own money to defeat him?"
               "Of coorse," replied Else.
               "And why, then, did you acquaint him with your knowledge of the secret?"
               "That he'd pay me the betther for keepin it."
               "Good; but are you sure he'll not feel apprehensive of your disclosing it to Mary
                  or her uncle?"
               "Not the laste in the worl," replied Else.
               "Still, the whole affair is but mere suspicion, after all."
               "What? about Mr. Talbot bein alive?"
               "Yes."
               "Well, call it whatsomiver name ye plaze, it's sartinty enough for me. I niver
                  thought any thing else but that he was livin somewhere in furrin parts."
               "And how will you account for this Yankee's correspondent speaking of the dying
                  man as Lambton in that letter of his you picked up after he left the cabin here?
                  How can you account for that, if he be really Edward Talbot?"
               "Quite easy," responded Else. "It was the name he went by in America."
               "Nonsense, woman! you make the most absurd and ridiculous suppositions; would you
                  have him change his name with his country?"
               "Feth wud I, an good reason he had to do that same, let me tell you. Didn't he
                  fire a pistol bullet at his wife in her own room, with the child in her arms, the
                  very same evenin he come home after killing Captain Blenherhasset in a dewel that
                  his own infarnal jealousy driv him to fight for her sake; an was there a corner in
                  London nixt day that hadn't a bill posted up on it, offerin a reward of a thousand
                  pound to the first man 'id take him? Humph! raison indeed; bedad, I think that 'id
                  surely be raison enough for any man to change his name wheriver he went. No, no,
                  Masther Randall, Edward Talbot's livin jist as sure as you're livin, if he didn't
                  die since the first iv May last; an that very Lambton he writes about is the man.
                  Whether he gives himself that name for fear the letter might fall into other
                  hands, or whether Mr. Talbot took the name himself, I can't tell—but ye may depind
                  on it Lambton's the man."
               "Perhaps so."
               "O, feen a doubt of it; and ye'll see that too, when Lanty comes back."
               "What, Lanty Hanlon?"
               "Ay, Lanty Hanlon; ye heard of him, I suppose."
               "And saw him, too. Don't you remember to have recommended him to me two or three
                  weeks ago, as a trusty messenger to send on a certain important business to
                  Derry?"
               "And ye sent him?"
               "Certainly."
               "Well?"
               "Well, he broke trust at the very outset."
               "Lanty Hanlon!"
               "Ay, Lanty Hanlon. Instead of crossing the lough at Doughbeg, he strolled down the
                  shore to Ballymastocker, to see a cockfight, and missed the tide."
               "O, feth, as to that," said Else, "I wudn't put it past him. He's the very ould
                  lad himself in regard to cockfighting."
               "Yes; but he was made well aware of the urgency of the message, and should have
                  postponed his personal gratification till his return."
               
               "Postpone, indeed! In troth, Master Randall, he'd postpone goin to heaven, if
                  there wus a cockfight 'ithin five miles of him; that an huntin's his wakeness,
                  poor fellow. An what excuse did he make when he came back?"
               "He never came back to make any. Instead of that, he sent me word he was in the
                  hands of the police for beating a gamekeeper, and would see me as soon as he got
                  clear."
               "Humph!" said Else, "that's another of his wakenesses."
               "It's rather an odd kind of weakness," said Randall, laughing.
               "Well, its natural for him, poor fellow, any way; the whole breed of him hated
                  gamekeepers for five generations back. And so the man was too many for him?"
               "No, he made his escape then, but the police caught him next day. It appears on
                  his return he crossed the mountain with his dogs, and met Lord Leitrim's
                  gamekeepers, who gave him chase. Two of them he distanced, and the third he led
                  into some lonely spot, beat him there soundly, and then left him gagged with his
                  own handkerchief, and tied neck and heels to an old hawthorn tree beside a well,
                  where he was found next morning, half dead from cold and hunger."
               "It's jist like him," said Else, "for the villain's niver out of mischief. But
                  still he's as true as steel when ye keep him away from timptation."
               "And how is that to be done, pray? Will he not meet with as much temptation on his
                  way to the United States and back, as he does here in the parish of
                  Clondavadoc?"
               "Not he," replied Else; "I'll trust him for that. The minute he finds it's on Mary
                  Lee's affairs he's goin, the sarpint himself wudn't timpt him. But," she added,
                  correcting herself, "I'm not sure yit whither he'll have to go at all or not; may
                  be somethin might turn up to save the journey and the expinse too. It's well to be
                  prepared, any way, you know."
               "Certainly. But is Lanty so devoted to Mary as you say?"
               "He'd lay down his life for her every day i' the year. There's not a livin thing
                  he loves like her in the whole worl."
               "Possible?"
               "Didn't ye know it? He cud sit lookin at her from morn-in to night, an niver be
                  dry or hungry. And it's a mighty queer notion, too, he has about her."
               "What's that?"
               "Why, he thinks it 'id be a sin to love her as he'd love any other girl."
               "How so?"
               "Bekase she's so good, he says. And it's all come of a drame he had onst about the
                  Blissed Virgin.—Och, och," said Else, suddenly interrupting herself, "an many a
                  purty drame I had of her myself in my young days, when I ust to wear her scappler,
                  an gather the May flowers for her alther; but them things is all over now. I can
                  niver drame or pray to her again, for the black thoughts druv her image out iv my
                  heart fer ivermore. And Mary Lee, too, the poor child, whin she spakes to me
                  sometimes of an evenin, sittin out here on the hill side, about the marcy of
                  Christ, an the bright heavens above, an the goodness of God to them that repent,
                  her words and looks make me tremble all over like a windle straw.—But, as I was
                  sayin," she continued, wiping her face with her apron, as if to brush away every
                  thing that could blunt in the slightest degree her keen and long-cherished
                  resentment,—"as I was tellin ye about Lanty; he had a drame one night, when he
                  thought the Blissed Virgin come to him houldin Mary Lee by the hand, and tould him
                  to watch her an take care of her as long as he lived, on her
                  account."
               "A delightful illusion, I must confess," said Randall.
               
               "I'm not a Catholic, you know, Else, but there is a poetry in the Catholic
                  conception of the attributes of the Virgin which always had an inexpressible charm
                  for me. I once saw a beautiful little beggar girl at Florence, kneeling before one
                  of her shrines, her hands and eyes raised in mute supplication for the crippled
                  mother who sat by her side, and I thought I had never seen a finer picture of
                  religion in my life."
               "Well, well, dear," ejaculated Else; "I don't know any thing about such picthers
                  now; I ust once, but that time's gone. But, as I was sayin, since he dramed that
                  drame of the Blissed Virgin (God forgive me for mintionin her name) and Mary Lee,
                  he can't think of one without the ither, an ivery wish of Mary's is like a command
                  to him from heaven."
               "How very extraordinary!" said Randall.
               "The drame?"
               "No, but that every one's so peculiarly affected by the words and looks of this
                  girl."
               "Well, it's jist the same with the children she taches the Christen docthrin to
                  down there in her little chapel undher the rock; they'd pit their very heads
                  undher her feet; an what's quarest of all, there's a dog in the town there below
                  that tears ivery body he can get a hoult of—the crossest animal iver run on four
                  feet; well, that dog, the first minute he seen her, crooched at her feet, and
                  kissed her hand, jist as if she fed him with it all his lifetime; and iver since,
                  as soon as he sees her, he runs away whinin afther her, and niver quits her
                  company till he leaves her at the lighthouse gate."
               "And old Drake, too, is very fond of her," observed Randall.
               "Hoot! as for Drake," replied Else, "Drake can read her countenance betther nor
                  you or I can. He knows who she likes an disn't like the minute he sees them. Sure,
                  when she lay sick last Haliday, he niver left her room night or day, nor niver as
                  much as tasted mate kind for a whole week, till Roger had to lift him on a chair
                  by her bedside and let her feed him with her own hands. Roger swears he saw the
                  tears fallin down the dog's cheeks, when he looked up in her face, and tuk the
                  food from her fingers."
               "She's too good and too pure for me, Else," said Randall, thoughtfully; "and I
                  fear such a creature could never be happy with the heretic and revolutionist I
                  am."
               "You'll not be either long, if she marries ye," said Else; "take my word for
                  it."
               "And why not?"
               "O, the Lord luck t'ye, Master Randall; she'd make a Catholic iv ye in three weeks
                  'ithout one word's spakin."
               "Indeed! by what means, pray?"
               "Why, she'd make her religion look so good an holy in yer eyes, jist by her ivery
                  day ways, that ye cudn't help lovin it yerself. An as for the rest, she loves her
                  ould country as well as you, Randall Barry, woman an all as she is, an wud suffer
                  as willingly too, may be, if all came to all. But hush! didn't I hear some noise
                  outside?"
               "No—it's only the storm whistling in the thatch."
               "Well, it's time, any way, ye'd have somethin to ate afther yer long race;" and
                  rising from the 'creepie,' she produced a cold fowl from the recesses of a little
                  cupboard concealed in the thickness of the cabin wall, and laid it on the table.
                  Then stooping, she raised up the hearth-stone, and disappeared in the dark opening
                  beneath with surprising agility for a woman of her years. The action, strange as
                  it was, did not appear to excite the young man's curiosity in the least; he
                  glanced merely at Else as she descended, and then leaning his head on his hand,
                  composed himself to wait patiently for her return.
               As he sat there by the table in the dim light of the rush candle, there was
                  nothing about his person worthy of special notice. His figure was light and
                  graceful, his limbs well moulded and muscular, and his height, if we could judge
                  fairly in the posture he had taken, a little above the middle size. His long black hair fell in disorder over the
                  low collar of his blue jacket, from the breast pockets of which the buts of a pair
                  of travelling pistols still peeped out. His cravat, as we have said already, was
                  knotted loosely in front, sailor fashion, and revealed a neck by far too fair for
                  a seafaring man, and one it would have puzzled a detective officer to reconcile
                  with his general appearance. But if there was nothing striking in his person,
                  there was that in his handsome face which gave character and interest to the whole
                  man—a shade of quiet melancholy, which at once impressed the beholder with the
                  conviction that the young outlaw was no lover of war or bloodshed for the
                  gratification they afforded him, but reluctantly adopted as a last and desperate
                  resource for retrieving the fallen fortunes of his country. His countenance was
                  calm and composed, without a trace of the socialist or the red republican to
                  vulgarize its fine expression.
               "Ay, ay," said he at length, his voice barely audible as he murmured out the
                  words; "let my father disinherit me if he will, and the spies of the government
                  dog me step by step, till they drive me at last to bay; still I shall neither sue
                  for pardon, nor fly from the land of my birth and my affection to beg a home on a
                  foreign shore. To abandon Mary Lee would now be impossible, were she as
                  indifferent to me as the meanest peasant girl in the kingdom; but were she even
                  dead to-morrow, and all my hopes buried with her in the grave, I should wait and
                  watch, and bide my time to renew the contest; I should still cling to the hope
                  that God, in his own good time, would inspire the young men of the land to rise
                  once more—not as wranglers and brawlers—not as mercenary anarchists and sordid
                  demagogues, but like Spartan brothers, to do, and dare, and die for their
                  country's weal. To see that blessed day, I could eke out life in the lowest
                  caverns of my native hills. To behold the sunburst, as of old, waving once
                     more before an army of gallant young Irishmen—true to the sacred cause
                  and to each other—true to right, to justice, and to honor! O, to see such an army
                  in battle array on the sunny slopes of old Clontarf, marching down, with fife and
                  drum, and colors flying, to drive the Saxon dogs from their long-lost homes and
                  pleasant firesides, and to be allowed to strike one good blow myself for the sake
                  of old times and old memories—O, Mary Lee, Mary Lee, much as I love you, I could
                  abandon you for this! But alas, alas! years must elapse ere it can happen;
                  meanwhile I wander among the hills a rebel and an outlaw, hunted and proscribed
                  like the vilest malefactor. Be it so; I have risked my all on a single cast, and
                  lost it. Well, I shall try to abide the consequence as best I may. Let them hunt
                  me, and catch me, if they can. I'll disappoint them so long as I'm able to fly or
                  defend myself. When I can no longer do either, I needs must submit."
               "There," said Else, emerging from the dark opening, and laying a bottle on the
                  table, from which she had already drawn the cork, "there's a bottle of ould Port
                  that lay down there below these twenty years and more; take a drink of it with
                  that could widgeon Roger left me yesterday; it'll do ye good afther yer day's
                  fatague."
               Randall had just emptied the first glass, laid it on the table again, and was
                  about to address himself to the cold widgeon, when Else pressed his arm, and
                  looked significantly towards the door.
               "What's the matter?"
               "Whisht! that's Nannie's blate—there's somebody comin."
               "O, no, it's the poor beast asking shelter from the storm."
               "Hush! I know Nannie better—there it's again."
               Randall rose quickly, threw on his sea cap, and buttoned his jacket.
               "If they want me," he said, "they must follow me to Aranmore. Good night,
                  Else."
               "To Aranmore?"
               
               "Yes—no possibility now of reaching Dublin by any other route. I hope to find a
                  fishing smack there from the Skerries, to take me off."
               "Take another glass, Master Randall."
               "No more—good night, Else;" and jumping into the mysterious opening, he
                  disappeared, leaving Else to replace the covering, remove the viands, and receive
                  the new comers, whose footfalls she could now hear distinctly at the door.
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               
                  Weeks thinks himself very ill treated, and the Irish the most savage, beggarly
                     "Varmint in all Creation."—He is conducted to a Wedding, and having taken a
                     Glass or two, under protest, dances an Irish Jig, to the great delight of the
                     Company.
               
               IT was now within a short hour of midnight, and Weeks, drenched and weary, still
                  plodded his lonely way over the hills of Benraven. The night was very stormy, and
                  Mr. Weeks very much out of sorts. In truth, he was troubled exceedingly, both in
                  mind and body—especially in the latter, for he had unfortunately lost his cap in
                  his rencontre with Nannie, and was obliged to use his pocket handkerchief instead.
                  It was a poor substitute to be sure; but what else could he do? He had already
                  drawn his coat tails over his head, but found it impossible to keep them down on
                  account of the violence of the wind. Still, the wind and the rain together, though
                  bad enough, were not the worst he had to contend with; the darkness was the great
                  difficulty, for he could hardly "see his finger before him," nor tell whether he
                  was going to Crohan, or back again by some circuitous route to Araheera Head.
                  Twice, indeed, he had the good fortune to meet with benighted travellers like
                  himself, who seemed to know all about the roads, and took, as he fancied, very
                  great pains to set him right. They kindly informed him he had lost his way, and
                  gave him strict caution to take the left hand road, which, curious enough, was the
                  very thing he intended not to do. But he was a stranger in the country, and of
                  course should take the directions of those better acquainted with it than himself.
                  Yet it was now nearly two hours since he met the latter of the two parties, and
                  still, strange to say, he was as far from Crohan, for aught he knew, as ever. On
                  he went, notwithstanding—on he drove through the pitchy darkness, butting his bare
                  head against the pitiless storm, and seeing nothing but the lightning flash as it
                  shot across his face. Many a lusty malediction did he vent, that night, on
                  Ireland, and the unlucky day he first took it into his head to speculate in
                  matrimony on her barbarous shore. At last, he topped the summit of a hill, which
                  must surely, he thought, be Benraven Scalp, and had begun to descend the opposite
                  side, when, much to his relief, he heard a voice shouting through the storm,—
               "Hoagh!"
               "Hilloa! who's that?" he cried, turning round; "who goes there?"
               "Hoagh!" was again repeated.
               "Come nearer," bawled Weeks, "come nearer; can't hear you with this infernal
                  whistling." And no wonder, for in turning, the wind blew the skirts of his
                  sporting frock about his ears, which kept flapping so rapidly that he could hear
                  nothing at all. "Come nearer," he repeated, "come nearer; I'm here on the middle
                  of the road."
               "Hoagh! hoagh!"
               "Tarnation to your 'Hoagh!' Hain't ye got English enough to tell what's the
                  matter."
               "Hoagh!"
               
               "O, darn your gibberish—you're the most confounded barb——"
               "Hoagh! hoagh!"
               "That's it; go it again. By thunder, he bellows like an ox."
               "Mhoagh!"
               "Well, there! By crackie, if you're sick, it's not with the lung complaint, I
                  reckon, any how. But hold on—you may have got into some fix—hold on. I'll find you
                  out, I guess."
               Weeks, actuated by compassion for the sufferer, as well as by the hope of gaining
                  some information respecting his whereabouts, began to grope his way towards his
                  companion in distress. He felt quite sure the unfortunate man could not be far
                  away, for it was impossible for human lungs to make the voice tell at more than a
                  few yards, in the teeth of such a furious gale. With this notion in his head, he
                  commenced his search along the road side, floundering, as he went along, through
                  the water tables, and tripping occasionally over the slippery rocks which had
                  fallen from the banks into the ditches. As it was impossible to see any thing in
                  the darkness, his only alternative was to keep sweeping both hands out before him
                  in semicircles, like a swimmer, with the expectation of at length touching
                  something with life in it. In this manner, he searched up and down, both sides of
                  the road, for a considerable time, calling loudly to the man in distress, but
                  receiving no reply, and was at last on the point of abandoning the poor wretch to
                  his fate, when he fancied he heard a heavy groan, as of some one in his last
                  agony, and stretching out both hands again, to feel in the direction of the sound,
                  stumbled once more and fell forward.
               Just as he had expected, Weeks felt something warm and hairy under his open
                  palms.
               "Well, there!" he exclaimed; "the fellow's got corned and fell in the drain. I
                  swow he has, and lost his hat too, for his hair's as wet as the very grass. Say!
                  what's the matter?" he continued, shaking him. "Say! wake up, if you don't want to
                  die here right off."
               No answer came.
               "Look here!" and he pulled him by the hair of the head, to make him speak. "Look
                  here! you've got drunk—hain't you?"
               At this moment, and just as he had inserted his right arm under the helpless
                  creature's head, to raise him up, a flash of lightning illumed for an instant the
                  person of the prostrate sufferer, and revealed to the astonished eyes of Mr. Weeks
                  the face and form of a young steer, quietly chewing his cud under the shelter of a
                  projecting rock.
               "Heavens and earth, what's this!" he exclaimed, snatching his arm from under the
                  animal's neck, and jumping on the bank at a single bound. "Well, there! if that
                  ain't the darndest sniggle—I swonnie, if I didn't take the critter for a drunken
                  Irishman, shouting for help all the time. O, Ireland, Ireland; if there's such
                  another country in all universal space—well—if there be, I'd like to see it—that's
                  all."
               "Not so fast, my fine fellow, not so fast," shouted somebody in his ear; "you've
                  driven that baste far enough. I'll take charge of him now, if ye plaze, and
                  yerself too, into the bargain."
               "Me?"
               "Ay, in troth, honey, just your very self. You're the queen's prisoner."
               "The queen's humbug—for what, I should like to know?"
               "Stealing that yearling."
               "Stealing! You don't say! ha, ha!"
               "I do say."
               "You're mistaken, ain't you?"
               "Not in the laste, my good man."
               "Well, I kinder think you be."
               "Kinder think. Exactly—that's one of the tokens; you're a Yankee, it seems."
               
               "Well, I always reckoned so—happened to be born in New England, any how."
               "Just so—in Ducksville."
               "In Ducksville!—why, how the thunder came you to know that—eh?"
               "Niver mind—I know more than all that, my fine fellow. I know you've stolen three
                  more of this same stock from Benraven Mountain, within the last fortnight, and
                  this one makes the fourth."
               "My dear man," said Weeks, "let me tell you again, this is a great mistake—I'm a
                  private gentleman."
               "Feth, may be so. Hilloa! come on here, Tom Henley—come on with the lantern;" and
                  as the latter came up, the speaker raised the light to the face of his prisoner,
                  and deliberately scanned his person from head to foot. "Let me see—six feet in height, slender figure, knock-kneed, long sandy hair, gray frock and
                  trousers, several gilt chains, rings, brooches, &c. Very good—you're just the
                  person I've been searching for these three nights past. Come, my lad, you must
                  trot to Mr. Johnston's."
               "Well, I'd rather not;" coolly replied Weeks. "I sorter think I'll sleep to-night
                  at my cousin's, Mr. Robert Hard-wrinkle's."
               "Not till you see Mr. Johnston, first. I'm his bailiff, and must do my duty. Come,
                  sir, no more palaverin about it."
               "Look here!" exclaimed Weeks, as the bailiff laid his hand roughly on his
                  shoulder; "look here—hold on a minute—don't you think you're carrying this joke a
                  leetle too far? I told you already I was Mr. Hardwrinkle's cousin-german."
               "What, of Crohan?"
               "Ye-e-s."
               "Just so—precisely—that's another token. You've been trying hard to pass for the
                  foreigner visiting there."
               "Trying to pass! My dear man, I'm that very individual himself, and was on my way
                  to Crohan, from Araheera lighthouse, when I heard that animal——"
               "Ha, ha! a likely story, indeed—on your way to Crohan—here, on the very top of
                  Cairncrit—three miles farther from Crohan than when you left the lighthouse, and
                  the very animal we're lookin for, too, in your custody."
               "Well, I reckon I must have been directed the wrong way."
               "And how did you happen to get in company with the stirk?"
               "Why, I heard the critter bellow, and seemed to think it might be an Irishman
                  shouting for help."
               "Ha, ha! upon my conscience, now, that's mighty flatterin; heard a stirk routin
                  under the rain, and took it for an Irishman in distress."
               "Isn't he mighty cute, intirely?" said Henley.
               "Wonderful—but tell me, Tom, didn't Lanty say the fellow generally carried a
                  fishing rod with him?"
               "Ay, did he; but who the deuce cud carry a fishin rod with him such a night as
                  this, when the strongest of us can scarcely carry ourselves against the storm? O,
                  as for that, you needn't be the laste afeerd in life; he's the very man yer lookin
                  for, as sure as your name's Ned Griffin."
               "Say, what Lanty d'ye mean," inquired Weeks; "Lanty Hanlon—eh?"
               "Niver mind, it makes no difference to you who he is."
               "Well, not much, I guess, but if I could see him just as well as not, I might save
                  you further trouble on my account. Let me see—he lives in this here neighborhood,
                  somewhere—don't he?"
               "Come, come, my good fellow, this hoodwinking won't take just at present. You may
                  be very smart, and cunning, and all that, but I have had some twenty years'
                  experience of gentlemen of your profession. So, come on; we'll take you down here
                  to one of these houses in Ballymagahey for the night, and carry you before Mr. Johnston to-morrow.
                  You can then call on Lanty Hanlon to give you a character, and as many more as you
                  plaze. Lift your feet and they'll fall themselves," he added, grasping the
                  unfortunate Weeks by the collar. "Come away out of this rain; come, trot, my
                  customer, trot—you've legs enough if you only use them."
               "Trot h—ll!" vociferated Weeks at last, losing patience; "if you don't let go my
                  collar this instant, I'll blow your brains out. Away, you ignorant, beggarly
                  savages—darn you, to take me for a cow thief. Away—make tracks this minute or
                  by——"
               "Be aisy, my valiant fellow, be aisy," said the bailiff, still gripping him by the
                  collar.
               "No, I shan't—let me go—I'll not put up with this, no how."
               "Don't fret—we'll put you up, and in lavender, too; never fear."
               "I tell you once more, I'm Ephraim C. B. Weeks, cousin-german to the Hardwrinkles
                  of Crohan."
               "O, thin, bad scran to the much ye need boast of the connection," replied Henley,
                  helping the bailiff to drag him down the hill.
               "Unhand me, villains, unhand me; I'm a stranger here—I'm a foreigner."
               "An sure we're only helpin to send you to foreign parts again. O, faith, honey,
                  we'll accommodate ye that way, and welcome."
               "Look here—hold on," vociferated Weeks, as they ran him down the hill; "I want you
                  to understand who I am—I'm a citizen—a free-born citizen of the United States,
                  under the protection of the stars and stripes, and I protest against this
                  violence—I command you in the name of my country to let me go."
               "Bedad, that's very alarmin, Ned—isn't it?"
               "Ha, ha! mighty alarmin, intirely," responded the bailiff. "He speaks like that
                  Yankee fellow, in Dublin, last week, who threatened the magistrate with the stars
                  and stripes, because he fined him five shillings for spitting tobacco juice on a
                  lady's dress."
               In this way the bailiff, assisted by Tom Henley, continued to drag the unhappy
                  Weeks down the south side of Benraven Mountain, despite his solemn protest against
                  the outrage, and his frequent assurances of his innocence, and finally succeeded
                  in conveying him to a house in the little village of Ballymagahey, where, late as
                  the hour was, a light was still burning.
               As the party approached the house, several voices were heard within, some speaking
                  loud, some laughing, others singing, and now and then the squeak of a fiddle
                  breaking out at intervals.
               Without pausing an instant, the bailiff knocked loudly on the door, and the next
                  moment pushed in before him Ephraim Weeks, haggard and torn, and dripping like a
                  water god.
               The fiddle stopped short in the middle of Miss McCloud's reel, and the affrighted
                  dancers fell back, and left the floor clear to the new comers.
               "O, hierna!" cried some one in a stage whisper; "he's mad—see how
                  his eyes rowl in his head—he'll tear us in pieces."
               The young females, hearing this, took alarm, and ran out of doors, screaming for
                  protection; the elder ones ran after to bring them back; the men shouted to the
                  runaways to stop in twenty different voices, till in a shorter time than we have
                  taken to describe it, the place was a scene of unutterable confusion. Nearly all
                  the females had disappeared one after another. The hunchback fiddler jumped
                  through the window with his instrument under his arm; and to make the din still
                  more intolerable, the house dog set up such a howling outside as if the world had
                  actually come to an end, when the bailiff, seeing how matters stood, stepped on a
                  chair and began to address the company,
                  assuring them the man was not mad by any means, but a notorious cow thief he had
                  arrested in the act of stealing Mr. Johnston's cattle from the mountain, and then
                  proceeded to give the details of the capture.
               Whilst the bailiff thus endeavored to quiet the apprehensions of the females,
                  Weeks stood stock still in the centre of a curious and wondering group—his hands
                  thrust down as low as he could drive them into his breeches pockets, and his eyes
                  wandering round and round in search of some one to recognize him—but alas! the
                  faces he saw there were all strange faces to him.
               It was some time before the bailiff's repeated guarantee of his prisoner's sanity
                  of mind and peaceable disposition could induce the females to return to the
                  dancing room; and when they did, each fair one, as she entered, was seen to cast a
                  fearful glance at the tall stranger, and press closely by the side of her partner.
                  Last came the little fiddler, looking twice as big as when he fled through the
                  window but a moment before, and swearing all kinds of anathemas against the
                  bailiff and his prisoner for exposing his instrument to the rain.
               Still, amid all the noise and bustle, Weeks stood there as calm and solemn as an
                  undertaker. He was no longer excited—that state of feeling had given way to a
                  calm, contemptuous, silent indignation. He felt precisely as an unfortunate Irish
                  Catholic feels in New England, when arrested for robbery, and happens to reflect
                  he is the only stranger in the township, and without a friend to say a word in his
                  favor. But we must not stop to moralize; we can only say,—to borrow a line from
                  the poet,— 
                     "We have seen such sights, but must not call to mind."
                  
               
               Suddenly, however, Mr. Weeks's attention seemed to be attracted by the entrance of
                  an active, curly-headed, humorous-looking fellow, wearing a rabbit-skin cap
                  jantily set on the side of his head, and supporting a laughing, dark-haired girl
                  on his arm.
               "Say, hold on there, you," cried Weeks, at length breaking silence, and motioning
                  to the new comer.
               The individual made no reply, but hastened to escape further observation by
                  ensconcing himself behind a door in a remote corner of the room.
               "Look here!" persisted Weeks, breaking through the group, and holding out his hand
                  in token of recognition; "look here!—how do, old feller; got into a sorter snarl
                  here, and glad you turned up to see me out."
               "Me!"
               "Why, yes—you're Lanty Hanlon—ain't you?"
               "Ay, that's my name."
               "All right; I knew you by your cap as soon as you entered. Well—I want you to
                  clear up a mistake. This here bailiff, or constable, or whatever darned thing you
                  call him, has arrested me for stealing a steer, up thereaway—ha, ha!—and won't
                  believe I'm Mr. Ephraim Weeks, no how you can fix it."
               "Mr. Ephraim Weeks!" muttered our friend Lanty, slowly repeating the words, and
                  looking up in affected wonder in the man's face; "Mr. Ephraim Weeks—you're a
                  stranger in these parts."
               "Why, what d'ye mean?"
               "No offence in the world, only you've the 'vantage of me."
               "Advantage! How's that!"
               "Why, I don't remimber iver to see you afore."
               "You don't, eh? Look at me again."
               "I do."
               "Why, darn ye, hain't ye seen me every day this month past?"
               "Me! bedad, may be so. Whereabouts, if it's a fair question?"
               "Now, you go to grass," cried Weeks; "you know me as well as I know myself."
               
               "Faith, and that same mightn't be much to brag of aither."
               "Why, tarnation t'ye, hain't you sold me two dozen flies, last Thursday, at
                  Kindrum Pond?"
               "I sell you flies? Ha, ha, ha! Why, upon my conscience, my good fellow, you must
                  be ravin."
               "Well, there!" exclaimed Weeks, looking at the imperturbable Lanty as if he could
                  run him through; then drawing a fly-book hastily from his pocket, he pulled it
                  open, and holding the flies before Lanty's face, demanded to know if they were of
                  his dressing or not.
               "Mine—begorra, it wudn't be aisy to tell that in the state they're in now, any
                  way,"
               "Ladies and gents," said Weeks, appealing to the bystanders, "I vow I bought these
                  flies from this here fellow last Thursday. And, what's more, he stuck me in them
                  too, to the tune of twenty-five cents apiece."
               "Why, don't they ketch?" inquired some one in the crowd.
               "Ketch—no, guess they don't ketch—they're the darndest things ever fell in water.
                  Why, I never could turn a tail with them, if I fished till doomsday."
               "I admit," said Lanty, "I sold flies to a gentleman of the name of Weeks; the
                  gentleman that's on a visit to the Hard-wrinkles, of Crohan."
               "And thunderation to ye! ain't I that same Weeks?"
               "You! ha, ha, ha! Begorra, that's capital—you Mr. Weeks."
               "What! will you dare deny me to my face, you scoundrel?"
               "Deny you? O, holy patience, did man or mortal iver hear the like?"
               "Shut up, you lying rascal," shouted Weeks, gesticulating at his innocent-looking
                  tormentor; "shut up, you unprincipled scamp; you know in your soul who I am—if you
                  have a soul—but you hain't,—dang the one you have!"
               "O, my poor man," responded Lanty, looking at his victim with all the gravity of a
                  judge about to pronounce sentence, and shaking his head sorrowfully as he
                  spoke,—"my poor man, how hardened a sinner you must be, to pass yourself off for
                  the good, innocent, modest gentleman that's now lyin sound asleep in his vartuous
                  bed."
               "Well, if there be a devil on earth," exclaimed Weeks, "you're that individual, or
                  his nearest relation, that's sartin. You stepped out from the lower regions
                  to-night to get a cooling, and met me some two hours ago on the mountain. You're
                  the person planned and played this here trick—no mistake about it."
               "Isn't he bowld spoken to be a thief?" said one of the bystanders, nudging his
                  neighbor's elbow.
               "Ay, and purshuin to him, see how innocent he tries to look," replied the
                  other.
               "O, the dear be about ye, man; one i' them fellows that's used to it 'd chate St.
                  Pether."
               "Whist! whist! boys," remonstrated Lanty, waving his hand for silence. "Let him
                  alone, let him alone; we shud niver rejoice, ye know, in another's misfortune. May
                  be, if you wur like him yerselves, ye wudn't care to be laughed at."
               "Come, come, my good fellow," interposed the bailiff, "you're only making matters
                  worse. Go somewhere and get rid of them wet clothes."
               "Ay, do, Mr. Stranger; take a friend's advice," said Lanty, "and don't expose your
                  precious health. The truth will all come out th' morrow. If yer innicint, so much
                  the betther; an if yer not, why, ye'll only be thransported two or three months
                  afore yer time; so take courage, and don't be unaisy."
               Lanty's cool impudence at last so provoked the Yankee that he could hardly
                  restrain himself. Once or twice, indeed, he hitched up his shoulders and showed
                  symptoms of battle; but his resentment as often cooled down again without
                     further mischief. Like poor Bob
                  Acres, Mr. Weeks could never get his courage up to the fighting point; some how or
                  other, it always escaped through his fingers' ends, like that of his illustrious
                  prototype.
               "Well, ladies and gents," said he at length, falling back, as a last resource, on
                  his soft sawder, "well, I must confess I feel a kinder disappointed. Now I do;
                  that's a fact. Why, it's just like this—I always heard the Irish cracked up all
                  over creation for their hospitality to strangers. At hum, in New England, they're
                  tip top in that line. Well, they're about as hospitable folks I guess as you can
                  scare up any where between Maine and Georgia. We get along with them slick, I tell
                  you. And as for extending them the right hand of fellowship, why, golly, we love
                  them like brothers——"
               "Phew!" cried Lanty; "just listen to that. He's puttin his foot in it deeper and
                  deeper. O, faith, my fine fellow, it's aisy seen ye niver was much in New England,
                  or ye'd know a little betther how the Irish are thrated there."
               Weeks suddenly drew in his horns—to use a homely expression. He saw, in an
                  instant, he had touched a delicate subject, and the sooner he dropped it the
                  better. Like many of his countrymen, he fancied the Irish he saw about him never
                  could have an idea in their heads above the pick or the spade; a ragged coat and
                  an Irish brogue, being in his mind synonymous
                  with consummate ignorance and absolute barbarism. He now felt he had gone a little
                  too far, and that any attempt to deceive his tormentors by such barefaced humbug
                  as he was then attempting, would only make matters worse, since, to all
                  appearances, they knew as much about the persecution their countrymen suffered in
                  New England as he did himself. The broad grin that overspread every face as he
                  went on to speak of the love which the citizens of New England cherished for their
                  Celtic brethren assured him of this, even before Lanty could say a word in reply.
                  Affecting, therefore, to disdain further conversation on the subject, after
                  hearing the laugh with which Lanty's humorous but cutting rebuke was received, he
                  turned to the bailiff, and demanded to be taken forthwith to some resting place
                  for the night.
               "You'll get comfortable quarters," said Lanty; "never fear; but av coorse you'll
                  take dhoch in dhorris
                  *
                  with us, afore ye go, to the health of the new-married couple."
               
                  
                  *Stirrup-cup.
               
               "What's that?"
               "Why, something to warm ye, after the could rain."
               "Don't drink," said Weeks.
               "Nonsense."
               "No, sir, I'm a Washingtonian."
               "A what?"
               "A Son of Temperance."
               "Pshaugh—son of botheration. I'm ashamed of ye. Hilloa there! Hudy Branagan, bring
                  in the bottle."
               "You may bring in a hogshead," said Weeks; "I shan't taste it."
               "And you in that condition! Why, the heavens be about us; d'ye mane to put a hand
                  in yer own life."
               "None of your confounded business. I shan't drink your darned liquor—that's
                  all."
               "Well, ye'll die if ye don't—and that'd be a burnin disgrace to the counthry, if
                  ye were even as great a thief as James Freny himself. Hoot, man, what'd yer people
                  say of us if we let ye die here in ould Ireland for want of a glass of stout
                  potheen. Here, take this, and swallow it, like a sensible man."
               "Away with it," cried Weeks.
               "Be aisy, avourneen, be aisy."
               "Take it away, or by thunder I'll break your bottle and glass in pieces," and
                  making a plunge, he attempted to force a passage through the crowd, but was again
                  driven back into the centre of the group.
               
               "Let me out," he shouted, now completely excited; "let me out, ye beggarly Irish
                  vermin. I despise your liquor, and your country to boot. I spit upon you and your
                  nation, for you're both as mean as dirt."
               "Ha, ha! there now," cried Lanty, laughing, with the bottle and glass in his
                  hand—"there now, that's more of yer New England friendship. But niver mind; if ye
                  were a Yankee fifty times over, we won't thrate ye the worse for that. Come, take
                  this drop—you'll be the betther of it."
               "Let me out."
               "Whisht, man; sure it's all for yer own good. Arrah, don't refuse to drink to the
                  bride and groom. It's as much as yer life's worth to refuse it. Take it; it'll
                  warm ye—taste it, any way—it's the deuce i' the barley—it's the rale ould
                  Innishowen," broke out from several voices, each rising higher than the other,
                  till poor Weeks knew not what to say, nor what side to turn to. Still he
                  obstinately refused to touch the beverage.
               "Well, boys," said Lanty, at last, "take hould of him, and lay him down, since
                  nothin else will save him. Whatsomiver the craythur is, we're Christians sure, any
                  way, and can't let him die fur want of a thrifle i' medicine. It's a liberty we
                  take, my good man, to be sure, but still it's betther do that, than have yer death
                  on our sowls, the lor between us an harm."
               "The sorrah take him, the spalpeen," said one of the bystanders; "isn't he nice
                  about it; feth, ye'd think it was a physic he was goin to swallow."
               "Begorra, I niver heerd the like of it."
               "It's a bad sign to see him refuse the liquor, any way."
               "Indeed, then, Andy, it's the truth ye're tellin; so it is; for in troth it's not
                  much depindince iver I had in the man 'd refuse a glass in dacency."
               "O, there's a bad dhrop in him; ye may take yer oath iv that; but look at Lanty,
                  Ned, just luck at his face—as sober as if it was cut on a tombstone. Did ye iver
                  see such a born devil in all yer life?"
               "Well, Lanty had it in for him, any way. And, begorra, he desarves all he'll get
                  and more, for he's niver aisy, they say, but when he's running down the
                  Irish."
               "So I'm tould. He thinks no one in the whole country fit to spake to him. As for
                  the Doghertys, and Currans, and Johnstons here, why, they're not fit to tie his
                  shoes."
               "Ladies and gentlemen," exclaimed Lanty, stepping up on a bench, and still holding
                  the bottle and glass in his hands, "I'm goin to give ye a toast, and may the man's
                  heart niver again warm to good nature, that does'n't drink it."
               "Silence, there, silence—till we hear the toast."
               "Stop that fiddle there, and listen to the spaker."
               "Here's then to the honest man," cried Lanty, raising his glass,—"here's to the
                  honest man all over the world, and confusion to the narrow-minded knave who'd make
                  religion or birthplace a test of friendship;" and tossing off the bumper, he
                  ordered the company to pass the bottle.
               Round went the toast, and off went the glass with many a loud hip, hip, hurrah.
                  There was shaking of hands, and touching of cans, accompanied by snatches of songs
                  suitable to the toast, and pledges of friendship to one another, not forgetting
                  long life and happiness to the bride and groom; all seemed joyous and happy as
                  they could wish to be, Weeks alone excepted, who still stood in the centre of the
                  crowd, looking silently on the noisy enjoyments of the company, and obstinately
                  refusing all participation in the hilarity of the occasion.
               "Where, in the name of patience, were you born at all," demanded the bailiff,
                  "that you won't drink at a weddin?"
               "He's an unnatural-looking thief, any way," exclaimed another.
               "Stand aside, boys," commanded Lanty, waving his hand from his elevated position,
                  "and let us give the stranger fair
                  play. He's all alone here amongst us, and we mustn't be hard on him. Jemmy Bragan,
                  fill that glass, and offer it to him again. And now, my good man," he continued,
                  addressing Weeks, "you heerd the toast, 'the honest man all over the world, and
                  bad luck to the knave who'd make religion or birthplace a test of friendship'—will
                  you drink it?"
               "No," replied Weeks, "darn me if I do."
               "Then, gintlemen, lay him down and administher the midicine."
               Four or five stout fellows now laid hold of the unfortunate Weeks, and were
                  deliberately proceeding to execute Lanty's orders, when a new actor suddenly
                  appeared on the scene, and commanded them to desist. It was the handsome,
                  dark-haired girl whom the reader saw a few minutes before entering the room,
                  leaning on Lanty's arm.
               "Shame! shame!" she cried; "are ye men, to treat a stranger in this way?"
               "Don't be onaisy, Mary," replied Lanty; "we don't intend him the laste harm in
                  life."
               "Well, you've carried the joke too far already, Lanty Hanlon; let him come with
                  me—I'll take care of him."
               "Why, Mary, it's only a bit of a frolic he brought on himself. He tould me a dozen
                  times the Irish were no betther nor savages, and we jist want to show him how much
                  he's mistaken."
               "And you do this to a furriner, not a month in the country; paugh! pretty
                  hospitality that!"
               "He's green, you know, Mary, and we want to saison him."
               "Tut, tut! shame, shame!"
               "It's for his own good—saisonin in time will make a dacent man iv him."
               "Hould yer tongue, now, Lanty; ye'd provoke a saint, hould your tongue, and let us
                  out. I must go and find some dry clothes for him, or he'll die in this condition.
                  Stand back, gintlemen, if ye plaze, and give us room to pass."
               "Bedad, Mary, I'm afraid to trust ye with him; feth, may be he'd take a fancy to
                  ye, and cut me out."
               "Whisht, now, and let me go. That tongue of yours 'll hang ye up on the gallows
                  yet, some day;" and taking Weeks familiarly by the arm, in she led him
                  unresistingly from the crowd, and disappeared through one of the inner doors of
                  the apartment.
               The dance was now resumed, and mirth and music made the time pass quickly and
                  merrily for the next hour. Lanty danced with every girl in the room, and when he
                  could no longer find a partner, danced a hornpipe himself on a door, amid the
                  shouts and cheers of the party. Every one seemed to share in the general joy. Even
                  the grandparents of the happy couple, old as they were, took each other's hands,
                  and went through some ancient saltations to the great amusement of the younger
                  spectators.
               On went the mirth and up rose the song, and the little hunchbacked fiddler had
                  just tuned his instrument once more, and commenced to rattle away at a country
                  dance with renewed ardor, when, all of a sudden, a shout was heard at the door,
                  followed instantly by bravos, bravos, echoed and repeated, till at last, in the
                  midst of a wild hurrah, in drove Ephraim C. B. Weeks, dressed in an old blue
                  swallow-tailed coat, and pantaloons that descended but an inch or two below the
                  knees, dragging in the young lady who had so kindly rescued him from his late
                  tormentors, and in rather unsteady accents, commanded the fiddler to "fire up, and
                  let him have something to dance to." Every body now crushed and crowded round to
                  welcome him back. Those who but a short time before were disposed to mortify him
                  to the very utmost, in revenge for his insolent abuse of their religion and their
                  country, were the first to call for three cheers for the "bould American;" and
                  foremost among the first was Lanty Hanlon, who clapped him lustily on the back,
                  and ordered the fiddler to strike up something with a "sowl in it, to shuit the
                  taste of the jolly Yankee."
               
               It is needless, dear reader, to describe what followed. Weeks seemed to have
                  abandoned himself entirely to the excitement of the moment. How that excitement
                  was brought about, however, no one could tell. He drank, and drank freely,—as was
                  evident the moment he made his appearance at the door,—but whether at the
                  solicitation of his fair friend, or merely to preserve his health after so long an
                  exposure to the storm, was never discovered; certain it is he was completely
                  fascinated by his lovely partner, and danced with her as long as he was able to
                  move a foot—swearing all the while by his "crackie" she was the finest gal in all
                  creation, and went through her figures like a real thorough-bred Yankee, "no
                  mistake about it."
               Here, dear reader, we must stop, leaving the finale of this scene to your own
                  charitable imagination; for a description of our friend Weeks's position on the
                  stage, as the curtain fell, is more than we should dare attempt. One thing,
                  however, we ought to mention, just to relieve your anxiety; he was conveyed safely
                  home that same night, and awoke in his own comfortable bed next morning in Crohan
                  house.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               
                  Kate Petersham at Castle Gregory.—Dr. Henshaw's Catholicity proves rather
                     strong both for Kate and the Priest.—The Doctor, like Mr. Weeks, forms a very
                     bad Opinion of Ireland and its Inhabitants.—Lanty plays an Irish Trick.—Its
                     Consequences.
               
               "IS Miss Petersham engaged, please?" said a servant, opening the parlor door.
               "No: what's the matter?"
               "Father John sends in his compliments."
               "Father John!—Is it possible!" exclaimed Kate Petersham, wheeling round on the
                  piano stool, and running to the door to receive him. "Ho, ho! indeed, so there you
                  come at last, and Uncle Jerry too; surely something extraordinary must have
                  happened to bring you all the way to Castle Gregory. Have you had a conflagration
                  or an earthquake in your neighborhood?"
               "Hold your saucy tongue," said the priest, slapping her affectionately on the
                  cheek; "you're never done scolding; 'pon my word, I had better come here, bag and
                  baggage; and live at Castle Gregory altogether."
               "You'll do no such thing, sir—I hate you. You're a barbarous man. You're the most
                  unsocial, ill-natured, hard-hearted creature in the whole world."
               "O, to be sure, because I don't spend all my time playing chess with the greatest
                  mad-pate in Christendom."
               "Do you hear that, Uncle Jerry?" exclaimed Kate, turning to Mr. Guirkie; "and the
                  man hasn't been here to see us once in a month."
               "Never mind; we'll have our revenge of him yet, depend upon it. His neglect of you
                  is absolutely unpardonable, after all your professions of regard for him."
               "Pshaugh! he's not worth my revenge. I renounce him; I shall take you for my
                  confidant in future, and leave him to his beads and breviary. So come over here,
                  to your old easy chair, and let us have a quiet chat together;" and running her
                  arm into his, she was hurrying him away to a corner of the room, when the priest
                  laid his hand on her shoulder.
               "Not so fast, Kate; not so fast. You've forgotten there's a stranger in the room.
                  Miss Petersham, let me present to you Dr. Henshaw, of Edinburgh,—Dr. Henshaw, Miss
                  Petersham, of Castle Gregory, one of the most mischievous and ungovernable of her
                  sex."
               
               "Don't believe him, Dr. Henshaw. I'm no such thing. Welcome, sir, to Castle
                  Gregory."
               "How d' ye do, my dear? glad to see you," said the latter, bowing stiffly, and
                  raising his gold spectacles to look at her in detail. "Don't trouble yourself
                  aboot what Father John says. It's not all gospel, I suspect."
               "Nor his preaching either, if what his bishop says be true."
               "Ha, ha! A very serious charge, indeed," laughed Uncle Jerry; "and no doubt reason
                  enough for it too."
               "I see you've been reading Swift, Miss Petersham," said Henshaw, taking a volume
                  from the table. "Do you admire him?"
               "Swift—certainly. Did you ever see an Irish woman who didn't?"
               "Well, I don't remember, parteecularly, as to that. But his moral sentiments
                  are——"
               "Swift was an elegant writer, full of wit and humor—and, best of all, he loved his
                  country, and never was ashamed to own it."
               "Ah! and you think he deserves credit for that?"
               "To be sure I do—why not? He lived in times when devotion to his country and her
                  cause was a disqualification for office both in church and state; besides, Dean
                  Swift was a near relation of ours by the Willoughbys, as my venerable aunt would
                  tell you."
               "Ah!—that indeed!"
               "But don't you like him, doctor?"
               "No," replied the doctor, gruffly.
               "You don't! is it possible? Why, I thought Swift was a favorite every where."
               "In Ireland—yes."
               "You must admit he's witty and humorous, doctor."
               "Not very—but that, and a keen sense o' the rideeculous, is about all that's in
                  him."
               "O, no, no, doctor, I won't agree to that at all; you quite underrate Swift. For
                  my part, I think there's more sound philosophy in Swift than in any other work I
                  ever read."
               "Humph! have you read much?"
               "No; sometimes, when the fit takes me, I pick up a book and read a page or two
                  here and there."
               "But do you study what you read!"
               "No; I'm too great a madcap for that. I can ride a horse, though, or sail a boat,
                  as well as any Irish girl you'll find; and these are the only accomplishments I
                  pretend to lay claim to."
               "Not very feminine, I should think," ejaculated Henshaw, pursing out his lips, and
                  looking over at the priest, with his eyes dilated into what he intended for a
                  smile.
               "No, sir; but they suit my turn of mind. And yet Mr. Guirkie here will tell you
                  I've got some philosophy in me, too."
               "I'll have nothing to do with your philosophy," said Uncle Jerry, pacing up and
                  down the room, and bobbing the skirts of his coat on his hands behind him. "I wish
                  to the Lord the captain was at home; that's all I wish."
               "Father John, go to the sideboard there, and find some refreshments," said Kate.
                  "Come, doctor, you must pledge me in good stout Burgundy, and I'll forgive what
                  you said of Swift."
               "I shall wait for the captain," replied Father John, looking up from the
                  newspaper; "the doctor there will oblige you at present."
               "You shall not, sir; he may not return for an hour yet. Wait for the captain,
                  indeed! Ain't I as good company as the captain? O, Dr. Henshaw, these Catholic
                  priests are the most ungallant people imaginable."
               Dr. Henshaw emptied the glass which Kate filled for him, adding, as he laid it on
                  the sideboard, "you're not so mawkish, I perceive, as our young ladies generally
                  are."
               "O, I'm only an Irish girl, you know; I do what I please— no one minds me; Father John there once thought he
                  could manage me, but it failed him."
               "Not I," replied the priest; "I never was so silly as to think any such
                  thing."
               "You did indeed, sir—you needn't deny it; you had me in leading strings for a
                  whole week or more."
               "How was that?" said Henshaw.
               "He tried to convert me—ha, ha! Kept me reading night and day——"
               "Convert you?—what, from sin?"
               "No, from Protestantism. Sin indeed! why, doctor, I'm ashamed of you."
               "Well, Protestanteesm is sin—and a most grievous sin, my good girl."
               "There, now you're at it again," muttered Uncle Jerry, still pacing the room in
                  his usual way. "You're at it again; I vow and protest it's outrageous."
               "You frighten me, doctor," said Kate; "upon my word I'll run away and leave
                  you."
               "But don't you know that if you die out o' the Kaatholic church you'll be
                  lost?"
               "Listen to that," exclaimed Kate.
               "I hear him," said the priest; "the doctor's very strong on that point."
               "Well, doctor, I'm not prepared to dispute with you about the matter at present,"
                  said Kate, "but I'm pretty sure of one thing—you could never make a Catholic of me
                  in that way."
               "He's got himself into trouble again," said Uncle Jerry, sitting down on a chair
                  beside the priest.
               "He deserves it," responded the latter, in a tone of displeasure.
               "I declare I never saw a man in my life so fond of differing with every body as he
                  is. Why, I vow to goodness, I thought he was going to swallow me neck and heels
                  this morning ing in the boat, when I attempted to defend Tillotson and
                  Burnet."
               "That's his greatest fault; he can never dispute five minutes without losing his
                  temper."
               "And does he suppose people must put up with his temper when he chooses to lose
                  it? I declare that's very fine."
               "It's a great weakness in him, and I'm sorry, for he's a man of great mental
                  ability."
               "O, who cares for his mental ability? I wouldn't give a brass button for a man who
                  can't talk with you on any thing but great heavy subjects. And then he goes at
                  them in such a way too, with all his might, like a dray horse starting a
                  load."
               "Heavy subjects are his speciality," observed Father John; "he don't pretend to
                  handle any thing else. And indeed, as a polemic and logician, he has very few
                  equals."
               "But he does pretend to handle every thing else. Why, he
                  reviews every book he can lay his hands on—stories, novels, poetry, every
                  thing—from a primer to a course of theology. Speciality indeed!"
               "You're right; he has been doing something that way of late, now that I remember.
                  But the truth is, I think so little of his literary criticisms I don't care to
                  read them. He never should attempt to criticise such books at all. They are
                  entirely out of the sphere of his taste and acquirements."
               "To be sure."
               "And then he goes about them so awkwardly."
               "He, he, he!" chuckled Uncle Jerry; "that reminds me of his last number. Did you
                  see his criticism on Cameron's Poems?"
               "No—what does he do with it? Strangles it, I suppose."
               "Not at all; he makes an exception to his rule. He praises it hugely. Cameron's a
                  Catholic, you know, besides being a Scotchman."
               "Ah, yes, there's something in that."
               
               "In speaking of some of the fine passages he tries to be exceedingly nice in his
                  appreciation of the beauties."
               "Nice!" laughed Father John; "that's good; I must read the criticism."
               "Do. It's worth the reading, I assure you."
               "But he must have gone about it very awkwardly."
               "Awkwardly! He remined me of an elephant I once saw picking up a bouquet with his
                  trunk. He first made a——"
               "Hush! here he comes, full of indignation at Kate's presumptuous boldness. See how
                  he runs his thumbs into his waistcoat pockets—that's a sure sign he's ruffled.
                  Kate," he added, as an offset to further controversy, "can't we have some
                  music?"
               "Certainly—what shall it be?"
               "O'er the water to Charlie."
               "Excellent—just the very thing," she cried, opening the piano and rattling away.
                  "How do you like it, doctor?"
               "Well, so, so. Associations make it pleasant just now."
               "Makes you think of home?"
               "Yes."
               "What think you, though, of our Irish music?"
               "Very fair; but it always gives me the blues."
               "The blues!"
               "Yes. It's so melancholy."
               "Moore's songs are, indeed, rather melancholy, but exquisite of their kind,
                  nevertheless."
               "Yes—he's a vary decent lyric poet—is Moore; and still there's nothing in him
                  after all but sentiment and fancy—he's greatly wanting in force and power of
                  thought."
               "That is to say, he's neither Byron nor Milton."
               "No, I don't mean that, either. But he tires you with the incessant play of his
                  fancy. He is forever hopping from flower to flower, like a butterfly."
               "Ah, then you adopt the criticisms of the Edinburgh Review."
               "I adopt no creeticism. I make my own," replied Henshaw, gruffly.
               "Well, you think with the Scotch Reviewers, that his poetry is too full of
                  beauties, and hampered too much with imagery."
               "I think simply this: he was a vary respectable songster in his way, but an
                  immoral man and a bad Kaatholic."
               "O, doctor, that's not fair. I must protest against your bringing up our poet's
                  private character. It's not magnanimous of you at all."
               "His poetry, take it all through," persisted Henshaw, "has done more to enervate
                  and corrupt the minds of the young, than any other I am acquainted wi'; and do you
                  know the reason, Miss Petersham?"
               "No."
               "Well, it was simply because in losing his faith he lost his morality also."
               "My dear sir, we have nothing to do with his faith," replied Kate. "Why, you drag
                  faith into every thing. Can't we admire a man's writings without first inquiring
                  about his faith?"
               "Yes, that's vary true; but it strikes me you value faith too little, and for that
                  reason you cannot properly estimate a man's writings. We Kaatholics deesapprove of
                  all books and writings injurious to faith or morals. You Protestants have no faith
                  at all, and you let your morals take care o' themselves."
               "Highty tighty," muttered Uncle Jerry, running his hands again under his coat
                  tails, and pacing the room as before; "he's at it again."
               Father John rose also, and turning Kate round on the piano stool, commanded her,
                  under pain of his sovereign displeasure, to play "The last rose of summer," with
                  Henry Herz's variations first, and then sing it.
               "Now, she exclaimed, when she finished the song,—"now, Dr. Henshaw, I put it to
                  you as an honorable man; did you, or did you not, ever hear so exquisite a song as
                  that?"
               
               "The words or the music?"
               "Both together, when played and sung as they ought to be."
               "Y-e-e-s, it's light, and pretty, and fanciful, and——"
               "No, no, sir. I shall not be put off with that; but tell me what poet ever wrote a
                  song of its kind equal to that? I give you the whole world to find him; not even
                  excepting your own Burns, Scott, Tannahill, and all the rest."
               "I never trouble myself much aboot such trifles," responded Henshaw. "I leave them
                  to the boys and girls."
               "I wish to goodness you would," muttered Uncle Jerry, looking at the priest.
               "Just so," replied the latter; "and if he only knew himself well enough, he would.
                     Ne sutor ultra crepidam."
               "Hillo! what are you doing there, Mr. Guirkie?" exclaimed Kate; "chatting away
                  with Father John, and I all alone here with this great reviewer, trying to
                  preserve my countrymen from utter annihilation; come to the rescue, or he'll not
                  leave us one of them; all, forsooth, because they happened to be Protestants."
               "What's the matter?" inquired the priest, looking over his shoulder.
               "Why, he's actually making mince meat of all our celebrities. He has come down now
                  as far as Burke, and is cutting him up at such a rate that nothing will be left of
                  him, by and by, but the bones."
               The priest threw his legs across, and pulled down his waistcoat with a jerk, but
                  said nothing in reply.
               "You're growing angry," said Uncle Jerry.
               "No, I'm not angry; I'm too well accustomed to him for that."
               "Poor Kate's as mad as a hatter; look, how she shakes her curls at him! The man
                  might try to be a little more courteous, I think."
               "Were he in any other place but Castle Gregory, he wouldn't come off so easily, I
                  assure you," responded the priest.
               "There now," cried Kate, running away from her antagonist, and flinging herself
                  down beside Uncle Jerry on the sofa; "I shan't dispute another syllable with
                  him—he has no mercy at all. He opens his great broadsides on every thing
                  indiscriminately, and goes firing away at you, all the time, his ponderous logic.
                  I never met so tremendous a Catholic as Dr. Henshaw. He has murdered me out and
                  out."
               "And why did you continue at it so long?"
               "What could I do? Am I to be challenged at my own fireside, and by a stranger,
                  too, and not fight? O, could I only get him once aboard the Water Hen, with a
                  stiff breeze from the southard, or on 'Moll Pitcher's Back' for a morning's
                  heathing, if I wouldn't have my revenge, no matter."
               "So you've surrendered at last, Kate," said the priest, walking over leisurely to
                  the sofa, and tapping his snuff-box on the lid.
               "Of course I have; how could I understand all the theories, and philosophies, and
                  systems into which he dragged me? If he only could talk as other men do, and on
                  subjects that girls like me are generally acquainted with, I might do well enough;
                  but not a thing you can say but he reduces to logic in a minute, and measures it
                  by some one of his new theories, as a haberdasher measures his tape."
               "He don't give you latitude enough, Kate," said the priest, taking a pinch.
               "No, he holds you like a vice, and then so bewilders you with his newly-imported
                  principles and methods, and so on, that you don't know what you're saying. But,
                  Father John, could you guess how he tries to account for the decay of
                  nations?"
               "O, ho! the decay of nations, no less."
               "Yes, indeed—a subject I know as much about as old Thomas there. Thomas, tell Aunt
                  Willoughby Father John wants to see her."
               "Well, let us hear how he accounts for it."
               
               "Why, sir, he accounts for the decay of nations generally, and of the Irish nation
                  in particular, by the laws that regulate the circulation of matter."
               "Ha, ha! Go, you mad creature," said the priest, again slapping her on the cheek;
                  "you're making him worse than he is."
               "It's a positive fact, sir," persisted Kate. "He says, as the world is developed,
                  the attractive power of new countries becomes greater than those of the old, and
                  carry away from their weaker neighbors, through the atmosphere, more than their
                  share of animal and vegetable life."
               "Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Uncle Jerry, quitting the sofa, and bobbing his skirts up
                  and down the room. "Ha, ha! the man's fit for the madhouse. I declare! account for
                  the decay of nations by laws regulating the circulation of matter. O, the Lord be
                  about us—what's the world coming to?"
               "That reminds me of an article I read in some magazine last week, where the writer
                  discovers the antipathy of the Irish to the English people to have originated in
                  the difference between the Roman and the Celtic civilizations."
               "He went far back to find it—didn't he?" said Uncle Jerry, bobbing away as he
                  spoke.
               "He was right, neevertheless," said Henshaw, who had been listening. "I agree with
                  him."
               "Right or wrong," said the priest, "of what earthly advantage is it to us to
                  discover the cause—is not the fact enough?"
               "No, sir, it is not enough; as a priest and a Chreestian, you should feel happy to
                  be able to ascribe this national anteepathy to a more creditable cause than the
                  memory of past eenjuries."
               "That rebuke is unmerited by me, Dr. Henshaw," responded the priest, kindling up a
                  little. "I deplore those unhappy differences between the two countries as much as
                  any man."
               "And still you're never done dinning in our ears how you've suffered and bled, and
                  all that, under the lash of the Saxon—in Scotland we are sick of it."
               "Humph! don't doubt it in the least. There has been, I must confess, rather too
                  much of this clamor about our rights and wrongs. But, my dear doctor, delicacy, I
                  think, should restrain you from expressing your opinions so freely on this
                  exciting subject. Miss Petersham, you must be already aware, loves her country
                  very much, and cannot but feel hurt to hear you speak of it so disparagingly."
               "Sir, I have never withheld my opeenions any where. When I form opeenions I am not
                  ashamed to avow them."
               "But I tell you, doctor, you ought to be ashamed to avow such opinions as you have
                  just expressed here. I have listened to you in my own house, speaking in the most
                  contemptuous manner of our Irish writers and statesmen, and borne with you
                  patiently, for I was then your host; but I cannot sit patiently here and hear you
                  outrage the feelings of a young and gentle girl at her own fireside, and on your
                  very first introduction, because she happens to be a Protestant, and is national
                  enough to feel proud of her countrymen."
               Henshaw was about to reply, when the door opened, and Mrs. Willoughby entered,
                  carrying a letter in her hand. She was evidently beyond threescore and ten, to
                  judge from the deep furrows of her cheeks and thin white hair; and yet she walked
                  as sprightly and upright as a girl of sixteen. Approaching Father John and Mr.
                  Guirkie with a smile of welcome, she extended a hand to each, and expressed the
                  pleasure she felt in seeing them at Castle Gregory.
               "Kate," she added; "where are you, Kate?"
               "Quarrelling with Dr. Henshaw," replied the priest.
               "O, the wild creature! She's always at some mischief. Kate, here's a note from
                  Mary Lee."
               In a moment the delighted girl was at her aunt's side, and kissing her hand
                  fervently for having carried the precious billet, bounded off again to read
                  it.
               
               "News for you, Uncle Jerry," she exclaimed, as she ran her eye rapidly over the
                  contents: "Mary Lee comes tomorrow, and you must stay to see her. You can't
                  refuse, for you know how anxious you've been to converse with her."
               "Come over," said Uncle Jerry, "and sit beside me here on the sofa; we must talk a
                  little of your friend. Do you really know who this girl is, or whence she came, or
                  what's to become of her?"
               "Not I," replied Kate. "All I know is, I love her dearly, and that's all I want to
                  know."
               "But of her father?"
               "She never speaks of him; I never even heard her mention his name."
               "I declare!—isn't that strange, and you so intimate?"
               "Very—she told me all about her uncle's embarrassment, though. She fears he can't
                  hold out much longer. His creditors in Dublin and Cork are pressing him very hard,
                  and he has no means left to meet their demands."
               "God help him, poor fellow, God help him; if he didn't happen to be a gentleman,
                  it hadn't been half so bad."
               "Have you called to see him yet, as you promised?"
               "No, I thought better of it."
               "How so?"
               "My visit might be disagreeable, perhaps."
               "Disagreeable?"
               "Yes—he might feel embarrassed."
               "What! ashamed of his poverty?"
               "No; but if he happened to find out that I was the purchaser of Mary's pictures,
                  what should I do? Roger would never sell me a picture again."
               "He knows nothing about it," said Kate. "Roger would die sooner than tell him;
                  even Mary herself don't know who buys her pictures. She thinks Roger sells them in
                  Derry to a picture dealer. All she don't understand about the matter is the high
                  price she gets for them."
               "Nonsense!" ejaculated Uncle Jerry; "she receives the value of them, and not one
                  stiver more or less. I'm not such a fool as to throw my hard-earned money away for
                  nothing."
               "Fool!" repeated Kate, looking at Uncle Jerry till the tears came to her eyes; "I
                  wish to God we had more fools like you, then."
               "There it's again," said Uncle Jerry, turning away pettishly from his fair
                  companion, for nothing irritated him more than to charge him with the crime of
                  benevolence; "there it's again; always harping on the same string. I'll stay at
                  home, in future," he continued, "for I shan't be plagued in this way any longer.
                  I'll not let a beggar—I'll not let a man with a torn coat, nor a woman with a
                  child in her arms—within a league of my house; as I live I shan't."
               "Don't grow angry with me, Uncle Jerry," pleaded Kate, taking his hand.
               "I shall grow angry; I can't help it; a saint couldn't stand it. I'll turn off
                  Mrs. Motherly too, for she's the cause of all this. I can't fling a copper to a
                  beggar, but she reports it a pound. Upon my word it's a pretty thing to be taken
                  for a simpleton at the age of sixty years; humph! a mighty pretty thing,
                  indeed."
               "I only hinted at your generosity—I mean your goodness—in—a—in—why, in giving fair
                  prices for Mary's pictures, that's all."
               "Fair prices——"
               "Yes; and I thought you wouldn't be angry with me for saying
                  that."
               "Of course I wouldn't; but you said nothing of the kind—not a syllable," replied
                  Uncle Jerry, softening down a little, notwithstanding.
               "Because you wouldn't wait to hear me," said Kate; "I certainly think it's very
                  good and kind in you to buy these pictures from the poor girl when you don't want
                  them yourself. I say that, Mr. Guirkie, and I shall always say
                  so."
               
               "But I do want them—I want all she can paint for a twelvemonth to
                  come; and I wouldn't give one of them for twice the price they cost me. Do you
                  hear that, now, Miss Petersham? Not for twice the price."
               "O, well," said Kate, humoring the whim, "that accounts for it, then."
               "Certainly. You thought all the time, I suppose, I bought these pictures as an act
                  of charity. He, he!" he chuckled, endeavoring all the while to belie his own
                  heart; "when I buy, Kate, I have an eye to business."
               Kate raised up hers in appeal against the sacrilege, but dared not venture a
                  word.
               "And that's the real reason, Kate, I don't visit at the lighthouse," said Uncle
                  Jerry, holding his head down, for his conscience smote him for bearing false
                  witness against himself; "that's the reason, precisely."
               "O, very well," said Kate; "I'm satisfied if you are."
               "I must acknowledge it's a selfish motive," continued Uncle Jerry; "but I have
                  been a man of the world, and doubtless my feelings are hardened by long
                  intercourse with it."
               "Hardened! And so you won't visit at the lighthouse, lest Roger should never come
                  with his pictures again?"
               "Precisely. If the old man saw me once there, he should never come knocking at my
                  door again. He's a wonderful man, that Roger, and I think I should miss him very
                  much."
               "He's a faithful creature," replied Kate; "like the ivy, he clings on to the last;
                  when the old house falls into ruins, he falls with it."
               "He is very obliging to me, at all events," said Uncle Jerry, "to make me the
                  first offer. But keep the secret to yourself, Kate," (and he whispered the words
                  in her ear,) "don't breathe it to a soul for your life."
               "Never fear; I'll not discover."
               "And now, can you tell me, has Mary Lee any friends or relatives in or about
                  Rathmullen?"
               "No, not that I know of."
               "You're not certain?"
               "Well, as certain as I can be, without actually hearing her say so."
               "Then I must have seen her ghost."
               "Her ghost, forsooth! where?"
               "In Rathmullen graveyard."
               "O, some one like her you saw. She has no relatives interred there. The Lees, you
                  know, are absolute strangers in this part of the country."
               "So I understood; and yet, upon my word, I saw her there, at two different times,
                  as plainly as I see you now. On both occasions, it was late in the evening, and
                  she passed within a few yards of me, apparently on her way to the shore."
               "You must have been mistaken. Mary never goes there; I should hear of it, if she
                  did. Sometimes, in calm evenings, she and Lanty Hanlon take a run up the lough
                  together in the jolly-boat, but I never heard of her visiting the graveyard."
               During this little conversation between Uncle Jerry and Kate, Dr. Henshaw and Mrs.
                  Willoughby were busily engaged talking on various subjects, and particularly those
                  relating to Scotch and English society. Being of an old aristocratic family
                  herself, the good lady was very fond of speaking of her ancestors, dating them
                  back as far as the Conquest, and of the various noble houses all over England and
                  Scotland, with which she had become connected during a long succession of years.
                  Dr. Henshaw, on the other hand, coming as he did from an old Puritan stock, and
                  still proud of his grim old warrior fathers, was not inclined to set much value on
                  his venerable companion's reminiscences of the past, and indeed went so far in his
                  rough, brusque manner of speaking of the English nobility, as to shock the old
                  lady's prepossessions very much, and finally to consign his own, as well as her
                  ancestors, to perdition, as enemies of the Catholic church. Fortunately, however, a circumstance of rather a
                  ludicrous character occurred just then to prevent an open rupture.
               Lanty Hanlon, as the reader may remember, was appointed to take charge of the
                  negro in the boat house, and keep him as comfortable as possible under hay and
                  blankets, till a carriage could be sent next morning to convey him to Greenmount,
                  if it should so happen that no accommodation could be had for him at Castle
                  Gregory. Lanty waited patiently till the half hour was up, expecting by that time
                  to see some of the castle servants coming down to relieve him. But when the half
                  hour passed, and no one came, he began to feel somewhat uneasy at the prospect of
                  being obliged to sit up all night with so unsociable a companion. The next half
                  hour passed away also, and no one came. Lanty went to the door to listen—but all
                  in vain—not a sound could he hear, but the occasional screech of the peacock
                  perched on the old sun dial.
               "Begorra," he muttered to himself, at last, scratching his head and returning to
                  his weary post, "begorra, it's a mighty agreeable okkipation, sittin here all
                  alone nurse-tendin a blackamoor, an not a sowl within call of me. I'd like to know
                  what Mary Kelly will say when I'm not there to take her up to Ned Callahan's
                  christenin. I'm sayin, Mr. Blackamoor," he continued, turning to the negro, who
                  now lay motionless on the flat of his back, "I'm sayin, ye'd do me a mighty great
                  favor if ye'd let me off till daybreak. I've some weighty business on my
                  hands."
               "Berry sick, massa," responded the negro.
               "O, I don't dispute that in the laste. But there's no fear of you dyin till
                  mornin, any how."
               "Berry bad, massa; berry sick; no tink me live."
               "O, musha, bad luck to the fear of ye, my augenach; yer more
                  frightened than hurt."
               "Me no feel toes—none at all."
               "O, botheration to yer toes—I'm not goin to stay here all night nursin them,
                  without as much as a drop i' drink, or even a draw of the pipe to warm me. So
                  start, my darlin; I'll carry ye to the castle."
               "You kill me, massa."
               "Dang the fear of ye—come, now, get up, my fine fellow—ye'll ride on a Christian's
                  back, any way, and that's an honor ye little expected."
               The poor negro begged hard to be left where he was for the night, but Lanty was
                  inexorable; the dance at Ned Callahan's christening, with Mary Kelly for a
                  partner, was too strong a temptation. After various twistings and turnings, he
                  succeeded at length in seating the invalid on the top of an empty barrel, and then
                  backing in, wound the creature's arms round his neck, and tied them there with his
                  handkerchief, lest he might happen to grow faint, and fall on the road. In this
                  fashion Lanty started off with his burden, intending to leave him in one of the
                  out-houses till morning. When he reached the castle, however, he found them all
                  locked. The only door, in fact, he saw open, after hawking his load all over the
                  place, was the great hall door of the castle itself. So, after some hesitation, he
                  took courage, and in he went. Looking round the spacious hall, and seeing no one
                  coming, he determined to deposit the negro on a door mat, and then, having rung
                  the bell, disappear as fast as possible. Unfortunately, however, he selected the
                  wrong place, and worse still, in turning round to drop the negro behind him, he
                  stumbled backwards, burst open the parlor door, where the company we have just
                  left were quietly seated, and rolled into the middle of the room, with the negro's
                  arms clasped around his neck as tight as a vice.
               The uproar was awful. Mrs. Willoughby screamed; Mr. Guirkie shouted thieves and
                  murder; Dr. Henshaw upset the table and lights, in his effort to catch his
                     aristocratic antagonist, as she fell
                  fainting from her chair. Kate ran to one door, and the priest groped his way to
                  another, calling on the servants. Within the room all was darkness and confusion.
                  Uncle Jerry, in his attempts to escape, capsized chairs, tables, tumblers,
                  decanters, dumb waiters, and every thing else that came in his way. Mrs.
                  Willoughby, in a fit of hysterics, wriggled furiously in the arms of the tall
                  reviewer, whilst Lanty kicked and swore lustily at the "blackguard blackamoor" to
                  let him go.
               At length the servants came running in with lights, one after another, all out of
                  breath, and all inquiring what had happened. The shouts and screams of the party
                  had attracted to the spot every domestic in the house, from the boot boy to the
                  steward. But their stay was short, for the instant their eyes fell on the negro's
                  black face, they mistook him for a certain gentleman of the same color, and fled
                  away, treading on each other's heels, and screeching like very demons, till the
                  din grew ten times greater than before.
               "What's all this clamor about?" demanded the priest, motioning back the affrighted
                  servants. "Brave fellows you are, to be scared in this way by the black face of a
                  poor African. But where's Lanty Hanlon?" he inquired, suddenly recollecting
                  himself; "eh! where's Lanty Hanlon? away, and bring the villain here forthwith;
                  he's the cause of all this trouble. Bring him here instantly."
               "Lanty Hanlon, where are you?" shouted one.
               "Lanty Hanlon, the priest wants you!" cried another. But no answer came. Lanty
                  Hanlon was gone.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               
                  Dr. Henshaw's Pride is deeply wounded. To be taken for a Burglar, and treated
                     as a Burglar, is more than he felt prepared to put up with. Captain Petersham
                     apologizes for his Blunder, but to no purpose.
               
               CAPTAIN PETERSHAM, booted and spurred, and accompanied by an officer in undress
                  constabulary uniform, entered the parlor the moment the servants rushed in with
                  the lights, and there beheld, to his utter amazement, the insensible form of his
                  venerable aunt, in the arms of a tall, red-bearded stranger. The groans of the
                  unfortunate African on the floor, and the cries of Uncle Jerry, mingling with the
                  screams and confusion of the affrighted servants, left him no room to doubt the
                  man was a burglar; and fired with indignation at the outrage thus offered his
                  relative, he snatched a pistol from the mantel-piece, and bounding over chairs,
                  tables, broken glasses, and every thing else that lay in his way, presented the
                  weapon at his head.
               "Villain, desist," he cried, "or I blow your brains out."
               "Hold on, sir," ejaculated Henshaw; "remove your weapon."
               "Lay down the lady on the sofa, sirrah—lay her down instantly!"
               "Are you mad, sir?—I have no—no——"
               "Down with her, or by——"
               The doctor, feeling the cold muzzle of the pistol touch his forehead, dropped his
                  burden as suddenly as if she had been a bar of hot iron, and then drawing himself
                  up, and pursing out his lips, demanded to know who dared assault him thus.
               "Silence, villain," again thundered the captain, "silence."
               
               "Sir, I'm no villain, and I demand——"
               "Another word!" and the excited captain again raised his weapon.
               But the police officer, fearing his fiery temper might drive him to extremities,
                  arrested his arm, and begged him to see to the lady, while he took charge of the
                  prisoner.
               "Hold him fast, then," he cried. "Let him escape at your peril. Ho! there," he
                  continued, shouting to the servants—"ho! there, rascals; let two or three of you
                  remove Mrs. Willoughby to her room, and the others start off and scour the country
                  for the rest of the gang; five pounds for the first capture; come now, my lads,
                  lose no time; tumble out and be active."
               As the excited captain rushed from the parlor, after issuing his orders, he came
                  full tilt against Uncle Jerry, and laid him sprawling on his back.
               "Thank you," said the latter; "I'm exceedingly obliged, upon my word. Well, I vow
                  and declare," he added, as he kicked up his little gaitered legs, and wriggled
                  like a capsized crab—"I vow and declare there's not such another place as Castle
                  Gregory in the whole world."
               "Kate Petersham! Kate Petersham! Hilloa, Kate, where are you?" cried the captain,
                  leaving Mr. Guirkie to his own resources.
               "Here," said a voice behind him.
               The captain turned, and to his surprise beheld his sister in an arm chair, her
                  head thrown back, her hair all down over her shoulders, and her whole frame
                  convulsed with laughter.
               "What in the name of all the Furies does this mean?" he demanded, beginning to
                  suspect some mistake.
               But Kate, to save her life, could not articulate a syllable; all she could do was
                  to point to Uncle Jerry, on the floor.
               "Who is he?" said the captain; and turning to the prostrate man, he seized him by
                  his arm, and raised him on his feet.
               "Why, how now! is it possible?—good Heavens!—how came you here, Mr. Guirkie?"
               "That's not the thing, captain; no, sir, that's not the thing; the question is,
                  how I'm to get away, for the devil's in the house."
               "Where is Dr. Henshaw?" inquired the priest, stopping a servant running across the
                  hall.
               "Who the deuce is Dr. Henshaw? What—and Father John here too? Can you explain this
                  uproar, Father Brennan?" demanded the captain.
               "Lanty Hanlon's the cause of the whole of it—at least I suspect as much—but I must
                  leave you with Mr. Guirkie—he can enlighten you on the subject, whilst I go in
                  quest of the doctor."
               "Lanty Hanlon! he's the very devil, that fellow. Why, here's an officer of police
                  in the house this moment, in search of him."
               "For what?"
               "For an aggravated assault on a foreigner of the name of Weeks."
               "The Yankee?"
               "Very likely."
               "Well, upon my credit," said Uncle Jerry, "I'm quite sure he deserved all he got,
                  for he's a very presumptuous fellow. What d'ye think, captain? He had the
                  impudence to tell me that a horn on a hare's ear for a June fly was all a humbug.
                  Just imagine a stranger tell me that, after fishing over five years in these
                  waters."
               "Can no one say where Dr. Henshaw is?" inquired the priest, accosting Mr. Guirkie
                  and the captain.
               "Dr. Henshaw again! Who the mischief is Dr. Henshaw?"
               "A friend of mine I brought with me to see Castle Gregory."
               "He's an awful man," said Uncle Jerry.
               
               "Awful man?"
               "Yes, he wields theology like a sledge hammer, and sends all Protestants to misery
                  everlasting."
               "Hold," exclaimed the captain; "I fear I've made a confounded blunder. Good
                  Heavens! what have I done! That must be the very man I left just now in the
                  breakfast parlor, in custody of the officer."
               "Ha, ha! he, he!" chuckled Uncle Jerry again; "that's glorious!"
               "Why, I took him for a robber in the act of carrying off my aunt."
               "Excellent! he, he! excellent! Capital idea, such a man as Dr. Henshaw carry away
                  your aunt. Ha, ha!"
               "Are you ready?" cried Kate, marching up to the captain with a cutting whip in her
                  hand, and the strap of her riding cap under her chin.
               "Don't provoke me, Kate. Go away now."
               "What, sir, turned coward? and your whole retinue in the field."
               "Begone, I say."
               "And your venerable relative wrested from the arms of one of the gang!"
               The captain retreated into the parlor, but Kate followed him.
               "Shall I have the five pounds if I succeed?—five pounds, you know, for the first
                  capture."
               "Begone this minute," ejaculated the mortified captain, turning short and pursuing
                  her; but the mirth-loving, provoking girl was too swift for him, and fled from the
                  room laughing till the spacious hall rang again.
               But to return to the prisoner in the breakfast parlor.
               The wrath of the distinguished reviewer, on finding himself shut up in custody of
                  a police officer, knew no bounds. "Open that door, sir," he exclaimed, violently,
                  pointing at it with his finger—"open that door eenstantly, and give me free egress
                  from this infernal house."
               "Keep quiet, my good man," coolly replied the officer—"keep quiet."
               "Stand from the door," vociferated Henshaw, raising his clinched fist, "or I'll
                  fell you to the earth."
               "If you don't keep your temper, I'll handcuff you," replied the officer, with as
                  much coolness as before.
               "Handcuff me! Sirrah," cried Henshaw, running his thumbs into his waistcoat, and
                  swelling up till he looked like a Jupiter Tonans. "Handcuff me—caitiff, cuif!"
               "I have shackled as strong men in my time."
               "You preesumptuous pygmy," growled the doctor; and he shot at his keeper a look of
                  withering scorn like Glenalvon when he said to the young Douglas,— 
                     
                        "Knowest thou not Glenalvon, born to command
                        Ten thousand slaves like thee?"
                     
                  
               
               "Pray, fellow, what do you take me for?" at length he added, a little cooled down
                  under the officer's imperturbability of look and tone.
               "A robber—caught in the very act of abducting one of the ladies of the house."
               "A robber! Look at me again, sir! Am I like a robber?"
               "Can't say as to that. I've seen robbers as good-looking in my time."
               "You're an eensolent scoundrel; but go on, play oot the play. This is my first
                  Irish lesson, I presume."
               "And you'll find it a sharp one, too, I suspect, before it's over."
               "Humph! you're an Irishman, I take it."
               "I am—what of that?"
               "Why, I suspected as much, by your insufferable eensolence."
               "See here, my good man; that's a reflection on my country," said the officer, "and
                  I don't like it. Say what you please of myself, as long as you're in my
                     custody—but if you value your
                  health, let my country alone; for my knuckles itch when I hear it lightly spoken
                  of, especially by a foreigner."
               At this moment a knock was heard at the door, and presently Captain Petersham
                  entered.
               "I hasten," said the portly captain, with a smile on his honest, jolly face—"I
                  hasten, Dr. Henshaw, to offer you an apology for this——"
               "Sir, I shall accept no apology," growled the doctor. "All I require is
                  permeession to quit this house—instantly."
               "But, my dear sir, will you——?"
               "No, sir; you've offered me an unpardonable insult."
               "Will you not listen to an explanation?"
               "No, sir—I'll listen to no explanation."
               "Pshaugh! nonsense, my dear friend—don't take it so ill. Why, I've been making and
                  apologizing for blunders all my lifetime. Father John here will tell you the
                  little boys on the streets call me nothing but blundering Tom Petersham."
               "That's a positive fact, and good reason for it, too," muttered Uncle Jerry,
                  ambling about the room, and bobbing his skirts up and down as usual.
               "Come, come, doctor," persisted the captain, again offering his hand, "let us
                  forget this foolish mistake, and drink success to Bonnie Scotland over a good
                  stout bottle of old Port—supper awaits us in the next room."
               "You must excuse me, sir; I can't partake of your hospeetality," said the doctor
                  gruffly, turning away and moving to and fro like a caged lion.
               "Don't you remember Eolus?" said Uncle Jerry, whispering in the priest's
                     ear—"Vadit per claustram magno cum murmure
                     rauco. He, he! he's the very man."
               "Is there no way to conciliate him?" inquired the captain, turning to the
                  priest.
               "None that I know of."
               "Let us start Kate at him," said the captain; "if the man has a soft spot in his
                  heart, she'll find it."
               And Kate did beg and entreat him to stay for the night, and begged and begged
                  again, but all to no purpose—the doctor was inflexible. Nay, he went even so far
                  at last as to rebuke her harshly for her familiarity; and Kate, the poor
                  kind-hearted girl, unaccustomed to such language, blushed like a child under the
                  reproof, and stole away, mortified, from the room.
               "Now, then, in the name of all the gods in Olympus," exclaimed the captain, who
                  had been watching Kate, and witnessed her repulse, "that makes an end of it. An
                  apology is as much as one gentleman can require of another, and I've already
                  satisfied my conscience on that point. Ho, there! who waits—Thomas?"
               "Here, sir."
               "Let the coachman drive up instantly, and take this gentleman home. Confound such
                  stubborn—sulky—maw-worms," he added, turning again to the priest. "I'm sorry, sir,
                  for this ridiculous blunder on your account; but hang me if I can play the
                  supplicant any longer."
               "Of course not."
               "Should he happen to be a gentleman, and desire satisfaction of another kind, I
                  shall be most happy to accommodate him. He can have Johnson of Birchfield, you
                  know, in a moment's warning."
               "No, no, captain," replied the priest, smiling; "he must dispense with such favors
                  for the present. For myself, I exceedingly regret having brought him with me to
                  Castle Gregory. But there was no help for it. The night was dark, and Mr. Guirkie
                  absolutely refused to part with the negro till he had seen you, and placed him
                  under your special protection. I'm sorry also I must accompany the doctor; for I
                  had promised myself a long chat with Kate on a certain interesting subject
                  which——"
               "Which is neither more nor less than the comparative merits of the Anglican and
                  Catholic churches. I suspected all
                  along, my dear fellow, what you and Kate were about, but it's no concern of
                  mine—let her please herself. If she wishes to adopt a new form of religion, I'm
                  satisfied—only let it be a decent one; for by all the saints in the calendar, if
                  she dared look even sideways at any of those tinkering religions they manufacture
                  nowadays, I'd hang her up for the crows to pick."
               "Ha, ha! you don't like these new-fangled systems, I perceive."
               "Like them! why, they're the most damnable nuisances in the country. One of those
                  canting fellows who peddle them round here, called on me last week, and after
                  disgusting me with his hypocritical twaddle, had the impudence to invite me to
                  what he called a prayer meeting. Ha, ha! By George, I had a good mind to fling the
                  fellow, neck and heels, out of the window. No, sir; I was bred a Protestant
                  myself, and intend to live and die one; but Kate is old enough now to know what
                  she's about, and may, for aught it concerns me, turn Catholic, if her taste lie
                  that way—but let her keep clear of these pettifoggers; that's all the stipulation
                  I make."
               "Well, but suppose," observed the priest, smiling—"suppose her taste led her to
                  adopt the Methodist——"
               "O, hang the Methodist. I'd rather see her peddle eggs with a basket on her
                  arm."
               "You don't apprehend much danger of that, I suppose? Kate's not exactly of that
                  turn of mind."
               "No; but you can't tell, sir, what may happen—you can't tell. These Hardwrinkles
                  are here night and day since she stopped going to church on Sundays."
               "Humph, and these visits are intended to counteract the influence of Mary Lee, I
                  suspect."
               "Poor Mary! Is she not a most fascinating creature?" said the captain, earnestly.
                  "I tell you what, sir, I believe in my soul I'm in love with that girl."
               The priest looked at the burly captain and smiled.
               "Well, hang me if I know what to make of it; but I feel sometimes as if I could
                  propose for her myself. Ha, ha! what think you of that, sir, from a bachelor of
                  forty-five?" and the captain laughed till his fat sides shook again at the idea of
                  such a match.
               "You would have but little chance against Randall Barry, I fear," replied the
                  priest.
               "The young outlaw?"
               "Yes; and the foolish boy is now somewhere in the neighborhood, I understand."
               "Saw him myself, and a devilish fine-looking fellow he is—saw him at the
                  lighthouse yesterday."
               "Is it possible! and you didn't arrest him as in duty bound? You're a very pretty
                  magistrate, indeed. Why, captain, I must report you to the government as an
                  abettor of treason."
               "Nonsense—I'm not a policeman, to carry handcuffs in my pocket."
               "But you might have ordered his arrest."
               "Humph! when I order the arrest of a fine young fellow like that, whose only crime
                  is to love his country, I shall be no longer Tom Petersham. Still, if he happen to
                  be brought before me, you know, as a justice of the peace, and fully identified, I
                  must commit him."
               "Of course you must. The boy is acting very rashly in coming here at all, after
                  all the warnings he has had."
               "He must be a bold fellow, knowing there's a reward of three hundred pounds
                  offered for his capture."
               "I wish to mercy he could be induced to quit the country for a time, for if he
                  happen to be taken, Mary will break her heart."
               "Well, he shall be arrested, you may depend on it, sooner or later. Three hundred
                  pounds, these hard times, is a strong temptation. Why, this very officer, in the
                  house now, chased him two days ago from Buncrana to Lambert's Point."
               
               "Carriage at the door," cried a servant.
               "And what of supper?"
               "On the table, sir."
               "Come then, my dear friend," said the captain, taking the priest familiarly by the
                  arm; "let us pick a bone together before you leave. Kate, go ask Dr. Henshaw to
                  join us. Where's Mr. Guirkie?—Mr. Guirkie, come forth—come forth, thou man of
                  indescribable sensibilities."
               But Mr. Guirkie had left the parlor a few minutes before, and was now making
                  arrangements with the steward for the safe conveyance of the African to Greenmount
                  next morning. He soon made his appearance, however, and joined the captain and the
                  priest in a glass of wine. It was all the refreshment they ventured to accept, as
                  Henshaw still doggedly rejected every attempt at conciliation.
               "Well, good by, doctor," said the good natured captain, accompanying the party to
                  the steps of the hall door; "I'm sorry you leave us in anger—but I know you'll
                  think better of it to-morrow. Good by, sir."
               The distinguished reviewer growled something in reply.
               "Kate," said the priest, "don't neglect to cultivate the acquaintance of Mary Lee,
                  nor forget to read that book I lent you on the beauties of the Catholic
                  religion."
               "Never fear," replied Kate; and then having promised Uncle Jerry to see particular
                  care taken of his poor African, she waved her hand in adieu, and the carriage
                  drove off at a gallop down the avenue.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               
                  Kate and Else at the Bedside of the Cabin Boy.—Else begins to suspect the
                     little Fellow will yet unravel a Mystery.—A Visit from Kate Petersham, who
                     receives a Letter from Lanty Hanlon, announcing Randall Barry's Arrest.
               
               A SEVERE attack of fever, resulting from the hardships he endured in the life
                  boat, had now confined the little cabin boy to his room at the lighthouse for
                  several days, during which Mary Lee was his constant attendant, hardly ever
                  leaving him, day or night.
               Doctor Camberwell had called to see the patient several times, and as often found
                  Mary patiently watching by his bedside, with the fidelity and affection of a
                  sister. Strongly did he remonstrate with her (as did her uncle also) on the
                  imprudence of shutting herself up so constantly in the sick room, especially when
                  Else Curley and Roger O'Shaughnessy were there to attend him. But all in vain.
                  Nothing could prevail on her to quit her post. She only smiled, and assured them
                  she apprehended no danger whatever.
               The room in which the boy lay was a small apartment on the north side of the
                  lodge, directly over the Devil's Gulch, and looking out on the far-famed Swilly
                  Rock, which lay in the very mouth of the lough, about half a mile distant, showing
                  its long black back now and then, as the swells of the sea broke over and seethed
                  down its sides. Beyond it, in the distance, appeared the rugged outline of Malin
                  Head, casting its deep shadow far out into the sea, and frowning a sulky defiance
                  at each passing ship as she rounded the dangerous bluff. It was to avoid that
                  headland the ill-fated "Saldana" ran for a harbor, and struck on Swilly Rock. On
                  that rock she lost her helm and masts, and then, broken up by the fury of the
                  ocean, drifted in fragments to the shore.
               
               Every soul on board perished, that night, but one little infant; and that infant,
                  now a lovely girl of eighteen, her eyes turned to the fatal spot, was praying for
                  the little wrecked cabin boy, laying beside her. She was kneeling before a
                  crucifix, with a rosary in her hand, and old Drake, resting his nose on his shaggy
                  paws, was peering up in her face.
               Suddenly she turned, and looked towards the bed.
               "Sambo—Sambo," muttered the boy; "where are you, Sambo?"
               Mary rose, and advancing to the bedside, laid her hand gently on the forehead of
                  the little sufferer—it was burning hot.
               "Sambo, dear Sambo," he again repeated, "let us return home. Mother calls me."
               "It's the crisis," murmured Mary; "six hours more will terminate the contest
                  between life and death. O Mother of God, Mother of our Redeemer," she added, "save
                  this wandering boy." And slowly sinking on her knees again, she prayed and wept
                  over him, till the tears rolled down her cheeks, and dropped unheeded on the
                  bed.
               "What's that you're doing, Sambo?" muttered the boy; "you scald me with drops of
                  lead."
               "Hush, hush," whispered Mary in his ear. "Keep quiet; I'm with you."
               "Take me home, Sambo, take me home."
               "Where?"
               "Where! to Old Virginny. There it is, right before you; don't you see the old
                  Potomac? Massa shan't blame you a mite—it was all my fault, and I'll tell him so.
                  Won't you take me back, Sambo?"
               "Yes, to-morrow—to-morrow; but keep still now, or I must leave you."
               The threat of desertion seemed to silence the little fellow completely. Mary then
                  applied a napkin steeped in vinegar and water to his burning temples, and after
                  smoothing his pillow, was returning to her seat near the window, when all of a
                  sudden she found herself clasped in the arms of Kate Petersham.
               "Kate!" she exclaimed; "is it possible?"
               "Yes—your own Kate—and I love you now a thousand times better than ever."
               "You won't scold me, will you?"
               "Scold you! for what?"
               "Not going to see you, according to promise."
               "And abandon your little charge there. No, no, Mary, I know your heart too well
                  for that. But I must scold you for something else, Mary. I must scold you for
                  staying here so constantly in the sick room."
               "There's no danger in the world, Kate."
               "Danger! Why, Dr. Camberwell says it's typhus fever, and of the most malignant
                  kind, too."
               "Well, but, dear Kate, you need not feel the least concern about that, for I'm not
                  afraid of it; and you know where there's no fear there's no danger."
               "I don't know any such thing. On the contrary, I'm sure you're running a great
                  risk."
               "Not the slightest. The Mother of God will protect me."
               "Ah, you can't be certain of that."
               "Quite certain. She never forsook me yet."
               "But if you've acted imprudently and rashly, why should she protect you?"
               "Listen to me, Kate, and when I tell you how all this happened, you'll say there's
                  something mysterious in it. It was just eighteen years, to the hour, since the
                  wreck of the Saldana, the night this poor boy was cast ashore on Ballyhernan
                  Strand. The circumstance struck me as something strange when I heard it mentioned
                  by the warren-keeper in the cabin, and pondering over it as I wet the lips of the
                  little mariner with a spoonful of wine and water, the idea occurred to me that the
                  Blessed Virgin had committed him to my special care. You may smile, Kate, but the
                  providence of God has its own ways and
                  means of accomplishing its ends. 'How very like my own fate is this little
                  wanderer's!' said I; 'perhaps he, too, has neither father nor mother left to watch
                  over him.' Just as I muttered these words to myself, he raised his eyes to mine,
                  and seemed to make such an appeal to my heart that I couldn't, for the life of me,
                  say a syllable in reply. So I only nodded a promise. He understood it though,
                  perfectly, and smiled his thanks as I gave it."
               "And you feel bound by that promise," said Kate, "though not a word was exchanged
                  between you."
               "O, indeed, as for that, Kate, I believe I had made the promise to the Blessed
                  Virgin before he looked at me at all. For why should he have been cast ashore that
                  night, of all the nights in the year, and consigned to my care too, by the doctor,
                  if there hadn't been something mysterious in it?"
               "And now, you're prepared to risk your life to save his?"
               "No, no," replied Mary, throwing her arm round her companion's neck, and leaning
                  her head gently on her bosom—"no, no, dear Kate, there's no risk for me, since the
                  Queen of Virgins has promised to save me."
               "But may not this be superstition?"
               "Superstition! O Kate, Kate, if you only felt for one short hour the blessed hopes
                  which the Mother of God inspires in the hearts of her suffering children, you
                  would speak less coldly of our beautiful religion. Indeed, Kate, only for the
                  consolations I have drawn for the last six years from that pure fountain of pity
                  and love, I should long since have sunk under the weight of my sorrows."
               "Ah," responded Kate, compassionately; "you've had sorrows enough, poor
                  child."
               "And yet, strange as it may seem, it's the cheerfulness with which he bears his
                  misfortunes that wounds me the most."
               "His misfortunes! Whom do you mean?"
               "My uncle."
               "O, I thought you were speaking of your own griefs."
               "No; I never had any thing to grieve for but him—he is all the world, though, to
                  me; for, indeed, I think, Kate, he loves me more than his life."
               "Don't wonder much at that, Mary."
               "To see him falling, step by step, from the proud position he once occupied among
                  the best and noblest of the land; to see his friends—alas! they were sorry
                  friends—deserting him day after day; to see his creditors, who were wont to come
                  to him bowing in lowly reverence, now insolently rebuking him for his reckless
                  extravagance; to see his stables empty, his hounds all dead and gone, his servants
                  forsaking him one by one; and to see himself smiling and happy-looking as a
                  bridegroom in the midst of all that desolation,—O, Kate, it was that which almost
                  broke my heart."
               "On the contrary, Mary, I think it should have consoled you to see him bear his
                  misfortunes so bravely."
               "Ah, yes; but it's all deception—an outward show. He only affects to be happy on
                  my account."
               "You may be mistaken, Mary; it's his natural disposition, perhaps."
               "O, no," replied the gentle girl; "I can tell his very thoughts, though he fancies
                  them hidden from all the world. Often have I watched his countenance as he read
                  over those insulting letters of his creditors, and seen how he struggled to hide
                  his indignation under a smile. And now, Kate, they have found us out at last."
               "What—discovered your retreat?"
               "Yes; and threaten Mr. Lee with arrest, if their demands are not immediately
                  satisfied. One man has bought up several of his bonds, and demands payment before
                  the first of next month."
               "And what's to be done? Can my brother do any thing to avert the blow? Shall I
                  speak to him on the subject?"
               "Not for the world, Kate."
               
               "And why so? you know he loves your uncle."
               "Yes, but for that very reason he would be the last man of whom he should ask a
                  favor."
               "To whom, then, will you apply for help?"
               "I have applied already, Kate, to a dear friend."
               "You have?"
               "Yes; to one who never refused me in my need."
               "Ah! I understand you. Indeed! And you expect succor from her. But why not apply
                  to the Redeemer himself—the fountain of all goodness?"
               "Because, dear Kate, I fear I'm not worthy to approach him; and I know, besides,
                  he will hear the prayer of the Mother who bore him sooner than mine."
               "Then you apply to her merely as an intercessor? Why, I always thought you
                  expected aid directly from herself."
               "Kate, Kate, how often have I told you the contrary!"
               "Yes; but I have heard it preached about so often in our pulpits."
               "Hush! some one knocks. Come in."
               The door opened, and Else Curley, wrapped in her old gray cloak, entered the
                  room.
               Without uttering a word of recognition or apology, she advanced to the bed, and
                  laid her withered hand on the temples of the patient. Then, having satisfied
                  herself as to the progress of the disease, she turned slowly round, and throwing
                  back her hood, addressed Miss Petersham in her usual hoarse, hollow tones:—
               "Young woman, why are you here?" she demanded.
               "That's my own affair," replied Kate. "By what right do you ask?"
               "The right which the age and experience of eighty years give me. I seen many a
                  faver, girl, in my time, but niver yet so dangerous a faver as this. Away from the
                  room—it's no place for idle visitors."
               "And pray, old woman, what reason have you to feel so much concern for my
                  safety?"
               "The raison's too ould," replied Else, "to spake of now. Yer grandfather, if he
                  lived, cud hardly remimber it. But here," she continued, drawing a piece of folded
                  paper from her bosom, "read this, and judge for yourself, if it's at Araheera Head
                  ye ought to be."
               Kate took the paper from her hand, and accompanied Mary to the parlor.
               "Ha!" said Else, now that she found herself alone with the sick boy; "if he hasn't
                  lost his senses, I'll try what can be done to clear up this mystery. If the nigger
                  started back frightened, as Lanty says, when he first seen Weeks at Mr. Guirkie's,
                  he must know something about him; and accordin to all accounts, the nigger and the
                  boy come from the same plantation. Ay, ay, there's a hole in that wall somewhere
                  worth the ferretin. Look up," she continued, touching the lad on the arm with her
                  fore-finger—"look up an spake to me."
               "Who's that?" murmured the boy, turning on his side, and gazing at the old woman;
                  "are you Sambo?"
               "Ay, I'm Sambo."
               "You're not Sambo—nigger Sambo."
               "Don't you know me?"
               "Yes, but you sure you're Sambo—very sure you're Sambo Nelson?"
               "Quite sure—and what's your name?"
               "My name—my name's Natty."
               "Natty what?"
               "Natty Nelson."
               "And where's your father?"
               "My father—my father—well, let me see, my father—where's my father."
               "Where does he live?"
               "Who?"
               "Your father."
               "Sambo, Sambo, whisper; don't be afraid; he shan't flog you."
               
               "Who shan't flog me?"
               "Father—old Danger, you know. So take me back to old Virginny—take me back, mother
                  calls me. Listen, ain't that the wash of old Potomac against the ship's side?"
               "Hush! don't speak so much, Natty—tell me, Natty."
               "Ay, ay, sir, by the mark—seven—send all hands aloft—take in sail."
               Else, finding it now impossible to draw any further information from the boy, took
                  a small vial from her pocket, and pouring a few drops of the contents into a
                  spoon, gave it to her patient.
               "There," she muttered, "that'll make you sleep for the nixt hour; and when ye
                  waken, if yer senses haven't come back, I'll try some other manes to rache the
                  sacret." Then drawing out her stocking, she sat down on a low stool by the
                  bedside, and commenced her knitting.
               "This is a very pretty piece of paper indeed," said Kate, looking at the address
                  as she entered the parlor.
               "To her ladyship, Miss Petersham."
               "Good, so far; now for the inside. Eh! what in the name of all the fairies is
                  this? 'Lanty Hanlon is my name, and Ireland is my nashin, Donegal is my dwillin
                  plas, an heven is my xpectashin.' His expectation, the villain! Ha, ha! if heaven
                  were full of angels like him, I'd rather be excused from joining the company. It
                  must be the fly leaf of the fellow's prayer-book. But hold, here's something on
                  the other side."
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "This is to let you no, that"—here Kate suddenly dropped her voice,
                              and read over the remainder in silence: "Randall Barry lies woondid
                              and a prisner in Tamny Barrics, I'll meet yer ladyship this evenin at
                              the castil about dusk, behint the ould boat-house, no more at
                              presint
                           
                              but remanes your abaident to command
                              LANTY HANLON."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "Any thing amiss?" inquired Mary, as Kate finished the reading of the precious
                  document—"you look alarmed."
               "Alarmed! do I? O, no, it's nothing particular."
               "Lanty's full of mischief—been playing you some trick, perhaps."
               "Lanty! no, no—it's a mere trifle; I must get home, however, as soon as possible.
                  Please ring for Roger—I want him to call the cockswain."
               As Mary turned to ring the bell, Roger made his appearance at the door, carrying
                  the old silver salver, and awaiting the command of his young mistress to
                  enter.
               "Come in, Roger; what have you got there?" said Kate.
               "A little refreshment, please, madam. Mr. Lee sends his compliments to Miss
                  Petersham."
               "Is he at home?"
               "No, madam; he went out in the direction of Araheera a few minutes ago, and gave
                  orders to have cake and wine sent in afore he left."
               "What kind of wine is it, Roger?" inquired Kate, smiling over at Mary as she put
                  the question.
               "Ahem! what kind, madam why, it's a—it's—a very delaceous currant wine—very pure
                  and delicate."
               "Indeed!"
               "And just twenty-five years old next Christmas. No, I make a mistake
                  there—hem!—twenty-four years next Christmas—ahem! just twenty-four
                  years—exactly."
               "O, it don't matter," said Kate laughing; "a year, you know, is nothing."
               "It's the wine Lady Templeton ust to like so much when she visited the castle, if
                  you remember," observed Roger, bowing to his mistress.
               "Currant wine's but a sorry beverage at best, Roger," said Kate,
                  mischievously.
               "Well, perhaps, ladies, you would prefer Champagne or Sherry?"
               
               "O, no; no, Roger, don't trouble yourself."
               "No trouble in life, ma'am; only just say so, and I'll be happy to serve them. But
                  if you try this here, you'll find it delaceous."
               "Very well; we must taste it on your reccommendation: and now, Roger, send my men
                  aboard—we must leave instantly."
               When the old servant left the room, Mary laid her hand on Kate's shoulder, and
                  looking at her affectionately, again expressed her fears that something was wrong
                  at Castle Gregory.
               "Nothing, Mary—nothing, whatever."
               "And yet you look deeply concerned. Has Captain Petersham or Mrs. Willoughby been
                  sick?"
               "No, no, dear child they're both quite well. It's something I must attend to
                  before to-morrow, having no immediate relation to any of the family."
               As Mary stood there, leaning her arm on her companion's shoulder, and looking
                  wistfully in her face, she exhibited a form and features of exquisite beauty. The
                  rays of the declining sun had just then entered the window, and for a second or
                  two bathed her whole person in golden light, illumining her countenance with that
                  celestial glow which holy men say overspreads the features of the seraphim. Never
                  breathed a fairer form than hers—never shone a fairer face; and yet the beauty of
                  her soul transcended far the loveliness of her person. O, when loveliness of body
                  and soul unite in woman, how truly does she then reflect the image of her
                  Creator—the great source of purity, beauty, and love!
               "Kate, dear Kate," murmured Mary, "when shall we kneel together before the same
                  altar? When shall we become sisters in faith, as we are now in affection?"
               "Sooner, perhaps, than you anticipate," replied Kate, kissing the forehead of the
                  lovely girl.
               "You've read the little books I gave you?"
               "Yes, and liked them too; but I've been reading another book, which speaks more
                  eloquently of your faith, and draws me nearer to the threshold of your church,
                  than all the controversial works ever written."
               "O, I'm so delighted, dear Kate! What is it?"
               "I can't tell you that."
               "Why so?"
               "You would blush all over, and run away."
               "Did I ever read it?"
               "Never, I believe, though it belongs to you, and to you alone; for there's not
                  another like it in the whole world."
               "Belongs to me?"
               "Yes, to your very self, and yet you're quite unconscious of its possession; but
                  come with me to the steps—I must not delay another minute."
               The two young friends now walked hand in hand across the green lawn, and stood at
                  the head of the long flight of steps, looking down at the boatmen preparing to
                  leave.
               "Randall's coming here to-night," said Mary.
               "Poor fellow! I wish he were safe off to the south; for, indeed, he must soon be
                  caught if he stay here much longer. Do you remember him in your prayers,
                  Mary?"
               "Sometimes," murmured the blushing girl, looking down on the grass at her
                  feet.
               "Then pray for him earnestly to-night," whispered Kate; and tenderly
                  embracing her dear young friend, she ran down the steps before the latter had time
                  to ask a single word of explanation.
               "Now, my lads," she cried, jumping into the stern sheets, and taking the tiller in
                  her own hands, "now for it—out with every oar in the boat, and stretch to them
                  with a will; we must make Castle Gregory in an hour and twenty minutes, if it can
                  be done with oar and sail."
               "Can't, Miss Kate! impossible!" said the cockswain, tautening the foresheet; "the
                  ebb tide will meet us at Dunree."
               
               "Not if this breeze freshens a little," responded Kate, looking over her shoulder;
                  "and it shall—for there it comes dancing in to us from the mouth of the lough." As
                  she spoke, the little boat, impelled by four stout oarsmen, shot out from under
                  the shadow of the rocks, and began to cut her way through the waters. Mary stood
                  for a moment looking down at the receding form of her reckless, light-hearted
                  companion, as she sat in the stern with her hand on the rudder; and then, waving a
                  last adieu, returned to resume her charge of the cabin boy.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               
                  Weeks begins to develop himself.—The Hardwrinkles.—Robert Hardwrinkle's
                     ultimate Designs on Mary Lee.—Visit from Constabulary Officer.
               
               "COME in," said Weeks, glancing over his shoulder at the tall, dark form of his
                  cousin, Robert Hardwrinkle, standing in the doorway. "Come in; I'm not
                  engaged."
               "Thank you," said his host, creeping softly in, and closing the door noiselessly
                  behind him. "I thank you; I merely called, at my good mother's request, to inquire
                  for your health. She always fears, poor creature, you're not well when you don't
                  come down to join us in family prayer."
               "Well, can't say I'm sick, exactly," responded Weeks, throwing up his feet on the
                  back of a chair, and offering his companion a cigar, which the latter modestly
                  declined. "Can't say I'm sick, though I hain't got quite clear
                  of that confounded wedding scrape yet. But the fact is, my dear fellow, I dread
                  these almighty long prayers of yours—I do, really."
               "Is it possible?"
               "A fact; I feel a sorter out of place like, sitting down there in the family
                  circle—well, kinder green, you know. Why, it's just like this—I ain't accustomed
                  to it exactly; business men in the States hain't got time to pray, as you do here
                  in the country."
               "Ah, but, my dear Ephraim, you should make time, for prayer is indispensable to
                  salvation. You cannot please God without it."
               "O, prayer is a very good thing, I allow," said Weeks, slowly puffing his cigar,
                  and beating off the smoke with his hand. "It's an excellent thing for those who
                  can attend to it; but it don't suit men in trade to spend whole hours at prayer,
                  and neglect their business."
               "Ah, but you can attend to both, if you only try."
               "Why, we do try. We read the Bible, and go to meeting three times on the Sabbath;
                  that's about as much, I reckon, as could reasonably be expected."
               "Perhaps so. The people of New England, I'm informed, have acquired a great
                  reputation for sanctity."
               "Certain, and deserve it too, take the hull of them on an average. There's the
                  women, for instance, and the farmers, and the country folks all round—they're all
                  church-going people, and do most of the praying, while the merchants and traders
                  are busy at their commercial pursuits. Well, it's just like this: one class of our
                  people does the praying, and the other does the trading—kind of makes it easy, you
                  know, on both; so that, take them on the hull, they're a very religious
                  people."
               "Ah, but, my dear Ephraim, that thing of halving the worship of God is forbidden
                  by the rules of the holy gospel. Every creature is bound to worship God, and pray
                  to him always—in season and out of season."
               "What! and have their notes protested at the bank? My dear fellow, business is a
                  sacred thing, and must be attended to."
               
               "Ah, but you forget, my good cousin, that the great, and, indeed, the only
                  business of life is salvation."
               "Well, supposing it is, (I always thought, myself, salvation was a pretty good
                  kinder doctrine in a general way, and I rather guess too the world should hardly
                  get along so well without it,) still you know it won't cancel a note, Cousin
                  Robert."
               "Ephraim! Ephraim!" said Hardwrinkle, his cold, stern, sallow countenance
                  exhibiting an expression of saintly sorrow as he spoke,—"Ephraim, where did you
                  learn to speak of religion with such contemptuous indifference? Have you so soon
                  forgotten the lessons of your pious mother? She, indeed, was a devoted servant of
                  the Lord. O, she was a holy soul—praying in season and out of——"
               "Precisely," interrupted Weeks, taking the cigar from his mouth, and knocking the
                  ashes off with his finger, "precisely—that's just it. She was forever running off
                  to contribution parties and prayer meetings, and neglecting her business at home.
                  By gracious, when father died he war'n't worth a five dollar bill in the world,
                  and I had to slink off to the south to earn my bread, 'mong niggers and cotton
                  bales. It's all very well to pray, and I don't object to it no how—but I don't see
                  either the darned use in praying all day and neglecting the main point."
               "The main point? and what's that, cousin?"
               "What's that! why, it's money, ain't it?"
               "Money!—you call money the main point?"
               "Yes, sir," responded Weeks, emphatically; "I call it nothing else.
                  Should admire to know what you call it."
               "You shock me, Ephraim. Really you shock me."
               "You don't say!"
               "Why, you must be a downright infidel, to speak in that irreverent manner."
               "Don't know about that. But I've got my own notions about religion, and ain't
                  agoin to change them for any man's way of thinking. Guess I'm old enough now to
                  judge for myself. And as for nine tenths of the religions going, I believe they're
                  danged humbugs."
               "Which of the different Christian denominations do you belong to, may I ask?"
                  inquired Hardwrinkle.
               "Well, can't say I belong to any in particular. I rather think, though, I like the
                  Unitarians better than most of them. Their ministers are pretty smart sorter men,
                  as a general thing, and preach first-rate sermons once in a while. No, I never
                  seemed to have any choice in that way. The fact is, I always calilated to do about
                  right with every man, and I kinder thought that was religion enough for me."
               "Cousin," said Hardwrinkle, after a little reflection; "will you permit me to ask
                  you one question?"
               "Certainly, my dear fellow; why not? Ask as many as you please. Ain't you my
                  cousin?"
               "I hope you won't be offended, or think me impertinent, Ephraim. You're my
                  mother's sister's child, you know, and it's but natural I should feel a lively
                  interest in your welfare, spiritual and temporal."
               "Of course, I'm your mother's sister's child—well!"
               "Well, it's merely this. Do you really believe in the existence of God? Now,
                  answer me candidly. It's rather a strange question, but no matter. Do you believe
                  in that dogma?"
               "Yes, sir," replied Weeks, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and
                  shaking up the silver. "Yes, sir, I believe that—no mistake about
                  it."
               "The Lord be praised!" exclaimed his pious cousin, turning up his eyes. "I'm
                  thankful you have not fallen yet into the lowest depth of the abyss. I really
                  feared, Ephraim, from your manner of speaking, you were an atheist."
               "No, sir; I believe in two things firmly, and no living man can make me change
                  that belief. I believe in the existence of a first cause, and the perfectibility
                  of man."
               
               "And is that all?"
               "That's all, sir—that's the length and breadth of my creed."
               "And how, think you, is man to be perfected?"
               "Why, by reason, science, and experience. That's about all he needs—ain't it?"
               "And what of religion?—shall it take no part in his perfection?"
               "Well—yes, guess it might help some; that is, if he'd only keep clear of these
                  darned isms, and adopt some sensible kind of religion for himself.
                  The worst thing in the world, cousin, for a business man, is to have any thing to
                  do with the details of religion. They sorter cramp him, you know. Let him lay down
                  a broad platform like mine, and stand upon it flat-footed—that's the way to get
                  along in trade."
               "And you're quite serious, Ephraim, in avowing those shocking sentiments."
               "Shocking or not, they're mine; that's a fact. Why, look here, my good friend; I
                  have seen too much of your hairsplitting religions in New England not to know what
                  they are by this time. Those deacons, and class leaders, and old maids, and
                  methodistical-looking crowds we see going to church every Sabbath, with their
                  Bibles under their arms, are, in my humble opinion, a darned set of dupes and
                  impostors, the whole concern of them. There's neither honor nor honesty amongst
                  them. By crackie, they'd cut your throat with one hand and carry the Bible in the
                  other. No, sir, a first cause, and the perfectibility of man, or, in other words,
                  the irresistibility of human progress, is about as much as any business man can
                  profess to believe with safety to himself or the interests of trade."
               "But is that belief sufficient to save your soul?"
               "Save my soul? O, that's quite another affair. If there be such things as souls,
                  (which is now rather a disputed point,) why, the Creator, who made them, knows
                  best how to take care of them, I presume."
               Hardwrinkle had never heard such language before on the subject of religion. Bred
                  in the country, and little acquainted with the world, he supposed that however
                  abandoned men might be, or whatever infidel sentiments they might really
                  entertain, the respect in which religion was held by the great majority of mankind
                  would naturally repress their inclination to avow them. Brought up as he was, a
                  strict Presbyterian, and accustomed from his childhood to hear religion spoken of
                  with the utmost reverence, he now appeared both astonished and hurt to hear his
                  cousin talk of it with such cold, reckless contempt. For himself, he was the very
                  impersonation of a hypocrite. Mean, sordid, and cunning as a Jew, he had the bland
                  smile and the saintly look forever at his command, and could play the Christian or
                  the demon, as it suited his purpose, with equal adroitness. All his religion was
                  external. It consisted of long prayers, demure looks, pious conversation, black
                  garments, and an ascetic aspect. At church he was never missing on the Sabbath;
                  hail, rain, or snow, he was there, sitting upright in his pew, motionless and
                  impassible as a statue. And there, too, sat his seven black sisters beside him,
                  tall, thin and lank, like himself; not a white spot to be seen about them but
                  their pocket handkerchiefs; even their very fans were as black as ebony. In the
                  whole world round never was seen so solemn, staid, and church-loving a family,
                  from Robert, the heir and master, down to Deborah,—or, as she was commonly called
                  by her elder sisters, Baby Deb,—now a young lady of seven and twenty. It happened,
                  however, that religion, by some misfortune or other, instead of softening and
                  expanding their hearts by its divine influence, had withered them up. Its
                  gladdening and exhilarating touch seemed only to have chilled them like an icicle.
                  The bright look and the pleasant smile, which denote the presence of religion in
                  the soul, were never once seen to light up their features. Like melancholy
                  spectres, dark and stern, they passed through the busy streets, or stole silently
                  away in the shadows of the houses—no
                  one caring to look after them, or bid God bless them for their charity. O thou
                  cold, stern monk of Geneva, thou whose heart never thrilled with a generous
                  emotion, whose pulse never throbbed with sympathy for thy kind, this death-like
                  picture of religion is thy handiwork. Thou subtle betrayer of the human
                  conscience, thou dark plotter of treason against the sovereignty of the human
                  soul, how could you look up at the bright heavens above, and see the blessed sun
                  gladdening the earth with his beams, or behold the stars dancing in their orbits
                  to the music of the spheres, and yet be demon enough to curse humanity with such a
                  lifeless religion as this?
               But of all the members of the Hardwrinkle family, Robert was the most heartless;
                  or if, indeed, he had a heart at all, it was as callous as a stone. When the
                  stranger beggar came to his door, (for those of the parish knew him too well to
                  enter his gates,) he neither ordered him from his presence nor hunted his dogs on
                  him. No, he kindly admonished the sufferer to guard against the many dangers and
                  temptations that beset him in his mode of life, counselled him gently to beware of
                  evil company, and then gave the shivering supplicant a religious tract to teach
                  him resignation to the will of Heaven, or a Dispensary ticket to procure ointment
                  for his sores. Money was his god, and he adored it. To part with a shilling, save
                  in usury, was like rending his heart-strings. He loved it, not for the use he
                  could make of it in giving employment to others, or in serving the interests of
                  the parish, without loss to himself, but for the mere pleasure of seeing and
                  feeling it with his hands. In this respect his cousin Ephraim was an entirely
                  different man. He, like a true Yankee, was fond of money too; nay, ready to go
                  through fire and water to obtain it; but yet he was just as ready, on the other
                  hand, to lend it to a neighbor in a pinch, and think it no great obligation
                  either. He valued money only as a circulating medium—as an agent to carry on
                  trade, or acquire a position for himself in society. He was forever talking, to be
                  sure, of dollars and cents; but still it was evident to those who happened to be
                  at all acquainted with his disposition and habits of life, that he was by no means
                  a mercenary man. Nor was he, like most lovers of money, envious of his neighbors'
                  prosperity—not he; on the contrary, he was pleased to see every one thrive and do
                  well, and ready to bid them God speed into the bargain. There was one peculiarity
                  in him, however, which at first sight looked rather damaging to the character of
                  an honorable man. He never scrupled taking advantage of his neighbor in
                  speculations; because every man, he contended, should have his "eye peeled," and
                  deserved to suffer if he hadn't. It was by sharp bargains men were made smart, and
                  by smart men trade was made to flourish; and if it happened now and then that a
                  few fell short of their expectations, why, the country at large eventually became
                  the gainer. On the other hand, if his neighbor happened to "come the Yankee over
                     him," to use a favorite expression, it was all fair in war—he
                  neither grudged nor grumbled, but "peeled his own eye" a little closer, and went
                  off to speculate on something else. Such were the two cousins. Both were fond of
                  money—the one to gloat over and adore it, the other to use it as an agent to
                  attain the objects of his pride or his ambition. But to proceed with our
                  story.
               "Merciful Heavens!" exclaimed Hardwrinkle, after a long pause, during which he
                  seemed to have lost his speech, for he uttered not a syllable, but kept looking
                  intently at his cousin; "merciful Heavens! such an expression from the mouth of a
                  Christian man—'if there be such things as souls.' Ephraim, Ephraim! I
                  fear you're irretrievably lost. O, let me entreat you to pray for light and grace
                  to dispel this darkness of unbelief. O, if you only read the word of God, join our
                  family prayer every night and morning, and come with me thrice on the Sabbath to
                  hear the outpourings of that faithful servant of the Lord, our dear and reverend
                  brother, Mr. Rattletext, be assured
                  your eyes would be opened to the light of glory shining through at a
                  distance——"
               "Say," interrupted Weeks.
               "The light of glory shining out to——"
               "Say, hold on; I've heard all that before—could repeat it myself as slick as a
                  deacon. There's no use in thinking to come it over me with that kinder talk. What
                  I believe, I believe, and I ain't agoin to believe nothing else, no how you can
                  fix it. A first cause, and the perfectibility of man, is my platform."
               "Ah, too broad, my dear friend—'narrow is the way,' you know."
               "Broad—that's just precisely what we want. We want a platform broad enough to
                  cover the hull ground. We are a young nation, sir, strong, active, and ambitious,
                  and must have room to stretch our arms east, west, north, and south. Our resources
                  are immense—inexhaustible, and we want a wide field to develop them—and that
                  field, I take it, sir, is the liberty of conscience."
               "You mean liberty to cheat and take advantage of your neighbor if you happen to be
                  clever enough to accomplish it with impunity?"
               "Why not? That's the life of trade, my dear fellow—that's what makes smart men.
                  Hence it is the Yankees are the smartest business men in all creation. Your
                  evangelical rules would ruin us in twelve months."
               "The laws of God ruin you? Do you really mean what you say?"
               "Well, look here; I speak only of our merchant and trading classes; with respect
                  to farmers, laborers, mechanics, women, and all that kinder folks, they can adopt
                  as many rules and regulations as they please, in the religious line. It don't make
                  any material difference, I presume, one way or other, since they hain't got no
                  business to transact; but you might as well think of corking up the Atlantic in a
                  champagne bottle, as expect the commerce of the States to thrive under the old,
                  stiff, evangelical rules of our grandfathers."
               "Ah, Ephraim, Ephraim, speak with respect of those holy men," said Hardwrinkle.
                  "O, I hope and pray," he continued, again raising up his hands and eyes in pious
                  supplication, "I hope and pray we may stand as well before the judgment seat as
                  they did."
               "Cousin Robert," said Weeks, looking sideways for a moment at the upturned face of
                  his companion, and twirling his watch key as he spoke,—"Cousin Robert, you're a
                  very godly, pious man, I reckon, and an honest man too; no mistake about that. But
                  pious people, let me tell you, ain't always to be trusted; hold on
                  now a minute; hold on; I'll just give you an instance in point. I knew a man once
                  in our section of the country, named Pratt—Zeb Pratt, they called him. Zeb was
                  deacon of the Methodist church in Ducksville, for nearly ten years in my own time,
                  and a real out and out Christian of the first brand. Well, he was cracked up so
                  for his sanctity, that he went by the name of Pious Zeb, of Scrabble Hollow. Now
                  Zeb never was known to be absent from meetin, morning, noon, or night—he was
                  punctual as the town clock. Every Sabbath morning, as the bell rang, there was Zeb
                  crossing the Commons, with his old faded crape on his hat, and his Bible under his
                  arm. He was president of all the charitable societies, too, in the district,
                  attended all the prayer meetings, carried his contributions of eggs and chickens
                  every year to the minister, distributed religious tracts to the poor——"
               "O, what a treasure!" exclaimed Hardwrinkle, unconsciously interrupting the
                  panegyric. "What a treasure!"
               "Treasure! What, Zeb Pratt! By gracious, he was the darnedest old villain in all
                  creation—he a treasure!—the old cheat, he'd swindle you out of your eye teeth.
                  Why, the old hypocrite cleared out one morning with all the funds of the Christian
                  Benevolent——"
               
               "Letters for Mr. Weeks," said a servant, knocking at the door.
               "Hand them here," cried the latter, promptly, throwing the stump of his cigar into
                  the grate, and snatching his feet off the back of the chair. "Ha, just what I've
                  been expecting this whole week past—they're from that lawyer of yours,
                  Robert."
               "Of mine?"
               "Why, yes, of your choosing. Rather slow though, for my money."
               "And, please, sir, Miss Rebecca wishes to know," said the servant, "what tracts to
                  distribute this morning, sir?"
               "Tell her it don't matter a great deal which; but she might as well, perhaps, try
                  that last package from the Home Missionary Society."
               "Yes, sir."
               "And William——"
               "Yes, sir."
               "She had better take Deborah with her, and leave Judith, Miriam, and Rachael to
                  meet Mr. Sweetsoul, the colporteur, and make arrangements with him about that
                  Sabbath school at Ballymagahey."
               "Yes, sir; and please your honor, sir, that woman is here with the three orphans
                  from Ballymastocker."
               "What woman?"
               "McGluinchy's wife, sir. Her husband died, if you remember, sir, last winter, of
                  the black fever."
               "And what does she want with me?"
               "Why, sir, she can't pay the rent, she says, till the new crop comes, and she
                  wants your honor to grant her spareance. The bailiff gave her notice to quit
                  yisterday."
               "Well, you must tell her, William, I pity her very much. I do, indeed, for hers is
                  a very bad case. But I have always made it a rule never to interfere with the law;
                  it must take its course."
               "Yes, sir; very well, sir;" and the servant bowed and quitted the room.
               "So you've heard from your lawyer at last, Ephraim," said Hardwrinkle, turning to
                  his cousin, who had just finished reading his letter.
               "Y—e—e—s," replied Weeks, "after waiting a whole week for it. These Irish lawyers
                  of yours are rather slow coaches, I expect."
               "Fast enough, Ephraim, fast enough for the poor man, when he has their claims to
                  satisfy—ay, ay, Heaven look to the poor when they happen to fall into their
                  hands."
               "Listen to his letter."
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "DEAR SIR: Agreeably to your instructions of June ——, I wrote
                              yesterday to Mr. Edward Lee, notifying him of the purchase of his
                              notes of hand for one hundred pounds, by Ephraim C. B. Weeks,
                              Ducksville, Connecticut, United States, now staying at Crohan House,
                              county Donegal, and of his (Mr. Weeks's) anxiety to have the debt
                              cancelled by the first of next month, or secured by responsible
                              indorsers, as it is his (Mr. Weeks's) intention to return home as soon
                              as possible. Shall be happy to receive further commands, and have the
                              honor to be
                           
                              Your very obedient servant,
                              "JEREMIAH DIDDLEWELL.
                              "Dublin, 26 Great James street, June ——."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "Humph!" said Hardwrinkle, after Weeks had read the letter over; "so you've made a
                  beginning."
               "Certainly. I've got to; the girl won't look at me otherwise. I have now called on
                  her a dozen times, and wrote her as many letters, and yet she treats me as coldly
                  as if I'd been an absolute stranger. We'll see, however, what the screws can
                  do."
               "You say Lee himself never gave you any encouragement."
               "Why, no; he only kinder laughs when I allude to it. I swonnie, I don't know what
                  to make of the man. His conduct's
                  duct's most unaccountable. Why he must either take me for a fool or a madman."
               "You are mistaken, Ephraim; he takes you for neither. He merely laughs at your
                  presumption in aspiring to the hand of such a high-blooded girl as Mary Lee."
               "High-blooded humbug—hang your high-bloods!"
               "Don't feel offended, my dear Ephraim—I had no intention——"
               "No, but that darned old witch, Else Curley, keeps talking to me just in the same
                  style about her aristocracy, so that I'm sometimes most tempted to cowhide her for
                  her impudence. When I inquire how she gets along in bringing things round, the
                  only answer I can get from the old rascal is, 'Wait a while, wait a while, till
                  her pride comes down another peg or two.' Yes, by crackie," he continued, rising
                  and pacing the room, with his hands stuck down in his pockets jingling the silver;
                  "yes, wait a while, till her pride comes down; just as if the grandson of an old
                  revolutionist of seventy-six warn't good enough for the best blood in the
                  land."
               "My dear Ephraim, you don't understand the Irish people, or you wouldn't talk so.
                  They're an old people, you must remember, and like all old people, proud of their
                  ancestors. You, on the other hand, being a new people, measure the respectability
                  of men and families by the amount of money or property they're possessed of,
                  simply because you have no ancestors yourselves."
               "Well, look here, cousin; be that as it may, I'm not agoin to stay here much
                  longer, any how. This affair must soon be fixed one way or other. When you wrote
                  me, to say this girl was the daughter and heir of old Talbot, I gave up my
                  business and came over here, without waiting even to bid my friends good by. Well,
                  after three weeks' search and inquiry in Cork and all round for the old woman said
                  to have nursed her, and as long spent in Dublin hunting up the certificate of her
                  mother's marriage, I came down here fully confident, from your assurances of
                  success, that the girl and her uncle were so almighty poor, they'd jump at my
                  proposal, right straight off. Now then, here I am all of five weeks sneaking up
                  and down to that confounded lighthouse, through thunder and lightning half the
                  time, and groping my way through rain and darkness the other half; and by crackie,
                  I ain't one mite nearer my object now than ever."
               "I'm sorry, Ephraim, very sorry indeed," replied Hard-wrinkle, looking down and
                  sighing regretfully; "sorry you're so much disappointed; but indeed, indeed it's
                  not my fault, for surely I've done all that could reasonably be expected to
                  expedite the affair. As for the two thousand pounds you kindly promised in
                  acknowledgment of the little assistance I might be in the matter, you know I
                  should have just as cheerfully done as much, my dear Ephraim, if you never had
                  promised a farthing. No, no; money has never influenced me, thank Heaven. No,
                  Ephraim; I hope I have a conscience to direct me, and a heart too, to love my
                  relatives well enough to do them a kindness without expecting a recompense."
               "I know it, cousin. I know it. You have been exceedingly kind, and I ain't agoin
                  to forget your kindness either; but just look how the case stands. Here I've spent
                  already five hundred dollars for the note, that ain't worth a red cent. Of course,
                  when you recommended me to buy it, you thought otherwise, and so I took your
                  advice. Well, there's four hundred dollars and over to Else Curley; and how can I
                  tell but the scheming old witch is 'doing' me all the while? That and my
                  travelling expenses, and loss of time besides, will amount to a pretty
                  considerable sum, let me tell you."
               "It is a pretty round sum, I admit," muttered Hardwrinkle.
               "Well, it's just such a sum," said Weeks, "that I've made up my mind I ain't agoin
                  to lose it for nothing. I'm determined to have the girl—no mistake about that. And
                  if she ain't willing to marry me one way, she shall another."
               "Ah, indeed; what mean you by that, cousin?"
               
               "Well, I've got my own notions about it; that's all. By jolly, I ain't agoin home
                  to Ducksville again empty-handed—catch me at it!"
               "You wouldn't carry her off by force—would you, eh?" said Hardwrinkle, dropping
                  his voice to a whisper, and looking round the room to see if the doors were
                  closed.
               "The thing has been done," replied Weeks, "and pretty often too in this country of
                  yours, if I ain't greatly mistaken."
               "Yes, I admit it has occasionally been done. But in this case I can hardly see how
                  it could be accomplished without danger."
               "Why, there's such a thing as a boat to be had, I guess, and the
                  distance to carry her ain't so very far that you can't find half a dozen stout
                  fellows to do it. I shouldn't like much though to go to these extremes if there
                  was any possibility of obtaining her consent by other means. But have her I
                  shall—no mistake about that."
               "Hush, hush!" ejaculated Hardwrinkle; "there's some one at the door—come in."
               The door opened, and an active, muscular-looking man, of middle age, entered and
                  advanced to the table at which Hardwrinkle was sitting. He was the officer of
                  constabulary whom the reader has seen a few nights before at Castle Gregory, with
                  Captain Petersham.
               "Ah, it's you, is it?" exclaimed Hardwrinkle, rising suddenly from his chair.
                  "Well, any news of Barry?"
               "He's arrested, sir, and now a prisoner in Tamny barracks."
               "What, arrested! eh! that's capital news. Please step to the next room—excuse me,
                  Mr. Weeks; I'll return presently."
               "Go ahead—don't mind me," replied Weeks, drawing a cigar from his case and
                  preparing to light it.
               "Now," said Hardwrinkle, carefully closing the door, "now for the details. Mr.
                  Weeks's notions of these young revolutionists don't exactly harmonize with ours,
                  you know, so it's just as well he don't hear our conversation on the subject. Now
                  for your story."
               "Well, sir, we crossed the ferry, as you suggested, proceeded on to Doe Castle,
                  and thence to Rann Point. There we met the man who gave you the information first
                  about Barry's intention to escape—I forget his name—he's one of your tenants."
               "Carson, you mean."
               "No, sir; the man you sent down to spy about the lighthouse, you remember; the one
                  who listened at Else Curley's door, and overheard the conversation between her and
                  Barry about his going to Arranmore."
               "O, yes, yes; Barker, the Bible reader."
               "Barker—precisely—that's the man; a pious soul he is, too."
               "Very—very, indeed. He's a most excellent man, is Barker."
               "Well, sir, we met him coming up from the shore, where he had been distributing
                  tracts among the fishermen, by way of an excuse. He told us he had just seen Barry
                  jump from a boat in company of three or four stout fellows, and enter one of the
                  huts. They were all strangers to him, he said, except Barry himself, and another
                  who seemed to be the most active of the party, and whom he had seen before, but
                  couldn't remember where."
               "Stop a moment; did he describe his dress or person?"
               "He did, but I paid little attention to it, not thinking it a matter of much
                  consequence. It appears to me, though, he said something about his wearing a green
                  jacket or a fur cap, or something to that effect."
               "The very man, sir; that's Lanty Hanlon, if he's alive, and quite as dangerous a
                  man, too, as Barry."
               "Lanty Hanlon—impossible, sir. You mean the fellow against whom you issued the
                  warrant for the assault on Mr. Weeks?"
               
               "The identical person."
               "Pardon me—that cannot be, Mr. Hardwrinkle—Hanlon was seen at a cockfight in
                  Kindrum not six hours ago."
               "I have no doubt of that," replied Hardwrinkle. "But, my dear sir, you little know
                  what that villain is capable of doing. Why, sir, it was once sworn on oath before
                  me, that this very Lanty Hanlon was seen at a wake in Crantin Glen, at a wedding
                  in Ballymagahey, and at a christening in Callen, the self-same night, and yet
                  these places are seven miles apart, and nearly equidistant from each other."
               "He must be an extraordinary man," said the officer, smiling incredulously.
               "He's a most dangerous man, sir, to be permitted to go free in any community. What
                  do you think, sir?—that fellow met one of Mr. Johnston's gamekeepers on Benraven
                  Mountain, some six weeks ago, where he happened to be coursing for hares. Well,
                  sir, he first took the gun from the keeper, and then left him gagged and tied to a
                  tree for the whole night; and next morning, when the unfortunate man was
                  accidentally discovered by one of the herdsmen, he was more dead than alive from
                  cold and hunger."
               "Was he punished for the outrage?"
               "No, sir; he managed to escape that very cleverly. The moment he secured the
                  keeper, he jumped on the first horse he found on the mountain, galloped for life
                  to Sandy Mount, then, secreting the horse among the trees, walked into Mr.
                  Johnston's parlor, and having apologized to that gentleman for having, contrary to
                  law, shot some grouse on his preserves, and obtained his pardon, again mounted,
                  rode back, and left the horse where he found him. Next morning, when the
                  gamekeeper returned and made his complaint against Hanlon, Mr. Johnston ordered
                  him instantly from his presence, called him a drunkard and a liar, and protested
                  he had never heard of such an attempt at imposition in his life—Hanlon having been
                  that very night, and at the very time the outrage was alleged to have been
                  perpetrated, standing before him in his own room. But with respect to Barry, how
                  did you succeed in arresting him?"
               "Simply enough, sir. We hired a boat, got our men in, and lay at anchor some five
                  or six fathoms from the beach, knowing well Barry and his party would endeavor to
                  escape next morning at daybreak, by rowing along the shore as far as Horn Head,
                  and there set sail for Aranmore. It turned out just as we expected. At the first
                  peep of day, the party got into the boat and shoved off. They were ahead of us
                  when they started, and we let them keep ahead for two miles or more, till we had
                  gone clear out of sight of the fishermen's huts. Then, stretching to our oars, we
                  soon came alongside, and grappled with irons we had taken with us for the
                  purpose."
               "Hah! and so secured him at last?"
               "Yes, sir, we secured him, but not without considerable difficulty."
               "What! did he resist?"
               "Resist! yes, as man never resisted before. It appears the crew that conveyed him
                  to Rann Point left him there, and returned home, confident he was out of all
                  danger, and the fresh hands appointed to convey him to Aranmore were old men,
                  hardly able to paddle an oar or handle a sheet. He was, therefore, left to depend
                  almost entirely upon his own resources. The instant we laid hold of the gunwale of
                  his boat, he sprang up in the stern sheets, and demanded what we meant by stopping
                  him. 'I'm a queen's officer,' said I, 'and hold a warrant for your arrest.'"
               "'Ah, a queen's officer,' he repeated, glancing at my civilian dress. 'Indeed!
                  Well, sir, take me if you can;' and coolly drawing a pistol from his belt, he said
                  to his men, 'Comrades, you'll find another pair in my overcoat; use them if
                  necessary.' Then stepping across the thwarts, and before I could rise from my
                  seat, he snatched the anchor from the bows of his boat, and with one hand swung it
                  as he would a walking stick into the
                  bottom of ours. The effect was instantaneous; the sharp iron cut right through the
                  thin sheathing of the little gig, and in two minutes she filled to her water
                  line."
               "'Now, my lads,' he cried, 'loose the grapples, and away with them.'"
               "Good Heavens!" exclaimed Hardwrinkle; "his object was to sink you."
               "Of course it was—and a bold attempt he made to accomplish it. When I saw how
                  desperate the case was likely to prove, I ordered my men to jump aboard and secure
                  him at all hazards, leaving our own boat to her fate; and setting them the example
                  myself, I sprang into the stern, presented a pistol at his head, and commanded him
                  to surrender, or I should instantly fire. I had hardly uttered the words, however,
                  when the board on which I stood was struck from under me, and in another second I
                  found myself in the water, plunging and grasping for something to lay hold of. By
                  this time my men had succeeded in scrambling over his boat's side; so they
                  immediately took me in, and then unhooked the grapple to relieve us of the sinking
                  gig. But now that we did succeed in boarding him, we found ourselves in a greater
                  difficulty than ever. Our firearms were entirely useless,—the powder being wet
                  with the sea water,—and there stood the young outlaw, pointing a brace of pistols
                  at our heads. 'Surrender,' said I; 'I command you, in the name of the queen, to
                  surrender instantly.'
               "'Ha, ha!' he laughed—'surrender to hounds like you! O for the firm earth to stand
                  on, and a good thong to kennel such cowardly dogs. A pistol bullet is too
                  honorable a death for such drivelling slaves.'
               "This taunt stung me to the quick; and calling on my men to rush on him in a body,
                  I sprang forward myself to seize him; but, alas, I was again unfortunate, and fell
                  flat on my face on the bottom of the boat. In another instant his heel was on my
                  neck.
               "'Lie there, dog!' he cried, crushing me till my eyes seemed to start from their
                  sockets; 'lie there, and die the only death you deserve.' But the braggart, in his
                  turn, had little time to enjoy his advantage; for my men, seeing the danger I was
                  in, and maddened by the fellow's scornful language, closed in upon him. As they
                  rushed forward, he fired both pistols in their faces, and two of them fell wounded
                  beside me."
               "Dreadful!" exclaimed Hardwrinkle.
               "'Now,' cried I, rising from my disgraceful position, 'now, my men, hold him;
                  handcuff him; kill him if he attempt to escape.' But my orders were of no avail,
                  for he had sprung into the sea, and was making for the shore.
               "'He's gone, sir,' cried one of the men.
               "'Gone!'
               "'Yes; there he is, with his coat off, swimming away from us like a water
                  dog.'
               "'What's to be done? what's to be done?' I cried in an agony of disappointment.
                  'Has no one presence of mind to think of some means to capture him? He's within
                  half a gunshot of the beach, and will reach it before we can get our oars into the
                  rollocks.'
               "Just then the thought of the firearms in his overcoat occurred to me, and
                  snatching up the garment, I drew a holster pistol from its pocket, and aiming as
                  deliberately as I could in a moment of such excitement, fired. The ball, as good
                  fortune would have it, struck him on the right arm, and disabled him. 'Now,' cried
                  I, as I saw him sputter in the water like a wounded bird, 'now, my lads, to your
                  oars, and pull for your lives—pull—pull—with all your might, or he sinks before we
                  can reach him.'
               "In another minute we had taken him aboard, exhausted and bleeding, and there he
                  lay in the boat's bows, without word or motion of any kind, till we reached the
                  quay under Tamny Barracks."
               "Well, thank Heaven," said Hardwrinkle, "he's safe for the present at least, and to-morrow I sign his
                  committal to Lefford jail. As for you, Mr. C——, you have done your duty as a
                  faithful servant of the crown, and shall not go un-rewarded. And now let us return
                  and carry the good news to Mr. Weeks.
               "My dear cousin," said Hardwrinkle, entering Weeks's room, followed by the officer
                  of constabulary, "I have good tidings for you."
               "You have—eh?"
               "Yes, tidings of great import."
               "Indeed—let's hear what they're like."
               "Why, Randall Barry (your rival)," he said, whispering the word in his ear, "is a
                  prisoner in Tamny Barracks."
               "Pshoh—you don't say so? Is it possible?"
               "A fact, sir."
               "On what charge, pray?"
               "Treason—treason against the state. You've heard all about him—have you not?"
               "Why, yes, I've heard of his being connected with some young revolutionists—that's
                  all."
               "Humph! you speak lightly of the matter, my good cousin."
               "And I think lightly of it too," replied Weeks, promptly, "so far as it may be
                  regarded as a crime. Were I in his place, I should do precisely what he has
                  done."
               "What, revolutionize the country?"
               "Yes, by crackie. It's full time, I should think, the people got rid of these old
                  fogy monarchies of yours. These darned old tyrannical governments ought to have
                  been sent to kingdom come long ago. As for his being a rival of mine, why, I don't
                  think the less of him for that; and if you have busied yourself about his arrest
                  on that account, I tell you, Robert, you make an almighty mistake if you think I'm
                  under any obligation to you for the job."
               "Why, cousin, you surprise me."
               "Well, them's my sentiments, notwithstanding. He's a fine, spirited,
                  gallant-looking young fellow, that Barry; and if he hate and despise your
                  slow-going, drivelling old kings and queens, by thunder I like him the better for
                  telling them so to their teeth; and if he loves Mary Lee, why shouldn't he try to
                  catch her the best way he can? Let every man have a fair chance."
               "If these be your sentiments, my dear cousin," said Hardwrinkle, "they are very
                  different, I must confess, from what I had expected of you."
               "Well, sir, they are my sentiments precisely—real true blue Yankee sentiments, and
                  no mistake."
               "Well, well, I must acknowledge I was deceived in you, cousin, and I'm sorry for
                  it. But we must postpone further discussion on the subject for the present. I see
                  Rebecca and her sisters out there on their way to Ballymagahey, and must speak to
                  them a word or two of caution before they leave. Pray excuse me, Ephraim."
               "Go ahead, go ahead," replied Weeks, preparing to light another cigar—"go ahead,
                  and don't mind me;" and the Yankee was left alone, at last, to enjoy the comfort
                  of a quiet Havana.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               
                  Reflection on an Irish Churchyard.—Miss Rebecca and her Cousin Weeks.—Piety and
                     Infidelity.
               
               MR. WEEKS left his room soon after his cousin,—it being now somewhat advanced in
                  the forenoon,—and with a cigar in his mouth, descended the steps at the hall door,
                  and sauntered out to breathe the fresh air. It was a delightful morning. Every
                  thing looked cheerful and pleasant. The new-mown mown hay lay in long swaths on the lawn, exhaling
                  its perfume under the warm sun. The mowers, swart with toil, were slowly sweeping
                  their scythes through the ripe grass, and moving onwards, side by side, with
                  measured step across the broad field. Over the tops of the trees which skirted the
                  demesne below, and through the vistas which time or the axe had made, appeared
                  patches of Mulroy Bay, shining as calm and bright as a mirror. On its southern
                  shore a little whitewashed building, showing a gilded cross on its gable, stood
                  facing the sea, and round about among the fern and hawthorns, with which it was
                  surrounded, a number of white headstones peeped out here and there to mark it for
                  a burial place of the dead. This was Massmount, where our foreign friend first saw
                  Mary Lee, as she knelt at the altar. It was a solitary spot, and as pleasant for
                  the dead to rest in as could be found in the whole world. No house within a mile
                  of it, and no noise to disturb its repose but the twitter of the swallow about the
                  eaves of the little church, or the gentle wash of the waves amongst the sea shells
                  at its base. And if, on the Sunday morning, the silence which reigned there
                  through the week was broken, it only seemed to make the stillness which succeeded
                  the more solemn and profound. To the eastward of the chapel, and surrounded by a
                  belt of trees, stood the modest residence of Mr. Guirkie—its white chimneys just
                  visible from the windows of Crohan House; and trending away to the westward lay a
                  long tongue of meadow land called Morass Ridge, on the tip or extreme point of
                  which rose up the still majestic ruins of Shannagh, once a
                  stronghold of the far-famed O'Dougherty of Innishowen. Midway between these two
                  prominent features in the landscape appeared the old churchyard of Massmount, with
                  its little white chapel facing the sea.
               Mr. Weeks, touched by the simple beauty of the scene, laid himself down half
                  unconsciously on the greensward to enjoy it at his leisure.
               Dear Irish reader, let us sit down beside him for a moment, and view the picture
                  also. There is nothing in it new to your eyes—nothing you haven't seen a thousand
                  times before. It was only an old churchyard, and old churchyards in Ireland, you
                  know, are always the same. The same old beaten footpaths through the rank
                  grass—the same old hawthorn trees which in early summer shed their white blossoms
                  on the green graves—the same old ivy walls overshadowing the moss-covered tombs of
                  the monk and the nun. No, there was nothing strange or new in the picture—on the
                  contrary, every thing there was as familiar to you as your own thoughts. But tell
                  us, dear reader,—now that we can converse quietly together,—does not the sight of
                  such a spot sometimes awaken old memories? Do you still remember the place in the
                  old ruins where the prior's ghost was seen so often after sunset, or the fairy
                  tree beside the holy well which no axe could cut down, nor human hand break a
                  branch off with impunity? But, above all, do you remember the shady little corner
                  where the dear ones lie buried—the grassy mound where you knelt to drop the last
                  tear on bidding farewell to the land you will never see again? O, dear reader, do
                  your thoughts ever wander back to these blessed scenes of your youth? When in the
                  long summer evenings, after the toil of the day is over, you sit by the porch of
                  the stranger enjoying the cool night air, and gazing up at the sparkling heavens,
                  does your eye ever roam in search of that star you should know better than all the
                  rest, the bright one that shines on your own "native isle of the ocean"? When your
                  heart feels sad under a sense of its isolation,—nay, when it turns with disgust
                  from the treacherous and the cold-hearted, who, having wiled you to their shores,
                  now deny you even a foothold on their soil,—does memory then ever carry you back
                  to the old homestead among the hills, where in bygone years you have met so many
                  generous souls round the humble hearthstone? Alas, alas! when you look at those
                  once stalwart wart limbs you gave your
                  adopted country as a recompense for the freedom she promised you—now wasted away
                  in her service—when you think of the blood you shed in her battles, the prayers
                  you offered for her prosperity, the pride with which you heard her name spoken of
                  in other lands, and the glorious hopes you once entertained of seeing her the
                  greatest and the best of the nations of the earth—and yet to think, O, to think
                  that the only return she makes for all this is to hate and spurn you,—when
                  thoughts like these weigh down your heart, dear reader, do you not sometimes long
                  to see the old land again, and lay your shattered frame down to rest in that shady
                  corner you remember so well in the old churchyard?
               But they tell you here you must not indulge such thoughts as these. On the
                  contrary, you must forget the past; you must renounce your love for the country
                  that gave you birth; you must sever every tie that knits you to her bosom; you
                  must abjure and repudiate her forevermore: the songs you sang and the stories you
                  told so often by the light of the peat fire, must never be sung or told again; all
                  the associations of home and friends, all the pleasant recollections of your
                  boyhood, all the traditions of your warriors and sainted ancestors, must be
                  blotted from your memory, as so many treasons against the land of your adoption.
                  Or, if you do venture to speak of old times and old places when you meet with
                  long, absent friends round the social board, it must be in whispers and with
                  closed doors, lest the strangers should hear you as they pass by. And behold the
                  return they make you for these sacrifices! They give you freedom! What! freedom to
                  live like helots in the land they promised to make your own—freedom to worship
                  your Creator under a roof which a godless mob may, at any moment, fire with
                  impunity—freedom to shed your blood in defence of a flag that would gladly wave in
                  triumph over the extinction of your race. Speak, exile! are you willing to
                  renounce your fatherland for such recompense as this? O, if you be, may no ray of
                  sunlight ever visit your grave—no friend or relation, wife or child, ever shed a
                  tear to hallow it. If you've fallen so low as to kiss the foot that spurns you,
                  and grown so mean as to fawn upon a nation that flings you from her with disgust,
                  then go and live the degraded, soulless thing thou art, fit only to batten on
                  garbage and rot in a potter's field. Go! quit this place, for the sight of an old
                  Irish churchyard has no charms for you.
               Mr. Weeks had been sitting for half an hour or more contemplating the scene before
                  him, when, hearing the sound of approaching footsteps, he turned to see who was
                  coming.
               It was Rebecca Hardwrinkle, accompanied by the colporteur and two of her younger
                  sisters, on their way to Bally-magahey.
               "Well, there," said Weeks, rising, and shaking off the chips he had been whittling
                  from a withered branch that happened to lie within his reach—"there! I thought
                  you'd gone long ago."
               "My brother detained me," replied Rebecca, "to select some tracts from a parcel he
                  had just received as I was leaving the house; and seeing you here, I passed this
                  way to offer you one for your inspection. It's on the efficacy of prayer."
               "Humph! I know what you're coming at, I guess; I haven't been at family worship
                  this morning."
               "Ah, cousin, were it only once you absented yourself, we might find some excuse,
                  but to be absent so often—O, dear!"
               "Well, now, look here; I don't profess to be much of a Christian, you know, and
                  consequently you can't expect me to get used to your traces right straight
                  off."
               "Well, but your religious sentiments are so very shocking, Ephraim, that I tremble
                  to think of your soul, and the end which awaits it if you turn not speedily to the
                  Lord. Read that little book, however, attentively, and you will find it of great spiritual advantage. And then,
                  dear cousin, I shall have you prayed for next Sabbath."
               "Me prayed for?"
               "Certainly."
               "Guess not."
               "Why, can you have any possible objection to be prayed for by the God-fearing,
                  pious servants of the Lord?"
               "Well, yes, I rather think I have—a slight one."
               "How very strange! Did you only once feel the benefit a Christian derives from the
                  prayers of the elect——"
               "Just so—but I'm kinder green, you know, in that line."
               "Brother Robert, and Deborah there, and Hannah, and all of us, have been prayed
                  for so often, and have always felt our strength renewed in so wonderful a
                  manner!"
               "All right. But you see, I feel considerable strong as it is, and ain't disposed
                  to trouble you just at present. Say, cousin, whereabouts here is the priest's
                  house? Ain't that it over there west of the pond? I want to call on the old feller
                  this morning."
               "Yes, that's his house; but what can your business be with him,
                  Ephraim?"
               Well, not much, if any; should like to ask him a question or two—that's all."
               "Are you not afraid?"
               "Afraid!—afraid of what?"
               "To converse with him in the weak state of your soul."
               "Why, what in creation do you take me for?"
               "Don't be offended, cousin. I speak to you for your own good."
               "My own good! I ain't a fool—am I?"
               "No, no, dear Ephraim, but you know you're weak."
               "Weak! shoh! you don't say so."
               "I speak the truth; you will never be able to resist him. He's a most insinuating,
                  dangerous man."
               "The old priest?"
               "Yes. You've heard, I suppose, how he converted the tutor at the old
                  parsonage?"
               "No—can't say I have."
               "And poor Kate Petersham, too," put in Deborah; "she's on the very verge of the
                  gulf."
               "There! by the way, I had almost forgotten it. I must call on these Petershams
                  right off. What sorter girl, though, is this Kate you speak of? Kinder crazy—ain't
                  she?"
               "A little weak," responded Rebecca, "but still a good natured soul. Some of her
                  neighbors, poor thing, have lately been telling idle stories about her; but I'm
                  sure they're all false. For my part, I can't believe them. And I'm sure it's
                  nothing to me if she turned Catholic to-morrow. Only people will talk, you know,
                  Ephraim."
               "Well—nothing prejudicial to her honor, I presume."
               Rebecca glanced significantly at her sister and Mr. Sweet-soul, but said nothing
                  in reply.
               "Excuse me," said Weeks; "I shouldn't have put that question, perhaps, but the
                  fact is, the young lady has invited me to Castle Gregory, and I can't very well
                  refuse; besides, her brother, Captain Petersham, is anxious to have me call on
                  him."
               "Did the lady invite you herself?" inquired Rebecca.
               "Why, certainly. I had a note from her a week ago to that effect."
               "Written by herself?"
               "Well, her name was signed to it—Kate Petersham."
               Rebecca again glanced at her companions, and tried to blush and look
                  mortified.
               "Well, it did seem kinder strange, I allow," said Weeks; "but not being well
                  posted up in the customs of the country, I didn't know but it was all right."
               "Don't go, Ephraim," said Rebecca, laying her black-gloved hand affectionately on
                  his arm. "Don't go; take my advice."
               
               "She can't hurt me, I reckon—can she?"
               "No, dear Ephraim; she can't hurt your body, but she might your soul. You're weak,
                  you know—very weak indeed, and she very captivating both in person and
                  conversation. I don't like, my dear cousin, these visits to Miss Petersham and the
                  Catholic priest, especially without some one to protect you against the dangerous
                  influence of their society."
               "You don't, eh?"
               "No, dear cousin."
               "Look at me, Miss Hardwrinkle," said Weeks, thrusting his hands down into his
                  pockets, and hitching up his shoulders.
               "I see."
               "Is there any thing remarkably green about me?"
               "Green! no."
               "Ain't I a Yankee, born and bred, eh?"
               "Certainly."
               "And do you really believe I don't know nothing—that I can't take care of myself
                  among a parcel of Irish. What sorter folks d'ye think we Yankees are, any
                  how?"
               "Don't grow vexed with me, dear Ephraim; don't grow vexed. I would not offend you
                  for the world. I only speak for your own good, dear cousin. Mr. Sweetsoul here
                  knows how often I have wept over your weakness, and how incessantly I have prayed
                  that the light of truth might dispel the darkness——"
               "Stop! stop!—thunder! Hain't I been listening to all that long talk till I'm
                  enamost crazy?"
               "O, dear, he has grown so nervous of late, Mr. Sweetsoul," said Rebecca, wringing
                  her hands, and turning to the colporteur, "that he cannot bear a single word of
                  advice."
               "Nervous! and where's the wonder, with seven sisters of you talking religion at me
                  from morning till night. Why, I can't smoke a cigar, by crackie, but I'm taken to
                  task for it. It's too great an indulgence, or it's too worldly-looking, or it's
                  one darned thing or other."
               "But listen to me, dear Ephraim; don't you feel that we have your spiritual
                  welfare at heart? and don't you know, when we speak to you of religion, it is only
                  because we love you too well to see you perish before our eyes? O, if the sweet
                  dew of religion only once touched——"
               "The dew of religion! there! That's the talk—go ahead, cousin; I shan't say
                  another word on the subject—go ahead. I'll stand it out, I guess, if any man can;"
                  and he picked up the branch he had just been whittling, and set to it again, as
                  vigorously as if he had been whittling for a wager. Ephraim C. B. Weeks was
                  evidently excited, but tried very hard to keep cool.
               "And now, Mr. Sweetsoul, you may judge whether we have reason or not to fear for
                  our dear cousin," said Rebecca, again turning to the colporteur. "Just look at
                  this trinket. Here is a pair of popish rosary beads, which the chambermaid found
                  on the floor of Mr. Weeks's bedroom the morning after he first entered the
                  lighthouse lodge at Araheera;" and the speaker held them up between her finger and
                  thumb for inspection.
               "Dreadful!"
               "This was his first lesson from the Romish light-keeper and his pretty
                  daughter."
               "I have already explained to you how I came by these beads," said Weeks. "I picked
                  them up where they had fallen from an old Bible at the lighthouse, and
                  unthinkingly put them in my pocket. But no matter now; fire away."
               "Don't grow angry, Ephraim."
               "I ain't angry."
               "I merely call your attention to the beads to show you the danger you have to
                  guard against in forming Catholic associations. Is there any thing in that to make
                  you angry?"
               "I ain't angry, I tell you; not a mite."
               "You are angry. I see it in your countenance, Ephraim. O, if you only experienced
                  religion for one little week, how
                  easily you could repress this irritability. There, now! see how you cut up that
                  stick so pettishly. Just see how nervous you are."
               "I tell you I ain't nervous," cried Weeks, at the top of his
                  voice.
               "Well—so excited."
               "I ain't excited."
               "Why, dear me, Mr. Sweetsoul, only look at him."
               "There!" broke out Weeks at length, losing his temper altogether, and flinging
                  away both knife and branch; "there! by thunder, if this ain't the most inhuman
                  treatment ever man suffered."
               "Stay, Ephraim, stay, cousin; do, for one moment," entreated Rebecca, endeavoring
                  to lay hold of his arm.
               "Not a darned second," he cried, buttoning his coat and hurrying off, full of
                  indignation at the idea of being treated so like a child or a fool. "By gracious
                  thunder," he added, halting for an instant on his step and looking back, "you
                  ought to turn to at once and spoon-feed me."
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               
                  Weeks visits Mrs. Motherly.—A Conversation on Slavery.—Weeks seems rather
                     disagreeably surprised to meet an old Acquaintance in Uncle Jerry's Negro.
               
               MR. WEEKS, on parting with his lady cousins, (which he did rather abruptly, as we
                  have seen in the last chapter,) returned to Crohan House, and lighting another
                  cigar, mounted the sober animal he generally selected for a morning's ride, and
                  set out for Father Brennan's. When he arrived at the reverend gentleman's
                  residence, he felt somewhat disappointed pointed to learn from the servant that
                  his master had gone some five or six miles on a sick call, and could not possibly
                  return till late in the evening. Resolving, however, to have an interview with the
                  good priest as soon as possible, he drew a card from the richly-carved case he
                  always had about him, and having written a request to that effect on the back of
                  it with his pencil, handed it to the servant, and then turned his horse's head in
                  the direction of Greenmount Cottage.
               Mrs. Motherly was sitting on the steps of the hall door, knitting her stocking,
                  and looking quite happy as she plied her needles. The good woman was dressed as
                  usual in her large, well-frilled cap and white apron, with her bunch of keys
                  hanging by her side, as much perhaps for show as convenience. On the grass at her
                  feet a gray cat lay stretched in the sun, with half a dozen kittens playing about
                  her on the green.
               "Good afternoon, Mrs. Motherly; how do?" said Weeks. "Mr. Guirkie at home?"
               "Your sarvint, sir," replied the matron, rising and running her needles into the
                  stocking, after she had waited to count the stitches. "Mr. Guirkie's not in,
                  sir."
               "Ain't?"
               "No, sir; he left here about an hour ago for Rathmullen."
               "Rathmullen—let me see—that's the place he visits so often?"
               "Yes, sir."
               "Goes there every week—don't he?"
               "Every Thursday, sir."
               "On business, I presume."
               "No, sir."
               "Got relatives there, perhaps."
               "No, sir; he has no relatives living, I believe. People's plazed to say, though,
                  he's often seen sittin on a tombstone there in the ould graveyard."
               "Well, must be some friend, I guess."
               
               "Why, if the gentleman was a native o' this part o' the country, it might,"
                  responded Mrs. Motherly, "but he's not; he was born in Cork."
               "Does he never speak to you of these visits, Mrs. Motherly?"
               "Niver, sir."
               "You don't say so! It's odd—ain't it?"
               "O, it's just of a piece with the rest of his doings," replied the good woman,
                  opening, as usual, her budget of grievances. "He niver thinks of telling me any
                  thing, of coorse; why should he? I'm nothing but a sarvint, ye know. I'm only here
                  to do the work, slavin and sludgin from mornin till night, strivin to plaze him
                  and humor him, till my heart's a'most broke, and all the thanks I get is mighty
                  easy told, Mr. Weeks."
               "Don't doubt it. He's a very odd kinder man in his ways—that's a fact."
               "You may well say it, sir. He's the provokinest man ever drew breath. But won't
                  you light and come in, sir?"
               "Well, guess I shall, come to think of it. Say, can't I write a note here, and
                  leave it for Mr. Guirkie?"
               "Sartintly, sir; come in, there's paper there, and pens plenty in the parlor. As
                  for the cratur on the sofa, he'll not disturb you in the laste."
               "Hilloa! who the thunder is this?" exclaimed Weeks, as he entered the parlor, and
                  beheld the African stretched at his full length on the sofa, apparently fast
                  asleep. "A nigger—ain't he?"
               "Yes, sir; that's our new boarder," primly replied Mrs. Motherly.
               "But how in creation did he come here?"
               "Mr. Guirkie, sir, carried the gentleman home with him from the wreck."
               "Ah, that's it. I have heard of a wreck lately somewhere here in the
                  neighborhood."
               "He's a very respectable boarder for a lone woman—isn't he, Mr. Weeks?"
               Well, don't know exactly; that's all a matter of taste. Some folks like niggers
                  very much. There's our New England ladies, for instance; they're terrible kind to
                  niggers. I'd venture to say, if this here chap happened to be cast ashore any
                  where along the eastern seaboard, they'd gather round and clothe and feast him
                  like a prince, before he got well out of water."
               "You're jokin, Mr. Weeks."
               "No, mam, I ain't jokin a mite."
               "And ye tell me they're so fond of them as all that?"
               "Fond? yes—guess they are fond—they're the most almighty fond creatures in that
                  way in all creation."
               "Bedad, then, Mr. Weeks, I don't envy their taste."
               "Well, it ain't just that, either, for the fact is, they despise niggers as much
                  as any people in the world. But it's a sorter philanthropy, you know, that's made
                  up of a half sentimental, half benevolent kinder squeamishness, with a slight dash
                  of the religious in it, by way of seasoning."
               "Yes, sir, of coorse."
               "You understand me?"
               "O, parfectly, sir. They must be mighty charitable intirely, God bless them."
               "Very charitable indeed. That is, I mean to the slave portion of the race.
                  Sometimes their philanthropy impels them even to pawn their jewels to buy a slave
                  from bondage—it's a fact."
               "See that now! Isn't it wondherful to think of it? And still I often heard Mr.
                  Guirkie say the craturs out there in America warn't so badly off after all."
               "Well, no—guess they're pretty well off for clothes and food, and all that sorter
                  thing. But they hain't got their liberty, you know; and no American born ought to
                  see a human in slavery and not try to liberate him."
               "True for you, Mr. Weeks; you speak like a Christian, so you do. Dear knows it's a
                  poor sight to see God's craturs bought
                  and sould, as they say they are over there, just for all the world like a cow or a
                  horse—it's onnatural."
               "It's shocking!"
               "And still," said Mrs. Motherly, "they tell us the poor Irish there isn't trated
                  much better than slaves."
               "The Irish! My dear woman, don't believe a word of it."
               "Why, I have a letther in my pocket here, from a niece of mine, that's livin in a
                  place called Boston, and she tells me it's tarrible to think of what they suffer.
                  There it is," continued the good woman, opening it, and pointing to a particular
                  passage, which ran as follows: 'We're thrated here like slaves, and have more to
                  suffer from the Yankees, specially in regard to our religion, than ever we had at
                  home from the bloody, parsecutin English.' It's a wonder they're not ashamed to
                  purfess so much tinderness for the slaves, and trate the poor Irish so manely as
                  that," said Mrs. Motherly.
               "My dear woman, you don't understand the case. It's only the lower orders of our
                  people do so."
               "And why don't the upper orders make them behave better?"
               "Can't do it. It's a free country."
               "O, bad luck to such freedom as that. I wudn't give ye a brass button for it.
                  There's my niece, as dacent a reared little girl as ever crossed the water—I'll
                  say that much for her, though she is my niece—and her mistress, who's nothin after
                  all but a shopkeeper's wife—may be not as decent a father and mother's child
                  either,—and the best word she has in her cheek for the cratur is the 'Paddy girl,'
                  and the 'Papist,' and the 'ignorant booby,' and 'go to the old priest—he'll
                  forgive you your sins for a ninepence.' What kind of talk is that, Mr. Weeks?"
                  continued the good woman, rolling up her arms in her apron, and looking at
                  him.
               "Well, that ain't right, I allow."
               "Right—bedad, if the girls would do as I would, they'd slap them in the face. And
                  that's what I told Bridget in my last letter. Humph! pretty thing, indeed! because
                  they pay their girls six or seven shillings a week, they must have a right to
                  insult and abuse them into the bargain."
               "Very few think so, Mrs. Motherly, very few indeed. I know many, very many
                  families in New England, who respect their help very much, and are as kind to them
                  as if they were relatives of the family."
               "To be sure you do, sir, and so Bridget says too, in her letter here; but they're
                     respectable people. I mane yer upsettin, half and between fine
                  ladies, that think they ought to take airs on themselves as soon as they can
                  afford to hire a girl to do their work—that's the kind I mane."
               "Just so; that's all right enough—but still, Mrs. Motherly, some of your girls are
                  pretty spunky."
               "I don't doubt it, sir, in the laste, and may be there's plenty of them desarves
                  to be turned out of doors too for their impudence. But can't all that be done
                  without casting up their religion and their priest to them? Ah, that's mane, sir,
                  mane as dirt, to insult a poor girl for her religion."
               "Well—as I hain't got many minutes to spare now, Mrs. Motherly, let us put off
                  this subject till another time. So I'll just sit down here, if you hain't no
                  objection, and write a note for Mr. Guirkie, which you'll please hand him as soon
                  as he returns."
               "Sartintly, Mr. Weeks, with the greatest pleasure in life; I hope Sambo here won't
                  disturb you, sir."
               "Not in the least. He's asleep—ain't he?"
               "So it seems; and still it's quare to see him asleep at this hour. He was sittin
                  up a minute or two before ye came. I'll see. 'Sambo! Sambo! wake up.' There's not
                  a stir in him, sir."
               "Don't mind him, Mrs. Motherly," said Weeks, dipping the pen in the ink. "Don't
                  mind him."
               "Well, I niver saw him asleep but he snored strong enough to draw the sides of the
                  house together. And see now, he hardly
                  ly seems to breathe. 'Sambo,' she repeated, shaking him by the arm,—'Sambo, wake
                  up; here's the gentleman you were asking about the other day.'"
               "About me?"
               "Yes, sir; he started just as if he'd been shot, when he saw you pass the window
                  last week."
               "Last week—why, I don't remember to have seen or heard any thing of him. I didn't
                  know you'd got a nigger here till this minute."
               "Well, he saw you, sir, any way, and looked as frightened as if you
                  came to drag him to the gallows."
               "Indeed! Wake him up, and let's see what he's like."
               "Sambo! hilloa, Sambo!" cried Mrs. Motherly, again shaking him roughly by the arm;
                  "look up, man, and speak to us—he won't though, not a budge he'll do. Bedad, Mr.
                  Weeks, may be he's dyin."
               "Not he—the fellow's coming possum over us, that's all; but hold on a bit; I'll
                  make him speak—bet a fourpence;" and striking the African a smart rap on the shin
                  with his knuckles, the sleeper started up in an instant to a sitting posture, and
                  bellowed as if he had been stabbed with a bayonet.
               "Shut up," said Weeks; "you ain't murdered—are you?"
               "O, Massa Charles, Massa Charles," cried the African, rubbing the wounded part
                  with his hand, "you know him place strike poor nigger."
               "You see that," observed Mrs. Motherly; "he seems to know you, sir."
               "Massa Charles—why, who the thunder are you—eh?"
               "O, golly, there, Massa Charles not know Sambo!"
               "What Sambo?"
               "Why, Jubal Sambo—gosh! that very sprizin; many time massa licked Sambo on old
                  plantation."
               "Where?" demanded Weeks, his words growing few and faint as the negro's voice and
                  features grew more and more familiar to him.
               "Where! yah, yah! no remember Moose Creek, old Virginny? Massa Charles look him my
                  back him; know Sambo better: ebery one knows him own marks."
               "Moose Creek!—good Heavens!" there! exclaimed Weeks, "well, by crackie, if that
                  ain't the most unexpected——"
               "Yah, yah!" chuckled the African, now that his shin no longer troubled him. "Massa
                  no spect see Sambo so far from home. Sambo no fraid massa now. Sambo free
                  nigger—yah, yah!"
               "Mrs. Motherly," said Weeks, turning to the housekeeper, who stood looking on
                  apparently much interested in the conversation, "may I beg you to quit the room
                  for a moment? I should like to say a few words to this poor fellow—seems to me I
                  have seen him before."
               "Indeed you have, sir, I'll warrant that," said Mrs. Motherly, looking sharply at
                  Weeks, now as pale as a sheet of paper. "But sure if you have any thing in private
                  to say to him, I'll not prevent you. Strange how people meets sometimes so far
                  from home, and when they laste expect it, too. Ha, ha! isn't it quare, Mr.
                  Weeks?"
               "Very much so indeed—but you'll excuse me, Mrs. Motherly."
               "Sartintly, sir; I was only just going to tell ye how Mr. Guirkie, thravellin in
                  America, once met with an ould rival of his in the same way, that he thought was
                  dead twenty years before. It was the oddest thing in the world. Him and Mr.
                  Guirkie, it seems, in their young days, were both courtin the same young lady;
                  but, lo and behold you, she went off at last with the other gentleman; and then
                  Mr. Guirkie made a vow never to marry, seein he had no heart to give away, for he
                  loved the girl beyond all raison; and indeed to this very day he carries her
                  picthur about him wherever he goes. Well, he went across the seas to thravel,
                  thinkin to forget her among the strangers; and what would ye have of it, but after leaving the West Indies, and
                  landin in the States of America, the first face he knew was that of his ould
                  rival. There he was standing on the quay right before him as he stepped ashore
                  from the vessel."
               "Very strange, indeed," assented Weeks—"a very remarkable circumstance—exceedingly
                  so. But won't you allow me, Mrs. Motherly——?"
               "Sartintly, Mr. Weeks—sartintly, sir."
               "Gosh, dat berry queer," muttered Sambo.
               "What?"
               "Why, Massa Guirkie meetin him old ribal on de wharf."
               "How so, Sambo?"
               "Well, old Massa Talbot just say same ting. Moder told me all about it long time
                  ago. Massa walk on de wharf, and dere comes him old ribal right out of de ship
                  afore him berry eyes, de man he tink was dead and buried. De sight almost knock
                  him blind."
               "Any thing else I can do for you, Mr. Weeks?"
               "Nothing, Mrs. Motherly, nothing at present."
               "Well, then, I'll leave you together, to settle your own affairs; only I would
                  advise you, Mr. Weeks, before I go, to caution this foolish fellow not to call you
                  Massa Charles any more, for the people of this wicked world are always watchin and
                  peepin into other people's business, ye know, and ten chances to one but they'd
                  say you weren't the man you purtended to be, at all, at all." So saying, Mrs.
                  Motherly made her usual courtesy at the door, and closed it behind her.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               
                  Mr. Weeks treats himself to a Ride on a Rathlin Pony.—Its Consequences.—Kate
                     takes him with her to Castle Gregory.
               
               DURING Mr. Weeks's long and secret conference with the negro, (for Mrs. Motherly
                  was carefully excluded from the room,) Hardwrinkle still remained closeted with
                  the officer of constabulary at Crohan House, devising plans for the immediate
                  committal of Randall Barry to Lifford jail. A difficulty, however, presented
                  itself, which Hardwrinkle had entirely overlooked in his zeal for the safety of
                  the state—namely, the presence of Captain Petersham, of Castle Gregory, who, as
                  senior magistrate of the barony, was very much in the habit of taking such cases
                  into his own hands, and disposing of them according to his own peculiar views of
                  the law thereunto made and provided. Hardwrinkle, it appears, in order to avoid
                  unnecessary delay, was for having the prisoner brought before himself, and
                  committed forthwith; but the officer demurred on the ground that the captain had
                  already, in anticipation of Barry's arrest, given strict orders to have the young
                  man brought before him, and no other. Hardwrinkle denied Captain
                  Petersham's right to issue such orders, inasmuch as the crime charged against
                  Barry was a capital offence, requiring prompt and summary action by the nearest of
                  her majesty's justices of the peace, without distinction of rank. Furthermore, he
                  contended that Captain Petersham, from his well-known disaffection to the
                  government, and his notorious opposition to its measures for the "amelioration" of
                  Ireland, was neither a fit or proper person to try the case at all. Still more,—he
                  assured the officer that the captain's anxiety to take Barry into his own hands was but the consequence of a secret
                  determination on his part to let the young rebel escape, if he could possibly do
                  so; and, therefore, to trust such a man with the case was virtually to defeat the
                  law, and frustrate the designs of the government.
               These remonstrances, however, seemed to produce but little effect on the police
                  officer, who still persisted in his determination of bringing the prisoner before
                  the senior magistrate as in duty bound—adding, by way of makeweight, that he
                  valued his life too highly to risk it by an act of premeditated disobedience to
                  the orders of such a madman and fire-eater as Captain Tom Petersham, of Castle
                  Gregory.
               At length, after various plans and schemes had been proposed and rejected, it was
                  finally agreed that nothing could be done for the present, but that early on the
                  following morning Hardwrinkle should despatch his servants post-haste to certain
                  magistrates of the neighborhood, on whose loyalty he could depend, requesting
                  their presence next day on the Petit Sessions bench, in order to neutralize any
                  efforts that might be made by Captain Petersham to free the prisoner. In the mean
                  time the barracks should be well guarded, particularly through the night, and
                  every possible precaution taken against attempts at rescue by the friends and
                  abettors of the young outlaw. With this understanding, the two zealous defenders
                  of church and state separated, each congratulating the other on having secured at
                  last the person of so dangerous and malignant a traitor as Randall Barry.
               Whilst the above consultation was going on, Weeks had quite recovered from his
                  consternation on recognizing the negro in Mr. Guirkie's parlor, and, after leaving
                  his message with Mrs. Motherly, was now proceeding on his way to Castle Gregory,
                  looking as grave and composed as if nothing had occurred to disturb his
                  equanimity.
               The animal on which he rode—we have said already—was by no means remarkable either
                  for his beauty of shape or swiftness of foot, and so low withal that his rider's
                  boots almost touched the ground as he jogged along. Still, though a mere pony, he
                  was remarkably thick set and stout, and looked strong enough to carry a much
                  heavier load, if he only made up his mind to do it. We add this saving clause,
                  because the little fellow happened to belong to the species of horse called the
                  "Rahery or Rathlin breed," well known in the north of Ireland, and famous not only
                  for its great strength, but its inveterate habit of resisting all attempts at
                  coercion; so that "as wrong-headed as a Rahery" had long become a common
                  expression throughout the province.
               Mr. Weeks, when he first took a notion to try the horse for a morning's ride, was
                  cautioned by his Crohan friends not to trust him too far. Rebecca, especially,
                  took great pains to acquaint her good cousin with the pony's bad habits, and to
                  put him on his guard. But Weeks, confident of his superior horsemanship, and
                  anxious to verify the truth of his favorite saying, "that no living critter could
                  come it over him," would listen neither to advice nor caution.
               The little Rahery, as we have before observed, being neither fast nor handsome,
                  and having little therefore to feel proud of, contented himself with trotting
                  along in his own quiet way, without the least pretension in the world, and caring
                  just as little for the opinions of his neighbors as he did for the spurs of his
                  rider.
               Notwithstanding all our hero's boasting, however, it was quite evident he knew
                  little how to govern the horse he rode just then, whatever he might have been able
                  to do at home in New England; for he kept tugging at the reins and pricking the
                  creature's sides with a constant uniform motion, as if the double movement of hand
                  and heel constituted an essential part of the exercise. Whether the gruff,
                  bull-headed little brute felt he had a greenhorn on his back, or whether he
                  resolved "to hold the even tenor of his way" despite bridle and spur, is difficult
                  to tell. But certain it is, Mr. Weeks's efforts seemed to mend the matter but very
                  little. In this fashion he managed to
                  dodge along for a mile or two, his legs swinging to and fro under the horse's
                  belly, and his left hand jerking the bridle at every step; when all of a sudden
                  the pony come to a dead halt, and absolutely refused to proceed another inch in
                  that direction.
               Mr. Weeks, who had ridden the horse half a dozen times before, and never had any
                  difficulty with him, felt rather surprised at his conduct, and took good care to
                  express himself accordingly, both in word and deed. After spurring for a while
                  without any effect, it occurred to him the saddle gear might have got out of
                  place, and he instantly dismounted to examine. But to his great disappointment he
                  found himself mistaken. Every thing was exactly where it ought to be. Taking the
                  reins then, he tried to lead the pony past the spot; but the pony decidedly
                  refused to lift a foot. It was very provoking to Mr. Weeks, to find himself there
                  "on the public highway," beating and shouting at the perverse little animal, and
                  every body laughing at him as they passed by. It was unpleasant, to say the least
                  of it, and Mr. Weeks, as might be expected, felt very uncomfortable indeed. At
                  length, when he tried and tried in vain, and saw no likelihood of succeeding by
                  ordinary means, he drew a knife from his pocket, cut a stout ash sapling from a
                  tree by the roadside, and then remounting, laid on the pony with might and main,
                  determined, if he still refused to proceed, it shouldn't be for want of urging.
                  The animal, finding matters growing serious, but resolved, notwithstanding, to
                  have his own way, now took the bridle bit between his teeth, and poking down his
                  head, wheeled round, and started off to Crohan House at full gallop. Weeks, unable
                  to manage the sapling any longer, threw it from him, and seized the reins with
                  both hands to haul him up; but alas! he might as well have seized the horns of a
                  buffalo: on drove the headstrong little Rahery at the top of his speed, and
                  apparently with as much ease as if he carried a child on his back.
               "Hoa! hoa!" shouted Weeks; "hoa, ye darned critter."
               The pony, unaccustomed to the Yankee manner of address, mistook it probably for a
                  command to go the faster, and on he drove accordingly.
               "Tarnation to ye!" cried Weeks, as his hat flew off, and his long sandy hair
                  floated back on the breeze. "Tarnation to ye! hain't ye got no mouth on ye nor
                  nothing? hoa, there, hoa! I say. O merciful Heavens! such a country."
               At this moment, a party of ladies and gentlemen, some five or six in number, came
                  riding up, meeting him at a smart trot, and Weeks, seeing their approach, motioned
                  them to stop his horse. One of the riders crossed the road for that purpose, and
                  waved his handkerchief; but the mischievous animal, on seeing his way blocked up,
                  instead of coming to a sudden halt, wheeled off sideways, and ran, or rather
                  tumbled, down a steep bank by the road-side, right into a farmer's kitchen, with
                  the rider's arms clasped round his neck. The blind impetuosity with which the pony
                  drove on, and the nearness of the house, left him no time to choose; so that rider
                  and horse were both in the man's house before they knew it. Then came the
                  catastrophe; for the pony, unable to stop his speed down the bank, not only passed
                  through the door with resistless force, but came full tilt against the "dresser,"
                  which stood opposite, breaking at a single crash every article of delft on its
                  shelves, and confounding man, horse, and dishes in one common disaster.
               The confusion which followed was amusing. The man's wife ran out with a child in
                  her arms, screaming murder and robbery—half a dozen little boys and girls ran
                  after her, yelling and crying for help—the pony backed out after doing the
                  mischief, and scampered off to his manger—and the owner of the house made his
                  appearance in his shirt sleeves with a pitchfork in his hand, swearing all sorts
                  of instant vengeance against the "murdherin" villain in the kitchen.
               "Stop, stop, my good fellow," exclaimed one of the party on horseback, who, seeing
                  how matters stood, had dismounted and arrested the weapon. "Stop—this is a mere
                  accident, my good man."
               
               "Away—out I' my road," shouted the farmer. "Stand off, and let me at him this
                  minute, or by ——"
               But here he paused and swallowed the oath, for on looking over his shoulder he
                  found himself in the hands of Captain Petersham.
               "I beg yer honor's pardon, sir, but I'll have his life."
               "Silence," commanded the captain.
               "I can't, sir; look at the wrack he made, the murdherin villain! I'll brain him
                  this minute. I'll smash——"
               "Listen to me, sir."
               "Flesh and blood cudn't stan it, captain."
               "Stop this instant, or I'll horsewhip you within an inch of your life."
               "The thievin vagabond! where is he? till I knock saucepans out of him."
               "Will you not listen to me, you dog?"
               "The bloody cutthroat, I'll have his life."
               "Robert, ho there, Robert, hand the reins to Mr. Whately. Quick, sir; and you, Mr.
                  Johnson, help him to gag this blundering fool, while I go in and see what the
                  matter is."
               "Bekase he's one i' the quality, he has lave to do what he lakes; but I'll tache
                  him the difference."
               "Who is he, Mr. Whately?" inquired one of the ladies, whose horse kept prancing in
                  front of the door.
               "Is the unfortunate man of this neighborhood?" demanded another.
               "Is he much hurt?" said a third, addressing the farmer's wife, who was now making
                  her way through the crowd of horses, with the child still in her arms.
               "How can I tell yer ladyship whether he's hurt or not. But the sorra's cure to him
                  any way, the dirty gomeril—to smash our bits o' plenishin, that I bought only last
                  week in Francy McGarvey's with the dribs i' money I earned hard with my own four
                  bones. Bad luck to him every day he rises."
               By this time Captain Petersham succeeded in making his way through the kitchen
                  over broken plates and dishes, and there found the hero of the tragedy with his
                  hands thrust down into his breeches pocket, standing in the midst of the ruins he
                  had made.
               "What's the damage, major?" said the Yankee, shaking up the silver, as the captain
                  approached him, "what's the damage? I'll foot the bill. Scissors! such a country!"
                  he muttered to himself. "O, if I were only once—say, what's the damage?"
               "Damage?"
               "Yes—hold on though; you ain't boss of the shanty,—are you?"
               "I, no, sir. Why, my Heavens! is this you?"
               "Well, yes, I guess I'm that particular individual."
               "Mr. Weeks of Drakesville, eh?"
               "No, sir, it ain't—Ducksville, if you please."
               "Yes, yes, I recollect—Ducksville. I'm really very sorry, Mr. Weeks. Upon my
                  honor, my dear fellow, I'm exceedingly sorry."
               "Why, who the thunder are you? Hold on. As I live, Captain Petersham, of Castle
                  Gregory! How do, captain? Glad to see you. Got into a kinder snarl here."
               "Ha, ha! you're not accustomed to our Irish horses yet," observed the captain,
                  laughing. "Got hurt, eh?"
               "No, sir, not a mite—got my coat torn and lost my hat—that's all."
               "Well, never mind—it might have been worse. Come, I've a horse at the door to
                  carry you to Castle Gregory. You'll dine with us, of course."
               "Well, the fact is, I was a-going there when this confounded accident
                  happened."
               "Thank you. Come then. I'll settle all this for you tomorrow."
               Whilst the foregoing colloquy was taking place, the owner of the house had been
                  gradually quieted down by the captain's
                  tain's friends outside, and the captain himself had succeeded in leading Mr. Weeks
                  to the door, where his servant's horse awaited him to mount. As the latter,
                  ashamed and discomfited, slowly advanced and looked up, he felt "kinder
                  uncomfortable," to use one of his own phrases, at seeing so many eyes fixed on
                  him. But the confusion lasted only a moment, for, like his countrymen, Mr. Weeks's
                  recuperative powers were always at hand.
               "Ladies and gentlemen," said the captain, by way of a passing introduction, "this
                  is Mr. Drake, of Weeksville, Connecticut, United——"
               "Mr. Weeks, if you please"—and the speaker drew forth a card from his silver case,
                  and presented it respectfully to his friend. "My name, sir, you will perceive, is
                  Weeks—Ephraim C. B. Weeks, Ducksville, Connecticut, United States."
               "Just so, Mr. Weeks. Excuse me, my dear fellow; I'm the most confounded blunderer
                  imaginable. Hang it, I'm always blundering about that name some how, and can't
                  tell how it happens."
               "Never mind the name, Mr. Weeks," said one of the ladies on horseback; "mount this
                  horse here, and come with us to Castle Gregory;" and the speaker, touching the
                  spirited animal she rode on the flank with her riding whip, broke through the
                  crowd, and prancing up to the door, stretched out her hand to the American; "come,
                  sir; I've been long wishing to see you; and now you and I must ride together and
                  have a chat in advance of the party."
               "Who is she, captain?" whispered Weeks, after he had touched the lady's hand.
               "That's my sister—Kate Petersham."
               "You don't say!"
               "Never saw her before, I presume?"
               "No—often heard of her, though. Kinder smart, ain't she?"
               "Yes, sometimes—when she takes the notion."
               "She looks sorter spry—rides well, I guess."
               "Yes; does pretty fair at a fox hunt. Like to cross a ditch or two with her, eh?
                  You can have any of my horses you please."
               "No, I thank you; I should rather not at present. That's a pretty piece of horse
                  flesh she rides—ain't it?"
               "Yes, sir; that's the best mare of her inches in the province of Ulster. I'll back
                  her against any thing of her age and weight in Ireland, for a thousand."
               "Should like to own the critter."
               "Can't, sir; Kate would as soon part with her right hand as part with 'Moll
                  Pitcher.' See how she dances, the wild creature—she's mad to get off."
               "What detains you, Mr. Weeks?" cried Kate.
               "Excuse me, madam, for a moment; I'll be with you presently."
               "Make haste then," urged the captain; "the lady will feel quite offended if you
                  keep her waiting."
               "Here, my good woman," said Weeks, taking a couple of sovereigns from his purse,
                  and handing them to the farmer's wife; "here, take these, and replenish your
                  shelves."
               "You seem to be in a great hurry to repair the damage," observed the captain.
               "Well, I guess it's just as well, ain't it?"
               "To-morrow had been time enough."
               "To-morrow. By jingo, I shouldn't wonder if that crazy coon, her husband, had my
                  life before half the time. These countrymen of yours, captain, ain't to be
                  trusted."
               "Ha, ha! I see you're not acquainted yet with the disposition of the Irish."
               "Ain't I though? Well, I rather guess I am some. By crackie, if I ain't, for my
                  short time amongst them, I don't know who is. Say, my good woman, hain't you got a
                  hat I could have for a day or so? Fly round and see if you can find one."
               
               "Mr. Weeks, Mr. Weeks," cried Kate again—"here I am waiting for you all this time,
                  and Moll Pitcher so restive that I can hardly manage her."
               "Never mind the hat," said the captain, dragging Weeks by the arm—"never mind it
                  now; we'll pick up your own on the road."
               "Hold on a second—hurry up, my good woman; let me have something to cover my head.
                  Hilloa! what's that?" he demanded, as she handed him a rabbit skin cap. "What the
                  thunder is this? Hain't I seen that cap before?"
               "No matter; put it on," entreated the captain, impatiently, "and let's be
                  off."
               "Wait a minute—what's this in the bottom of it, eh?—a letter, I swonnie it is,—and
                  to Miss Kate Petersham, too. Why, how's this?"
               "Who owns the cap?" demanded the captain.
               "I own it," said a new comer, issuing from a door of a little room behind the
                  dresser. "I own it, sir."
               "Lanty Hanlon!"
               "Let me have the cap, sir—here's one to replace it," said Lanty, handing Weeks
                  another of nearly the same description, and taking his own without the least
                  ceremony from the hands of the astonished Yankee.
               "Well there!—say, captain, can you tell me how many duplicates of this individual
                  are to be found in the deestrict, or, in other words, is he really the old
                  gentleman himself?"
               "Lanty Hanlon, how came you by this letter?"
               "Don't trouble yourself about it, captain," replied Kate; "it's only a love
                  letter. Hand it here, Lanty. I'll meet you at the place you know,
                  this evening. Be punctual now, or I'll discard you."
               "Niver fear, my lady; I'll be there; but mind, if you don't be up to time
                  yourself, we must break the engagement." And throwing the cap carelessly on his
                  head, he disappeared as he came.
               "I see, captain, you know that fellow."
               "O, yes; I have known Lanty for years."
               "Well, he's a tarnation villain; let me tell you that."
               "Lanty—ha! ha! O, no, he's not a bad fellow. Fond of playing tricks, that's
                  all."
               "Tricks—he's the darnedest rascal unhung."
               Weeks now mounted the groom's horse, which proved to be a gentle, well-disposed
                  animal; and with the captain on one side and Kate on the other, rode in front of
                  the procession, his rabbit-skin cap jantily set on the side of his head, and his
                  hands and feet jerking and swinging as before, to the no small amusement of the
                  party.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               
                  Uncle Jerry and the "Three Twins."—A Surprise.
               
               THE reader will remember that Mrs. Motherly had a strong objection to Mr.
                  Guirkie's carrying his purse with him, whenever she suspected him of going to
                  visit the blind fiddler at the Cairn, or the widow with the "three twins," at
                  Bally-mastocker. She insisted it was her duty to search his pockets on such
                  occasions, and he permitted her to do so, with all the docility of a child, save
                  and except when a third party happened to be present; then he drew himself up, and
                  proclaimed his independence both by word and look, but so ostentatiously withal,
                  that any one with the slightest discrimination might have seen it was only the
                  advantage the coward takes, when he unexpectedly finds help at his back. Uncle
                  Jerry was, we must admit, rather peculiar in the exercise of his benevolence, or,
                  as Mrs. Motherly used to say, very odd in his ways. It was not exactly because
                  Batt Curley of the Cairn was destitute
                  of the ordinary means of living, that he took such a kindly interest in him, for
                  Batt always earned enough to eat and drink by his fiddle, hard as the times were;
                  it was because he was old and blind, and only a fiddler at that. So also with
                  respect to the widow and the "three twins," at Ballymastocker: there was nothing
                  very lamentable in her case either; but the thought of a poor lone woman, with
                  three children born at a birth to take care of, so fixed itself about his heart,
                  that he found it impossible to banish it. And it was only because the case of the
                  negro had something peculiar in it, his sympathy was so suddenly excited in his
                  favor. Had the doctor told him the negro's arms had been broken, he would have
                  felt for the poor sufferer, no doubt, as he felt for every body in distress; but
                  to have all his toes broken and disjointed, was something dreadful to
                  think of. A poor African wounded in this manner touched the tenderest sympathies
                  of his generous soul.
               The reader must not imagine for a moment, notwithstanding all we have said, that
                  Uncle Jerry's fancy had more to do with his benevolence than his heart. No such
                  thing; fancy was only the angel of light that stood by, while charity, the first
                  born of the Redeemer's love, drew the picture of human sorrow, and held it up
                  before him. Christian Charity, loveliest of virtues! when the Saviour, who gave
                  you in triumph to the world, first presented you on Calvary, how beautiful you
                  were then! When, taking you by the hand, he led you up the hill, and pointing to
                  the Sun of Christianity just beginning to rise, bade you go forth to bless and
                  bind all hearts together, till the light of that Sun should again be absorbed in
                  the source of its life forevermore,—how modest your blushing face, and how timid
                  your noiseless step, as you then came out from the darkness of paganism, to weave
                  your web of love round the great heart of regenerated humanity! You had
                  worshippers in those days to fall in millions at your feet; but where are they
                  now? Alas, alas! like the deserted king of Greece, looking round the Bay of
                  Salamis for his scattered ships,— 
                     
                        "You counted them at break of day,
                        But when the sun set where were they?"
                     
                  
               
               The goddess of Charity whom men worship now, how unlike thee she is! Bold and
                  proud, she walks with stately step, and shuns the lowly cabin on her way to
                  princely halls. She extends no friendly hand to the helpless and houseless in the
                  darkness of night, but waits for the broad glare of noonday, to carry her gifts to
                  the market place. She stalks along the public thoroughfares in wanton attire,
                  surrounded by followers whom she attracts by the splendor of her garments and the
                  stateliness of her mien. She sets herself up as thy rival, modest, blushing child
                  of God. In the flaunting dress of the courtesan, she disputes thy empire over the
                  hearts of men; and, alas, that we must confess it! she gains the victory.
               But, dear reader, fallen as the world is, there are some true hearts to be found
                  in it still; some who, like Uncle Jerry, will steal away into obscure places to
                  comfort the poor, and blush like him to be caught in the act. So was it now.
               It appears that Mr. Guirkie, instead of going directly to Rathmullen, on his
                  weekly visit to the old churchyard, as Mrs. Motherly had supposed, fell in with
                  the priest, on his way to visit the widow with the "three twins" at
                  Ballymastocker, who was taken suddenly ill, and instantly resolved to accompany
                  him to the house.
               As Captain Petersham, with his party, rode along, two horses, standing at the
                  widow's door, attracted his attention; and on coming up, he recognized them as
                  Father John's and Mr. Guirkie's. At once he made up his mind to invite the two
                  friends to Castle Gregory, and accordingly dismounted for that purpose.
               On entering the humble dwelling of the widow, or rather as he stepped on the
                  threshold, a sight met his view which
                  caused him instantly to draw back. Uncle Jerry was sitting near the fireplace,
                  with his back to the door, and so intent at his occupation, that he neither heard
                  the captain's footstep, nor observed the shadow his person cast upon the wall as
                  he came in. The latter, as the reader knows already, was a blunt, out-spoken,
                  honest-hearted, rollicking country-gentleman of the old school, and Kate, knowing
                  his ways so well, had been expecting every instant to hear his voice in high
                  banter with Uncle Jerry; but, instead of that, she was rather surprised to see him
                  steal out again on tiptoe, with his hands raised up in wonder, as if at something
                  he had witnessed within.
               "What's the matter, captain?" she demanded; "is the widow dead?"
               "Not that I know of; but such a sight as that I haven't seen for years—come down
                  and behold it with your own eyes;" and lifting her from the saddle, he escorted
                  her to the door of the cabin.
               Mr. Weeks and the other gentlemen of the party, hearing the captain's words, were
                  instantly excited by a natural curiosity to see what was going on, and alighted
                  also.
               Uncle Jerry was still intent on his work. He was rocking a cradle of more than
                  ordinary proportions, made of coarse wicker-work, in which the three twins were
                  soundly sleeping. On a low stool beside him lay his pocket handkerchief, which he
                  had been using when the captain first saw him, and had only laid down as the party
                  came crowding round the door.
               "Gentlemen," said Kate, turning to her friends and whispering her words low, "I
                  beg you'll retire. This is no fitting scene for profane eyes like yours. Away, and
                  leave the captain and me to speak to him."
               They did as directed; and then Kate, motioning the latter to keep his place,
                  stepped across the earthen floor with the lightness of a bird, and stood behind
                  the watcher. She was about to touch him on the shoulder with her finger to make
                  him aware of her presence, but drew it suddenly back again, and waited a minute
                  longer.
               In that short minute Uncle Jerry had laid open his whole heart to her. She could
                  read it as plainly as a book. Inserting his hand into the lining of his great
                  seal-skin cap, he drew forth from a secret pocket, which Mrs. Motherly had failed
                  to discover, a Bank of Ireland note, and rolling it up into convenient shape, took
                  the hand of one of the orphans, and wove it in between its fingers. As he did so,
                  a big tear dropped on the hand, and Uncle Jerry took up his handkerchief to wipe
                  it off.
               "Hold!" said Kate; "let it remain there, to consecrate the offering."
               "God bless me!" exclaimed Mr. Guirkie, looking up with his eyes still full. "Why,
                  I thought I was alone."
               "And if you were," replied Kate, hardly able to restrain her own tears, "the
                  lesson had been lost."
               "What lesson?"
               "That," said she, pointing to the child's hand holding the money, with the mercy
                  drop glistening on it.
               "Why, upon my word and honor, Kate," said Uncle Jerry, wiping his tears, "I don't
                  know how it is, but the smoke of the peat fire affects my eyes more than
                  ever—perhaps it's because I'm growing older."
               Kate took his hand and pressed it lovingly in hers. "God bless you," she said. "I
                  never see you but I feel my heart growing better. If charity and faith ever dwell
                  in human bosoms, they are surely to be found in yours. But tell me, where is
                  Father John?"
               Uncle Jerry pointed to the room.
               "Has he finished?"
               "Yes—you may go in."
               Kate opened the door gently, but seeing Father John kneeling by the bedside of his
                  penitent, closed it again.
               "Come in," said the priest, turning his head a little, and seeing her form as she opened the door; "come in,
                  Miss Petersham; and as I administer the sacrament of the body and blood of the
                  Redeemer to this poor dying creature, beg of him, by the love he bore you in the
                  institution of this adorable mystery of the eucharist, to convert you to the true
                  and living faith."
               Kate fell upon her knees.
               "God of love," said the priest, prostrate before the open pix, "if ever I have
                  done aught to deserve a blessing at thy hands, I now implore thee to touch the
                  heart of this erring child. Breathe into her soul the spirit that quickeneth unto
                  life, that she may one day feel how good thou art, and how inestimable a treasure
                  she possesses in the sacrament of thy love. And thou, O Mary, Mother of God, pray
                  for her, that she may soon break asunder those earthly ties that hold her back
                  from the arms of the church of Christ stretched out to embrace her."
               He then rose and administered the viaticum to the dying woman, afterwards the
                  sacrament of extreme unction, and, kneeling once more by her bedside, recommended
                  her soul fervently to the God who gave it.
               As he turned to quit the room, Kate looked up in his face, her cheeks flushed with
                  the emotions of her heart. "Father," she cried, still kneeling before him,
                  "father, give me thy hand;" and kissing it, she placed it on her head, and asked
                  his blessing.
               He gave it from the depth of his heart. Then Kate rose, and silently accompanied
                  her two friends to the door, where the party impatiently awaited their coming.
               The captain, who had been a silent witness of the whole scene, touched his cap
                  respectfully as the priest appeared, and silently mounting his horse, rode off
                  with his friends to Castle Gregory.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               
                  Mr. Weeks professes Washingtonian Principles, but is induced, notwithstanding,
                     to taste Whiskey Punch.—Its wonderful Effects.
               
               "MR. WEEKS," said Captain Petersham, after dinner was over and the cloth removed,
                  "I'm delighted to see you at Castle Gregory; and now, as the ladies have left us,
                  we must drink a glass of stout Innishowen together. Mr. Johnson, shove down the
                  decanter to our American friend."
               "Excuse me, captain," said Weeks; "I never drink."
               "Nonsense! you must drink. By George, that's a pretty thing! not drink, indeed!
                  why, you're not a teetotaler, are you?"
               "Well, pretty much. I'm a Washingtonian."
               "Of course you are—I know all that. But you don't mean to say that every
                  Washingtonian's a temperance man?"
               "You mistake, I reckon," said Weeks. "A Washingtonian don't mean an American,
                  exactly, but a member of a certain temperance society."
               "O, I see—that's the meaning of it. So you belong to a temperance society, then!
                  Well, 'pon my honor, friend Weeks, I had formed a better opinion of you."
               "Don't think it wrong to take a pledge against liquor, do you?"
               "No—not perhaps for the working classes—but I think no gentleman should take it.
                  If a sense of his position, and respect for his honor, don't restrain a gentleman
                  from brutalizing himself, then I say he's no gentleman, and no pledge or oath can
                  bind him. What think you, Father John?"
               "You're right, captain; except in those rare instances when gentlemen regard
                  excess as a sin against God: in such cases a pledge may restrain them when their
                  honor can't. Perhaps Mr. Weeks is one of this class."
               
               "How—regard intoxication as a sin against God?"
               "Yes—for which he, one day, will bring you to account."
               "Well, as to that," replied Weeks, "I reckon it depends materially on the kinder
                  notions one has formed on that ere point. Folks differ, you know, considerable
                  about the sorter being God is; and, as for myself, I can't say I ever got well
                  posted up on the subject. But I always maintained that the abuse of liquor was a
                  sin against society."
               "Of course—there never was a second opinion about that."
               "And I always set my face against it on that account."
               "Precisely; you adopted the prevailing sentiment—for I can call it by no other
                  name—that the abuse of liquor should be discouraged, not because it's offensive to
                  God and injurious to the soul, but because it's offensive to society—to modest
                  eyes and ears polite."
               "Father John, take my advice, and drop the argument," said the captain, "or you'll
                  be head and ears into one of your long sermons directly. Mr. Weeks, don't mind
                  him—he's forever moralizing. Come, fill your glass, like an honest man, and drink
                  your national toast—'Success to the stars and stripes.'"
               "Don't drink, I assure you, captain. Should be most happy to oblige you, but it's
                  against my principles."
               "Against the ——! against a man's principles to drink a glass of punch at a
                  friend's table!"
               "Don't urge the gentleman," said two or three of the company—"don't, sir; he has
                  scruples about it. Every man should know what suits himself best."
               "Nonsense! I can't bear to look at a guest sitting at my table as dry as a
                  stick."
               "Well, to please you, I'll taste something," said Weeks, at last; "though it's
                  against my principles to drink. Mr. Johnson, have the goodness to make me a
                  spoonful or two of sangaree"
               "Sangaree. Ha, ha, ha!" laughed the captain. "Not a drop of it, Johnson—not a
                  drop; make him a glass of whiskey punch. Or, stop—send it up to me; I'll make it
                  myself."
               "No, no—hold on, captain; excuse me," said Weeks, intercepting the decanter on its
                  way to the head of the table; "excuse me; I'd rather not; Mr. Johnson will make
                  it."
               "Why, it seems so strange—Whately, could you have imagined it? a freeman, a
                  citizen of the model republic, and neither Presbyterian nor Quaker, to belong to a
                  temperance society. Ha, ha! it's monstrous!—it shocks all my American
                  prepossessions."
               Weeks smiled in his usual cold way, and assured the captain the "Sons of
                  Temperance" were very numerous in the States; and that, for his part, he had been
                  strictly temperate since he was fifteen years old.
               "And, pray, Mr. Weeks," said the captain, filling his glass from the tumbler,
                  "what pleasure or advantage can you derive from this self-denial you practise—it's
                  not for your sins, I suspect—eh?"
               "No, sir; don't believe in that doctrine."
               "And why the mischief do you abstain, then?"
               "Why, because it suits my constitution best, and saves my pocket besides."
               "O, that indeed; I understand you now."
               "Two excellent motives—ain't they, captain?"
               "You must ask Father Brennan, sir; that question involves a knowledge of morals of
                  which I profess to be entirely ignorant. What say you, Father John? will his
                  motives stand the test of your theology?"
               Father John shook his head, but said nothing in reply.
               "Well, look here," pursued Weeks, turning to the priest; "I ain't a-goin to
                  dispute the matter now; but just multiply fourteen years (the time I've been
                  temperate) by three hundred and sixty-five dollars saved each year,—and that's
                  about the lowest estimate I can make,—and you have precisely five thousand one
                  hundred and ten dollars, exclusive of
                  interest. Now I call that a saving. I may be mistaken, but I call it a
                  saving."
               "Not a doubt of it," replied the priest, smiling—"not a doubt of it; you calculate
                  very closely though—don't you?"
               "Well, no, sir; I merely follow Cousin Nathan's advice, and don't waste my powder.
                  I had a cousin once called Nathan Bigelow——"
               "There!" ejaculated Uncle Jerry, laying down his glass untasted, and rising from
                  the table; "there! he's at Nathan again. I vow and declare I can't stand it—this
                  is the fifth time."
               "What's the matter, Mr. Guirkie?" inquired the captain.
               "Nothing very particular," replied Uncle Jerry, making his way out; "I'll return
                  presently."
               "Well, this cousin of mine," continued Weeks, "this cousin called Nathan——"
               "O, he's the man, used to preside at town meetings, direct the minister what to
                  preach, and so forth. Yes, yes, you needn't mind; we have heard of him."
               "Have, eh?"
               "Yes; he's quite familiar to us."
               "Well, I was only going to say that I merely followed his advice. And now, with
                  regard to my second motive, I found, when about fifteen years of age, or
                  thereaways, that liquor proved a leetle too exciting for my constitution, both
                  mentally and physically."
               "Ah, indeed," said the priest; "how so, pray?"
               "Well, it softened my heart a leetle more than I found convenient."
               "You drank too freely, perhaps, for a boy of your age?"
               "Well, guess I did—rather; can't say I got drunk, though—got tight once in a
                  while. But the darned thing used to draw a sorter skin over my eyes, that I
                  couldn't see clearly what I was about."
               "Hence you gave it up?"
               "Yes. You'd like to know, perhaps, how it came round?"
               "Certainly—let's hear it by all means."
               "Well, it was kinder funny, too. Father sent me one morning, when I was about
                  fifteen or a little over, to a place called Meriden, with chickens and squash for
                  the market. It happened I took a young colt with me father bought short time
                  before, and he was a smasher of his age, I tell you—only rising five,
                  and as pretty a piece of horse flesh as you could scare up in the hull county.
                  After selling the provisions and putting the proceeds in my wallet, I dropped into
                  a bar room to have a drink before I'd start for hum. Just as I took a cigar after
                  the brandy, a long-legged, green-looking chap—Vermonter, guess he was—comes up to
                  the counter, and says he, 'Youngster, that horse of yourn's pretty smart horse, I
                  reckon.' 'Well, yes,' I said, 'considerable smart for a colt.' 'What time does he
                  make?' 'Three and a half.' Says he, 'No; can't do it.' 'Can't?' says I. Says he,
                  'no, hain't got the points for three and a half, nor four neither.' 'Well,' says
                  I, quite coolly, as I lit my cigar, 'you can bet, if you've a mind to.' 'Agreed,'
                  says he; 'what'll it be?' 'I ain't particular,' said I. 'Well,' says he, 'treat
                  for all round, if you've got no objection?' 'None,' said I; 'I'm quite
                  agreeable.'
               "Well, having got the lend of a sulky from a doctor in the neighborhood, we marked
                  the course, appointed a time-keeper, and off I started. Crackie, how that colt did
                  put that day! Well, he went it slick, I tell yer. The critter knew just's well as
                  I did myself what he'd got to do, and he struck out like a good fellow."
               "Won the bet, of course?"
               "Won it! Ye-e-s; and twenty seconds to spare besides. 'Well,' said the tall
                  fellow, coming up to me, as I stepped from the sulky, and clapped the colt on the
                  back,—'well,' said he, 'he did his prettiest, I reckin?'
               "Said I, 'No; not by a long chalk.' 'Darn the matter,' said he, 'he won the bet, any way; so come in and
                  have a drink.' As the chap spoke, he beckoned to two or three other hard-looking
                  customers, that seemed to be loafing about the corner, and then dove into an
                  oyster cellar. 'Brandy smashes and cigars for five,' said he, passing the
                  bar-keeper. 'You'll go that, youngster, won't you?' 'Well, don't care if I do,'
                  said I, 'though I ain't much accustomed to it.'"
               "So you drank too much on that occasion?" observed one of the company,
                  interrupting the details, for he thought Mr. Weeks was growing rather tedious.
               "You'd better believe it, friend. Well, to cut the story short, before I left the
                  cellar that afternoon, I lost the price of the squash and chickens, and swapped
                  the colt besides for a Canadian pony, a gold watch, and thirty-seven dollars in
                  cash. Next morning came though, and O, scissors! if I didn't feel like
                  suicide."
               "Conscience stricken," said the priest, "for the night's debauch?"
               "Conscience stricken! Why, no; but letting that green chap come it over me so
                  smooth. Well, I swow, I never felt so cheap in my life—that's a fact."
               "He cheated you, then?"
               "Yes—guess he did cheat me. Hold on a bit though; you'll hear. About seven o'clock
                  next morning, father came into the kitchen swearing like fifty. I was lying abed
                  at the time, just thinking of getting up."
               "'Where's the young scamp?' he cried; 'by thunder, I'll cowhide him this minute
                  within an inch of his life.'
               "'Good gracious!' exclaimed mother. 'Why, Amasa Weeks! Ain't you ashamed?'
               "'No, I ain't.'
               "'You oughter then.'
               "'Stand aside,' shouted father, 'and let me pass.'
               "'Amasa, ain't you crazy?'
               "'Shut up, I say. The young scoundrel! I'll teach him how to trade!'
               "'Poor child,' said mother, 'it was his first trade; and what could you expect of
                  a boy of fifteen? Why, gracious, if he was taken in about that watch,
                  it ain't agoin to ruin you—is it?'
               "'But the horse! the horse!' shouted father.
               "'The horse! why, what's the matter with the horse?'
               "'The matter!—thunderation's the matter!—the critter's blind!'
               "'Blind!—why, you don't say!'
               "'And lame! lame! the tarnation villain!'
               "'Pheugh,' said I, jumping out of bed and bolting through the open window with my
                  jacket under my arm; 'it's time I warn't here, I reckon;' and without waiting for
                  further information on the subject, I cleared."
               After the suppressed titter, which accompanied Weeks's story all through, had at
                  last broken out into a broad laugh, and then subsided, Father John quietly
                  observed that the gentleman's first lesson was rather an expensive one.
               "Should think so," said Weeks in reply; "it cost me, or father rather, somewhere
                  in the neighborhood of two hundred dollars."
               "And so, after that, you concluded to drink no more?"
               "Gave it up, sir, right straight off; I saw it wouldn't pay."
               "And that, I suppose, was your only motive for becoming temperate?"
               "Why, yes—of course it was."
               "Well," said the priest, "I can't admire it much. Had you only united that motive,
                  selfish as it was, with a desire to please God and save your soul——"
               "Whew!" ejaculated Weeks, interrupting the priest; "that's quite another affair.
                  My principle is, to leave Christianity and religion, and all that sorter thing, to
                  those whose duty it is to look after it. I'm a business man, squire, and my object
                  is trade, and nothing else."
               
               "Good!" cried the captain, returning and clapping Weeks on the shoulder as he
                  passed him on his way to the head of the table. "Good, sir; that's honest
                  speaking. By George, Weeks, you're a trump."
               "Well, them's my sentiments, and I ain't afraid to avow them either," said Weeks,
                  taking courage from the captain and the poteen together. "I'm a business man, and
                  make no pretensions to piety, nor nothing else."
               "Certainly not, sir; that's as much as you can attend to."
               "Of course it is—no doubt of it."
               "And see here," said Weeks, after finishing the last glass, and making the spoon
                  ring in the empty tumbler,—"see here, captain; I may as well say what I think. I
                  never saw a pious business man yet worth a copper to the country. I
                     swonnie I never did."
               "Ha, ha!" laughed the captain; "listen to that, Father John."
               "And I tell you what, sir," continued Weeks, turning to the priest,—who now kept
                  his head down to hide a smile, while he toyed with his watch chain for an
                  excuse,—"I tell you what, sir, ministers may say what they please, but they're a
                  darned set of humbugs; that's the hull amount of it."
               "Hah! take that, my reverend friend," chuckled the captain again. "The truth
                  occasionally, you know, will do you good."
               "I'm quite surprised, Mr. Weeks," gravely observed the priest, while the smile
                  still kept playing about the corners of his mouth,—"I'm really surprised to hear
                  you speak so irreverently."
               "Well, hold on a bit—hold on—see here: I know as many as fifty ministers in New
                  England alone, and more too, abandoned their pulpits last year, and went off to
                  speculate in this, that, and t`'other thing, to make money. Some went into the
                  fish business, some into the lumber trade, two on 'em from my own town turned to
                  the law, and the majority managed to squeeze themselves into the legislature. Now,
                  if these men had, what they pretended to have, a vocation to the ministry before
                  their ordination, where in thunder did it go after? I'd like to know."
               "It's no doubt a melancholy fact," said the priest, "that your Protestant clergy
                  of New England, especially those with limited revenues, in very many instances
                  have renounced their sacred calling for more lucrative trades and professions,
                  thereby disgracing themselves and their religion. Such instances are very rare in
                  this country, however."
               "Are?—how's that?"
               "Why, we don't love money here, perhaps, so much as you do in the States; and
                  besides, we haven't the same opportunities to speculate."
               "Well, that may be all very true; but it's my opinion ministers, in general, make
                  a trade of religion every where, one way or other. I have had a pretty good chance
                  myself to see how the thing works, and I reckon I can tell as much about it, too,
                  as most folks. Been a class-leader once in my time."
               "What!" exclaimed the captain, leaning his folded arms on the table, and gazing at
                  the Yankee, bedizened all over as he was with chains and brooches. "What, a
                  class-leader—you?"
               "Yes."
               "A Methodist class-leader?"
               "Why, certainly."
               "A canting, Methodist class-leader?"
               "Of course."
               "May the Lord forgive you, sir." (The reader is already aware of the captain's
                  special contempt for that particular sect.) "Why, you must have lost your
                  senses."
               "Well, they are a kinder scraggy, I allow."
               "And you made such a spooney of yourself as to snivel away with this psalm-singing
                  set. By the Lord Harry, Weeks, I thought you were a different man altogether."
               
               "Well, I admit it was sorter mean—that's a fact. But wait a bit; let me tell you
                  how it happened. I had an object in view."
               "O, confound your object!"
               "Wait a minute; you'll say it warn't a bad one, if the thing had been properly
                  managed. Well, there was a gal in our neighborhood, named Brown—Zepherina Brown,
                  or Zeph, as she was called for shortness sake."
               "Pardon me, Mr. Weeks—your glass is empty," said the captain. "Whately, send up
                  the bottle."
               "You'll excuse me, captain."
               "Hang your excuses; make a glass of punch, sir, like a man."
               "Well, I'd rather not, just at present."
               "Nonsense!"
               "I'm not used to it, you know."
               "Used to it! used to Innishowen whiskey twenty years old? Are you used to new
                  milk? 'Pon my honor, sir, I'm ashamed of you. If you don't drink, by the Lord
                  Harry I'll think you're a Methodist still."
               "Well, I rather think I'll be ashamed of myself before long, if I hold on at this
                  rate. It begins to wake me up already. I swonnie it does."
               "Psaugh! my dear sir, you might drink a puncheon of it. Irish whiskey's meat,
                  drink, washing, and lodging for every human being under the sun. Come, send up
                  your tumbler; I'll mix it for you. There's Madeira and Claret on the sideboard,
                  and I wouldn't give a brass button for oceans of it, while there's a drop of this
                  real old Irish whiskey here to soften my heart. By George, sir, if you only drank
                  it for six months, it would make a man of you."
               "Humph! guess it would—the wrong way."
               "No, sir, but the right way. It would cure you of that passion you have for
                  speculating and money-making. It would make your heart grow twice as big as it
                  is—ay, big enough, by George, to take the whole human race into it."
               "Well, it's a fact," said Weeks, "it does make a feller feel kind of good; but
                  guess it's not to be trusted too far, either, for all that."
               "Never fear, Weeks, never fear; you go on with the story, and I'll mix the
                  punch."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               
                  Mr. Weeks grows eloquent after the second Tumbler, and makes a crack Speech,
                     but declines a Duel with the Light-keeper as not being in his Line.
               
               "WELL," said Weeks, making another start, "Zeph lived at a place called Pratt's
                  Corner, five six miles from Ducksville. She was kinder related to us somehow by
                  the Bigelows, and mother and she terrible intimate. Zeph used to invite mother to
                  prayer meetings, and mother, in return, sent Zeph presents of apple-sass twice a
                  year regular. Well, Zeph got to be considerable old, you know, and kinder wrinkly
                  about the nose, and, as a matter of course, pious in proportion—but to balance the
                  wrinkles, Zeph had the cash."
               "Ho! ho!" cried the captain, "did the wind blow from that quarter?"
               "She had two sawmills of her own, and some twenty thousand dollars in railroad
                  stocks besides. Well, I made up my mind one day to try if I couldn't induce Zeph
                  to take a partner to help her manage her business affairs, and forthwith set about
                  making the necessary preparations. I felt kinder green, then, you know, in the
                  religious line, and so thought better
                  attend two or three prayer meetings in Ducksville beforehand, to get into the way
                  of it, like."
               "Capital! capital!" ejaculated the captain.
               "When the day came for my first trial, I shaved clean as the razor would cut it,
                  mounted a black suit and half yard crape on my hat, and then put for Pratt's
                  Corner. As I entered the room, Deacon Lovejoy was holding forth strong against the
                  old pope, (his favorite theme;) so, slinking in with a face as grave as I could
                  conveniently command, after so short a practice, I took my seat longside Zeph,
                  without seeming to notice who was in it. After the deacon resumed his chair, Zeph
                  turned her head a leetle mite sideways, and siz she, in a low, touching voice, 'O
                  Mr. Weeks, how I do rejoice to see you at last among the servants of the Lord!'
                  'Ah!' said I, looking up in her face kinder dreamy like,—'Ah! how pleasant it is
                  to dwell in the assembly of the faithful—O dear——'
               "'You've been a wanderer,' said Zeph.
               "'Alas! alas! I have,' said I, looking up at her again. 'I've been a poor, sinful
                  wanderer, seeking for the waters of life among the swamps and quagmires of a
                  wicked world; but Heaven be praised, the blessed light hath come at last to guide
                  me to the pure spring.'"
               "Excellent! capital!" shouted the captain, rapping the table till the tumblers
                  rang again. "Ha, ha, ha! by Jove, Weeks, you're a clever fellow. Gentlemen, let us
                  postpone the courtship for the present; I see the ladies coming; and fill your
                  glasses—fill them up; bumpers let them be—nothing less than bumpers. I give you
                  Mr. Weeks and the stars and stripes forever."
               The company rose and drank the toast with a hip, hip, hurrah! and nine times nine;
                  and Kate, no longer able to restrain her curiosity, came tripping in from the
                  drawing room, accompanied by half a dozen ladies, declaring she could sit no
                  longer among a parcel of silly, moping girls, with such distinguished company in
                  the house. "Besides," she added, glancing archly at Mr. Weeks, "I want to hear a
                  speech. I'm actually dying to hear a speech from a citizen of the great
                  republic."
               "Gentlemen, please take your seats," said Captain Petersham, with a wave of his
                  hand; "I see Mr. Weeks is about to speak. As for you, ladies, you're a set of
                  saucy, impudent baggages, to intrude upon us here over our cups."
               "Mr. Weeks," "Mr. Weeks," "Mr. Weeks," was now heard from all parts of the
                  room.
               "Ladies and gents," said the latter, rising slowly, and running one hand into his
                  vest pocket, while he rested the other on the table,—"ladies and gents, I ain't
                  a-goin to make a speech; speech-making's not in my line. But I ain't a-goin to sit
                  silent, either, when such honor is done to the flag of my country. Ladies and
                  gents, I'm an American born, of the true blue Puritan stock, a citizen of the
                  model republic of the world. ["Hear, hear."] I ain't given to braggin much, I
                  expect, and besides, it don't become a foreigner to brag of his country in a
                  strange land; but speaking as this here gent and I were (turning to Father John)
                  about religion, I ain't afraid to assert that you can't find, in all creation, a
                  class of men professing more enlarged and liberal views of religion than the
                  merchants and traders of New England.
               "We are liberal in all things where conscience merely is concerned, and
                  conservative only with a view to preserve order in society, that trade may
                  flourish under its protection. Yes, ladies and gents, whatever tends to cripple
                  trade or impede the progress of social advancement, whether it be a new theory or
                  an old theory, a new creed or an old creed, we strangle it. We
                     strangle it as the heathens in old times used to strangle deformed
                  children. Business men in our country ain't so very particular as to difference in
                  religious denomination. They don't care much whether the creed be Orthodox,
                  Universalist, Episcopalian, or Baptist, if it only gives free scope to intellect, and a clear track
                  for human progress. There's but one creed they object to; and that is (excuse me,
                  friend, said the speaker, turning to the priest)—that is the Roman Catholic.
                  ["Hear him! hear him!" cried Captain Petersham, that's the kind of talk I like."
                  "Hear him! hear him!" echoed half a dozen others, following the lead.] Well, the
                  fact is, ladies and gents, they can't go that kinder doctrine, no
                     how; it tightens them up so they can't move one way or other. The laws
                  and rules of the Catholic church hain't got no joints in 'em; you can't bend 'em
                  no shape or form. Then they have what they call 'confession;' and if one of their
                  society happens to speculate beyond his means, the priest brings him right chock
                  up for it; so he hain't got no chance to risk any thing in the way of trade, no
                  how he can fix it. Again, if a Catholic happens to find a pocket book, for
                  instance, with five or six thousand dollars in it, he must restore it to the owner
                  right straight off, when, by waiting for twelve months or so, he might make a few
                  hundreds by the use of it to start him in business. Such a creed as that, ladies
                  and gents, no true American can tolerate. Well—he wouldn't deserve the name of a
                  freeman if he did. The question for Americans is, not whether any particular form
                  of religion be young or old, true or false, divine or human, but whether it suits
                  the genius of the country; that's the question—the only question—to decide. Our
                  country is young, ladies and gents; she has done little more, as yet, than just
                  begun to develop her resources—the greatest resources of any nation throughout all
                  universal space; and we feel it's our best policy to moderate the rigors of the
                  gospel—to temper it, as it were—well, to make it as little exacting as possible.
                  Hence our ministers, as a general thing, especially in cities and large towns,
                  seldom preach about sin, or hell, or the ten commandments, or that kinder
                  subjects, because such themes are calculated to disturb and perplex business men,
                  to the injury of trade. And we have long made up our minds that trade must be
                  cared for, whatever else suffers. Yes, ladies and gents," continued the speaker,
                  growing more animated as the old Innishowen began to warm up his blood, "our
                  country is bound to go ahead of every other country in creation. Excuse me, ladies
                  and gents, for speaking my sentiments right out on the subject; but
                  they are my sentiments and the sentiments of every native born
                  American."
               "Bravo, bravo, Weeks!" cried the captain; his fat sides shaking as he clapped his
                  hands. "Bravo—that's the talk."
               "Yes," continued Weeks, I'm a Yankee, and them sentiments are true blue Yankee
                  sentiments. We ain't a-goin to be fettered by any form of religion under the sun;
                  if it don't encourage trade and commerce it don't suit us—that's the hull amount
                  of it. Had the United States hung on to the old worn-out creeds of Europe, what
                  should our people be now?—perhaps in no better condition than yourselves, ladies
                  and gents, at this present moment."
               "That's cool," muttered some one in an under tone.
               "It's a fact, nevertheless," said Weeks, catching the words. "The antiquated
                  religion of our grandfathers would have acted like a strait-jacket on the nation,
                  cramping its energies and stinting its growth. Had we not shaken ourselves free
                  from the trammels both of pilgrim and priestly rules, could we have become in so
                  short a period so intelligent, enterprising, and powerful a nation? Yes, ladies
                  and gents, could we have flung our right arm across the Gulf, and laid hold of
                  Mexico by the hair of the head, as we do now, and be ready to extend our left over
                  your British American possessions, at any day or hour we please to take the
                  trouble, and sweep them into our lap? I ask, ladies and gents, could we have done
                     that?"
               "Hurrah!" shouted the captain—"capital! glorious!"
               "I don't profess, ladies and gents," still continued Weeks, "to belong to any
                  particular religious denominination myself. My creed is, 'a first cause and the perfectibility
                  of man:' that's the length, breadth, and thickness of my religious belief, and I
                  stand on that platform firm and flat-footed. Still, I go in for three things in
                  the religious line, as strong as any man—almshouses, observance of the Sabbath,
                  and reading the Bible. These are excellent things in their way, and ought to be
                  encouraged by every man who loves order and likes to see trade flourish. But I can
                  go no further; I can never believe, sir (turning to the priest), that the Founder
                  of Christianity intended a nation so intelligent, so intellectual, and so
                  civilized as ours, should be bound down hand and foot by the strict rules of the
                  gospel. No, sir; he intended we should moderate and adapt them as far as possible
                  to the interests of the state and the requirements of society. With these ideas
                  and these principles, ladies and gents, we are bound to go ahead—we must go
                  ahead—we can't help it—prosperity forces itself upon us—we on our part have only
                  'to clear the track' for it. Nothing can bar our progress, for our destiny is
                  universal empire. Nothing can stop our course—no obstacle, moral or physical, on
                  earth or air, on sea or land. Yes, our energies are immense, and must be expended.
                  Ladies and gents, were it necessary to bore the earth through, we should do it.
                  Yes, by crackie, tunnel almighty creation to find an outlet for our
                  resources."
               "Glorious, glorious!" shouted the captain; "hurrah! for the stars and stripes!
                  Well done, Weeks; bravo, bravo! my boy."
               And "bravo, bravo!" echoed from all parts of the room; even the ladies stood up
                  and waved their pocket handkerchiefs. In the midst of this general acclamation,
                  however, and just as Mr. Weeks had hitched up his shoulders for another start, a
                  loud, piercing shriek came from the entrance hall, which startled and silenced the
                  noisy company in an instant.
               "What the fury is that?" demanded the captain. "Ho, there, James, Thomas—go
                  instantly and see what that noise means."
               Kate rushed to the door, followed by the other ladies, curious to learn what had
                  happened; and the gentlemen, fearing some serious accident, darted out pell-mell
                  after them.
               "Who the mischief are you?" growled Captain Petersham, grasping a tall,
                  grave-looking man by the arm, as he hurried out from the parlor. "Who the mischief
                  are you, fellow?"
               "Pardon me, sir," replied the stranger in the mildest manner possible; "my name is
                  Sweetsoul. I came with——"
               "Who! what! the colporteur! the Methodist Bible-reader!"
               "The same, sir."
               "And what do you want here, sir?"
               "Excuse me, sir, I——"
               "I shan't excuse you, sir; you have no business in my house, you canting rascal;
                  out of it instantly."
               "But the lady there, sir."
               "Lady, what lady?"
               "Hush, hush! brother Tom," whispered Kate, catching him by the button-hole, and
                  whispering in his ear, "it's Baby Deb."
               "What, one of the Hardwrinkles?"
               "Yes, yes," she replied, convulsed with laughter; "her sister Rebecca—ha, ha,
                  ha!—her sister Rebecca—ha, ha!"
               "Cease your folly, Kate, and tell me."
               "Well, she's—ha, ha!—gone off with ——"
               "Eloped?"
               "Yes, fled away with —— O, dear!"
               "Rebecca Hardwrinkle eloped? Nonsense, Kate, you're only fooling me."
               "It's a positive fact," said the light-hearted, mischief-loving girl—"ask Baby
                  Deb, there, if you don't believe me."
               "O, dear! O, dear!" cried the latter, clapping her hands; "she's gone! she's
                  gone!"
               "Well, there," ejaculated Weeks, when he heard what had taken place, "there!
                  eloped! if that ain't going it strong, I don't know what is. By thunder, if this
                  ain't the most infernal country——"
               
               "Miss Hardwrinkle," said the captain, kindly taking the disconsolate young lady by
                  the arm, "let me conduct you to Aunt Willoughby's room. And tell me as we go how
                  all this happened."
               "Won't you send the police in search of her, captain? I came all the way with Mr.
                  Sweetsoul to entreat you to send them."
               "Certainly, certainly, my dear young lady, I shall do so forthwith; but how did it
                  happen?"
               "Why, a man came to the house in Ballymagahey, where we had been distributing
                  tracts, and told Rebecca a dying woman wanted to see her immediately, and have
                  some spiritual conversation with her before she departed."
               "Humph! I see; well?"
               "Well, poor Rebecca!—you know, captain, how eagerly she thirsted for the salvation
                  of souls——"
               "Yes, yes, I know all that—well?"
               "The instant the man delivered the message, she started off as quickly as
                  if——"
               "Yes, of course—I understand you; well?"
               "Her holy zeal, you know——"
               "Never mind her zeal. What the fury have I to do with her zeal—excuse me, Miss
                  Hardwrinkle, but can't you tell me how she was carried off at once?"
               "O, dear! you hurry me so—and then I'm almost dead with the fright."
               "Listen to me—did you see her carried off?"
               "See her?"
               "Yes, yes, did you actually see her?"
               "With my own eyes."
               "Then how was she carried off?"
               "Behind a man! O, dear! O, dear!"
               "Behind a man?"
               "Yes; on—a—on—a—" Here Deborah tried to blush and cover her face.
               "Confound it, on what?" roared the captain, losing patience altogether. "Can't you
                  speak at once if you wish me to take measures for your sister's recovery. How did
                  he carry her off?"
               "On a—on a—O, dear, on a pillion! behind him."
               "Phew! on a pillion! Ha, ha! By the Lord Harry, that was a
                  sight."
               "It was shocking—in broad daylight too; O, dear!"
               "It was villanous," said the captain, endeavoring to smother a laugh—"most
                  atrocious! to carry such a saintly young lady, and one so reserved in all her
                  habits of life, over the open country in broad daylight, on a pillion. S'death!
                  the scoundrel should be hung for it."
               "And O, captain," said Deborah, "I can never forget the terrific shriek she gave,
                  as she flew past me behind the inhuman wretch. It still rings in my ears—it was
                  heartrending."
               "Who could have played this trick, Kate?" said the captain, turning to his sister;
                  "eh—what does it mean?—I confess I don't understand it."
               "And how can I?" replied Kate, covering her face with her handkerchief; "how can
                  I, if you don't?"
               "Kate!"
               "What?"
               "Look up."
               "There—what's the matter?"
               "This is some of your devilry."
               "Mine!"
               "Yours. Come! come! no evasion now; you're in the plot, whatever it is, as sure as
                  your name's Kate Petersham. It's exactly like you—you needn't try to look
                  serious."
               "Why, brother Tom!"
               "Psaugh—brother Tom!—that won't do, Kate. I vow to Heaven, you're the most
                  mischievous—but stop—wait a minute," he
                  added, as a sudden thought seemed to strike him. "Miss Hardwrinkle," said he,
                  again approaching the afflicted young lady, "Miss Hardwrinkle, do you remember to
                  have seen the man before?"
               "What, the wretch who——?"
               "Yes—have you any recollection of seeing him before?"
               "No; for I could see nothing but his form, he flew by so fast; and besides, he
                  kept whipping the wretched animal so dreadfully all the time."
               "He, he, he!" chuckled Uncle Jerry to himself all alone on the sofa; "it must have
                  been an amusing sight."
               "You're a barbarous man," said Kate, overhearing the words as she passed him
                  by—"you're a barbarous man to say so."
               "O, you young trickster," exclaimed Uncle Jerry, shaking his finger at her as she
                  turned back her laughing eyes upon him; "the plot is of your making, as sure as
                  the sun."
               "What was the color of his clothes?" again inquired the captain; "or did you see
                  any thing remarkable in his form or appearance?"
               "Nothing—I could see nothing distinctly, except that he wore a cap."
               "A cap—what kind of cap?—black or blue?"
               "No. I rather think," replied Deborah, "it was a sort of fur cap; it looked rough
                  rather, and somewhat high in the crown."
               "Whitish?"
               "Yes. Something like a hare or rabbit-skin cap."
               "That's enough!" exclaimed the captain, "that's quite enough; I know the villain!
                  I know him!—I suspected who he was from the beginning; he's the most daring,
                  impudent, reckless rascal, that, in all Christendom."
               "Who is he—who is he?" demanded half a dozen together.
               "Lanty Hanlon, of course; who else could he be? No man but Lanty in the three
                  baronies would dare play such a trick."
               "Lanty Hanlon," screamed Baby Deb, in semi-hysterics; "O, my gracious!"
               "Don't be alarmed," said the captain; "your sister's in safe hands."
               "O, no, no, captain; that man will murder her!"
               "Not he; nor hurt a hair of her head, either."
               "Why, you surely mistake, captain," said several of the company. "Lanty Hanlon's
                  the most notorious robber and wrangler in the whole neighborhood."
               "I can show you a wound he gave me here on the top of my head, captain," said the
                  colporteur, sneaking into the room.
               "What, you! Out of my house, you scurvy vagabond," shouted the burly captain,
                  collaring the Bible-reader, and sending him head-foremost from the room. "Ho,
                  there, fellows, James, Thomas, bundle out that snivelling rascal. By the Lord
                  Harry, if he come in my sight again, I'll horsewhip him."
               "Well, but, captain, you must be mistaken about this Hanlon," said one; "it was he
                  beat my game-keeper."
               "The same fellow robbed my salmon box," said another.
               "And poached on my premises," said a third.
               "Yes, and by crackie, it was that tarnation villain drugged me first with poteen
                  whiskey, and then danced me to death, at the wedding," put in Weeks. "He's the
                  most provoking rascal, too, I ever met, for he keeps as cool as a cucumber all the
                  while."
               "Gentlemen," said the captain, "you may say what you please of Lanty Hanlon, and
                  think what you please, too, but I know him better than the whole kit of you put
                  together; and by the Lord Harry, he's one of the best specimens of his class I
                  ever saw. He's an honest-hearted, reckless, rollicking, light-hearted Irishman,
                  who likes his bit of fun as well as the
                  best of us, and will have it if he can; but tell me the man ever knew Lanty to do
                  a mean thing. He may have speared your salmon, and shot your game, and broken your
                  bailiffs' heads; but where's the harm in that? Can you call it a crime to kill the
                  trout that swims in the mountain brooks, or the black cock that feeds on the
                  mountain heather? What right have you to forbid a man to catch the trout that
                  jumps in the stream before his own door, or kill the game that feeds on his own
                  pasture? May the devil take such game laws, say I, and may the man that respects
                  them never know the taste of a white trout at breakfast, or a black cock at
                  supper. As for you, Mr. Weeks, you must have said or done something to provoke
                  Lanty, or he never had put you through the coarse hackle in that way. Besides, you
                  didn't matriculate here yet; you're green in the country."
               "Gentleman wishes to see Mr. Weeks," said a servant, interrupting the speaker.
               Mr. Weeks followed, and was conducted to the breakfast parlor. As the door opened,
                  the visitor advanced to meet him, with an open letter in his hand.
               "Ha! Mr. Lee, glad to see you, sir—how d'ye do?"
               "Good evening, sir," replied the light-keeper, stiffly. "Pray, Mr. Weeks, is this
                  your handwriting?"
               "My handwriting?"
               "Yes, sir; Miss Lee received that letter this morning through Tamny post office;
                  it bears your signature."
               "Why, what's the trouble?"
               "Do you acknowledge it yours, sir?"
               "Well, yes, I reckon so; what's the matter? you seem kinder put out about it."
               "Mr. Weeks," said the light-keeper, "you have managed in some way to get hold of
                  my note of hand; may I now ask how you came to know of the existence of such a
                  paper—or was it through Mr. Robert Hardwrinkle you discovered it?"
               Weeks bowed his assent.
               "Ah, I thought so. Well, sir, having bribed an old woman to play the black-foot
                  between you and my, and Miss Lee, and not having succeeded as soon as you
                  anticipated, you directed your attorney to mark a writ against me for debt; and
                  now, at the heels of the writ, Miss Lee receives that letter, making her proposals
                  of marriage, and assuring her at the same time of an account at your banker's of a
                  hundred thousand dollars. What does this mean, sir?"
               "It ain't the first letter, I guess—is it?"
               "Not the first you sent, sir, but the first came to her hands."
               "Shoh! you don't say so! That infernal she devil then has played me false—well,
                  there! Tarnation seize the whole darned pack——"
               "Hold, sir. Did you or did you not take out this writ against my body with a view
                  to compel Miss Lee to marry you?"
               "How's that?" muttered Weeks, affecting not to understand the question.
               "Answer me, yes or no," said the light-keeper; "I have no time to spare."
               "Look here, friend; I ain't a-goin to be catechised this fashion."
               "Catechised—by all the gods in Olympus, I'll catechise you, my fine fellow, and
                  the right way, too. Your villany's discovered at last, sir. Else Curley has
                  revealed to me all your plots and schemes."
               "Well, but you needn't get into such a fuss about it, my dear man," responded
                  Weeks, quite coolly; "if you ain't disposed to let me have the girl, why don't,
                  that's all; but you've got to pay the face of the notes, or go to jail——"
               "Scoundrel, let you have the girl!"
               "Ain't I good enough for her?"
               "You!"
               "Why, yes. I'm an American born—good enough, I reckon, for the best Irish girl ever stood in shoe
                  leather—all-fired proud as they are."
               "And why didn't you ask her like a man, if you thought so? No, you hadn't the
                  courage, sir. Your meanness of soul wouldn't let you. You preferred to scheme and
                  plot with Else Curley, and to sneak about my house day after day like a hungry
                  spaniel. By George, if I suspected what brought you there when you first came, I'd
                  have flung you neck and heels into the Devil's Gulch. What! because I'm poor, you
                  tried to compel my niece to marry you through fear of my incarceration. Begone,
                  sir! let me never see you within a league of the lighthouse again, or if you do,
                  I'll horsewhip you as I would a dog."
               "Say, don't get into such a fury about it."
               "Fury!" repeated the light-keeper, buttoning up his coat, and darting a look at
                  the crest-fallen Yankee so full of contempt that the latter cowered under it.
                  "Paugh, sir," he added, "you're beneath my scorn. Had you the slightest pretension
                  to the character of a gentleman, I should have compelled you before I left this
                  room to apologize for the insult you offered—but coxcomb and a coward as you are,
                  I let you pass."
               "Coward! guess you're mistaken—ain't you?" replied Weeks, shoving his hands down
                  into his breeches pockets, and hitching up his shoulders.
               "You're a disgrace, sir, to the name of America," continued the light-keeper,
                  without noticing the reply. "Your country is a noble country, sir; your heroes of
                  the revolution rank among the first soldiers of the world; your orators and
                  statesmen have already eclipsed some of the first celebrities of Europe; your
                  people, in the main, are a high-minded, generous people; but you, sir, and such
                  sneaking rascals as you, with your godless liberalism, and your national vanity,
                  are enough to bring your country into contempt wherever you go. I have loved
                  America ever since I was able to lisp the name; but if you be a fair specimen of
                  your countrymen, I would rather be a dog than an American. If you're a Yankee, the
                  New Englanders must have sadly degenerated since the revolution. Go, go!"
               "Well," said Weeks, "can't say as to that; but I rather guess they're a leetle
                  ahead of the Irish yet."
               "Yes; you and such as you, in vending hickory hams and wooden nutmegs, may be
                  somewhat smarter, I suppose. But smartness, without either honor or principle, is
                  a poor recommendation. Go home, sir, go home again, and tell your countrymen,—that
                  class of them at least to which you belong,—that hucksters and speculators are
                  less respected here in Europe for their smartness than despised for their love of
                  gold. Tell them you failed in your own speculation in matrimony, because you
                  relied too much on your low cunning, and valued too lightly the character of the
                  people on whose simplicity you came to practise. Tell them you saw in Ireland a
                  poor man proud—bankrupt in every thing but honor—who, reduced to beggary and a
                  jail, would rather see his child mated with the poorest peasant on his native
                  hills, than give her to a peddling, speculating foreigner, with a hundred thousand
                  dollars at his banker's. There, sir," he added, flinging the letter in Weeks's
                  face, "take back your vile proposal, and begone. I came with a brace of pistols
                  here in my breast, to demand the satisfaction due from one gentleman to another;
                  but you're too contemptible a scoundrel to smell an honest man's powder;" and so
                  saying, the light-keeper flung on his slouched hat and left the room.
               Weeks stood full three minutes gazing at the door through which the light-keeper
                  passed, without moving a muscle—his hands, as usual, thrust into his pockets. He
                  seemed completely confounded at what had taken place. "Well, there," he ejaculated
                  at length, throwing himself down in an arm chair and taking out his penknife to
                  whittle a small mahogany rule that lay
                  beside him on the table, apparently without the least consciousness of what he was
                  doing,—"there, that's the end of it, I reckon. Humph! well, Mr. Charles B.
                  Bigelow, or rather I should say, Mr. Ephraim C. B. Weeks—since that's the name you
                  have chosen for the present—I think you ought to feel kinder cheap—eh! four
                  hundred dollars lost for spells and charms—that is, considering the sort of bills
                  they were—not to speak of what the note cost me—and fooled into the bargain. Go
                  it, go it, my boy,—that's the way to make a fortune out of the ignorant Irish.
                  Well, I'm in a fix, that's a fact—a tarnation ugly fix, too. O Else Curley, out of
                  h—ll there's no such woman as you. I reckoned I was pretty smart myself, but I
                  guess you're a leetle mite smarter. Humph! of some twenty love-letters, the girl
                  has received but one, and that the very one I mailed myself at the post office.
                  And there's that darned cabin boy—only for him I might get along slick enough yet;
                  for come to get the light-keeper into jail, Cousin Robert and I could manage to
                  carry off the girl somehow. But the boy, if he recover, will reveal all, and then
                  the whole secret is blown. Sambo says he'll go down to the lighthouse to-night and
                  demand the young scamp—and Cousin Robert promises to send a constable with him to
                  enforce his right of guardianship—but should he blab the secret before they reach
                  him, I must put for Ducksville right straight off. As it is, I'm cornered up
                  rather close to feel comfortable. O, Ireland, Ireland—could I once get off with
                  this girl under my arm, I should advise every stranger that values his life to
                  keep clear of you a day's sailing at least."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXII.
               
                  Else and Mary.—The Solitary and her Foster-child.
               
               THE reader will recollect that when Kate Petersham parted with Mary Lee at the
                  steps, the latter looked somewhat alarmed at the serious tone in which her
                  light-hearted friend begged her to remember Randall Barry that night in her
                  prayers. She made an effort, in fact, to detain Kate for an explanation; but Kate
                  eluded her grasp, and bounded down the steps, the moment she uttered the words,
                  with the fleetness and agility of a fairy.
               On her return to the sick room, the agitated girl found Else seated on a low stool
                  beside the little cabin boy's bed, knitting her stocking.
               "What ails ye, dear?" said the latter, with a tenderness of look and tone she
                  seldom betrayed even to her favorite. "What ails ye, Mary? yer so pale."
               "Pale! am I pale?"
               "Yer as pale as a ghost, dear—what's the matther?"
               "Nothing. But come to my room—I have something to ask you. We mustn't disturb our
                  little patient, you know. How is he now, Else?"
               "Better."
               "You're sure?"
               "Sure as can be, dear—he's recoverin fast. He got the cool [crisis] this morning,
                  an his pult's quieter now."
               "Thank God," exclaimed the grateful girl, with all the fervor of her pure loving
                  heart. "O, I knew well the Blessed Virgin wouldn't forget him. Her intercession
                  has saved him.
               
               Poor little fellow, he'll see home and friends once more. Won't he, Else?"
               "Hope so."
               "But, Else!"
               "What?"
               "You have a secret for me."
               "A secret?"
               "Yes; I saw it in Miss Petersham's face, and I see it now in your's. You needn't
                  try to keep it from me, Else. Randall Barry's arrested."
               "Randall Barry! Why, what in the world, dear, put that in your head?"
               "Else, you needn't try to deceive me. I know well he's taken."
               "And what if he is asthore," said Else, smoothing down the dishevelled tresses of
                  her lovely protegée with her hard bony fingers,
                  whilst the muscles of her own face twitched with emotion—what if he is? sure it's
                  only for a day or two. He'll soon be free again."
               "Had I only taken my dear uncle's advice, and told him never to come again, this
                  had never happened."
               "And didn't ye tell him that a hundred times?"
               "Yes; I told him often how my uncle loved me, and how it would break his heart if
                  I leave him—and how little I knew of the world, and how poor a companion I would
                  make for one like him. I told him all this many and many a time, Else, and begged
                  him to return home to the south, and wait for better and happier days—but he knew
                  my heart belied my words."
               "God love yer innocent heart," exclaimed Else, while her old eyes filled with
                  tears; "God love ye, dear; yer too good for this world."
               "Had I only prayed fervently to God for strength," continued Mary, "I might have
                  overcome my weakness. But alas! Else, I'm so selfish; I was thinking only of his
                  love for me all the time, when I should have thought of nothing but his safety.
                  And he's now a prisoner on my account, with shackles on his limbs, and the doom of
                  the rebel before him. O, if I had only parted with him forever the last time he
                  clambered up these rocks to see me."
               "And if ye had," said Else, "ye'd have nothin for it. Ye were both intended for
                  one another, and for that raison ye niver cud part him. So take heart now, and all
                  'll be well yit."
               "O Randall Barry, Randall Barry! so brave—so faithful—so true to his country and
                  to me!" cried the distressed girl. "Else, Else, could I see him free once more,
                  were it only for an instant, I would bid him farewell forever, should my
                  heartstrings break in the parting."
               There was a sense of desolation in the words or the tones of Mary's voice that
                  touched the old woman deeply. But when the former spoke of her heart breaking, the
                  very idea seemed to call back again into life the better and holier feelings of
                  her nature, and unable to control any longer the emotion that agitated her soul,
                  the old woman flung her arms around the neck of her foster-child, and wept over
                  her like a mother.
               "God forbid! God forbid! asthore machree," she cried, "God forbid yer heart 'd
                  break. Darlin! darlin! why shud it ever break? for it's little this world can
                  spare a heart like yours. O angel! ye don't know what yer heart is, or what yer
                  pure innecint soul is worth to a sinful earth like this. It's little ye know,
                  dear, what ye are. Modest, wee crather, yer as simple and bashful as the daizy
                  that grows undher the green fern by the mountain strame; no one sees ye, no one
                  knows ye, no one thinks of ye down here in the black bins of Araheera—but I know
                  ye, asthore, I know what yer heart is; och, och, it's I that does,
                  ivery pulse of it. And why shudn't I,
                  Mary, darlin? wasn't it these withered hands tore ye from yer dead mother's arms,
                  here among the rocks; wasn't it me nursed ye on ould Nannie's milk, and rocked ye
                  in yer cradle up there in my poor cabin on the Cairn. I know what the valie of
                  your heart is, alanna. An to spake of it brakin for Randall Barry,
                  or sufferin one minute's pain—niver, niver," she exclaimed, suddenly rising,
                  "niver, Mary, while I'm livin and able to prevent it."
               The change in Else's look and tone was quick as thought. For a moment her heart
                  had softened under the mesmeric touch of the angelic being she embraced. But it
                  was only for a moment. Again the dark shadow came rushing back upon her soul, and
                  again the relaxed muscles of her face resumed their usual hard and stern
                  expression.
               "Let me pass, girl," she cried; "I have work to do."
               "What work?"
               "No matter—let me pass."
               "Else, your countenance terrifies me. O, I know that dark, awful temptation is
                  upon you again."
               "Away, child; take your hands off my cloak—I must be gone."
               "What's your purpose, Else?"
               "Purpose! I niver had but one purpose for thirty years, and the time is come now
                  to execute it."
               "You shan't leave me," said Mary, kneeling; "you shan't leave
                     me, Else, till you promise to do no harm to Robert Hardwrinkle or
                  his family."
               The old woman folded her arms on her brown, half-naked breast, and looked down on
                  the face of her foster-child.
               "Mary Lee," she said,—her voice husky with the passion she strove in vain to
                  conceal,—"Mary Lee, yer tears balked me of my vengeance twiste before—take care
                  they don't a third time, for I swear by——"
               "Hush! hush! Else," interrupted her fair protegée, holding up the crucifix that hung suspended from her neck,
                  and laying her forefinger on the lips of the figure. "Hush! these lips never spoke
                  but to bless."
               "Take it away, girl; take it away," cried Else, averting her eyes from the image,
                  as if she feared to look upon it lest her courage should fail; "take it away, and
                  listen to me. I'm bound by a vow made at the siege of Madeira, by the side of my
                  dead husban, niver to forget what Lieutenant Richard Barry did for me that day.
                  Randall Barry is that man's grandson, and he now lies a prisiner in Tamny barracks
                  through the threachery of Robert Hardwrinkle. The time is come to fulfil my
                  promise, and I'll do it; I'll save Randall Barry, should I lose body and soul in
                  the attempt."
               "Else, Else, this is impious," said Mary; "remember there's a God above you."
               "Paugh!" ejaculated the old woman; "I knew no God these thirty years;" and as she
                  spoke she wrested Mary's hands from her cloak, and caught the handle of the door.
                  "Let the villain luck to himself now," she cried—"let him and them that brought my
                  only sister to shame and an early grave,—that driv my brother from his father's
                  hearthstone to die among the strangers,—that hunted myself like the brock through
                  the crags iv Benraven—hah—let them luck to themselves now, for as Heaven hears me,
                  if Randall Barry's not a free man in four and twenty hours, their roof tree smokes
                  for it."
               "Else, stop for a moment."
               "Away, girl!"
               "Else, Else," entreated Mary, again attempting to detain her. "Would you commit
                  murder—deliberate murder?"
               "Murdher! is it murdher to burn a nest of vipers?"
               "Else, think for a moment. You have an immortal soul to be saved."
               "Me! I have no soul. I lost it thirty years ago—let me pass."
               
               "Listen to me."
               "No, no, no; I listened to you too long—away!"
               "Grant me but one favor. It may be the last I shall ever ask—for I fear, Else, we
                  must soon fly from this place, and then I can never hope to see you more. Grant me
                  but one favor."
               "What's that—mercy to the Hardwrinkles?"
               "No, dear Else, but mercy to yourself—to your own soul, dearer to me than the
                  wealth of worlds. Here," she continued, throwing her rosary over Else's neck,
                  "tell these beads to-night before you sleep, and as you pray, fix your eyes on the
                  crucifix."
               "Stop, stop!" exclaimed the old woman, her face flushed with passion, while the
                  hood of her cloak falling back on her shoulders and revealing her gray elf locks,
                  gave her the look of a maniac. "Stop!" she ejaculated, repulsing the pious and
                  affectionate girl—"stop! I can't touch this blissid thing. Eh, what? God of
                  heaven! what's this?"
               "The image of Christ," responded Mary, "whose life was one continuous act of love.
                  Look at those arms extended to bless and forgive the whole world, and tell me, can
                  you behold the image of that dying Saviour, and yet feel so hard-hearted as to
                  take the life of your fellow-creature?"
               "Whisht, girl, whisht," said Else, sinking back on a chair, as if her emotions had
                  completely overpowered her; "whisht! and tell me whose rosary is this?"
               "Father John's—he lent it to me when I lost my mother's."
               "Good God!" exclaimed the afflicted woman, covering her face with her hands, "this
                  rosary was once mine."
               "Yours!"
               "Ay, ay; I brought it with me from the West Indees, and giv it to ould priest
                  Gallaher of Gortnaglen, Father John's uncle. Augh, hoch, it lucks ould and worn
                  now like myself;" and the unfortunate woman burst into tears.
               "I wish it had grown old and worn in your own hands, Else, dear," said Mary,
                  sitting beside her, and pushing back the gray hairs from her wrinkled forehead. "I
                  wish it had, Else, for then your long life had been better and happier."
               "May be so."
               "How consoling, to reflect, in your old days, you had served God faithfully!"
               "It's useless to think of that now, alanna; I'm lost."
               "Lost! O, God forbid. Only forgive your enemies, and God will forgive you. Think
                  how he forgave the Jews who put him to death; think how he forgave Magdalen and
                  the penitent thief."
               "Child," said Else, with a smile that made Mary shudder,—it expressed so plainly
                  the depth of her despair; "child, you speak only of sinners, but I'm a devil."
               "No, no, don't smile and speak to me so; you are not, you are not," cried Mary,
                  clinging to her old nurse's neck; "you never could love as you loved me, and be so
                  wicked. O, never speak those awful words again, Else; they terrify me. No, no, you
                  are not so wicked. You are not lost; the friend of the poor orphan can never be
                  lost."
               As Mary was yet speaking, a knock came, and Roger O'Shaughnessy presented himself
                  at the door. He had been engaged, it would seem, burnishing up the old silver
                  salver, for he held the precious relic under his arm, and had pushed the chamois
                  leather, with which he had been rubbing it, into the breast pocket of his old
                  bottle-green coat.
               "What now, Roger? Has Mr. Lee returned?"
               "Not yet, plaze your ladyship," replied Roger, bowing respectfully. "O, it's only
                  Else Curley," he added, correcting himself; "I thought you had company. No, he's
                  not come back yet; and I wish he was, for there's strangers approachin, and not as
                  much as a bit or a sup in the house fit to offer them. I wish to goodness they'd
                  stay at home. I declare I don't know what they want down here, the half o'
                  them."
               
               "Never mind, Roger; receive them at the door, and show them in."
               "Indeed, then, I won't, plaze yer ladyship," replied Roger; "they'll have to find
                  the way themselves; and if they're any of the master's acquaintances, you know,
                  they'll not expect any thing, 'hem! if you only hint, ahem! that the butler's not
                  at home."
               "Very well, Roger; do as you please."
               "And now," said Mary, turning to Else, "you promise to tell these beads to-night
                  under the invocation of the Blessed Virgin. Do you promise?"
               "Ay, ay, ay, I'll say them to plaze ye," replied Else; "but it's of little valie
                  they'll be, for I haven't bent a knee to God since afore you were born."
               "No matter. God is merciful. He has converted worse hearts than yours. Offer your
                  prayers to-night, Else, and who knows but the old rosary, once so familiar to your
                  touch, with God's good grace, may awaken those better and nobler feelings which so
                  long have lain dormant in your heart."
               "God be with ye, child," said Else, tenderly kissing the forehead of the gentle
                  girl. "God be with you, asthore. I tould ye my intintion, that ye'd
                  know what happened me, if the worst comes to the worst."
               "I have no fear of that, dear nurse; there's still a bright spot in your soul to
                  redeem it from the sins that cloud it, were they as numerous as the sands of
                  Araheera. Go, and remember your promise."
               "Ay, ay, I'll remimber it;" and so saying, the old solitary of Benraven wrapped
                  her gray cloak about her shoulders, and passed from the room.
               After paying a visit to the little cabin boy, and finding him still asleep, but
                  apparently much easier, Mary approached a window that looked out upon the iron
                  bridge, and the narrow road leading to the village of Araheera. She expected to
                  see the strangers, whom Roger had announced, coming down the hill; but they had
                  already passed the gate, and entered the lighthouse yard. Else Curley's tall form
                  was the only object she could see, hurrying back to the cairn, accompanied by
                  Nannie, who had waited for her, as usual, outside, and now went bleating and
                  trotting after her.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               
                  Lanty takes the Loan of Miss Hardwrinkle, and carries her off on a
                     Pillion.—Else feels certain she has discovered a Clew to the Mystery.
               
               WHEN Else reached the Cairn, she was somewhat surprised to find the door of her
                  cabin forced open, and the scanty furniture it contained tossed here and there, as
                  if somebody had been searching the house. Lighting a rush candle without further
                  delay, and inserting it in the wooden candlestick attached to her spinning wheel,
                  she threw off her gray cloak, and took a hasty survey of the room. Her first
                  glance was at the hearthstone under which Randall Barry had so mysteriously
                  disappeared, when Nannie's bleat announced the presence of Hardwrinkle's
                  detectives; the second, at the cupboard, concealed in the thickness of the wall,
                  from which she furnished the widgeon and wine to her young friend before setting
                  out on his perilous journey to Arranmore. Both, however, had escaped discovery; at
                  least, there was no visible mark of their having been suspected or examined.
                  Satisfied, apparently, with these observations, Else drew over her creepie-stool,
                  and sat down to build a fire for the night. Hardly had she touched the tongs,
                  however, for that purpose, when a piece of closely folded paper fell from them on
                  the ashes.
               
               "Humph!" ejaculated the old woman, picking it up; "what can this be? From Lanty,
                  I'll warrint; it's like his contrivin, to put it in the joint o' the tongs;" and
                  hitching over the creepie nearer to the wheel, she brought the piece of crumpled
                  paper close to the dim light, and read as follows:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "Och, thin, sweet, bad luck to ye, my ould darlint; isn't this the
                              purty pickle ye got me into? The hole country's out afther me, and
                              here I am waitin for ye this half hour, with Miss Hardwrinkle sighin
                              and sobbin on the pillion at yer doore. Upon my conscience it's hung
                              ye ought to be, to thrate me this way afther all the promises ye made
                              to stay at home. But naboklish, I'll be even with ye
                              yit, Else, if I only live to get over the amplush I'm in. Of coorse
                              I'm expectin to be shot every other minit, for the polis is afther me
                              in all direcshins. As for the damsel herself, O hierna!
                              mortial ears niver heerd the bate of her. Her schreechin brought out
                              ivery livin soul atween here and Ballymagahey. She'd listen naither to
                              rime or raison. I tried to soother her, but ye might as well try to
                              soother a weazel. Bad scran to the haporth, she did but squeel and
                              spit at me all the time. Thin I tried to raison with her. I tould her
                              I hadn't the laste bad intintion in life, it bein only the loan of her
                              I was takin in a dacent way, till a friend of mine got over his
                              throuble. That made her worse. She wudn't even stop to listen to me.
                              Bad luck to me, Else, if iver I met so onraisonable a female since the
                              hour I was born. Atween scripthur and schreechin, she has nearly
                              driven me out of my senses. Hould! whisht! there, by all that's bad,
                              she's at it again as hard as ivir. O, Heaven forgive ye, Else Curley,
                              for the throuble I'm in on your account this blissed day. But I can't
                              stay another minit. I'm off again over the mountain; and remimber if
                              any thing happens me, ye'll find her ladyship at Molshin Kelly's of
                              Carlinmore. No more at present, but remain your obedient,
                           
                              LANTY HANLON.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "Note bene. As ye valie yer life, keep close to Mary."
               "Hegh!" ejaculated Else, throwing the paper on the ashes again. "Hegh! but I'm
                  sorry I didn't get a hoult of ye, ye spawn of the sarpint. Hah, I'd tache ye a
                  lesson ye'd remimber till the clay covered ye. Little ye thought who was watchin
                  ye this mornin, when ye went to Ballymagahey with yer tracts. Little ye thought
                  who the ould woman was that passed for the widow with the three twins—the poor,
                  desarted crathur, that's dyin with the curse of herself and her dead husband on
                  yer back. Hah! hah! Randall Barry, ye'll not have so many constables to guard ye
                  the morrow, while such a high-bred dame as Rebecca Hardwrinkle's to be sought and
                  found. Ay, Robert, ye'll want more peelers than ye can spare, to guard your
                  prisoner, or I'm far out of my reckonin. Devil as ye are, ye have yer match for
                  wunst. And now do yer best, ye black-hearted villain; do yer best, and niver fear,
                  ivery time you play the Knave I'll strike with the Five-fingers."
               Else was here interrupted in her soliloquy by the approach of footsteps, and
                  turning on her creepie, seemed somewhat surprised to see the tall but stooping
                  form of Roger O'Shaughnessy entering the cabin.
               "Humph! what now?" she demanded; "any thing wrong at the lighthouse, that yer here
                  so soon?"
               "No, nothin to speak off;" replied Roger, familiarly taking a seat, and stroking
                  down the few gray hairs that remained, with the palms of his hands. "No, nothing
                  in particular. Only the constables are there after Mr. Lee," responded Roger.
               "Humph! so they're come at last, are they?"
               "And so," continued Roger, "I thought, as they cudn't do much harm in the master's
                  absence, I'd step up at my leisure to Mr. Guirkie's, and see if he'd buy this
                  picthur. If it brings only a couple of pounds atself you know, we might lay in a
                  dozen or two of chape wine—Cape Madeira or so, to keep up the credit of the
                  place."
               As the old man spoke, he drew from beneath his coat a small oil painting, and laid
                  it on the table beside him.
               
               "What is this?" exclaimed Else, looking at it for a moment. "Roger, it's her
                  mother's portrait. You shan't sell it."
               "I know; but, ahem! it's only a copy."
               "Copy or not, ye can't sell it."
               "We can't starve, either," said Roger, apologetically.
               "Starve!"
               "Of course, when there's nothing left."
               "Hoot! nonsense! yer always complainin."
               "Bedad, then, may be I've raison enough to complain, when the bacon's all gone,
                  and not as much as the smell of wine or whiskey within the walls of the house.
                  It's aisy for you to talk, Else; but if ye had the credit o' the family to
                  maintain, and nothin to maintain it with."
               "Yer not so bad off as that, Roger, altogether, eh? Have ye nothin at all left
                  after the bacon?"
               "Nothin to speak of. There's some chickens, to be sure, but——"
               "Some chickens. Is there no sheep?"
               "Ahem! sheep; well, ay, three weeny wethers, but there's not a bit on their bones.
                  Surely three poor, weakly wethers is a small dependence through the long winter.
                  As for the bits o' picthurs, the poor child could do nothing at them since that
                  weary cabin boy came; and, in troth, it went hard enough on me, Else, to see the
                  young creature workin away, from mornin till night, unbeknown to her uncle, tryin
                  to earn with her brush what'd buy little necessaries for the house, when she ought
                  to be roulin in her coach, with her footman behind her. Och hoch! Else, it's a
                  poor day whin I'm driven to make lyin excuses to sich gentry as the Johnsons and
                  Whatelys, in regard to the house. God be good to us, it's little I thought, forty
                  years ago, when I ust to announce Lady Lambton, and Lord Hammersly, and Marquis
                  ——"
               "Stop, Roger Shaughnessy—stop yer claverin," interrupted Else, lighting her pipe;
                  "yer niver done braggin about yer lords and ladies."
               "Ahem! braggin—bedad, it's no braggin, Else, but the truth, and not the whole o'
                  that same aither, let me tell ye. Ahem! may be, when I ust to get seventeen pipes
                  o' the best wine——"
               "Hoot! hould yer tongue. Here, take a draw o' this till I scrape up some supper. I
                  have a journey afore me, and I can't delay a minute longer."
               "Well, ye may think as ye plaze, Else," said Roger, taking the pipe from his
                  venerable companion, "but they're changed times with us any way, when them that
                  wanst thought a castle too small to resaive their company must now starve in a
                  dissolit lighthouse. Ochone! ochone! the good ould times, when we ust to think
                  nothin of fifty coaches of an evenin, drivin into the court-yard."
               "Hoot! man, make it a hundher at wunst," said Else; "what signifies a score or
                  two, in or over?"
               "Well, may I niver do harm, Else——"
               "Whist, bedhahusht, I say, I'm in no humor now to listen to such
                  foolery. I ought to be on the road by this time;" and advancing to the cupboard,
                  she drew down an oaten bannock from a shelf, and breaking it into several pieces,
                  consigned it to her pocket. Then bringing the silver-mounted pistol she was in the
                  habit of carrying on her journeys, close to the light, she examined the priming,
                  and finding it satisfactory, thrust it into her bosom. "There," she ejaculated,
                  "yer aisy carried any way; and who knows but ye may be of sarvice afore Randall
                  Barry gets clear of his blood-hounds?"
               "Where are ye bound for, Else," inquired Roger, "with that waipon about ye?"
               "That's my business."
               "Yer not bent on murdher, I hope."
               "Not if I can help it."
               "Bedad, then," said Roger, "I wudn't trust ye if ye got into one of her tantrums.
                  Ahem! yer a dangerous woman, Else, when yer vexed, or, as the ould sayin is, yer a
                     good friend, but a bad inimy. But,
                  Else, cudn't ye lend us a thrifle o' that money ye got from the Yankee? Ahem! I'd
                  pay it back at the end o' the quarter."
               "Not a farthin, Roger. I'm keepin that for another purpose."
               "Well, it's not much I'm askin," said Roger; "only just the price of a dozen o'
                  wine, and a cheese or two, for the credit o' the house."
               "Let the house take care of itself," responded Else, throwing the gray cloak again
                  upon her emaciated shoulders. "I'll have good use for the money afore long, Roger.
                  As to buy cheese with it, or wine aither, I'm afeerd it'd be more likely to buy a
                  rope to hang me for passin it. Ay, ay, Roger, ye'll hear news about that money
                  yet, or I'm greatly mistaken."
               "Ahem! yer in a mighty hurry, Else; wait till I get the picthur under my coat.
                  Ahem! as for a dhrop of any thing, I suppose it's not convanient."
               "Humph! a dhrop of any thing. I thought it'd come to that at last;" and again
                  opening the cupboard, she drew forth a bottle, and held it for an instant between
                  her and the light. "Ay, there's some left," she added, laying it on the table.
                  "Drink it, and let me go."
               Roger raised the bottle also, and seeing it nearly full, laid it down again.
                  "Ahem! ahem!" said he, stroking down his long gray hairs, and looking wistfully at
                  his companion. "Ahem! it's a liberty I take, Else, but if ye have no objection,
                  I'll carry it home with me."
               "Carry it home?"
               "Yes. Ahem! Captain Petersham and the Johnsons 'll be down to-morrow, and there's
                  not a dhrop to offer them."
               "Take it, then—take it, and away with ye. I ought to be in Crohan by this
                  time."
               "Ye might had company," observed Roger, carefully corking the bottle and dropping
                  it into his capacious pocket. "Ye might had company if ye only left sooner."
               "I want none; the dark night's all the company I seek."
               "Well, that blackamore came down with a constable, just afore I left the
                  lighthouse, and took away the boy."
               "What, took the boy away in the state he's in?"
               "Troth did they, and without as much as sayin by yer lave atself. The constable
                  had a writ with him signed by Mr. Hardwrinkle."
               "Hah, the villain," exclaimed Else; "that's more of his plottin. Was the boy
                  willin to go?"
               "Willin—ye might well say that. The minute he saw the blackamore, he all but
                  jumped out o' bed with joy, and the poor blackamore himself kissed and hugged the
                  little fellow till I thought he'd niver let him go. Bedad, I niver thought them
                  naigers had so much good nature in them afore."
               "And so he had a writ from Robert Hardwrinkle," muttered Else, reflectively. "Ay,
                  ay, that was the Yankee's doings, I suspect. Humph, I'm beginnin to think, from
                  what Mrs. Motherly tould me about the nigger, when he first got a glimpse of
                  Weeks, they must be ould acquaintances, and may be he thought the boy'd tell tales
                  when he recovered his senses. Hah, hah, Robert! I'm on yer track again. So the
                  boy's gone."
               "Ay, is he; and mighty well plazed I am at that same, in regard to Miss Mary, for
                  the crathur cudn't do a hand's turn while he staid—but hould," said Roger,
                  suddenly checking himself, "hould; I'll wager what ye plaze he tuck the rosary
                  with him."
               "What rosary?" demanded Else.
               "Why, Mary's mother's—Mrs. Talbot's; and I declare I niver thought of it till this
                  minute."
               "The one with the jewels?"
               "Ay. She forgot all about it, I suppose."
               "Forgot what?"
               "That she lent it to him."
               "She never lent it; she hadn't it to lend since the day the Yankee first came to the lighthouse. She
                  mislaid it somewhere that day, and niver could find hilt or hare of it since.
                  Hoot! ye're dhramin, Roger."
               "Dramin—bedad, then, it was a mighty quare drame, when I saw it with my own eyes,
                  and handled it with my own fingers."
               "Her mother's rosary?"
               "To be sure. How could I mistake it? Didn't I see it a hundred times, when
                  we—ahem! when we lived at the castle? Bedad, Else, it's not a thing to be aisy
                  mistaken about, for there's not the like of it in the whole world, but one, and
                  that same's many a thousand mile from here—if it's in bein at all."
               "Ye mane Mr. Talbot's?"
               "Of coorse. They were both as like as two eggs, and presents from the Duchess of
                  Orleans to Edward's father and mother, when they went to France long ago."
               "Ay," said Else, resuming her seat, and looking up sharply in Roger's face, as if
                  she feared his mind was wandering,—"ay, 'as like as two eggs.' And where did the
                  boy keep the rosary? for it's strange I never could see it about him, though with
                  him late and early."
               "Well, ahem!" said Roger, "I must tell ye that, Else, since ye ask me. Ahem! one
                  day last week, as Lanty was going to Rosnakill, I wanted him to bring me a bottle
                  o' wine; for feen a dhrop was in the house, and we expected company that evenin.
                  Well, it happened Mr. Lee had no money convanient; and naither had Lanty himself,
                  nor Mary; and I didn't know what in the world to do in the amplush I was in, for
                  as luck 'd have it, the brandy was out as well as the wine, and not a taste of any
                  thing in the house but a thrifle o' whiskey in the bottom o' the decanter. So,
                  thinks I to myself, since I can do no better, I'll, ahem! I'll try—may be the
                  cabin boy might happen to have some change in his pockets, and I'll borrow it till
                  he gets well."
               "So ye searched his pockets?"
               "I did," replied Roger; "ahem! It wasn't right, I suppose; but seein the pinch I
                  was in, I couldn't very well help it."
               "And found the rosary?"
               "Yes; sewed in the linins of his waistcoat pocket. I thought first from the hard
                  feel it might be gold pieces, and I ripped it open."
               "Sewed in the linins of his waistcoat?" repeated Else, pronouncing the words
                  slowly, and gazing vacantly at her companion as she spoke.
               "Ay, she sewed it in herself, I suppose; thinkin the blissed crucifix might help
                  him in his sickness."
               "Roger Shaughnessy," said the old woman, suddenly rising, after a long pause,
                  during which she kept her eyes unconsciously fixed on him,—"Roger Shaughnessy, can
                  you swear on the holy evangelist, you seen that rosary in the boy's
                  possession?"
               "Swear! Of coorse I can. Why, is there any thing strange in that? Ye seem to be
                  all of a flutther about it."
               "No matter—I have my own manin for it. Now go you back to the lighthouse, and stay
                  with Mary; she's all alone, and needs yer company. I must hurry as fast as I can
                  to Castle Gregory, and then back to Crohan."
               "The Lord be about us!" exclaimed Roger, as he stood looking at the receding form
                  of the old woman descending the hill. "What does she mane now? There, she's off to
                  Castle Gregory this hour of the night, and thinks no more of it than a girl would
                  of sixteen. Ahem!" he added, buttoning his coat over the picture, and moving off
                  towards the lighthouse; "she's a wondherful woman."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               
                  Uncle Jerry and Mrs. Motherly quarrel, and the Captain suggests a Means of
                     Reconciliation.
               
               "UPON my word, it's very strange," said Mr. Guirkie to Father Brennan, as the
                  latter entered the breakfast parlor at Greenmount to make his usual morning visit;
                  "I declare it is exceedingly strange."
               "What's the matter now? any thing new since last night?" inquired the priest.
               "No; but that abduction of Miss Hardwrinkle—Mrs. Motherly has just returned from
                  the post office, and says there are no tidings of her yet. What in the world could
                  the fellow mean by carrying her off?"
               "You'll soon find that out, I suspect. Lanty seldom plays a trick without an
                  object."
               "You think Lanty's the man, then, without doubt?"
               "Certainly—no other would attempt it;" and the priest picked up a newspaper, and
                  familiarly took a seat at the window.
               "Why, God bless me, if Robert Hardwrinkle gets hold of the unfortunate fellow,
                  he'll transport him," said Uncle Jerry, pacing the room uneasily, and bobbing the
                  tail of his morning gown up and down as usual. "He certainly will transport
                  him—eh?"
               "Never mind. Lanty can take care of himself. With all his recklessness he manages
                  to keep clear of the hangman. Ten chances to one, if caught with the lady in his
                  custody, he would make it appear he was only taking her home."
               "Just so. I wouldn't doubt it in the least," assented Uncle Jerry; "the fellow's
                  capable of doing any thing. In fact he has imposed on myself a hundred times. No
                  later than last week the rogue sold me hare's ear and crottle, not worth a brass
                  farthing——"
               "Ha, ha!" laughed the priest, "you're beginning to find him out at last."
               "Well, but after all, the villain has something in him one can't help liking. He's
                  full of tricks, to be sure, but still he's honest in his own way. I wish to Heaven
                  he was out of the county for a while, at all events; for if he stay here that
                  serpent will destroy him."
               "Who? Robert Hardwrinkle?"
               "Yes; he'll follow him like a blood-hound. But, by the by, I had almost forgotten.
                  What of your young friend Barry? Will he be committed?"
               "I fear it. Captain Petersham says he can't help committing him. The case is so
                  clear there's no possibility of getting over it."
               "Poor fellow! I'm sorry for him, and I'm very sorry on Mary Lee's account. Can
                  nothing be done to save him—eh?"
               "Nothing—the sergeant of police here—Mullen, who is really a very honest, decent
                  fellow—says he must identify him."
               "They say he's a fine young man, this Barry."
               "Very much so, indeed. He's as handsome and high-minded a lad as ye could meet
                  with any where. But like all young men in love, he is very imprudent. So much so
                  indeed, that I often think he must have been crazy to act as he has. The idea of
                  his running the gantlet through all the constables and spies between here and
                  Cork, with a reward of five hundred pounds for his head, merely to see a foolish
                  young girl, is so provoking to all who feel an interest in his welfare, that
                  ——"
               "Hush, hush! Father John! nonsense! say no more about that. Love's a thing you're
                  not competent to speak of, you know. It's out of your line altogether. So far from
                     thinking ing the less of him for his
                  imprudence, I think the more of him. But apropos of the Lees," he added, throwing
                  up his spectacles and halting before the priest; "have you found out who they are,
                  or what they are?"
               "No, sir; so far as regards their family connections, I know no more about them
                  than you know yourself."
               "I declare! It's very strange. I can find no one to give me the least information
                  respecting the family. I tried once to draw something from Kate Petersham, she's
                  so intimate there; but the young baggage was as close as an oyster. As for Roger,
                  I darn't venture to approach the subject, lest he take alarm; and then he would
                  never come to sell me a picture again. But have you no conception of what the
                  mystery is? It can't be murder, I suppose."
               "O, no! nothing of that nature. It means, I suppose, that Mr. Lee got embarrassed
                  in his money affairs, and left home for a time to avoid his creditors—that's all,
                  I suspect."
               "Poor fellow," said Uncle Jerry; "it's a pity of him."
               "It is indeed a great pity; for he's an honorable, generous hearted man as I've
                  met in many a year."
               "God comfort him," ejaculated Uncle Jerry again, twirling his thumbs as he looked
                  through the window. "O, dear! O, dear—what a poor sight, to see a high-minded,
                  well-bred gentleman like him reduced so low—so low as to trim oil lamps for a
                  living!"
               "It's hard."
               "Hard! Why, only think of it. Here am I, a miserable, good-for-nothing old
                  imbecile, without kith or kin in the world, and yet plenty of money in my purse,
                  and a comfortable house to live in, whilst down there in the black binns of
                  Araheera there's a gentleman of birth and education, with an angel of a child to
                  take care of, and not a shilling in his pocket to buy the common necessaries of
                  life. I declare it's awful."
               "The ways of God are wonderful."
               "Wonderful? I tell you what, Father Brennan, one must be well fortified by
                  religion to bear up against it. A beautiful girl like Mary Lee, pining away in
                  poverty and solitude, working, working, night and day, night and day, at her easel
                  to earn a morsel of bread, and I a worn-out old fellow, doing nothing, nay,
                  occupying some useful body's place in the world, when I should have been kicked
                  out of it long ago. Why, sir, it's outrageous to think of it. It's actually
                  outrageous."
               "Stop, stop—take care, Mr. Guirkie," said the priest, "you talk too fast."
               "Sir, it would provoke any man. I say if Aristotle were a saint, it would provoke
                  him;" and Uncle Jerry rose and pushed back the chair violently.
               "But this is taking God Almighty to task, Mr. Guirkie. You should remember he
                  orders every thing for the best, and that inscrutable are his judgments, and
                  unsearchable his ways."
               "I know that. I know God is good, and I know all that seems strange to us now will
                  be fully explained hereafter, of course. Why, if I didn't believe that, I wouldn't
                  put up with it half the time."
               "Ha, ha!" laughed the priest—"put up with it? You haven't much to put up with, I
                  should think?"
               "No matter for that; I have my own feelings, and you know very well, Father
                  John——" Here Mr. Guirkie was interrupted by the entrance of Mrs. Motherly.
               "Humph! may I beg to know, ma'am," said he, turning half round and looking angrily
                  at his respectable housekeeper,—"may I beg to know why we are interrupted?"
               "It's no offence, I hope, to come with a message," said Mrs. Motherly,
                  deprecatingly. "I niver thought it was."
               "Didn't you? It's no matter what you thought."
               "Don't be unkind to the good woman," said Father John, who understood Mr. Guirkie
                  well, and knew all his little
                  weaknesses respecting Mrs. Motherly. "Don't be unkind to her, Mr. Guirkie. She is
                  a very excellent woman, is Mrs. Motherly."
               "Humph—good enough, if she only knew her place. But I protest against her
                  inveterate habit of interrupting me when I have company. I shan't tolerate it,
                  sir, any longer."
               "Just listen to that, Father John, when he knows in his heart and soul it's his
                  own story he's tellin."
               "My own story, woman?"
               "Yes, sir; jest yer own story. For ye niver have company in the house but ye
                  thrate me this way. There's no livin with ye, when there's any body to the
                  fore."
               "And how is it when he's alone?"
               "He's as quiet as a lamb, your reverence."
               "It's false," said Mr. Guirkie; "I say it's false."
               "False! O, the Lord pardon ye, sir, the Lord pardon ye, for beliein yerself; for
                  I'd take it to my death, Father Brennan, there's not a quieter nor a kinder man
                  livin, when he's by himself."
               "Indeed!" said the priest, emphasizing the word, and looking significantly at Mr.
                  Guirkie. "Ho! ho! that's the way of it!"
               "Pray what do you mean, Mr. Brennan?" demanded Uncle Jerry.
               "O, nothing, nothing particular. I was merely thinking of what Captain Petersham
                  says of you and Mrs. Motherly."
               "Of me and Mrs. Motherly?" repeated Uncle Jerry.
               "Of me and Mr. Guirkie?" echoed Mrs. Motherly. "What could he say of me, yer
                  reverence? I defy him to say any thing of me but what's dacent."
               "Of course you do, Mrs. Motherly. You have always been, since you came to reside
                  in my parish, an honest, respectable woman. Captain Petersham, when he spoke of
                  you and Mr. Guirkie, never pretended to insinuate——"
               "O, I dar him to it," exclaimed the good woman; "I dar him to it; and he'll be
                  here face to face afore many minutes, for the message I came with was from his
                  groom that he'd call here on his return from the barracks. I'll dar him to say any
                  thing against my karacter. Och, och, it'd be a poor day with me to hear my name
                  now in the mouth of the people, after livin fourteen long years a widow, without
                  man or mortal ever presuming to throw dirt at my door. Hierna! the
                  Lord be about us—to spake of Mr. Guirkie and me in the same breath!"
               "My good woman," said the priest, rising from his chair and approaching her, "you
                  take this quite too seriously."
               "Well, listen to me, yer reverence, for a minute."
               "No, no, not now—some other time—it's all a joke, you know."
               "Joke! but I'll let neither man or woman joke with my karacter, Father Brennan.
                  I'll not lie under it, sir. Mr. Guirkie's a good man, sir, and a dacent man, and
                  has the good will of rich and poor; but may I niver cross that flure again, if he
                  had the vartues of all the saints in the collinder, and all the gold in the Bank
                  of England to boot, if I'd ever as much as think of him, barrin as I ought to do,
                  and as it becomes my place to do. I know he's kind to me, sir, and very kind to
                  me——"
               "Quit the room, ma'am," commanded Uncle Jerry; "quit the room instantly;" and
                  snatching the spectacles from his face, he motioned with them to the door. "Kind
                  to you, indeed! I command you to quit the room."
               "And yer house, too," replied Mrs. Motherly, raising her apron to her eyes. "O,
                  dear, O, dear! isn't it a poor thing that an ould woman like me can't button her
                  master's leggins, or tie his cravat, but he'll suspect her of thinking of what she
                  never dreamt of?"
               "I suspect you!"
               "Ay, just you, Mr. Guirkie; for I believe in my heart no one else could ever make
                  up such a story. I don't deny that I
                  liked ye for a master in spite of all yer odd ways, and that I tried to take care
                  of you, when I seen ye couldn't take care of yourself; but it's little I thought
                  ye'd conster my kindness in the way ye did."
               "Listen," said Uncle Jerry, running his hands under his skirts, and bending
                  towards his housekeeper; "may I beg to be informed whether I am master in this
                  house; and if so, why you don't quit the room when I command you."
               "As for this cruel thratement, after so many years slavin and workin for ye, night
                  and day," continued the weeping widow, without paying the least attention to her
                  master's request, "I forgive ye for it. I do, indeed, forgive ye from my heart and
                  soul."
               "You're resolved, then, not to quit the room; eh, have you actually made up your
                  mind not to leave?"
               "Och, hoch! ye'd be dead in yer grave many a year ago, Mr. Guirkie, only for the
                  way I watched ye; for, yer reverence, ye know yourself, the poor man has no more
                  wit nor a child——"
               "Humph! I see you won't go, Mrs. Motherly. Very well, then," said
                  Uncle Jerry; "I shall. Let me pass."
               As he rushed through the entrance hall, his slippers clattering against his heels,
                  and his spectacles swinging from his fingers, the hall door opened, and Captain
                  Petersham entered whip in hand.
               "Soh, ho! what now?"
               "Good morning, sir," responded Uncle Jerry, bowing stiffly.
               "You're excited, Mr. Guirkie, eh? What's the matter?"
               "Excited! can't I get excited in my own house, if I please, Captain Petersham,
                  without being obliged to account for it?"
               "Undoubtedly, sir, most undoubtedly. Why not?"
               "That is," said Uncle Jerry, correcting himself, "that is, if I'm
                     master of the house; but it seems I am not. My housekeeper, Mrs.
                  Motherly, there, is master;" and he glanced back at the parlor door.
               "Ho, ho! it's only a lovers' quarrel, then. Come, come, Mr. Guirkie, you musn't
                  get angry with Mrs. Motherly; if the good woman grows jealous of you now and then,
                  you must try to conciliate her, you know, the best way you can."
               "Captain Petersham, your language is offensive," said Uncle Jerry, "and I shan't
                  put up with it any longer."
               "And, Captain Petersham, you must clear my karacter this very minute," sobbed Mrs.
                  Motherly, coming up from the parlor with her apron to her eyes, followed by Father
                  John. "I'm a lone woman, sir, and have nothing but my karacter to depend on."
               "By the Lord Harry," exclaimed the captain, looking from one to the other, "here's
                  a pretty piece of work. Ho, ho! and Father Brennan, too. By George, sir, you're
                  the very man. You can settle the whole affair in a jiffy."
               "How so?"
               "Why, marry them at once, sir. Marry them instantly. Nothing else will ever put a
                  stop to their love quarrels."
               Mr. Guirkie, on hearing this, could contain himself no longer. "Captain
                  Petersham," he cried, "I shall not ask you to quit my house, for nobody ever did
                  quit it yet at my request, and nobody ever will, I suppose; but, sir, I'll leave
                  you and your friends to occupy the premises. For my part, I leave this
                  neighborhood to-morrow, and seek for some place where I can live in peace."
               "Mr. Guirkie, are you mad?" said Father John, stopping him as he turned the handle
                  of the hall door.
               "Gentlemen, dear, don't let him go out without his cap," said Mrs. Motherly; "and
                  them slippers of his, sure they're no betther than brown paper—he'll ketch his
                  death of cold. O, hierna! hierna!"
               "Mr. Brennan, am I to consider myself a prisoner in my own house?" demanded Mr.
                  Guirkie. "Say yes or no, sir, at once, and be done with it."
               As the priest was about to reply, the clatter of horses' feet was heard approaching, and next instant Kate
                  Petersham, mounted on "Moll Pitcher," came cantering into the courtyard, and
                  reining up at the door, jumped from the saddle.
               "Mr. Guirkie, a word with you," she said, taking his arm, and leading him back to
                  the parlor; "as for you, Father John, I must see you before the trial comes
                  on."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               
                  Mrs. Motherly, before quitting the House forever, wishes to leave some
                     Directions about her Master's Flannels.—Mr. Guirkie, in the mean time, sheds
                     Tears over the Portrait of Mary's Mother.—His first Love and his last.
               
               IT was now approaching noon—the hour at which the neighboring justices of the
                  peace usually assembled in the little court house at Tamney, to hold their petit
                  session once a fortnight. Already the courtyard was filled with men, women, and
                  boys, (a thing of very rare occurrence in that remote and peaceable district,)
                  eagerly talking in groups, here and there, about something in which they seemed to
                  take a more than ordinary share of interest. Two or three policemen, whom
                  Hardwrinkle had ordered from the next town, to take charge of the barrack in the
                  absence of its proper occupants, now in search of his sister among the glens of
                  Benraven, were pacing up and down before the grated windows, anxiously awaiting
                  the arrival of the magistrates. To judge from the smothered imprecations of some
                  among the crowd, and the more significant gesticulations of others, one might
                  easily suspect there was mischief brewing. Here and there a stalwart fellow might
                  be seen hitching up his pantaloons, and spitting on his shillaleh, as he clutched
                  it in his brawny hand; and now and then a boy would jump to a seat on the low
                  stone wall that enclosed the courtyard, with pockets well stuffed, and more than
                  usually heavy. The fear of the law, and the presence of the police, small as the
                  force was, had the natural effect of preventing, for the present, actual breach of
                  peace; but still it was easy to see that something serious was likely to take
                  place before the close of the proceedings. One individual in particular seemed
                  very busy amongst the crowd, apparently giving orders and directions. This was a
                  woman of tall stature, wearing a gray cloak, with the hood drawn over, but behind
                  which, notwithstanding its depth of shade, several white elf locks were plainly
                  visible. The reader will at once recognize in this personage our old acquaintance,
                  Else Curley, of the Cairn. Still erect and lithe as a sapling, though the snows of
                  eighty winters had passed over her head, she made her way through the throng of
                  men and women, with a step as firm as when she trod the battle field on the
                  heights of Madeira, forty years before. Nor had she lost entirely, either, that
                  imposing presence, which in her younger days must have stamped her as a remarkable
                  woman. Age, it is true, had furrowed her skin, and pinched her cheeks with its
                  iron fingers; but the bold forehead and the deep-set gray eye were there yet, to
                  tell of her resolute and indomitable will. As she turned from side to side to
                  deliver her commands, the women and boys fell back and gazed at her with fear, and
                  the strongest men there shrank from her touch, as they felt her hard, bony hand
                  upon their shoulders.
               Suddenly a horseman appeared in sight, cantering on from the direction of
                  Greenmount cottage; and instantly the cry rose that Captain Petersham was coming.
                  Then the crowd began to sway to and fro, the boys to jump from their seats on the
                  low wall, and the policemen to shoulder their muskets. But they were doomed to be
                  disappointed; for the horseman, on nearer approach, proved to be only one of the
                  captain's grooms, who, riding up to the gate, beckoned to a constable, and handing him a warrant, commanded
                  him, in his master's name, to execute it without delay.
               The man seemed to hesitate for a moment after reading the document.
               "The captain's orders are, that you proceed to Crohan House instantly," said the
                  groom, "and bring the boy into court."
               "Yes; but I don't feel at liberty to quit my post," replied the constable. "Our
                  force is small."
               "As you please," said the servant; "I have delivered my orders;" and wheeling
                  round, without further parley, he galloped back to Greenmount.
               "Well, Thomas," demanded the captain, meeting the groom at the door, "you handed
                  the warrant to one of the guard—has he gone to execute it?"
               "No, sir; he seems to have scruples about quitting his post."
               "Scruples! ho, ho! Is that the way of it? Scruples! Look here, sir; ride back, and
                  tell him for me, if he don't start within sixty seconds from the time you reach
                  him, I'll have him in irons ten minutes after. Begone now, and hurry back to
                  report."
               "The scoundrel!" he continued, plucking off his sea cap, and rubbing up his curly
                  hair, as the servant rode off; "the sneaking scoundrel! I'll thin off his
                  constables for him! By the Lord Harry, he'll not involve me in his villanies, if I
                  can help it. It's most atrocious. What! send a fine, gallant young fellow like
                  that to the hulks or the gallows, because he loves his country more than his king?
                  I'll be hanged if I do it, so long as I can throw an obstacle in the way."
               "Captain," said a voice behind him, "if it's plazin' to yer honor——"
               "Hilloa! who's here? What! Mrs. Motherly—and still in tears? Come, come, go to
                  your room, woman, and get reconciled. Away! You're as great a fool as your
                  master!"
               "Indeed, then, that's the truest word ye said yet, captain; for if I wasn't a
                  greater fool, I wouldn't stay with him. But there's an end to it now, any
                  way."
               "End to what?"
               "I'll leave him; that's all."
               "Nonsense!"
               "Indeed, then, I will, sir; I'll niver sleep another night in this house. My
                  heart's been a-breakin with him every day these five years, but it's broken now,
                  out and out. O, winastru, winastru! and this is the thanks I'm
                  gettin after workin and slavin for him early and late, night and mornin, every
                  hour since I first darkened his doors. But sure it's all past and gone now, any
                  way."
               "Hold your peace, woman, and go to your room instantly. Mr. Guirkie is too good
                  for you. Away, and thank God you have such a master."
               "O, it's little yer honor knows about him, captain. Ay, ay, it's little you know
                  about him, poor man. Och, hoch, dear, if ye lived in the same house with him as I
                  did these five long years! But no matter now, sure. God forgive him as I forgive
                  him; and that he may live long and die happy is all the harm I wish him. And now I
                  wash my hands of him forevermore. I'll never——"
               "Mrs. Motherly!"
               "O, it's no use, it's no use, captain. I can't stay, nor I won't stay. If ye went
                  down on yer bended knees to me, I'll never close an eye under his roof. And now
                  let him find one that'll tie his cravat, and button his leggings, and bathe his
                  feet, as faithfully and constantly as I did for these five long, weary years; and
                  if he does, then all I have to say is, let him forget there ever was born in this
                  world such a woman as Nancy Motherly."
               "Captain Petersham, have the goodness to step this way," said Father Brennan,
                  opening the parlor door, and interrupting the conversation, much to the captain's
                  relief.
               
               The disconsolate housekeeper entreated his honor to wait and listen to her, but
                  all in vain.
               "Why, how now," exclaimed the latter, throwing his portly person on the sofa, and
                  glancing round the room; "all alone, eh?—where have they gone—Kate and Mr.
                  Guirkie?"
               "Hush! don't speak so loud. They're all three inside there."
               "All three—who's the third?"
               "One you would never dream of seeing here—Roger O'Shaughnessy."
               "O, it's Roger, is it?"
               "Yes; the old man, it appears, came up this morning from the lighthouse to sell a
                  picture to Mr. Guirkie."
               "A picture?"
               "Mary, you know, has quite a taste for painting, and Roger's her salesman."
               "Poor thing!"
               "Only for that, the family had suffered long ago."
               "You astonish me; are they really so very destitute?"
               "So I'm informed. Indeed, from what I have seen and know myself, I believe they
                  must be reduced as low as they can be, and live."
               "God bless me!"
               "Why, I thought Kate had told you of it."
               "No. She said something, I remember, of their being poor, and all that, but never
                  hinted at any danger of their suffering. By the Lord Harry, sir, this can't be. It
                  shan't be. The thought of Mary Lee in distress actually frightens me."
               "And then, she's so patient and gentle," said Father John; "never seen but with a
                  smile on her face. Working at her easel through the long day, and often far into
                  the night, with old Drake sleeping by her side as she plies her brush—working,
                  working, without complaint or murmur, to earn the bare necessaries of life for her
                  beloved uncle, and that good old man who has followed them so faithfully, in their
                  fallen fortunes."
               "She's a delightful creature," exclaimed the captain. "I wish to the Lord she
                  could be induced to come and stay with Kate at Castle Gregory. I would be a
                  brother to her as long as she lived."
               "She never would consent to part with her uncle and old Roger."
               "Then, by the Lord Harry, let them all three come. Castle Gregory's large enough.
                  As for me, I suppose I must remain an old bachelor, since there's no help for it.
                  Lee's an honest, kind-hearted, generous fellow himself, as ever broke the world's
                  bread; and I should take it as a favor if he came and took up his quarters with me
                  at the old castle. By George, I must call down in the Water Hen to-morrow, and see
                  him about it."
               "Don't speak too fast, captain," said the priest. "Have a little patience. There's
                  a mystery now solving in that room, which may balk you, perhaps, of your generous
                  purpose."
               "Mystery!"
               "Yes. Shall I tell you what it is? or have you time to hear it? The court sits at
                  noon—does it not?"
               "Hang the court! Go on with the mystery."
               "Well, Roger has been selling pictures to our friend, Mr. Guirkie, it appears, for
                  the last six months or more, and, queer enough, never imagined for a moment the
                  purchaser had the least suspicion of the artist—having passed himself off as a
                  picture dealer from Derry; while, on the other hand, Mr. Guirkie was well aware of
                  the secret, and all the time kept buying her pieces, and indulging his good, kind
                  heart by paying double prices."
               "Ho, ho! I understand. Roger was unwilling to expose the poverty of the family,
                  and therefore went under an assumed name."
               "Precisely. Well, this morning, it seems, he started from the lighthouse to sell a picture, as usual. When he
                  reached here, he felt rather shy about coming in, lest he might happen to meet
                  somebody who had seen him before, and would recognize him. So, sitting down under
                  the window, to wait for an opportunity of seeing Mr. Guirkie alone, and feeling
                  somewhat fatigued, perhaps, after his long journey, he fell fast asleep. In that
                  position Mr. Guirkie discovered him, with the picture carefully concealed under
                  the breast of his coat, just as Kate entered the parlor. You heard the shriek he
                  gave when the portrait met his eye, I suppose."
               "Shriek—no, I heard no shriek. Portrait! why, what does that mean?"
               "It means that he recognized the likeness, and in so doing, almost lost his
                  senses. But wait, you shall hear. In the first place, it happened to be a copy
                  Mary had taken of her mother's portrait, which Roger carried off, either by
                  mistake, or because he could find no other ready."
               "Yes, very well—go on," said the captain, impatiently; "it don't matter
                  which."
               "And this very portrait now reveals the whole mystery."
               "The mystery! There, you're at it again. Mystery!—Good Heavens, sir, can't you
                  tell me what mystery you mean? Excuse me, Mr. Brennan; but you know how deeply
                  interested I feel in every thing that regards this girl—and then you're so
                  tedious."
               "Have patience a little longer and I'll explain," said the priest, smiling. "You
                  are already aware that Mr. Guirkie has been for the last five years in the habit
                  of visiting, once a week, the old churchyard of Rathmullen, and that nobody could
                  tell his reason or motive for so doing."
               "Certainly, every one in the parish knows that—well?"
               "And you remember to have heard Mr. Guirkie tell how he saw a young lady quitting
                  the churchyard several times, as he entered?"
               "Yes."
               "And that he thought, or fancied he thought, the figure of that lady strongly
                  resembled Mary Lee. Well, it now turns out, that our dear old friend and Mary have
                  been all along visiting the same grave."
               "Hah! the same grave!"
               "Yes, the grave of her—mother!"
               "You surprise me! her mother! Are not the Lees strangers here?"
               "Yes. But you recollect the circumstances of the wreck of the Saldana, and how the
                  body of a woman, wearing a gold crucifix on her neck, with the name of Harriet
                  Talbot engraved on the back, was cast ashore, and interred in Rathmullen
                  churchyard. That woman was Mary Lee's mother."
               "Good Heavens! Mary Lee's mother?"
               "Yes, sir, Mary's mother."
               "Humph! and so that accounts for those strange rumors we heard of the white lady
                  and gentleman, seen so often quitting the churchyard and sailing down the Swilly
                  on moonlit nights. But what business had Mr. Guirkie at her mother's grave,
                  eh?"
               "That's the secret," replied the priest.
               "The secret! confusion! to the—But no matter—no matter; have your own way, have
                  your own way. I shall ask no more questions. I suppose you'll tell it some
                  time—when it suits you. By George, sir, you're the most circum——"
               "Captain, dear," said Mrs. Motherly, opening the door gently and cutting the word
                  in two, "I want——"
               "Want! What the fury do you want?" thundered the provoked
                  captain.
               "Only one word, yer honor, afore I go. It's about the master's flannels. I'm
                  afeerd——"
               "Confound your master's flannels! To blazes with them; what have I to do with your
                  master's flannels?" he exclaimed furiously; "begone this instant!"
               
               "I'll not keep ye one minute, yer honor. I'm only afraid Mr. Guirkie'll ketch his
                  death o' cold."
               "Woman, quit the room!"
               "Away, away, Mrs. Motherly," said the priest, interposing good-naturedly, and
                  closing the door; "I shall become your intercessor with Mr. Guirkie as soon as
                  possible; but don't quit the house, by any means, till I see you again."
               "What now?" cried Kate, stepping from the little room in which she had been
                  closeted all this time with Mr. Guirkie, and laying her hand on the captain's
                  shoulder. "What now? Brother, how is this? out of temper, eh? What's the
                  matter?"
               "The mischief's the matter. Between Father Brennan's mystery, and Mrs. Motherly's
                  importunity, and those confounded constables, I'm almost crazy."
               "Well, well, brother Tom, you're so impatient, you know, and so impetuous. Hush,
                  now! not a word. Listen—I have something to tell you."
               "What?"
               "About Uncle Jerry."
               "Well, what of him? Has he had a fit? is he dying? is he dead?"
               "No, not exactly that—but, there's a—mystery—in it."
               "Mystery!—d—n the mystery!—there it's again! Mystery, well, if this isn't enough
                  to provoke—away! stand off! I'll be humbugged no longer. Let me pass—I must see
                  him instantly—away! begone!"
               "You shall not, captain," cried Kate, endeavoring to prevent him; "you shall
                  not."
               "By the Lord Harry, I shall, though."
               "Nay, nay—it's a very delicate affair, brother; and indeed he'll never forgive you
                  if you do—you know how bashful and sensitive he is."
               "Is he still insensible?" inquired Father John.
               "Quite so," responded Kate; "he has not moved a muscle since he saw the
                  picture."
               "Insensible!" repeated the captain; "then, Kate, be it delicate or indelicate,
                  I'll see my old friend, think what you please about it;" and freeing himself from
                  his sister's grasp, he advanced and opened the door of the adjoining room.
               The first object which met his view, was Mr. Guirkie himself, seated at a table on
                  which lay, what appeared to be, a framed picture some eight or ten inches square.
                  His forehead rested on his hands, and his eyes seemed riveted to the canvas.
                  Indeed, so absorbed was he, that the noise which the captain made in forcing open
                  the door seemed not to disturb him in the least. When Kate saw her brother gazing
                  so intently at Mr. Guirkie, she suddenly ceased speaking, and gently passing him
                  by, took her place behind Uncle Jerry's chair. All was silence now. Old Roger
                  stood leaning his back against the wall, looking down pensively on the floor;
                  Kate, like a guardian angel, took her stand by the side of her unconscious friend;
                  the priest laid his hands against the door casing and peeped in; and the
                  boisterous, burly captain, so noisy but a moment before, remained on the threshold
                  silent and motionless as a statue.
               "Look!" said the priest, whispering over the captain's shoulder, and pointing to
                  the picture.
               "What?"
               "Don't you see something drop—drop?—listen! You can almost hear them falling on
                  the canvas."
               "Tears?"
               "Yes."
               "God bless me! I don't like to see him weep. Shall I wake him up?"
               "No, no," said Kate; "let him weep on."
               "But, Kate, what portrait is that—eh?"
               "The likeness of a long-lost friend—Mary Lee's mother."
               "Long-lost friend—Mary Lee's mother?"
               "Yes; the only woman he ever loved. Old Roger, here, will tell you all about it,
                  some time when he has more leisure."
               
               "It's only now I could recognize him, your honor," said Roger, "though I seen him
                  many a time this twelvemonth past. Years, you know, make a great change in
                  us."
               "Kate, I must try to rouse him," said the captain; "I cannot bear to see those
                  tears falling there so silently on the canvas—it's very unpleasant."
               "Not yet—not yet," remonstrated Kate, motioning back the captain with her hand;
                  "let the faithful soul indulge his rapturous reverie. These are not tears of
                  anguish, brother, but of love. O, think of the love of that heart, after an
                  absence of twenty years. Surely, surely such love is not of earth, but of heaven:
                  so pure, so gentle, so enduring. A wanderer over the wide world, seeking solace
                  for a widowed heart, he returns to his native land, and after years of patient
                  search, discovers her lowly tomb at last among the ruins of Rathmullen Abbey. Week
                  after week, for six long years, has he visited that tomb. Every stain which the
                  mildew had left on the humble slab that bears her name he has obliterated, and
                  every letter the moss of years had filled up he has lovingly renewed. O, tell me
                  not, Father John," continued Kate, her cheeks flushed with the emotions of her
                  heart, "tell me not, that the pure, gentle, blessed love of the olden time has all
                  died out from the hearts of men. No, no, no—God is love, and God never dies.
                  Noble, generous, faithful heart!" cried the enraptured girl, bursting herself into
                  tears; and falling at Uncle Jerry's feet, she removed his hand from his forehead
                  and kissed it with enthusiastic affection. "O that I had but studied this book
                  more carefully! how much more I should have learned of the beautiful and the good.
                  How cold and insipid are all printed words, compared with the blessed teachings of
                  a heart like thine. Mary Lee, Mary Lee, angel or woman, whatever thou art, would
                  to God he could now look on thy seraphic face, and press thee——"
               "Mary Lee," repeated Mr. Guirkie, at last breaking silence and looking on the face
                  of the suppliant girl, while the tears still glistened on his own,—"Mary Lee! I
                  think I have heard the name before. Poor Mary Lee! Are you Mary Lee?"
               "No, no," replied Kate; "I am but a child of earth—your own poor, foolish, loving
                  Kate Petersham." As Kate spoke, she motioned to the beholders to quit the room,
                  for she dreaded the effect an exposure of his weakness before the bantering
                  captain might produce on a mind so sensitive as his; and fully appreciating the
                  delicacy of her fears, they withdrew silently from the apartment and closed the
                  door, before Mr. Guirkie's consciousness had completely returned. And, dear
                  reader, we must withdraw also, for the time of court-session is already past, and
                  Mr. Robert Hardwrinkle is anxiously looking from the court house door in the
                  direction of Greenmount, and wondering what can detain the chairman of the bench,
                  or why he should presume to keep a gentleman of his importance waiting so
                  long.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               
                  The Priest and Dr. Henshaw.—The Influence of Catholicity.—Its attractive and
                     repulsive Features.—The Priest's Garden and the old Tombstone.
               
               FATHER JOHN, having waited to see Mr. Guirkie completely restored to his usual
                  equanimity, and Captain Petersham in the saddle ready to set off for the court
                  house, took the near cut over the hill, and soon reached his humble home. On his
                  arrival, the servant handed him a letter, and informed him that several persons
                  had called, and among the rest Else Curley of the Cairn, who expressed great
                  anxiety to see him before the court opened. Mr. Hardwrinkle also had sent his man
                  in haste to say, that a riot was apprehended hended in the event of Barry's committal, and
                  requesting Father Brennan's presence to maintain order and assist the magistrates
                  in the discharge of their duty.
               "A very modest request, upon my word," said the priest, opening the letter, and
                  seating himself quietly in his easy chair to read it. "Very modest, indeed; but I
                  have a duty of my own to discharge at present."
               The letter ran as follows:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "MY REVEREND FRIEND: The blow I have so long been evading has fallen
                              at last. My creditors have discovered my retreat, and placed a writ
                              for my immediate arrest in the hands of the sheriff. I leave here
                              to-morrow, by daybreak, and cross over to Malin Head; but where, after
                              that, fate only must determine. What is to become of poor Mary, God
                              alone can tell. For the present, at least, you must be her protector,
                              for I know of no other to whose care I could entrust so precious a
                              charge. I should much rather, for my own part, go to jail and weather
                              out the storm as best I might; but the thought of my incarceration
                              would take the dear child's life. I must quit this place to-morrow,
                              too, without seeing her; for I never could summon courage enough to
                              bid her farewell. The furniture here will, of course, be sold for
                              debt. Save the old Bible and harpsichord, if you can. They are of
                              little value, to be sure, to anybody; but still they are links—alas!
                              the only links left us now—to connect us with the past. If you speak a
                              kind word to the captain about old Roger, I'm sure he won't let him
                              want. Be kind to Mary, and comfort the poor child in my absence.
                           "God bless you.
                           
                              "Yours, faithfully,
                              E. LEE."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "John!" cried the priest, as he read the letter—"John!"
               "Sir."
               "Take the horse and gig immediately, and drive as fast as possible to the
                  lighthouse. Give my compliments to Mr. Lee, say I received his note, and tell him
                  to come up without a moment's delay, and bring Miss Lee with him. You
                  understand?"
               "Yes, sir."
               "And see here—don't wait to feed the horse, but go at once."
               "No, sir."
               "Let Mr. Lee have the gig, since he has no conveyance of his own, and you can
                  return on foot at your leisure."
               "Certainly, sir."
               When the servant closed the door, the priest leaned back in his chair and composed
                  himself to read vespers. And a snug, pleasant little room it was, that parlor of
                  Father John's, to read or pray in, with its latticed windows looking down on the
                  placid face of the beautiful Mulroy, now sleeping calmly in the bosom of the
                  hills. Close by the side of the humble edifice grew a long line of gooseberry and
                  currant bushes, and up from between them, here and there, the honeysuckle
                  stretched its long neck into the open windows. Out before the door stood an old
                  elm tree, majestic and lonely in the centre of the grass plot, spreading its giant
                  branches far and wide over house and garden. Many a name was carved on that sturdy
                  old trunk in its day, and many a time the priest and his good old reverend uncle
                  sat on the stone bench together, and leaned back against it in the summer
                  evenings, to say the rosary and tell the beads. And there, too, round about grew
                  many a flower of native growth, fresh and fair, simple and modest, like the virgin
                  whose altar they were intended to decorate—the mountain daisy, white as snow; the
                  primrose, its faithful companion, at its side; the cowslip, with the dew always on
                  its face; and the lily of the valley, hiding its head in the grass, as if it had
                  no right to occupy a place in the world at all. These and such as these were the
                  only tenants of that modest garden. O, well we remember it—that garden where none but wild flowers grew—those
                  pretty wild flowers, nature's own spontaneous offering. And every morning would
                  the priest pluck a bunch to scatter on the shrine of the virgin, as he ascended
                  her altar to say the holy mass, knowing well she loved them best; for it was such
                  as these Joseph used to gather for her, long ago, by the wayside, when his work of
                  the day was done.
               Down below the garden, and over the copse which lay between, appeared the
                  whitewashed walls of Massmount Chapel, rising from the water's edge, and on either
                  side facing the sea, the white gravestones peeping out from the long grass and
                  tangled fern. But in that solitary spot there was one particular grave, on which
                  the priest's eye often loved to rest, as he sat by the window gazing down on the
                  old churchyard. It was the grave of an old and long-cherished friend—of one who
                  found him in his early days an exile and a wanderer, and took him into his house
                  and heart; one who paused not to ask the poor wayfarer from what nation he came or
                  whither he went—for his big heart knew no distinction of birth or race; who
                  lavished on him all the loving fondness of a father, and at last took him by the
                  hand and led him within the sanctuary. On that humble slab, covering the old man's
                  grave, the priest's eyes often rested, as he sat by the window of his little
                  parlor; and often he sighed and longed for the day to come when he might see that
                  stone replaced by a monument worthier the great and holy heart that slept beneath
                  it. But, alas! he sighed in vain; for he was poor, and his love alone could never
                  raise it.
               Dear reader, many a noble heart lies mouldering in a forgotten grave; and many a
                  grave on which gratitude should have erected a monument to virtue, lies deserted
                  and abandoned to the nettle and the dockweed. We have seen such in our own day.
                  Alas, alas! that the world should be so ungrateful.
               Once upon a time we stood beside an open grave on a green hill side in N—— E——. It
                  was a grave in which the mortal remains of a great and good man were soon to be
                  deposited—a man whose virtues were the theme of every tongue. And well they might,
                  for never breathed a purer soul, nor throbbed a nobler heart than his. At once
                  unaffectedly simple and unconsciously sublime, his nature was a compound of the
                  finest qualities of the Christian and the gentleman, without a single jarring
                  element to mar its modest grandeur.
               The funeral procession at length reached the spot, and the coffin was laid beside
                  the grave with the lid thrown open, that the mourners might look on the face of
                  the dead for the last time. Never was seen such a crowd as that morning gathered
                  there. Fathers and mothers leading their little children by the hand, and young
                  men with bearded lip, and old men with hoary heads, were there, and strangers from
                  distant cities were there, and bishops in purple cassocks, and priests in black
                  stole and surplice. Kneeling on the greensward, the incense rose, and the psalm
                  was sung, and the people of high and low degree mingled together, and prayed for
                  the repose of his soul; and whilst they prayed their tears fell thick and fast. It
                  was a sad but glorious sight to see that multitude weeping and prostrate that
                  morning before the open coffin; and gazing on his face, they saw it still beaming
                  with that look of love which ever marked it through life; nay, he seemed at that
                  moment as if making them his last appeal for an affectionate remembrance. And each
                  one answered the appeal by a silent vow—a vow to honor, to gratitude, and to
                  God—made while they gazed on his face through their tears—made with their hands
                  upon his coffin—a vow never to forget him.
               Ten years passed away, and again, after many wanderings, we returned to that green
                  hill side, and looked round for the monument which that crowd of loving hearts had
                  erected to the memory of their benefactor and friend. "What seek you, stranger?"
                  said an old man, seated on the grass, by a little mound of clay. "The monument
                  erected to the memory of the
                  illustrious ——" "Here it is," he replied, laying his hand on the sod beside him.
                  "That!" "Yes, this is the monument; I have just been sowing a few flower seeds at
                  his feet." "But his friends!" we inquired. "Friends!" repeated the old man,
                  smiling bitterly. "Yes, that mighty multitude which ten years ago we saw weeping
                  and wailing here before his unburied corpse—what has become of them?" "Dead."
                  "What, all dead!" "Ay, they all died on the day of his burial—all save one and
                  myself. That one comes often here to say a prayer and drop a tear on the grave,
                  for living and dying he loved him best of all the world. But alas! he is poor, and
                  those whom he trusted to for help have proved ungrateful." "Nay, say not so, old
                  man," we replied; "mayhap he has not solicited their aid. It were sad indeed to
                  think——" "Solicit!" he repeated, again interrupting me; "no, he could never do
                  that—the peculiarity of his relations with the dead forbade it. But, friend," he
                  added, "true gratitude never waits for time, nor place, nor man to call forth its
                  expression."
               Pardon us, dear reader, for this disgression. Perhaps it is out of place, but for
                  the life of us we couldn't help making it.
               Father Brennan had but little more than commenced to read his office, when the
                  parlor door opened, and a servant announced a visitor. Presently our old
                  acquaintance, Dr. Henshaw, entered, and the priest instantly laid his breviary on
                  the table, and rose to receive him.
               "Dr. Henshaw, this is very kind. I'm very much pleased to see you—pray be
                  seated."
               "Sir, you'll excuse me; I merely called to return this volume of Bailly's
                  Theology, and to thank you for your hospeetality before I leave."
               "Ah! then I see you're still angry with me, doctor; and, indeed, not without some
                  show of reason, for I may, in a moment of irritation, have said more than was
                  becoming in the presence of strangers. Still we must not indulge resentment, you
                  know."
               "More than was becoming. Why, sir, you said what was both offensive and unjust,"
                  replied the doctor, gruffly.
               "Perhaps so. If I did, I sincerely regret it."
               "But, sir, your regret is not enough. In justice to me, you are bound to retract
                  the charges you made against me in presence of the parties before whom you made
                  them."
               "That I shall, sir, most willingly. Whatever those parties may think unjustifiable
                  in the language I used that night, I am ready to retract and apologize for. What I
                  said, Dr. Henshaw, merely regarded your inveterate habit of intruding your faith
                  into every thing. Why, you had hardly been five minutes conversing with Miss
                  Petersham, when you told her she would certainly be damned if she didn't renounce
                  Protestantism and join the Catholic church forthwith."
               "And why not tell her so at once, sir? where's the use of dilly-dallying about it?
                  Humph! it's charity, sir, to let them see the whole truth at a glance—I say it's
                  charity, sir."
               "And as a consequence of that charity," subjoined the priest, "they're both
                  shocked and disgusted."
               "Be it so—the sooner shocked, the better. Protestantism is a chronic disease, sir,
                  and it's no by syllabubs and sirups you can cure it; no, sir, but by the most
                  searching medicine, administered vary frequently and in large doses."
               "Such treatment, I fear, would more likely kill than cure," said the priest.
               "I maintain the contrary, sir. Error should be taken by the horns, and no by the
                  tail. I have seen how you converse with that girl—Miss Petersham; why, you talk to
                  her, sir, as if you were making an apology for the severity of Catholic
                  deescipline, and the conservatism of Catholic doctrine. Hoot, sir, you can never
                  make a Catholic of her by such a course of training as that."
               "You think so?"
               "Most assuredly, sir."
               "And yet she is preparing to join the church in a few days."
               
               "I can hardly believe it, Mr. Brennan."
               "Why not?"
               "Why, she hasn't the look of a convert."
               "What, because she don't appear grave and solemn?"
               "No. But her deportment is not like that of a girl desirous of saving her soul.
                  She's cracked, sir, or, as we say in Scotland, she's 'clean daft.'"
               "By no manner of means, doctor; you mistake her character altogether. Under all
                  that apparent thoughtlessness lies concealed a fund of natural piety and love of
                  truth, which, if you only knew her as I do, would surprise you. Kate Petersham is
                  not a Scotch girl, you know, to look glum, and shake her head like a 'canny'
                  Presbyterian; nor English either, to wait for the slow conviction of her intellect
                  before she surrenders the heart; but a genuine, true-blooded Irish girl,
                  inheriting the enthusiasm and impulsiveness of her race, whose soul feels the
                  divine attractions of religion drawing her to its bosom, long before her mind
                  recognizes its presence. Like all Irish girls, Kate is playful, witty,
                  light-hearted, and tries ever to hide her piety under an affected recklessness.
                  She will steer the Water-Hen in the teeth of a gale, or ride Moll Pitcher at a
                  steeple chase, over breakneck walls, when the humor takes her; but see her in her
                  closet, when she shuts the door against human eyes, and you'll find her a very
                  different being. Yes, sir, Kate is an Irish girl in every sense of the
                  term—generous, impulsive, wayward, if you will—but with a heart full of true
                  piety, and a disposition as humble and gentle as a child's."
               "Humph!" ejaculated the doctor; "and may I ask, sir, after this extraordinary
                  eulogium, how you set about her conversion?"
               "Not by dosing her with dogmas, anathemas, and philosophy, I assure you," replied
                  the priest, smiling.
               "No, that's not your method, I perceive. You began, I suppose, like all others of
                  the old school, by pushing her down gently from Protestantism into infidelity, and
                  when she could go no farther, led her up again by the old negative process, step
                  by step, through all the isms into the true church."
               "No, sir, that course would only have confused without converting her."
               "And what then?"
               "I merely pointed out to her the beauties of our holy religion, and sent her down
                  to Mary Lee to see them illustrated."
               "Ah! Mary Lee—the light-keeper's daughter?"
               "Yes. She converted Miss Petersham without a word of controversy—converted her by
                  the mere example of her every-day life. It's precisely to the force of similar
                  example we owe so many conversions, by the Sisters of Charity, for instance, and
                  the various other religious societies."
               "I admit, sir, they are useful in their way—nay, of great advantage as helps to
                  religion, especially as regards the weaker sex; but men of intellect must be
                  treated otherwise, sir. Intellectual men need intellectual treatment; and whilst
                  your Sisters of Charity, and so forth, have done much, and are still doing much,
                  in their own way, there is still need of men who, like myself, endeavor, according
                  to our poor abeelities, to defend truth and combat error, by means of that vary
                  pheelosophy, logic, and theology you seem to think of so lightly. Each in his own
                  sphere, sir, is an old adage."
               "Certainly, and a good one, too. But you misapprehend me, doctor, if you think I
                  disparage one or the other as means of conversion. Not at all. I merely say
                     you overrate them, and give too little credit, in your account, to
                  the grace of God and the influence of example. In fact, sir, like the majority of
                  converts, you make a mistake in the very beginning. You think—or seem to think, at
                  least—that nothing has been done in the church for the conversion of heretics till
                  you joined her, and that in the ardor and freshness of your zeal you are expected
                  to make up for the neglect. This is a grievous error, doctor, and if allowed to go
                  unchecked, might lead to lamentable
                  consequences. Take yourself, for instance. Instead of studying, like a child, the
                  primer of the church, and learning therein the thousand helps to salvation, and
                  the thousand beauties to be found in her ceremonies and pious observances, you
                  leave all such little things to the ignorant, and jump at once into the higher
                  region of dogma, without the slightest preparatory training. The result is, that
                  you often introduce subjects in your writings and lectures which are not only ill
                  timed and uncalled for, but really dangerous in hands so inexperienced as yours. I
                  willingly admit, Dr. Henshaw, you're a very able writer. Indeed, in that
                  department of letters you have chosen as the field of your operations, you have,
                  so far as I know, very few equals. But the greater your abilities, the greater the
                  danger both to yourself and the church. To yourself, because of the inordinate
                  pride such talents are apt to generate, and to the church, lest your non-Catholic
                  readers might mistake your productions for fair specimens of the true tone and
                  spirit of Catholicity. In that case the church would certainly suffer; for I
                  cannot help telling you, doctor, that so far, at least, you have only presented
                  the church in a repulsive attitude."
               "That is," replied the doctor, smiling serenely, "I have not tried my hand at
                  namby-pambyism yet."
               "No. You certainly have not, sir. But by taking the very opposite extreme you
                  have, in my opinion, done very little good to religion. What pleasure or benefit
                  can you find in the use of such language as you uttered that night at Castle
                  Gregory—and not only there, but wherever you had occasion to speak of
                  Protestantism? Then your profound reasoning and subtle logic, on the other hand,
                  may convince intellects, but, be assured of it, will rarely convert hearts. In
                  such an age as this, you must exhibit the church under her most alluring and
                  attractive form, or you will make no true converts. Men will read your elaborate
                  articles, admire your vigorous thoughts and your cogent arguments, but their
                  hearts will remain untouched. If ever, indeed, by such a course, you do succeed in
                  bringing a Protestant within the vestibule of the church, he will stand there like
                  a converted philosopher, scanning the books of the new school and examining the
                  principles of the new philosophy, but he will hardly fall before the altar, and
                  with heart bowed down before his God, acknowledge himself a humble and penitent
                  child. No, sir; it's not enough to convince the intellect; you must convert the
                  heart, also, or you will make no converts. Father F——r has done more for the
                  conversion of souls, in the smallest and least valuable of his works, than you
                  have ever done, or ever will do, with all your great talents. And the reason is
                  plain. He is not ambitious—except, indeed, for the promotion of God's glory, and
                  the happiness of his fellow-beings. His thoughts, as he writes, are never of
                  himself. He aims not at the admiration of men, but at their salvation. It is the
                  writings of such converts as he is we want to see, and not elaborate essays on
                  subjects neither practical nor necessary. If you want to make your talents useful
                  to the church, don't strain them to reach where your readers can't follow you, but
                  write for the people—write for the millions, sir, not for theologians and
                  philosophers. If you do that, you will save your own soul, and convert thousands
                  of others; but, if not, I fear you will lose both."
               "Humph!" ejaculated Henshaw, after the priest had concluded his somewhat long
                  speech, and buttoning his coat, as if preparing to leave—"I was not aware that I
                  solicited your advice in the matter; if I had, no doubt I should be prepared to
                  defer to it; but as it is——"
               "Doctor," interrupted his friend, "I speak my sentiments on this subject openly
                  and candidly, and at the risk of giving you offence; but I do so both for your own
                  sake and that of religion. The course you're pursuing will undoubtedly prove, in
                  the end, to be an injudicious one—and you will only have the mortification of
                  knowing, in your old days, if you persist in it, that the church of God has gained nothing by your advocacy."
               Here the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a servant, with Captain
                  Petersham's compliments, and his request to see Father Brennan at the court
                  house.
               "Ah, I expected as much," said the latter. "This trial of young Barry has just
                  commenced, I suppose. Will you accompany me, doctor?"
               "No, I should rather not, just now," replied Henshaw. "I have some preparation to
                  make before leaving to-morrow."
               "What! going so soon!"
               "Yes; I must return by to-morrow's packet."
               "Why, we shan't have time to make up our quarrel, then. O, you mustn't think of
                  it, doctor."
               "To-morrow I shall positively start for Derry."
               "Well, well, we must talk of that again. Come with me now, for an hour or so, to
                  the court house, to hear this trial. If you refuse, I shall say you parted with me
                  in anger. Come, we are old friends, doctor, and must not get estranged for
                  trifles—come;" and the priest, after several unsuccessful attempts, at length
                  prevailed on his discomfited friend to accompany him to the court house.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               
                  Randall Barry's Trial.—Kate Petersham on Moll Pitcher.—She balks, but facing
                     the Wall a second time, clears it.—The Negro on the Witness' Stand.—Else Curley
                     comforts Robert Hardwrinkle.
               
               WHEN Father Brennan, accompanied by his learned friend, arrived at the court house
                  gate, he found the yard filled with people. At the door stood two or three
                  policemen, with bayonets on their muskets, keeping out the crowd, now clamorous
                  for admission, and on the walls several groups of men and boys, peeping in through
                  the windows. As the priest made his appearance, however, the noise ceased for a
                  moment, and the usual whisper ran round, "Ta shin
                     saggarth, ta shin saggarth"—There's the priest, there's the
                  priest.
               "Stand back," cried a voice in a tone of authority; "stand back, and let his
                  reverence pass."
               The priest glanced quickly in the direction of the speaker.
               "Who is that?" inquired Henshaw.
               "Lanty Hanlon, if he's alive."
               "What! our quondam skipper?"
               "The very man—what a fool-hardy crack-brain he is to come here after carrying off
                  Miss Hardwrinkle. He hasn't got an ounce of sense, that fellow."
               "Fall back," shouted the policemen; "fall back, and let the gentlemen into court.
                  Make way, there."
               As the latter gained the upper step at the court house door, a loud cheer suddenly
                  broke from the crowd.
               "Hurrah! there she comes, the darling!"
               "So ho!" ejaculated Henshaw, turning on his step; "what now?"
               "Kate Petersham! I declare it is."
               "Hurrah!" shouted the same voice; "there she comes, on Moll Pitcher."
               "Hold on," said Henshaw.
               "What's the matter?"
               "Look! look! sir; she faces that wall."
               "Pooh! that's nothing."
               "Good Heavens! sir, she'll break her neck."
               "Not a bit of it—she learned to ride in Galway."
               "It's sax feet high—there!—hold, her horse balks!"
               "Balks! that's strange, eh! what can have happened; something she shied at, I
                  suspect. Moll Pitcher was never known to balk in her life."
               
               Whilst the priest was yet speaking, Kate rode her horse close up again to the
                  wall, as if to show her the difficulty she had to encounter, and then wheeling
                  round cantered back for another start.
               "She'll balk again," said Henshaw, confidently.
               "Wait a while—we'll see."
               Every voice was now hushed, and every eye fixed on the rider, for the leap was
                  dangerous, and the spectators, as might naturally be supposed, felt anxious for
                  the safety of their favorite. The spot where she tried to cross was the only one
                  in the wall accessible for a leap, on account of the large rocks which lay along
                  either side for a distance of a quarter of a mile or more; and even there the
                  ground rose so abruptly as to put the horse to a perilous disadvantage. Had the
                  rider been aware of the danger before she approached the leap, very likely she had
                  ridden round, and avoided the difficulty; but having once made the attempt, she
                  determined to risk every thing rather than fail. Perhaps, too, the sight of so
                  many spectators, and the cheers which reached her, had something to do with
                  confirming her resolution.
               As the fearless girl turned her horse's head to the wall, she let the reins drop
                  for a moment, and leaning over on the saddle, tightened the girts a hole or two;
                  then adjusting her cap, and patting the spirited animal on the neck, again
                  cantered along at an easy gait.
               "Now!" said the priest; "now for it!"
               "The girl is decidedly mad, sir," said Henshaw.
               "Hush! she raises the whip."
               Moll Pitcher knew well what that sign meant, and with a snort and a toss of her
                  saucy head, sprung forward with the fleetness of a greyhound.
               "God assist her," muttered the priest to himself; "it's a frightful risk."
               "Amen," replied Henshaw, catching the words; "amen—though she don't deserve it—her
                  fool-hardiness is unpardonable."
               "Now!" and the priest unconsciously seized his friend's arm—"now!"
               As he spoke, Kate again raised the whip, and Moll Pitcher rose to the wall.
               For a second or two stillness reigned as deep as death. If the animal touched the
                  wall in crossing, horse and rider would both, in all probability, have been
                  seriously injured, if not killed. If she did not, there was still danger from the
                  broken, stony ground on the opposite side.
               "Hold!" exclaimed Henshaw, "they're both down—good Heavens, sir, they're
                  killed!"
               The mare rose and stood in an almost perpendicular attitude for a second, as if to
                  gather all her strength for the effort. It was an instant of painful anxiety to
                  the spectators; but it was only an instant, for in the next she made the spring
                  and crossed without touching a stone, the foam flying from her mouth, and the
                  streamers from her rider's cap floating back in the breeze.
               "Hurrah! hurrah! God bless her!" now broke in one loud burst from the crowd; but
                  the exclamation was suddenly checked, for it was soon found that rider and horse
                  had both fallen.
               "The girl's killed," exclaimed Henshaw.
               "God forbid!" replied the priest, straining his eyes as he spoke. "But she has
                  certainly fallen."
               Then a general rush was made towards the gate, each vying with his neighbor for
                  the credit of being first to reach the ground.
               "What means all this uproar?" demanded Captain Petersham, suddenly appearing at
                  the court house door, accompanied by one of his brother magistrates—"eh, what has
                  happened?"
               "Miss Petersham has fallen, sir, crossing that stone wall," replied a
                  policeman.
               "Fallen—impossible. What! on Moll Pitcher?"
               
               "I fear she's hurt, captain," said the priest.
               "Ah! Father Brennan, you here, too? Hurt—nonsense!"
               He had hardly uttered the last word, when another wild shout rose that made the
                  very welkin ring again; and there, plain to every eye, came Kate, firmly seated in
                  her saddle, bounding along the meadow, and waving her handkerchief in
                  acknowledgment of the greeting.
               As she jumped the last ditch, a man apparently in disguise—for his clothes seemed
                  to accord little with his figure and gait—advanced and laid his hand on the
                  reins.
               "Well, Lanty, is the trial over?" demanded Kate, bending to her saddle-bow, and
                  whispering the words.
               "No, my lady, it didn't begin yet."
               "Glad of it—I feared I should come late."
               "Is your ladyship hurt?"
               "Not in the least."
               "Nor Moll Pitcher?"
               "Not a particle."
               "The darlin," exclaimed Lanty, laying his hand on the mare's neck; "she's as true
                  as steel. O, my life on her for a million."
               "The moment will soon come to try her," said Kate, as Lanty stretched out his arms
                  and lifted her from the saddle. "Are you sure all's ready?"
               "Ay, ay, never fear."
               "Where is Miss Hardwrinkle?"
               "In the mountains, safe and sound."
               "And the police, how many here?"
               "Not many," responded Lanty; "but don't stay, or the guard will suspect
                  somethin."
               The above conversation passed stealthily and rapidly, under cover of the cheers of
                  the crowd.
               "Fall back!" again bawled the police; "fall back there, and make way for the
                  lady."
               "Ho! Kate, my girl," cried the jolly captain, snatching his sister up in his arms,
                  and kissing her affectionately, as she ascended the steps. "The rascals here would
                  have you hurt or killed; but they little know the metal you're made of, nor the
                  gallant bit of flesh that carries you, Kate. A little out of sorts by the
                  fall—bruised or stunned, eh?"
               "Not a whit," responded Kate. "I could ride a steeple chase this moment with the
                  best blood in the country. Ah, Father John, you here? I'm glad to see you;" and
                  bending reverently, she kissed the priest's hand.
               "My dear girl," responded the latter, "I'm delighted to see you unhurt, for I must
                  confess I felt rather anxious."
               "O, it was nothing—a mere stumble; the mare lighted on a round stone and fell,
                  that's all. O, hoh! and Dr. Henshaw; I'm glad to see you too, sir," she continued,
                  holding out her hand. "You must come up and see us to-morrow at Castle Gregory.
                  Now don't say a word; I shall have no excuse. You must positively come, and you
                  may cut up Swift, too, into mince meat, if you like. Father John, I lay my
                  sovereign commands on you to present yourself and Dr. Henshaw at Castle Gregory
                  to-morrow."
               "And, Kate, you must put in a good word for me," said the captain, looking over
                  good-humoredly at the doctor. "But never mind; we'll settle all that to-morrow;
                  let us now proceed to business. Come in, gentlemen; we have some spare seats on
                  the bench. Ho, there, police! make way, make way. Come in; there's quite an
                  interesting case in court."
               As the parties took their seats and looked round the room, the first object that
                  arrested their attention was the negro. He was standing in the witness box,
                  apparently awaiting the return of the presiding magistrate to resume his
                  examination. On the right of the bench, and immediately below it, sat the cabin
                  boy, wrapped in a thick, blue blouse, and looking pale and emaciated after his
                  sickness. Beyond him, and near the dock in which Randall Barry stood, shackled and
                  guarded by two constables, appeared the tall form of Else Curley. She was seated on one of the steps leading
                  up to the jury room, the hood of her cloak, as usual, drawn over her head, with
                  the white elf locks visible beneath it. But the object which appeared to attract
                  every eye, and challenge universal attention, was the noble, manly figure of the
                  young outlaw, as he stood before his judges, awaiting his trial, his left arm
                  still in a sling, and his right bound by a chain running round his waist, and
                  fastened by a padlock in front.
               Randall Barry was now in his twenty-fifth year; but misfortune and disappointment
                  had cast a shade of melancholy on his countenance that made him look several years
                  older. His face was eminently handsome, and his person tall and muscular. Though
                  far from being robust, his limbs were well moulded, and evidently capable of great
                  physical exertion. As he stood in the dock, his dark eye wandered slowly over the
                  faces of the multitude, resting now and then for a moment on those he recognized.
                  But when Kate Petersham appeared, and took the place assigned her by the clerk of
                  the court, he glanced at her sharply for an instant, and then, as she raised her
                  eyes to his, bent his head and blushed at the thought of his degradation. But to
                  return to the negro.
               "Your name is Sambo?" resumed Captain Petersham, addressing the witness.
               "Ees, massa."
               "Sambo what?"
               "Nigger Sambo."
               "You're a negro—that's pretty evident; but what's your surname?"
               "Don't know, massa."
               "What are you called, Sambo Smith, or Sambo Brown, or Sambo Robison? You've some
                  family name, have you not?"
               "Noting, massa," replied the African, "noting but Sambo."
               "Why, you rascal, do you mean to tell me you've got no family name?"
               "O sartin, massa, I'm got famly name."
               "And what is it, then? Answer directly, sir. I've been examining this stupid
                  fellow a full half hour, and can get nothing out of him," added the captain,
                  turning to the priest; "he's the most provoking creature I ever met with. Answer
                  me, sir; what is your family name?"
               "Famly name, massa!"
               "Yes, yes, yes; you had a father, I suppose?"
               "Fader—well, supposin I'm had a fader."
               "Supposing you had a father? By George, this is absolutely intolerable. Had your
                  father a name?"
               "Sartin, massa."
               "And what the fury was it?"
               "Sambo, massa—him was Nigger Sambo, too."
               Here the whole assembly, magistrates and spectators, broke into a loud laugh at
                  the discomfited captain, and the negro yah-yah'd, and shook his sides in true
                  African fashion.
               "Excuse me, captain," said Henshaw, "but these unfortunate creatures seldom or
                  ever have a surname."
               "Yes, yes, I was aware of that; but I have an object in ascertaining what his
                  second name is. He must have a name, either from his father or master. Silence in
                  the court, there! Tell me, sir," he continued, "what is that boy's name, sitting
                  there before you?" and he pointed to the individual in question.
               "Dat boy?—Natty Nelson."
               "Where was he born?"
               "Don't know, massa."
               "Where did you first see him?"
               "I seed him in de baccy field—yah, yah!"
               "In what state?"
               "Ole Virginny."
               "On whose plantation?"
               "Whose plantation? Can't tell dat, massa, no how," replied the African.
               "You must, sir; I shall order you the bastinado this instant if you refuse."
               
               "Yah, yah, massa; this am free country. Nigger here am good as white man."
               At this stage of the proceedings a stir was seen in the crowd at the lower end of
                  the room, and presently entered Mr. Ephraim C. B. Weeks, covered with jewelry, a
                  gold-headed cane in his hand, and the silver card case protruding as usual from
                  his pocket.
               Sambo was so intent on evading such questions as might be likely to criminate his
                     protegé, and so fearful, at the same time, of
                  provoking the magistrate's anger, that he neither heard nor saw any thing of Mr.
                  Weeks, till that gentleman attracted his notice by throwing his feet upon the very
                  platform on which he was standing.
               "Golly, Massa Charles, you dar?" he exclaimed, as his eye turned on the new comer.
                  "Massa—I mean Massa Week," he added, endeavoring to correct the blunder.
               Captain Petersham's quick eye saw the confusion this unexpected recognition caused
                  the Yankee, and instantly writing a few words rapidly in pencil, dropped them on
                  the clerk's desk, and again resumed.
               "Witness, I again repeat the question—on whose plantation did you first see this
                  boy?"
               "Me no tell dat, massa," replied the negro, decidedly.
               "Then I shall commit you. Clerk, make out his committal. I'll send you presently
                  where you can have plenty of time to determine whether you'll answer or not."
               "Mr. Petersham," observed Hardwrinkle, leaning over on the bench, and speaking in
                  low tones, but still sufficiently loud to be heard by his brother magistrates, "it
                  does not appear to me that the name of the proprietor of the plantation is
                  essential in this case."
               "Certainly not, so far as we regard simply the ownership of the rosary; but
                  there's a secret of some importance, I suspect, in connection with the case, which
                  I'm anxious to discover."
               "But are you justified, nevertheless, in committing the witness for your own
                  personal gratification?"
               "Perhaps not; but at present I'm disposed to run the risk," replied the captain;
                  and turning abruptly from Hardwrinkle, he handed the committal to a constable, and
                  ordered him to take the witness forthwith to the barrack, and keep him in close
                  custody.
               The negro, finding himself in the hands of an officer, looked beseechingly first
                  at Weeks and then at the boy, but said nothing.
               "You may depend on it, Sambo," said the captain, as the poor fellow left the
                  witness box, "you shall never leave the lock-up till you tell who the owner of
                  that tobacco field is, or was, when you first saw this boy—away with him."
               "Massa, massa, I'm want to speak one word to Natty."
               "Not a syllable."
               "One leetle word."
               "Not a letter of the alphabet."
               The boy now rose, and in feeble accents begged permission to accompany the negro
                  to prison. "He has been my friend," he said, "please your worships, my best friend
                  ever since I was a child, and I would grieve to part with him."
               "It cannot be," replied the captain; "he must go alone."
               During this conversation Weeks sat leaning back against a partition, with his feet
                  stretched out before him, pointing a pencil with a penknife, and apparently quite
                  indifferent to what was passing. He was cautiously deliberating, however, all the
                  while, whether it were better to acknowledge he had taken the rosary from the
                  lighthouse by mistake, or run the risk of the negro and the boy keeping the
                  promise they had made him. If he admitted having taken it, he should produce it,
                  and the existence of two rosaries would at once discover the whole secret. If he
                  did not, and the boy, from his strong affection for the negro, should be driven at
                  last to confess the truth, it might be worse still. The reader must here observe, that up to the moment of the
                  boy's arrest at Crohan House, Mr. Weeks never dreamed of his having a rosary in
                  his possession; and even when the constables took him off, he never imagined it
                  could possibly involve him in any trouble. Hardwrinkle was not so, however. The
                  instant he saw the rosary, he knew it, at once, to be a duplicate of that he had
                  seen with his sister Rebecca, and already aware of the boy's connections in
                  Virginia, thought it prudent to apprise his cousin of the danger, and accordingly
                  despatched a private message to him to that effect; the latter, believing his
                  presence at the trial might be the means of deterring the negro from divulging the
                  name of his master, if he should happen to be so inclined, made his appearance in
                  court, as we have already described. Things, however, had taken rather a different
                  turn from what he expected. The African was now committed for contempt, and on the
                  point of being separated from his protégé—a
                  separation he knew to be most painful to both; and he began to feel somewhat
                  apprehensive lest the negro's promise of fidelity should give way to his love for
                  the boy. "Well, I swonnie," said he to himself, as he pointed the pencil, or
                  rather whittled it, (if one could judge by the quantity of chips,) "I swonnie, I
                  don't know. I guess it might be just as well to make tracks from this here place
                  as soon as possible; things are beginning to tighten in so's to make one feel
                  sorter uncomfortable. There's that darned note, though, of the light-keeper's—if I
                  had that cashed, I kinder think I'd bid the folks in this section good by for a
                  while. Well, the sheriff's after him, any how—that's a comfort—and O, crackie! if
                  I don't make him pay for his insults at Castle Gregory. If I don't screw him tight
                  up—well, if I don't, it's no matter; that's all." In this fashion Mr. Weeks kept
                  communing with his own thoughts, weighing his chances of success and failure, till
                  the boy rose and begged the court to allow him the privilege of being confined in
                  the same cell with the witness. "Ah," thought Weeks, "I guess I'm about long
                  enough here. I see the tears in his eyes—he'll never hold out; and if he comes to
                  blab, I might feel sorter unpleasant;" and so thinking, he took his hat and turned
                  to quit the court house.
               "Excuse me, Mr. Weeks," said Captain Petersham, "we must detain you a little
                  longer—you're summoned to give testimony in this case."
               "Summoned!"
               "Yes, sir. Here, constable, hand this to the gentleman. Have the goodness to
                  resume your seat, Mr. Duck—ah, Mr. Weeks, I should have said; we shall want you
                  presently. Clerk, call Else Curley."
               "I'm here," responded Else, promptly, rising from the low step on which she had
                  been sitting, and brushing back her gray hair under her hood with her brown, bony
                  hand,—"I'm here."
               "Take your place on the witness stand," said the clerk.
               As Else advanced, every eye was upon her. Hundreds there who had come from a
                  distance to hear the trial of the young rebel, and had never seen Else Curley, now
                  pushed forward to get a glimpse of that far-famed fortune-teller and solitary of
                  Benraven.
               Having taken the usual oath, the old woman folded her arms in her gray cloak, and
                  awaited the pleasure of the magistrates.
               "Shall I examine her?" said Hardwrinkle, addressing the captain.
               "I thank you," replied the latter; "no, I should prefer to examine her
                  myself."
               "Your name is Else Curley, and you reside on Benraven Mountain?" began the
                  captain.
               "Yes."
               "Do you know Mr. Lee and his daughter, of Araheera lighthouse?"
               "I do."
               
               "Have you ever seen a rosary of a peculiar description in Miss Lee's
                  possession?"
               "I have."
               "Can you describe it?"
               "It was a silver-baded rosary, with a crucifix set in diamonds."
               "Look at this one, and tell me if you ever saw it before."
               Else took the rosary, and after looking at it for a moment replied, "This is the
                  very picthur of Mary Lee's, if it been't itself."
               "Can you swear positively it is Miss Lee's?"
               "No," responded Else, "but it's as lake it as one thing can be lake another."
               "Have you seen a rosary like that in Miss Lee's possession?"
               "A hundher times. I tuck one like it from her dead mother's neck among the rocks
                  of Araheera, the mornin after the wrack of the Saldana, and put it on her
                  own."
               "On whose?"
               "Mary Lee's. The child was livin in her mother's arms when I found her."
               "What!" exclaimed the captain; "you must mistake. Do you mean to tell the bench
                  that you found a living child in the arms of a dead woman on the morning after the
                  wreck of the Saldana, and that that child is the same Mary Lee who now claims this
                  rosary?"
               "I do," replied Else, confidently.
               This declaration of the old woman, made so promptly and positively, took the whole
                  audience by surprise. Even Hardwrinkle himself, who thought he knew more of Mary
                  Lee's history than any other in court, looked confounded and astonished at the
                  unexpected revelation. In a moment he foresaw the disclosure would eventually lead
                  to the discovery of his cousin's matrimonial speculation, the boy's relationship
                  with the proprietor of the Virginia plantation, and his own confusion sion and
                  disgrace, unless he succeeded in damaging the witness's testimony.
               "Captain Petersham," said he, turning to the presiding magistrate, and speaking in
                  the gentlest possible accents, "may I take the liberty of putting a question or
                  two to the witness? It really cannot be possible she speaks the truth in this
                  matter."
               "As you please," replied the captain; "but I don't see how it can affect the case
                  whether she speaks the truth or not about the discovery of the child. She swears
                  positively that the rosary is as like that which Miss Lee lost as one thing can be
                  like another, and she had even described it, before she saw it, as consisting of
                  silver beads and a gold crucifix set in diamonds. Now, for my part, I don't
                  believe you could find another rosary through all Europe of the same description.
                  But proceed, sir; satisfy yourself, by all means."
               "Else Curley," said Hardwrinkle, addressing the witness, "of what religion are
                  you?"
               "I was once a Catholic," replied the old woman; "I'm nothin, now."
               "Do you believe in a future state of rewards and punishments?"
               "Humph!" she replied; "why shouldn't I? God surely'll punish the persecutor and
                  the murdherer in the nixt world, if the law don't in this;" and as she uttered the
                  words, she fixed her keen, deep-sunken eyes on her questioner.
               "How long is it since you've been in a house of worship?"
               "Well on to thirty years."
               "You are commonly called the witch and fortune-teller of the Cairn, are you
                  not?"
               "Sometimes fortune-teller, and sometimes she-devil," replied Else; "just as the
                  people fancy."
               "Do you know what crime it is to take a false oath?"
               "I do."
               "What is it?"
               
               "Parjury."
               "And what is perjury?"
               "The crime yer father committed whin he swore agin my only sister, and sint her to
                  an untimely grave."
               Here a laugh came up from the crowd below; but it was soon suppressed by the
                  police, and Hardwrinkle proceeded.
               "I repeat the question, witness; what is perjury?"
               "The crime yer father committed whin he swore my brother to the hulk, and sint him
                  to die in a forrin land, with irons on his limbs. The crime ye committed yerself
                  whin ye sint me twice to the dark dungeons of Lefford jail, and when I come out,
                  driv me to burrow lake the brock in the crags of Benraven."
               "Woman, I shall send you to jail for the third time, if you persist in using such
                  language in court."
               "Scoundrel! hypocrite! murderer! I defy you," cried Else, throwing back her hood,
                  and raising her shrivelled arm as she spoke; "yer villany's discovered at last.
                  There," she ejaculated, pointing to Weeks, "there, tell the court who sent that
                  man to me for spells and charms to make Mary Lee marry him; who tould him of the
                  witch and fortune-teller of Benraven; who tould him she would sell her sowl to
                  fill her pocket? Ah, little ye thought, when ye made this greedy cousin buy up the
                  light-keeper's notes, that ye might have the means of sending him to jail if he
                  refused his niece, little ye thought the bedlam of the Cairn was watching
                  ye——"
               "Hold! hold, woman!" exclaimed Captain Petersham. "What does all this mean?"
               "Mane!" repeated Else. "It manes that this cousin of his, this man of trinkets,
                  come here from America in search of the heiress of William Talbot, and that Robert
                  Hard-wrinkle conspired with him to take her off by fair manes or foul. It manes
                  that at the instigation of that devil there in human shape, the Yankee here paid
                  me eighty British pounds for spells and charms, and my good word besides, to make
                  her marry him. It manes that, after watching for thirty years, I found at last
                  evidence to prove to the world that the pious, God-fearing, saintly, smooth-spoken
                  gentleman on the bench there beside ye, is a hypocrite and a villain."
               "Police! take charge of this woman," commanded Hard-wrinkle, his long, dark,
                  sallow face pale with confusion and anger; "take her away."
               "No, no; not yet, Mr. Hardwrinkle, not yet," interposed Captain Petersham; "we
                  cannot permit her to leave after casting such aspersion on your character. As your
                  brother magistrates, we feel concerned for your reputation, and must for your
                  sake, and indeed for the honor of the bench, make further inquiries into this
                  matter.
               "Else Curley," said he, "you have just charged Mr. Hard-wrinkle, a magistrate of
                  the county, and a gentleman—up to this moment, at least—of unexceptionable
                  character, with having conspired with Mr. Weeks to take off Miss Lee by fair means
                  or foul. What proof of that fact can you offer?"
               "That, on the third day afther Weeks arrived at Crohan House," promptly replied
                  Else, "he came into my cabin on the Cairn, and paid me twenty pounds earnest for
                  my sarvices to help him to secure Mary Lee, and that afore he iver
                  seen a faiture of her face. How cud he know that I was acquent with Mary Lee, or
                  how cud he tell that I'd take his money for sich a purpose, or how cud he know any
                  thing about me, if Robert Hardwrinkle didn't tell him who and what I was?"
               "Yes, but all this amounts only to mere suspicion. Have you proofs?"
               "Weeks's bank notes, that I have still in my possession, clean and fresh out of
                  the Bank of Dublin, is proof enough on his side, I'm thinkin; and the note in the
                  sheriff's hands can spake for Robert Hardwrinkle's."
               Here the deputy sheriff entered the court house, accompanied by the light-keeper
                  and his afflicted niece, closely followed by her old, faithful domestic, Roger
                  O'Shaughnessy, in the bottle-green
                  livery with the faded lace. As the constables drove back the crowd to make way,
                  and Mary appeared, deeply veiled, leaning on her uncle's arm, Captain Petersham
                  rose and saluted her with marked respect, and then a murmur of sympathy ran round
                  the assembly; and as she advanced nearer to the bench, her dear friend Kate, her
                  eyes suffused with tears, and regardless of the spectators, ran to meet her, and
                  flinging her arms round her neck, embraced her with true sisterly affection.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               
                  Trial continued.—Else charges Hardwrinkle with Conspiracy to carry off Mary
                     Lee.—She proves William Talbot, Mary's Father, to be still living, by Means of
                     the Rosary found on the Person of the Cabin Boy.—Mary's Feelings overpower her
                     on hearing the Announcement.—The Rescue of the Rebel.—The Riot.—Hardwrinkle's
                     Death.
               
               THE crowd outside the court house grew more and more clamorous for admission, as
                  the trial proceeded. Stones were several times thrown at the doors, and finally,
                  the multitude grew so excited as to be on the point of rushing up the steps to
                  disarm the constables, when suddenly the word "halt" was heard ringing clear and
                  sharp from the direction of the street, and next moment a detachment of police,
                  headed by a lieutenant, passed through the gate, and opening a passage with their
                  bayonets, took their position on the court house steps.
               This reënforcement, it is needless to observe, was ordered by Mr. Hardwrinkle
                  himself, from the neighboring village, without the knowledge or consent of Captain
                  Petersham. Hardwrinkle, in fact, saw from the beginning that the captain
                  determined to throw every obstacle in the way of Barry's committal, and he, on the
                  other hand, resolved to leave no means untried to thwart and disappoint him. Hence
                  the moment he found the police had all been sent in search of Lanty Hanlon and his
                  sister, with the exception of three or four to guard the prisoner, he despatched a
                  messenger to the nearest officer in charge, and under pretence of an anticipated
                  riot, commanded him to bring forthwith all the force he could muster, to sustain
                  the magistrates in the execution of the law.
               After the slight interruption occasioned by the entrance of the sheriff and his
                  party, the chairman again resumed his examination of the witness.
               "My good woman," said he, "you have made a very grave and serious charge here, in
                  open court, against one of my brother magistrates; no less a charge, indeed, than
                  of conspiring with another individual here present to entice, seduce, or carry
                  off, by fair means or foul, a highly accomplished and respectable young lady, Miss
                  Lee, of Araheera Head. I now call on you to substantiate that charge, or confess
                  yourself guilty of a foul and malicious slander."
               "Slander!" repeated Else, drawing herself up and looking round the audience. "I
                  niver was guilty of slander in my life. I'm now fourscore years and more: thirty
                  of them I spent in the wilds of Benraven, under the foul name of witch and devil's
                  dam; but where's the man or woman here ever knew Else Curley to tell a lie or
                  slander a neighbor? If there is, let them spake. What I am, that man there on the
                  bench has made me. For these long and weary thirty years, he stud between the
                  light of heaven and me; and yit though I niver expect to see God but in anger, I
                  wudn't tell a lie to send him to the gallows."
               As Else uttered these words, her look was calm and defiant, and she stood as erect
                  as a statue, her arms folded on her brown bare breast, and her deep gray eyes
                  fixed on Robert Hardwrinkle.
               
               The spectators gazed on her in silent astonishment. Her mien, her attitude, but
                  above all the dignity with which she spoke, struck them as extraordinary in a
                  woman of her character and years.
               "She has seen better days, that old creature," observed Henshaw, turning to the
                  priest.
               "Ay, so report says."
               "But on what grounds," again demanded the captain, "have you made this charge
                  against Mr. Hardwrinkle?"
               "Humph! grounds enough, sir, grounds enough. First ask the sheriff there to
                  produce the promissory note Mr. Lee's now arrested for."
               "My jurisdiction don't extend so far, my good woman. If the gentleman, however,
                  chooses——"
               "Certainly, sir," replied the latter, "certainly; I can see no objection."
               "Well, I guess you might as well not mind it just now," drawled out Weeks, who had
                  resumed his seat, and kept whittling his pencil.
               "How so?"
               "Well, I object to the production of the note—that's all."
               "The objection don't hold, sir—the note being now in possession of the civil
                  court," responded the sheriff, handing the document up to the bench.
               "Hah!" exclaimed the chairman, as he read it over. "This note's drawn in favor of
                  Steven C. Ingoldsby, and indorsed by Robert Hardwrinkle to Ephraim C. B.
                  Weeks—with interest added up to 13th—. Witness, how does this date correspond with
                  Weeks's arrival at Crohan?"
               "He was here two weeks to a day," promptly responded Else—"just time enough for
                  his cousin there to go to Dublin, and ferret out Mr. Lee's creditors."
               "You're of opinion, then," said the captain, "that Mr. Hardwrinkle bought up this
                  note and indorsed it to Weeks, as a means of coercing Miss Lee to marry him
                  through fear of her uncle's incarceration?"
               "I am."
               "And yet, my good woman, you have given us no proofs that Mr. Weeks ever proposed
                  marriage to the young lady in question."
               "Proofs!" repeated Else, running her hand into her bosom, and drawing out a pile
                  of letters. "Proofs—there's proofs enough here."
               "How came you by these letters?"
               "Weeks gave them to me to deliver to Miss Lee."
               "Ah—and you did not deliver them?"
               "No; I kept them."
               "Miss Lee, then, never saw these letters?"
               "Saw them—humph! no; it'd ill become the daughter of William Talbot to touch the
                  love-letters of such a scarecrow as that;" and her eye pointed to the Yankee as
                  she spoke.
               "Hand me these letters," said the captain; "we must see what they look like."
               After glancing over the contents of one or two taken at random from the parcel, he
                  turned to Weeks, and requested to know from that gentleman, whether he
                  acknowledged the authorship, and if so, had he any objection to have them read in
                  court.
               Weeks hesitated for a moment, at a loss what reply to make. He felt a great
                  temptation to disavow the letters altogether, if he could only do so with
                  impunity; but he feared he could not, and to fail in the attempt would only cover
                  him with greater shame and confusion than ever.
               "You have heard the question, Mr. Weeks?"
               "What! about writing these letters?"
               "Yes!"
               "O, I acknowledge the corn right straight off. I guess I hain't got nothing in
                  them to be ashamed of—have I? Well, the hull amount of it is, I sorter liked the
                  girl."
               "Just so, sir."
               
               "There's no treason in that, I reckon."
               "Certainly not."
               "As for the lady been of gentle blood, and all that sorter thing, why, it's right
                  enough, I guess, over here, in this old country of yourn. And so, folks round here
                  may think, perhaps, a Yankee merchant, like me, ain't good enough match for her;
                  but I tell ye what, gents," he continued, rising to his feet, and thrusting his
                  hands down, as usual, deep into his breeches pockets,—"I tell you what, I'm the
                  son of an old revolutionist, and I've got a notion that the descendant of one of
                  these same old heroes is about good enough for any Irish girl ever walked in shoe
                  leather. I may be wrong, gents, but them's my sentiments notwithstanding."
               "Witness," resumed the chairman, without appearing to notice this speech;
                  "witness, since the gentleman acknowledges having written these letters and made
                  honorable proposals therein, what can you show us disreputable in his conduct, or
                  that of his cousin, Mr. Hardwrinkle, respecting the overture of marriage?"
               "Wasn't it the act of a mane, designin villain," responded Else, "to try to
                  enthrap a girl of her years into a marriage to save her uncle from beggary or a
                  jail, when he knew her to be the heiress of William Talbot, now livin in the
                  United States?"
               Mary started as the sudden announcement fell upon her ear.
               "Hush, hush!" whispered Kate; "keep quiet for a moment."
               "O, my God," she murmured—"what do I hear! my father still living!"
               The light-keeper glanced at the chairman, and then at the witness, as if he feared
                  the old woman's wits were wandering; and the priest, turning to Dr. Henshaw,
                  quietly observed that "things were beginning to assume a new complexion."
               "Else Curley, be careful what words you utter here," said the captain, anxiously
                  looking down at the two young friends, now folded lovingly in each other's arms.
                  "You may have excited hopes, perhaps, which never can be realized. On what
                  authority do you make that assertion?"
               "What, that William Talbot is still livin?"
               "Yes."
               "Plenty of authorities: first and foremost, that rosary there in the priest's
                  hand; then the draggin up of that poor cabin boy under a warrant, for fear he'd
                  tell the sacret when he'd recover; and last of all, the condemned look on that
                  dark, dismal countenance there beside ye."
               Hardwrinkle raised his head and smiled at the old woman, but it was a smile so
                  ghastly that the spectators felt chilled by its death-like expression.
               "Hah! ye smile," said Else; "ye smile, and well ye may, for you're the bloodsucker
                  and I'm the victim. Ye hunted me long, and run me down at last. From crag to crag
                  ye hunted me, and from peak to peak; from the mountain to the glen ye hunted me,
                  and from the glen to the prison. Ay, ye hunted me, and ye famished me, and ye
                  robbed me of my sowl at last. Ah, well ye may smile at the rack and ruin ye've
                  made; but never mind; bide yer time, bide yer time; it's a long lane has no turn.
                  That hellish smile can't last forever. May be yer time is shorter nor ye think
                  for. The hand of God may reach ye yit afore death reaches me. Bide yer time; wanst
                  I thought I cud niver die till I seen yer corpse at my feet and my heel on its
                  neck; but Heaven, it seems, or fate, will have it otherways. There's but one bein
                  livin cud save ye from my vengeance, and there she's now," cried the speaker,
                  turning to Mary Lee; "that very girl there, that spotless child, that ye tried to
                  make the victim of yer cold-blooded villany, has three times saved yer life——"
               "Woman, woman," shouted the chairman, at the top of his voice, after several
                  fruitless attempts to silence her, "woman, stop! I shall commit you if you don't
                  desist instantly."
               
               "Pshaugh!" exclaimed Else; "what care I for yer committal? Hah, hah! commit me!
                  But go on, go on, captain; put yer questions, and I'll answer them."
               "You say this rosary is a proof that Mr. Talbot is still living; how do you
                  explain that?"
               "Aisy enough. That rosary is the property of William Talbot, and the boy here must
                  have received or stolen it from its owner when he left Virginia three months ago.
                  Call up Roger O'Shaughnessy; he can identify it."
               "Is Roger O'Shaughnessy in court? Witness, you may remain as you are."
               "Ahem! yes, please yer honor," responded Roger, rising, and making a profound
                  obeisance to the bench.
               "Have you any objection to be sworn in this case?"
               "Not the laste in the world, yer honor."
               "Clerk, swear him where he stands."
               After the usual solemnity of taking the oath, Roger raised his hands, and smoothed
                  down his few remaining white hairs over the collar of his old bottle-green coat,
                  and then looked across at his young mistress, as if to say in as many words,
                  "Don't be afraid, my child, don't be afraid; I'll say nothing to injure the credit
                  of the family."
               "Witness," began the chairman, "what is your name?"
               "Roger O'Shaughnessy, sir."
               "You have been a servant in Mr. Talbot's family—how long?"
               "I was forty years steward and butler at Castle ——, the family seat of the
                  Talbots, and my father before me for nearly as many more."
               "Clerk, hand him that rosary."
               Roger took the precious relic from the clerk's hand, and drawing out his
                  spectacles, deliberately wiped them with his handkerchief, and then slowly
                  adjusted them.
               "Well, sir," demanded the chairman, after a long pause, "have you seen that
                  article before?"
               "I have, sir, a hundred times."
               "In whose possession?"
               "In Mr. William Talbot's, and in his father's, Edward Talbot's, of Castle ——."
               "Have you ever seen another like it?"
               "I have, sir; the fellow of it, in the possession of Edward Talbot's lady, and
                  afterwards in that of her daughter-in-law, Miss Mary Lee's mother, from whose neck
                  it was taken after the wreck of the Saldana, by the witness, Else Curley, and
                  placed on the neck of her fosther child here present."
               "Can you swear the rosary you now hold in your hand is not the rosary Miss Lee
                  lost recently, but that which at one time belonged to her father?"
               "I swear it."
               "How can you swear it, when the two are so much alike?"
               "Ahem! ahem!" ejaculated Roger; "they're like one another, to be sure, your honor.
                  But I carried this rosary several times to the jeweller in Cork, with my own
                  hands, to be mended, and can take my oath to the crack here yet under the arm of
                  the crucifix."
               "You swear that."
               "I do, sir."
               "Very well, that's sufficient; and now let me ask another question in connection
                  with the rosary. Do you think, from what you have known of William Talbot's
                  disposition, he would be likely to part with this rosary—give it as a present, for
                  instance, to this boy?"
               "Ahem! yer honor," responded Roger, "I didn't think so wanst, any way. I mane the
                  night his father died, when he called Master William to his bedside, and throwin
                  the rosary round his neck, cautioned him never to part with it as long as he
                  lived, for there was a blessin in it, and he'd find it out some time before he
                  died. 'I bequathe it to ye, my son,' siz he, 'as the best legacy I can lave ye.
                  Since the Duchess of Orleans give it to me as an acknowledgment for saving her life at the Virgin's Chapel at Aix, I
                  niver yet went to sleep without telling those beads. I hope, my dear boy, you'll
                  follow your old father's example.' Ahem! I was present myself your honor, standin
                  by when that happened, and if I could judge by Master William's vows and promises
                  that night, I might safely say, he'd never be likely to part with it
                  willingly."
               "From the Duchess of Orleans, did you say?"
               "Ahem! yes, sir," responded Roger. "Her grace gave one to Mr. Edward Talbot, and
                  the fellow of it to his lady, at Vairsells, with her own hands. I heerd the old
                  master tell the story to the lords and ladies many an evening at Castle ——. But,
                  och! sure, yer honor, that's neither here or there, now; no, no! these old times
                  can never come back again. Och, och! it's little I thought wanst, when I used to
                  see as many as seventeen lords and ladies of the best blood in the land seated in
                  the great dining hall at Castle ——"
               "Well, well, Roger, we mustn't talk of these things now," interrupted the captain.
                  "You must remember you're on your oath."
               "Ay, ay, true enough; I had almost forgot that. But I'm ould, yer honor, ye know,
                  and my memory's not just so good as it used to be."
               "It's now nearly twenty years since Mr. William Talbot was last seen in England—is
                  it not?"
               "Ahem! ahem!" ejaculated Roger, pausing for a moment to recollect himself; "ahem!
                  no, sir, it's not so long as that; no, it's just eighteen years ago come next
                  Michaelmas since he fought the duel; we niver seen him more after that night."
               "Nor heard of him?"
               "No, sir; not a word. Some thought he crossed over to France, and some thought he
                  went out to America—but no one could ever tell. For a long time we expected he'd
                  write home, but no letter ever came; and then we began to think he heerd of his
                  wife been lost, with the rest of the passengers in the Saldana, and made up his
                  mind to bury himself in some distant country for the rest of his life."
               "Gentlemen," said the chairman, addressing his brethren of the bench, "perhaps you
                  wish to examine the witness further."
               No one seemed inclined, however, to interfere; and then he turned to Father
                  Brennan and his learned companion, and observed, somewhat quaintly, that the
                  history of the rosary was a very interesting one, and likely to involve important
                  consequences.
               "Important, I trust, for your young friend here," said the priest, in reply. "Her
                  tender devotion to the Mother of God, and her constant practice of saying the
                  rosary, will soon find their reward, I hope, in the discovery of a long-lost
                  parent."
               "It's a very curious affair all through."
               "Remarkably so; but you know, captain, I often told you how God Almighty makes use
                  of strange means sometimes to accomplish his designs. The discovery of one rosary
                  by the loss of the other, is clearly providential."
               "By the Lord Harry, it looks very like it," exclaimed the captain. "To judge from
                  the circumstances, one would suppose Providence had certainly some hand in it. But
                  we must try to get through the business of the court a little faster, or we shall
                  have to stay here all night. Witness," he continued, again resuming the
                  examination, "I have another question to ask before I dismiss you. Can you
                  remember what day it was Miss Lee first missed her rosary?"
               "I cannot, sir, exactly; but I think it was on or about the time Mr. Weeks paid
                  his first visit to the lighthouse."
               "Yes; about that time, you think—you can't swear to the day?"
               "No; I can't swear to that—but Miss Lee is here present; ye can ask her."
               The captain hesitated a moment—at a loss whether to call on Mary for her testimony
                  in presence of so many spectators, or
                  suffer the circumstance to pass unnoticed, and come to some conclusion respecting
                  the cabin boy without further delay. His deliberation, however, was suddenly
                  interrupted by the sheriff, who now rose and begged to be permitted to leave with
                  his prisoner as soon as possible—it being late in the afternoon, and the distance
                  to Lifford jail some six hours' travel.
               "What's the amount of the debt?" demanded Else, interrupting the captain, who was
                  about to reply to the sheriff. "Mr. Lee shan't leave here the night in your
                  costidy if I can help it. How much is the debt?"
               The sheriff, looking for an instant at the execution, named the sum.
               "Humph!" ejaculated Else, running her hand down into her pocket and drawing out
                  her wallet—"humph! the sum's big, but I've enough here to pay it."
               "You?"
               "Ay, me. Hah, hah! Isn't a witch's money as good as a queen's, if it's current?
                  Mr. Weeks there will tell ye these notes came fresh from the bank; hah, hah!"
               "Why, how's this?" demanded the captain; "how did you come by this large amount of
                  money?"
               "That's not a fair question, captain, and I'm not bound to answer it; but to plaze
                  ye, I'll tell ye: I got eighty pounds of it from that gentleman there, Mr. Weeks,
                  for sarvices rendered, an the rest here in goold I saved from my husband's
                  earnins. Here, Misther Sheriff, count out yer money, and let the prisoner go."
               The sheriff took the bills and gold, and laid them on the table; then counting
                  over the amount marked on the back of the execution, he receipted for the same,
                  and handed the document, with the balance of the money, over to the witness.
               While this transaction was passing, the whole audience seemed in commotion; every
                  one expressing his astonishment to his neighbor, that a woman of so infamous a
                  character as the fortune-teller of the Cairn, should thus part with the gold she
                  loved so much to save a comparative stranger from the hands of the law. Even the
                  light-keeper himself was taken completely by surprise, and the magistrates looked
                  at one another, and shook their heads, as if they suspected some mischief at the
                  bottom of it. As the sheriff was about to consign the bills to his pocket-book, a
                  sudden thought seemed to strike him, and drawing out a small bank detector, he
                  laid it before him, and took up one of the notes to examine it.
               "Humph!" he ejaculated, after a pause of considerable length; "I might have
                  suspected as much. Witness, let me see that note of hand and execution for a
                  moment—I fear I made a mistake."
               "Too late, sheriff," responded the old woman—"too late; but if the fragments 'd be
                  of any use to ye, they're here at my feet."
               "Any thing wrong?" inquired the chairman.
               "Yes, sir; these notes are counterfeits on the Bank of Dublin."
               "Counterfeits!"
               "Not a doubt of it, sir. The Dublin Bank, in its last circular, cautions the
                  public against tens and twenties, counterfeits of its new plates; and here," he
                  added, handing the detector and one of the notes up to the bench, "you can see in
                  an instant the plate is a forgery."
               The captain examined it for a moment, and then turning to the witness, demanded to
                  know if she could affirm on oath these notes were given her by Mr. Weeks.
               "I protest against putting that question to a woman of such disreputable
                  character," cried Hardwrinkle, "and but this moment convicted of an attempt to
                  pass counterfeit money. I object to the question."
               Those of the spectators within hearing of this unexpected disclosure, who happened
                  to have had any dealings with Weeks during his short stay in the neighborhood, now
                     began to feel alarmed; and one of
                  them, a dealer in dry goods, who had furnished him with fishing tackle, gaffs,
                  landing nets, &c., stood up and begged to inform the bench he had now in his
                  possession a bank note from Weeks in payment for goods delivered, and prayed the
                  chairman to examine it.
               The latter took the paper, and, after looking at it for a moment, pronounced it an
                  impression from the same plate.
               "Here's another, plase yer honor," cried a little tailor, who had mounted on the
                  shoulders of his neighbors, and flourished a bill over the heads of the audience;
                  "here's another I got from Mr. Hardwrinkle, and I'm afeerd it's of the same
                  family."
               "Send it up."
               The tailor's note, like the haberdasher's, proved also to be a counterfeit.
               "Clerk," said the captain, "make out a warrant instantly for the arrest of Ephraim
                  C. B. Weeks, in the name of the state, on a charge of having uttered counterfeit
                  money."
               "And I," said the light-keeper, "as Mary Lee's guardian, charge Ephraim C. B.
                  Weeks with having stolen that young lady's rosary from my house at Araheera
                  Head."
               "Clerk, when you have made out the warrant, take Mr. Lee's deposition. Witness,"
                  he added, motioning to Else Curley, "you have done—you may retire."
               "Ay, ay," muttered Else, drawing the hood of her old gray cloak over her head as
                  she turned to leave the witness stand; "I'll retire now, but there's more work to
                  be done yit afore the sun sets. Let the wrong-doers luck to themselves."
               "Stop, woman! for whom is that threat intended?" demanded Hardwrinkle.
               "Ask yer own conscience," replied Else, halting on her step, and casting back a
                  look of intense hatred at her persecutor; "ask yer own conscience, if ye have any.
                  All I say to ye now, Robert Hardwrinkle—luck to yerself, for God will soon call ye
                  to yer reckonin;" and so saying, the old woman slowly descended the steps, and
                  silently took her place close by the dock where Randall Barry stood patiently
                  awaiting his doom.
               The reader, perhaps, may think it strange that such insulting language as Else
                  Curley uttered during her examination should have been permitted in a court of
                  justice; but it must be remembered that Else bore the reputation of witch and
                  sorceress, and in that character claimed for herself privileges and immunities
                  which no ordinary woman would dare have aspired to. Besides, she was well aware
                  that as long as Captain Petersham presided in court, she had little reason to fear
                  Hardwrinkle's resentment. In addition to all this, however, Else Curley was
                  naturally a bold, fearless woman. Her look, her speech, her very gait proclaimed
                  her such the moment she appeared. Supercilious to her equals, she was as arrogant
                  in her intercourse with those above her; and very likely had the judges of assize
                  presided in that court house, surrounded by all the pomp and circumstance of
                  supreme judicial power, instead of humble county magistrates, Else's conduct
                  towards Hardwrinkle would have undergone but little change.
               "Miss Lee," said the chairman, when Else had retired, "I regret exceedingly to be
                  obliged to call on you for testimony in this case, or rather, that your uncle's
                  deposition, just made, requires it. But you will perceive it's a matter of grave
                  importance, and needs a thorough and patient investigation. Have the goodness, if
                  you please, to take the witness stand."
               As Mary rose and advanced, leaning on Kate's arm, her whole frame trembled, and
                  her heart seemed to sink within her at the thought of being exposed and questioned
                  before so many spectators. In passing the dock where Randall Barry stood shackled,
                  patiently awaiting his trial, she raised her handkerchief to her face, under her
                  veil, as if to hide it more effectually from her lover's gaze, and timidly
                  ascended the platform.
               
               The moment the audience saw the graceful figure of the young witness, and heard it
                  whispered about she was the light-keeper's daughter, a general rush was made in
                  the direction of the bench. Those in front forced their way along the passages
                  either side the council table, and, despite the threats and efforts of both
                  policemen and magistrates, succeeded in obtaining positions where they could
                  behold the far-famed beauty of Araheera Head.
               "Your name is Mary Lee—is it not?" began the captain, after silence was again
                  restored.
               "Yes, sir."
               "Will the witness have the goodness to remove her veil?" said Hardwrinkle.
               Mary trembled as she heard the words, but made no motion to comply with the
                  order.
               "I must insist upon it, however painful."
               "Miss Lee, I fear you must gratify the gentleman in this little matter," said the
                  captain. "According to the usage of the court, the witness should uncover the face
                  during examination. I had hoped, indeed, Mr. Hardwrinkle, under the painful
                  circumstances of the case, might have waived this point of court etiquette; but I
                  find I have been mistaken."
               Mary slowly raised her veil, and, with trembling hands, laid it gently over her
                  shoulder. As she did so, a murmur of admiration broke from the crowd of
                  spectators, like that we sometimes hear at public exhibitions, when the covering
                  is removed from the face of a beautiful statue.
               "God bless me! how lovely she is!" exclaimed one of the magistrates, unconscious
                  of what he said, and gazing on her face as if it had been a vision.
               And well he might gaze, for never saw he such a form and face before. And yet it
                  was not so much in those features, so perfectly moulded by the plastic hand of
                  Nature, that her beauty lay, as in the angelic blush and unaffected modesty with
                  which her pure soul had so radiantly suffused them.
               Dear reader, this lovely girl was a child of Mary—an humble, gentle servant of the
                  Mother of Jesus. And there lay the great secret of her beauty. The perfection of
                  her features nature gave her, but that which defies all the art of the sculptor or
                  the painter—that inexpressible charm which animated them—was the gift of
                  religion.
               Looking at this exquisite being, as she stood there before the admiring multitude,
                  her eyes cast down, and her cheeks covered with blushes, one could hardly help
                  thinking of those fine lines of Williams's Sister of Charity:— 
                     
                        Thy soothing how gentle! thy pity how tender!
                        Choir-music thy voice is, thy step angel grace,
                        And thy union with Deity shrines in a splendor
                        Subdued, but unearthly, thy spiritual face.
                     
                  
               
               "Miss Lee, have the goodness to look at this, and see if you can recognize it,"
                  resumed the captain, handing her the rosary.
               After a moment's examination, she replied in the negative.
               "Any marks by which you can distinguish it from yours?"
               "Mine, sir," she replied, "was much more worn than this."
               "Ah! from constant use, I suppose," said the captain.
               Mary kept her eyes cast down, but said nothing in reply.
               "Don't blush, my child, don't blush; you love your religion, and practise it. I
                  wish to Heaven we could all say as much for ourselves. As to the devotion of the
                  rosary, though I'm far from being a Catholic myself, I look upon it as the most
                  beautiful devotion in the world."
               "Thank you, captain," said the priest; "thank you for your generous testimony.
                  You'll find," he added, "before very long, there's a charm in the rosary you
                  little suspected. The Immaculate Virgin, whom that spotless creature has so long
                  served with such tender affection, will not suffer her love to go unrequited."
               
               "I don't know, but by the Lord Harry," responded the burly captain, "I'm beginning
                  to think there's some mysterious influence at work;" and he hitched
                  his chair a little closer to the desk, as if he felt an increasing interest in the
                  investigation.
               "And now, Miss Lee, can you inform the bench when you missed the rosary?"
               "On the 12th of ——"
               "From what place?"
               "From an old family Bible, in which I usually kept it."
               "Did you make a thorough search for it?"
               "Yes, sir."
               "Did you see Mr. Weeks, here present, at the lighthouse on that day?"
               "I did, sir."
               "Where—in what part of the house?"
               "In the parlor."
               "Was it in that room you kept the Bible?"
               "Yes, sir."
               "Did any other person visit the lighthouse on that day?"
               "A gentleman called, but did not enter the parlor."
               "I have but one more question to ask, Miss Lee. Are you of opinion that some one
                  not a member of your family took or stole the rosary?"
               "I am, sir."
               "Whom do you suspect?"
               "I know of no one who could have taken it but the gentleman I saw in the
                  parlor."
               "That's enough, Miss Lee—you may retire," said the captain, leaning back in his
                  chair. "Gentlemen," he continued, addressing his associates, "the testimony of the
                  sick girl, Mr. Hardwrinkle's servant, who found the rosary on the floor of Weeks's
                  room, the morning after his first visit to the lighthouse, and Miss Lee's
                  corroborative evidence, make the case a pretty clear one against Weeks; and as it
                  comes within our jurisdiction, being but a case of petty theft, we must commit
                  him, and send the forgery affair up to a higher court."
               "Hold on a minute," exclaimed the Yankee; "you ain't a-goin to commit me, I
                  expect, without hearing me in my own defence?"
               "Well, sir, go on," replied the chairman; "proceed, but don't be long about it,
                  for we haven't much time to spare. This trial has taken up too much of our time
                  already."
               "Well," said Weeks, gathering in his legs and rising to his feet, "I can't say I
                  know much of English law, though I do think I'm pretty well posted up in law of
                  the States. But, gents, I've got a sorter notion—well, I may be mistaken, ye
                  know—but still, I've got a sorter notion that there's no law to be found in any
                  civilized country in the world to punish a man when he hain't committed no crime.
                  I guess that's a point won't admit of much dispute, any how. Well, let's see now
                  what injustice I have committed. There's Miss Lee to begin with; I hain't stolen
                  her rosary. I took it, I allow—inadvertently put it in my pocket; but I had no
                  intention of stealing it, not a mite. We Yankees ain't a given to hooking, as a
                  general thing; it ain't our nature. We speklate once in a while beyond our
                  capital, and come it over greenhorns now and then in the way of trade, but hooking
                  ain't a Yankee trick, no how, specially such a tid-re-eye consarn as that. I
                  acknowledge I took it, gents, and you may do what you've a mind to about it; but
                  as for hooking the affair, I swonnie I never thought of it from the time I left
                  the lighthouse till cousin Rebecca showed me the darned thing a day or two after,
                  and called me a Papist in disguise for having it in my possession. Now, as to this
                  old lady here, she hain't got nothing to complain of either, that I know of. The
                  hull amount of the matter is, she did nothing for me, and I paid her nothing ing; ain't that so, gents? Ha, ha! the
                  old thing thought she was smart—and so she is a darn'd sight smarter than I took
                  her for—but she forgot she had a Yankee to deal with;" and Weeks shut one eye as
                  he spoke, and thrust his hands down into his breeches pockets—"she forgot she'd a
                  Yankee to deal with, a live Yankee, with his eye peeled, and fresh from
                  Connecticut."
               Here the magistrates, after commanding silence several times, (for the audience
                  got so tickled at Weeks's language and gestures they could no longer restrain
                  themselves,) at length broke out into a loud laugh, the captain's fat sides
                  shaking as he turned to and fro to say a merry word to the priest or his next
                  neighbor on the bench.
               "Silence, you rascals down below there," he cried, when he recovered himself.
                  "Can't a man speak without a brogue on his tongue, but you must laugh at him?
                  Silence, and let the man be heard."
               "Stand him up, captain, jewel; stand him up on the table—we can't hear him,"
                  responded several voices in the crowd.
               "Up with him! up with him!" now became the general cry, and Weeks, in the midst of
                  the uproar, mounted the table, and trusting to his own resources to elicit
                  sympathy from the audience, boldly resumed his defence.
               "Well," said he, pulling up his shirt collar and pushing back his long sandy hair
                  behind his ears, as he looked round the hall—"well, ladies and gents, I guess I
                  hain't got a great deal more to say. All of you know pretty much by this time that
                  I'm a stranger in these parts, and I know, on the other hand, you're Irish to a
                  man. Well, I ain't a-goin to make the inference—no, I leave that to yourselves.
                  All I shall say is, the Irish at hum and abroad are famous for their hospitality
                  to the stranger."
               "Be aisy, avourneen," said somebody near the door; "be aisy now, and don't be
                  tryin to soft soap us that way. Don't ye remimber the weddin at Ballymagahy?"
               "Well, there!" exclaimed Weeks, turning round to look.
               "Who's that?" demanded the captain.
               "By thunder! if it ain't the tarnal rascal again!"
               "Who?"
               "Lanty Hanlon, if he's alive."
               "Impossible—the police are now in pursuit of him."
               "Well, pursuit or not," replied Weeks, "if he's out of limbo, that's he, or I
                  ain't Ephraim C. B. Weeks."
               "Police, see who that fellow is," said the captain.
               "Lanty Hanlon's the man, and no mistake," repeated Weeks. "I could swear to his
                  voice on the top of Mount Tom."
               "Ho there! at the door below! has the detachment from Milfred arrived?" demanded
                  Hardwrinkle.
               The answer came up in the affirmative.
               "Then let search be made instantly for Lanty Hanlon. You, sergeant, hold a warrant
                  for his arrest—see that he escape not, at your peril."
               "What! how's this?" demanded Captain Petersham—"a reënforcement without my
                  knowledge or consent?"
               "I apprehended a riot and rescue of the prisoner," replied Hardwrinkle.
               "Ha! a rescue!" and the captain turned to look at the young outlaw. "Rescue a man
                  with a broken arm, under charge of constables! What, shackled, too!—good heavens!
                  this is barbarous. Constable, remove those irons—off with them instantly. What!
                  chained like a felon, even before he is found guilty!"
               "He's a bold, daring fellow," pleaded Hardwrinkle.
               "Psaugh! psaugh! sir, your explanation only makes the matter worse. Your conduct's
                  a disgrace to this bench, sir, and an outrage on the feelings of your brother
                  magistrates."
               "Hush, hush! captain," remonstrated the priest, laying his hand on his friend's
                  arm and speaking low. "You must take another time and place to rebuke Mr.
                  Hardwrinkle."
               
               "No, sir, I shall not," replied the indignant captain. "This is the proper time
                  and place to rebuke him; and I tell him now, here in open court, that his conduct
                  throughout this whole affair has been both unchristian and ungentlemanly."
               "Captain Petersham, you know I'm a man of peace," said Hardwrinkle, "or you would
                  hardly dare to utter such language here."
               "Dare!" and the captain turned on him such a look as might have withered him
                  up.
               "I shall quit the court under protest," said Hardwrinkle, rising, "since neither
                  the law nor the feelings of a gentleman are respected here."
               "Not an inch, sir. Move but one step from where you stand, and I commit you."
               "What! commit me?"
               "Ay, you, sir, for conspiring with your worthy cousin there to carry off by force
                  and violence the person of Mary Lee, in an open boat from Araheera Head to
                  Malinmore, in the event of her not consenting to the marriage. I have now, sir, in
                  my possession due information to that effect, sworn by two of the very men you
                  engaged to execute that damnable design."
               "The charge is false," said Hardwrinkle, but in tones so low and husky that the
                  very sounds spoke his guilt.
               "And that no time might be lost," pursued the captain, without noticing the
                  denial,—"that no time might be lost, the young lady was to have been carried off
                  this very night, as soon as the sheriff had removed her uncle, and no one left to
                  protect her, in that remote and desolate spot, but her old and feeble servant,
                  Roger O'Shaughnessy."
               Here a murmur of indignation ran through the audience, and every eye turned on
                  Hardwrinkle. That gentleman made no reply, however, but after a moment's
                  reflection quietly resumed his seat, as if he had made up his mind to bear his
                  sufferings with the patience and humility of a martyr.
               During the interruption, Weeks stood on the table, or platform, with his hands
                  driven down into his breeches pockets, and apparently as little concerned at what
                  was passing as if Hardwrinkle had not been "a drop's blood to him in the world."
                  Even when the charge of conspiring to carry off Mary Lee was made against that
                  respectable relation, he hitched up his shoulders, and jingled the silver as
                  usual, but showed no sign of either surprise or resentment. At length, however,
                  silence was restored, and, at a nod from the chairman, Weeks again pulled up his
                  shirt collar and resumed his defence.
               "Well, ladies and gents, I ain't a-goin to detain you long. No; speech-making
                  ain't in my line; but still, you know, every man should be able to tell his own
                  story. Well, as to this darn'd old critter here, half devil, half catamount, I
                  guess I have given a pretty considerable fair account of my transaction with
                  her—well, enough to show I hain't done her no wrong, any how. Then, as to the dry
                  goods man, let him produce his bill, and if I hain't paid him the full value of
                  his goods already in pure gold, independent of the fifty dollar note, why, I'm
                  ready to suffer the consequences; that's all. I calklate, gents, to give every man
                  his due, but dang a copper more; and if I find a man tryin to impose on me, I
                  manage, some how or other, to pay him off in his own coin. I repeat it, gents, let
                  this dry goods man, who supplied me with fishing tackle and all that sorter thing,
                  let him stand up here and produce his bill. That's plain talk; ain't it, gents?
                  Well, then, all that remains now, is to account for my transaction with Mr.
                  Hardwrinkle here about that note. It goes agin me to do it, it does—that's a fact;
                  but considering the fix I've got into, I feel bound to go through with it. Mr.
                  Hardwrinkle may feel a little put out about it, I guess, but he's here, you know,
                  on his own soil, while I'm a stranger, and nothing to depend on but the bare
                  truth. Besides, this is about the last
                  day, I reckon, I can spend conveniently in this section of the country, and for
                  the sake of New England, should like to leave it with a good name."
               "And why wudn't ye, asthore—by the powers, ye earned it richly,"
                  said some one close by, in a stage whisper. "Faith, yer a credit to the country ye
                  came from, avourneen."
               "Silence, there," commanded the chairman, hardly able to suppress a laugh;
                  "silence, there, and respect the court."
               "Go ahead," cried Weeks, "whoever you be; go ahead; I'll wait till you've got
                  through. I ain't in no hurry."
               "Proceed, Mr. Weeks, and don't mind the fellow."
               "Well, the hull amount of the matter is, the note cost Mr. Hardwrinkle nothing,
                  not the first brass cent; he got it from a Dublin attorney on commission, to make
                  the most he could on't."
               Hardwrinkle here attempted to interrupt him, but the captain interposed, and the
                  speaker continued.
               "I ain't surprised at Mr. Hardwrinkle's gettin riled, not a mite, for I swonnie it
                  looks kinder mean in me to talk so after enjoying his hospitality; but I've got
                  into a sorter snarl, gents, you see, about this here marriage concern, and I must
                  tell the truth, for I don't see any other chance of getting out of it. Well, then,
                  to be plain about it, we had an under standing—Mr. Hardwrinkle and I had—well, it
                  was just like this: if we succeeded in getting rid of Lee by means of the note,
                  and could then induce the young lady to marry right straight off, or, if she
                  refused, to carry her off to the nearest place we could catch a vessel bound for
                  the States—I say, if we succeeded in this, Mr. Hardwrinkle was to have ten
                  thousand dollars cash, and I run the risk of the note, succeed or fail."
               "Scoundrel!" ejaculated Hardwrinkle, hissing the words between his teeth.
                  "Gentlemen, this is the most outrageous falsehood——"
               "Psaugh! hold on a bit—don't get riled, Cousin Robert."
               "But what could I expect, when the fellow's ignorant of the very first principles
                  of religion?"
               "Do say! Well, I never made much pretension about it, you know, cousin, and so you
                  couldn't expect much from me in that line; but for you, who's praying and reading
                  the Bible most part the time through the week, and Sabbath especially, why, it was
                  going it a leetle mite too strong to try to do me out that note—worn't it now,
                  Cousin Robert? By crackie, Bob, for a pious, God-fearing man, you're about as
                  smart a one as I've met since I left Connecticut; you are, I swow; no mistake
                  about it. But, gents, I don't see no use now in talking over the matter further. I
                  was a-goin to produce Mr. Hardwrinkle's letters to me before I left the States
                  about this here marriage, to show you I ain't the only one to blame in the
                  transaction; but I guess it's just as well to let the matter drop as it is. As
                  regards the speculation I came here on, why, all can be said about it is, I
                     failed—that's the amount of it. The fact is, gents, I always heard the
                  Irish were an almighty green sort of folks, both at hum and abroad, and thought a
                  Yankee, specially a Connecticut Yankee, had nothing to do but go right straight
                  along soon's he got among them; but I find now I made a slight mistake in that
                  respect. It ain't so, gents; the Irish at hum ain't so green by a long chalk as
                  some I've met in Vermont."
               "Nor all the Yankees so smart as they think," added the captain, smiling.
               "Well, sometimes we get sniggled, you know, like the rest of folks. Well, it's
                  just like this: we hain't got to our full growth yet, but give us fifty years more
                  to get our eye teeth cut, and I tell you what, captain, should like to see the
                  foreigner then could come the blind side of us; that man 'd be a caution, I tell
                  ye. As for Mr. Hardwrinkle here, I don't wonder he's smart, for he belongs to a
                  pretty considerable smart kinder family. Well, he's got a cousin in Ducksville, name of Weeks, said to be about as
                  smart a man as you can scare up in that section of the country; and still he
                  hain't been a hundred miles from home, I guess, all his life time."
               "Brother of yours, I suppose," said the captain.
               "Well, no, he ain't."
               "I thought, being a Ducksville man, and a cousin of Mr. Hardwrinkle's here, he
                  might be your brother, or cousin, at least."
               "No, not exactly; he's much about the same, though, we've always been so intimate.
                  It was he first told me of his relations here, the Hardwrinkles."
               "First told you! What, did you not know that already?"
               "No; can't say I did."
               "Are you not Mr. Hardwrinkle's cousin?"
               "Not that I know of."
               "Not that you know of! Why, how's this? Have you not passed for a cousin of Mr.
                  Hardwrinkle's since you came to reside here?"
               "Well, yes, pretty much, I guess."
               "Pretty much! Why, sir——"
               "Hold on," said Weeks, "hold on a moment, captain; I can explain that, too, quite
                  to your satisfaction, I reckon. The Weeks family, then, you must know, and ourn
                  were terrible intimate, being next neighbors for a little more than twenty
                  years—well, the fact is, we got to be so intimate we never made any difference
                  with respect to relationship, or that sorter thing—not a mite."
               "Stop; you don't apprehend the question, I suspect; I want you, sir, to tell us in
                  plain terms, and briefly as possible, whether you are, or are not, a relative of
                  Mr. Robert Hardwrinkle here present;" and the captain motioned to the latter
                  gentleman, who, to the infinite merriment of the beholders, kept gazing at the
                  Yankee in undisguised astonishment.
               "Well, come to think of it," replied Weeks, as if he had been trying hard to
                  recollect himself, "come to think of it, I guess there is some relationship."
               "You guess there is!"
               "Yes, I rather think so—by marriage."
               "Mr. Weeks," said Hardwrinkle, "remember you are now in a court of justice."
               "Allow me, Mr. Hardwrinkle," interposed the chairman; "I shall finish in a minute
                  or two. Your turn comes next. You say you guess there is some
                  relationship by marriage, Mr. Weeks."
               "Yes; one of the Weeks married a Bigelow, if I don't greatly mistake, somewhere
                  about the end of the revolutionary war or thereaway. I kinder think Uncle Nathan
                  used to——"
               "Stop, stop, sir! Confound you and Uncle Nathan. You can't speak a sentence, sir,
                  but you have Uncle Nathan at the head and tail of it. Answer at once, sir; are you
                  or are you not a cousin of Mr. Hardwrinkle's?"
               "Why, as to blood relationship, I guess there ain't much of that to speak of. But
                  still it amounts to pretty much the same thing in the end. The Weeks and Bigelows
                  were always in and out, you know, like one family. And then young Ephraim and I—or
                  Eph, as we used to call him 'bout the doors—went to school together for eight or
                  ten years, and never kept a secret from one another more than if we had been twin
                  brothers."
               "Well, by the Lord Harry," cried the captain, turning to his associates, "if this
                  ain't the coolest fellow I've met in my day! And so," he continued, looking at the
                  imperturbable Yankee, "it turns out at last there's no relationship at all between
                  you!"
               "No, guess not, except by marriage. Still, it's much about the same thing. The
                  Weeks have always been as intimate with us as cousins could be. Well, in fact we
                  were cousins in every thing but the near blood."
               "Ha, ha!" laughed the captain; "this is capital, eh! Not only outwitted your
                  friend here by passing counterfeit bills, but passed yourself off, too, as his American cousin, eating and drinking of
                  the best in his house. Ha, ha! by George, that beats Bannaher."—Here the audience,
                  at length fully comprehending how matters stood, broke out into a general laugh,
                  in the midst of which a curly-headed fellow, mounting on a window-sill, waved his
                  hat and shouted at the top of his voice, "More power to ye, Weeks, more power to
                  ye, Mabonchal."
               "'Pon my conscience, captain, jewel, it's chaired he ought to be, instid of sint
                  to jail," cried another.
               The chairman now rose to command silence in the court, but was met with cheers for
                  Weeks and groans for Hardwrinkle. "Hurrah for the bowld Yankee—down with the black
                  sarpint."
               "Order! police, keep order there below! Silence, you vagabonds, silence!" cried
                  the captain; "this is pretty conduct in a court of justice."
               "Send him out till we chair him, captain, send him out; he desarves it for puttin
                  the 'Leek' in Black Robert."
               The police, after several efforts, at length succeeded in restoring silence, and
                  the chairman was about to take up the charge against Randall Barry, when Weeks,
                  who still coolly maintained his position in front of the bench, his hands, as
                  usual, driven down into his pockets, begged leave to say a word or two before he
                  left.
               "I shan't keep you long," he said; "no, a word or two is all I've got to say. I
                  came to this country, gents, as most of you know by this time, on a matrimonial
                  speculation. Well, I failed—I did—no mistake about that. Now, then, gents, all I
                  ask in return for my loss of time and money—not to speak of several mishaps in
                  trying to put the thing through—is simply this: that you won't let the darned
                  affair get into the newspapers. I'm a Yankee, gents, a full-blooded Yankee, of the
                  old Puritan stock, and should hate, of all things, to have it known that a New
                  Englander—and a Connecticut man at that—could be taken in by the Irish. I swonnie,
                  I'd rather put for Texas right straight off, than return to the States, and find
                  it published all over the country; I would by a long chalk. Why, I should ever
                  after be looked on as a disgrace to Yankee land. So, as I said before, I'm willing
                  to put up with the hull of it if you only promise me this tarnal trial shan't get
                  into the newspapers."
               "Cool again," said the captain; "put up with it indeed! Any thing more to
                  say?"
               "No, I've got through, I guess."
               "Very well, sir. Constable, take this man in charge."
               "Hold on a minute," cried Weeks.
               "Take him away."
               "See here! Hold on! Hain't you made a mistake? What's the crime?"
               "Passing counterfeit notes on the National Bank."
               "But who's cheated, I should like to know?"
               "Away with him," commanded the captain.
               "Look here!"
               "Silence, sir, and quit the stand instantly."
               "Well, now, I swonnie, if this ain't going it a leetle too strong,"
                  muttered Weeks, as he stepped from the platform, in the hands of the constable. "I
                  ain't gone to the county house yet, though! No, I sorter reckon not. By crackie,
                  captain, you'd better look out, for I tell you what, my dear fellow, you'll find
                  it no joking matter to incarcerate a citizen of the United States——" The remainder
                  of the sentence was lost in the murmurs of applause which greeted him from the
                  audience.
               And now the captain was about to call the witnesses in the case against Randall
                  Barry, when the cabin boy rose, and, in feeble accents, begged to have the negro
                  liberated.
               "It can't be," replied the captain. "You or he must first acknowledge on what
                  plantation you lived in Virginia, and from whom you got this rosary, found on your
                  person."
               "There's no longer cause for keeping the secret," said the boy, "as Mr. Bigelow is
                  committed for forgery."
               
               "Bigelow! Soh, ho! then his real name is Bigelow."
               "Yes; he was always called Bigelow on the plantation."
               "Did you know him there?"
               "He did so," exclaimed Weeks, again making his appearance before the bench, "he
                  did so; no mistake about that; many a good lickin I gave him. I'll give you the
                  whole history——"
               "Gag that fellow, constable, gag the rascal," cried the captain; "nothing else
                  will stop his tongue."
               "Hold on a minute."
               "Silence, sir, and sit down."
               "See here, captain; don't get put out with me. Natty there's sick, and I want to
                  save him the trouble of talking. Besides, I should like to have the credit of
                  telling the hull story myself. Well, the amount of the matter is, the boy and the
                  negro both belong to Mr. Talbot's plantation, in Virginia, and ran away. I was
                  sent after them to hunt them up, and, as if all h—had a hand in it, here they come
                  to this here place of all other spots in creation, to blow the hull secret."
               "Heaven, you should have said, sir," observed the captain.
               "Heaven or h—; call it what you've a mind to; but that tarnal, danged rosary has
                  discovered all."
               "Yes, sir; Heaven has made use of your villany to requite the very person you
                  would have made its victim for her piety and devotion to the Mother of God. Your
                  scoundrelism, and that of your associate here, have, under the direction of
                  Providence, resulted in the restoration of a loving child to the arms of a
                  long-lost parent. Miss Lee, I congratulate you most sincerely on the happy issue
                  of this trial, and pray God you may live long—as you have lived ever since I had
                  the happiness of knowing you—the pride and ornament of your sex."
               "God bless her! God bless the dear girl!" now resounded from all parts of the
                  court house, while the lovely object of congratulation was herself shedding tears
                  of gratitude to the mother of orphans in the arms of Kate Petersham.
               "And now to the prisoner in the dock—who demands his committal?" inquired the
                  captain.
               "I do," responded Hardwrinkle; "I demand it in the name of the state. Clerk, call
                  Sergeant Joseph Muller. Swear him."
               As the latter came up to the stand, Hardwrinkle pointed to the prisoner. "Have you
                  seen that man before?"
               "I have, sir."
               "What is his name?"
               "Randall Joseph Barry."
               "Do you swear that?" said the captain.
               "I do."
               "What! did you see him baptized?"
               "No; but I was brought up within a stone's throw of his father's house."
               "Gentlemen," said the prisoner, interrupting the witness, "it's quite unnecessary
                  to proceed further in this examination. My name is Randall Joseph Barry; I am a
                  rebel to the British government, and the same individual for whose capture the
                  reward of three hundred pounds is now offered by the crown. I have no defence to
                  make, and I ask no favors. Proceed, if it so please you, to make out my
                  committal."
               "Fool!" ejaculated Else Curley.
               "Young man, the court does not expect you to make admissions likely to criminate
                  yourself," said the chairman, casting a reproachful look at the prisoner.
               "He has avowed himself a rebel," said Hardwrinkle; "he is therefore unbailable,
                  and now I demand he be committed forthwith to Lifford jail."
               "Have you any thing to say in your vindication," said the captain; "if you have,
                  we shall hear you patiently."
               "Nothing," promptly responded the young outlaw. "I have deliberately done that
                  which British law declares to be a crime, and am now willing to suffer the
                  consequences. Had I effected my escape to a foreign land, as was my purpose," (and
                  whilst he uttered the words, his eyes involuntarily turned in the direction of Mary Lee, the sole cause of his
                  detention,) "had I effected my escape, I should have been there no
                  less an enemy and a rebel to the British government than I am here on my native
                  soil, nor cease for one single day of my life to compass its overthrow."
               "Lost! lost!" exclaimed some one under the bench, in tones so heart-rending that
                  every eye turned in the direction of the voice. It was poor Mary Lee—she had
                  fainted in the arms of Kate Petersham.
               At a single bound the prisoner cleared the dock, and stood beside her breathless
                  form, as it reclined against that of her affectionate companion.
               Instantly the uproar and confusion became so great that Hardwrinkle rose and
                  commanded the police to advance and arrest the prisoner.
               "Back!" cried Randall; his dark eye flashing under the excitement of the
                  scene—"back, slaves; I have no intention to escape;" and he waved his hand at the
                  police, as they rushed forward to secure him.
               "Forward, fellows! What stops you, when I give the order?" repeated
                  Hardwrinkle.
               "Hold!" said Captain Petersham. "Not an inch further. I command here. Constables,
                  keep your places."
               "Mary," whispered Randall, stooping over her—"one word—speak to me but one word,
                  and then we part."
               "Part!" murmured the gentle girl, opening her eyes, and looking lovingly into his;
                  "O Randall! Randall! has it come to this?"
               "Hush, dear Mary; hush!" whispered Kate; "it may all be well yet—hush—you have a
                  friend coming you little dreamed of."
               "Good by, Mary; good by! We shall never meet again," said Randall, his face
                  quivering with emotion, as he uttered the words. "You have at length found a
                  father, who will love and protect you as I would have done."
               "O, stay! do not leave me," said Mary; "the queen will pardon you. She is so good.
                  O, no, no; you shall not leave me—never."
               "It cannot be," said Randall—"my doom is the gallows—for pardon I shall never
                  ask."
               "Back with ye! back with ye! hell hounds, give way," now came ringing out in tones
                  as clear as a trumpet, from a stout, curly-headed fellow, at the head of some
                  dozen others, cleaving their way through the crowd, and smashing heads and
                  bayonets with their blackthorns in their stormy passage. "Give way, ye dogs, give
                  way. To the rescue—corp au dhoul, to the rescue."
               "By the Lord Harry," exclaimed the captain, jumping to his feet, "there comes
                  Lanty Hanlon. I vow to Heaven it is. Well done, my gallant fellow, well done!"
               "O Lanty, you never failed me yet," said Kate, proudly. "My life on you for a
                  million."
               "Now comes the tug o' war," said the captain, whispering to the priest.
               "Police, do your duty," cried Hardwrinkle; his face no longer wearing its demure
                  aspect, but fired with passion at the danger of losing his victim, after whose
                  blood he had thirsted so long. "Do your duty! I command you."
               For a moment the outlaw looked round the court, as if to calculate his chances of
                  escape—in the next, he was driven forward in the centre of a group towards the
                  door.
               "Shoot them down!" vociferated Hardwrinkle, gesticulating furiously—"shoot down
                  the rebel and his rescuers."
               "Hold! hold!" commanded the chairman, in a voice of thunder. "The first man that
                  fires dies; he's not yet committed—hold your fire."
               By this time Lanty and his men had gained the side of the dock where Else Curley
                  stood, her arms folded as usual, and her keen, deep-sunken eye fixed on
                  Hardwrinkle. As they did, the whole detachment of police rushed from the door, despite the captain's orders, and
                  charged the rioters with fixed bayonets.
               "Surrender the prisoner, or we fire," cried the lieutenant. "I order you to
                  surrender, in the queen's name, instantly."
               "Cudn't ye wait till th' morrow?" said Lanty, sneeringly.
               "I again command you to surrender the prisoner," repeated the officer.
               But hardly had the words escaped his lips when a blow from behind felled him to
                  the ground, and then the riot commenced in good earnest.
               "Down with the Sassenach dogs!" shouted Lanty, making his staff play round him in
                  true Celtic fashion. "Down with them—corp au dhoul—drive them before
                  ye."
               Else Curley, at this moment, by some chance or other, succeeded in forcing her way
                  in amongst the combatants, and thrusting the silver-mounted pistol she carried
                  into Randall's breast, drew forth, herself, the old Spanish dagger, which the
                  reader saw once before at her cabin on the Cairn, and waved it in her brown
                  skeleton hand high over the heads of the rioters. "Come on!" she cried; "the young
                  lion is now with his dam, and see who'll dar injure a hair of his head. Come on!
                  let the enemy of my house and home come on, and see how soon this good steel 'll
                  drink his heart's blood. Away with him to the door, there, and balk the tiger of
                  his prey—away with him, my hearties!"
               Hardwrinkle now jumped from the bench, and calling on the police to stab the
                  prisoner and his rescuers, forced his way also in amongst the rioters, his eyes
                  flashing fire and his face flushed with intense passion. At this moment Randall
                  Barry, after breaking bayonet after bayonet with the pistol which he held still
                  undischarged in his hand, turned to defend himself from those in the rear, and met
                  Hardwrinkle face to face.
               "Rebel!" cried the latter, snatching a carabine from the next constable—"rebel,
                  traitor, enemy of your religion and your country, take now the punishment you
                  deserve;" and as he spoke he attempted to pull the trigger, but his hands trembled
                  so in the fury of his passion that he missed the spring. Next instant Else
                  Curley's long bony fingers had grasped him by the throat, and he fell backwards on
                  the flags of the court house, the musket exploding as it reached the floor.
               Lanty and his comrades had now fought their way bravely on, step by step, Randall
                  defending himself with his single arm against the repeated assaults of the
                  constables, and still reserving his fire, as if for a last emergency. It soon
                  came.
               They had succeeded, indeed, in driving the police before them out through the
                  court house door; but here the danger and difficulty increased, from the fact that
                  once beyond the threshold, Captain Petersham's authority ceased, as presiding
                  magistrate, and Hardwrinkle was at liberty to give what orders he pleased, if he
                  only assumed the responsibility. How he extricated himself from the hands of Else
                  Curley 'twould be impossible to say; but certain it is, that, much to the surprise
                  of the beholders, he was suddenly seen jumping from a window of the building down
                  on the low wall enclosing the yard, like one demented.
               "Fire!" he cried, as he alighted and glanced at the preparations made for Barry's
                  escape—his quick eye detecting in an instant the reason of Moll Pitcher being kept
                  there standing at the gate. "Fire!" he repeated; "on your lives let not the
                  prisoner escape—fire!"
               But he had come too late: Randall had already gained the outside of the yard,
                  borne on by his trusty defenders, foremost amongst whom fought Lanty, his head and
                  arms bleeding profusely from bayonet wounds, whilst Randall's own were hardly in a
                  better condition.
               Hardwrinkle saw there was but one chance remaining, namely, to intercept the
                  fugitive and detain him till the police could come up and arrest him; and making
                  all possible speed to where his horse stood in the hands of his groom, he mounted
                  and dashed past the gate in order to head the prisoner off.
               
               Randall, however, was already in the saddle. He had sprung to it by the strength
                  of his single arm, and instantly gathering up the reins, gave Moll the word. The
                  splendid creature, knowing well that something more than usual was expected of
                  her, reared for an instant, and then shot forward like an arrow, making the fire
                  fly from the pavement.
               "Glorious!" cried Lanty; "now for it! If horseflesh can save ye, Randall Barry,
                  it's Moll Pitcher."
               "Shoot him down! shoot him down!" vociferated Hardwrinkle, as he rode on before
                  the fugitive with the intention of wheeling round and intercepting him in his
                  flight.
               The words were hardly spoken, when three or four shots came in quick succession.
                  They did no mischief, however,—one of them slightly grazing Barry's cheek, while
                  the others went wide of their mark.
               The crowd now rushed through the gate and over the wall in wild confusion; some
                  throwing stones at the police, and others venting curses loud and deep against
                  Hardwrinkle and his Sassenach crew.
               Randall saw, as Hardwrinkle wheeled his horse to intercept him, that if he
                  happened to be detained but a second, he should, in all probability, fall by a
                  bullet from the police, before he could get out of musket range, and so, drawing
                  the pistol from his breast, he let the reins drop on his horse's neck, and
                  prepared himself for the worst. He had hardly done so when Hardwrinkle was up
                  within ten yards of him. "Keep off! keep off!" cried Randall, "or I fire."
               But his antagonist took no notice of the warning, and as he rushed on in the
                  blindness of his fury, Randall dropped the muzzle of his pistol, and shot his
                  horse through the head. "There, take your life," he cried; "I shall never have a
                  dastard's blood on my hands."
               The horse dropped instantly, the ball passing through his brain.
               And then rose a cheer wild and loud, that made the very heavens ring again, as
                  Randall was seen flying up the hill on Moll Pitcher, clear of all danger, his long
                  black hair floating on the breeze, and his broken arm still visible in the
                  sling.
               Whilst the crowd stood cheering and gazing after the young outlaw, Else Curley,
                  followed by several of the constables, hurried to the spot where Hardwrinkle had
                  fallen. Else was first on the ground. "Hah!" she cried, as if about to utter some
                  malediction, but suddenly stopped, and bent down to gaze on the face of the fallen
                  man.
               "What's the matter?—is he hurt?" demanded the constables.
               "Ay, he's hurt," responded Else, dryly.
               "He don't move—how's that?"
               "He's dead!"
               "The horse, you mean."
               "Horse and rider—they're both dead."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               
                  Weeks escapes in the Riot.—Is pursued by a Constable.—Climbs over a Wall,
                     leaving his Coat-tail behind him in the Constable's Hands, and finally
                     disappears.—Else takes her Leave, and retires to Benraven Mountain, there to
                     pass the Remainder of her Life.—Lanty Hanlon, in the Dress of an old Woman,
                     winds up the Story.—Postscript, which is Characteristic of the Author of the
                     Preface, terminates the Story in manner similar to that in which it began.
               
               ON examination, it was found that the unfortunate man had carried a small dirk or
                  stiletto in the breast pocket of his coat, which, having been displaced by the
                  fall, was driven by the crushing weight of the horse fairly through his heart— the animal dropping so suddenly as to
                  leave him no time to extricate his feet from the stirrups.
               Captain Petersham and his friends, on hearing the melancholy intelligence,
                  hastened to the scene of the disaster, and there found the body stretched on the
                  road, and surrounded by a gaping and wondering crowd.
               "Dead?" inquired the captain.
               "Yes, your honor," replied a policeman, touching his cap; "he's dead—this dagger
                  passed straight through his heart; I drew it out this moment."
               "Shocking!" exclaimed the priest, stooping and laying his hand on the forehead of
                  the corpse; "most shocking! Gone to meet his God without a moment's
                  preparation."
               "And in the very flush of his guilt," added the captain, gazing at the dead body.
                  "The victim of his own inveterate prejudices and his love of gold, for I'm very
                  much inclined to think the fear of losing his share of the reward had more to do
                  in driving him to this last act of desperation than his hatred of the young man.
                  Hand me the dagger. Kate, you and Mary had better leave here at once," he
                  continued, turning to his sister; "we shall call for you at Greenmount."
               "And bring Father Brennan with you," said Kate; "don't forget that."
               "No—but look you here, madcap; take care not to present Mary suddenly to Mr.
                  Guirkie, as he may lose his senses altogether; be prudent."
               As the captain took the dagger in his hand to examine it, Roger O'Shaughnessy, who
                  was standing by, touched him on the arm, and whispered in his ear, "That's Else
                  Curley's, yer honor."
               "This dagger!"
               "Yes, sir."
               "Else Curley's!—you must make a mistake, Roger."
               "No, sir, that's her old Spanish dagger. I'd know it amongst a thousand."
               "But how could it come into Mr. Hardwrinkle's possession?"
               "Ahem! I don't know that, yer honor; unless, whin he was strugglin with her on the
                  floor of the court house, he might have wrested it from her hands."
               "That accounts for it, then," said the priest. "I saw Else waving a dagger after
                  the riot commenced."
               "Humph! then he died by his enemy's weapon, though not by his enemy's hand—curious
                  enough, eh!"
               "Yes; and I'm very happy to think the poor old woman, after her long thirty years
                  of deadly enmity to the unfortunate man, is still guiltless of his death."
               "She's a desperate woman, Father Brennan—desperate."
               "True, she was always of a wild, ungovernable temper; but yet not half so bad as
                  she seemed. Her care and love of Mary Lee, the once houseless and homeless orphan,
                  and her fidelity to Randall Barry, in requital for his uncle's kindness at the
                  siege of Madeira, are enough to redeem worse women than Else Curley."
               "But where is she?" inquired the captain, looking round.
               "Where is she, indeed!—now that I think of it."
               "There she is," replied some one in the crowd. "There, beyont, yer honor, settin
                  on that stone, by the ditch, with the ould goat beside her."
               As the captain, followed by the priest and Dr. Henshaw, approached the old woman,
                  she seemed absorbed in deep thought; her head bent, and her folded arms resting on
                  her knees.
               "Else!" said the captain, touching her shoulder, to make her aware of his
                  presence. "Else Curley!"
               "Humph!" ejaculated the old woman, looking up slowly. "What's the matter?"
               "Come—you must go with us to Castle Gregory."
               "For what?"
               "We want to see you there."
               
               "Who wants to see me—you?"
               "All of us. Mary Lee, in particular, before she leaves. Besides, I should like to
                  make some better provision for your old days, than the cabin on the Cairn
                  affords."
               "No, no," said Else, rising and folding her gray cloak round her emaciated
                  shoulders,—"no—I'll go to see my foster-child afore she leaves Fanid; but I'll
                  niver quit the cabin till my bones are carried up to be laid with my sister's, in
                  Mass-mount churchyard. And that won't be long, either; for now, since the one I
                  loved best has found a father, and him I hated most a grave, I have nothing in
                  this world to live for. In regard to the ould cabin, it's but a dissolit spot to
                  look at, captain, but it's all the world to me. I lived in it so long, and ivry
                  rock and blade of heather about it got so familiar to my eyes, that if ye put me
                  in a palace, I'd steal back to it again."
               "But, Else, remember you're old," remonstrated the captain, "and will need some
                  one to take care of you."
               "Ay, ay, take care of me!" she said, with a melancholy smile. "Care 'd kill me
                  afore my time, captain, I'm so unused to it. No, no; as I lived alone, I'll die
                  alone."
               "But what of your soul, Else?" said the priest.
               "Ah!" she replied, "the weight that lay upon it for thirty years is at last
                  removed—and now I begin to feel life in it again."
               "Thank God, you're guiltless of the death by which that heavy load was removed, at
                  all events."
               "Amen," said Else; "amen. Three times did Mary Lee stand atween him and my
                  vengeance, and now, for the fourth, the thought of her kneelin to me at the
                  lighthouse with tears in her eyes, to persuade me against his murder, held back my
                  hand as I raised it to plunge the dagger in his heart. But he's dead now, and so
                  is my anger—fare ye well! fare ye well!" and the old solitary turned her steps in
                  the direction of Araheera Head, followed closely by her faithful companion,
                  bleating and trotting after her, to her mountain home.
               "There she goes, poor old soul," said the captain, gazing after her, and leaning
                  his hand on the priest's shoulder as he spoke; "I fear her death, like her life,
                  will be miserable."
               "No, no; don't fear," said the priest; "I'll take care of her."
               "God bless you! and for her temporal comfort I'll look to that myself."
               "Humph! I see you begin to take an interest in the old woman."
               "Why not? who could help it, after those proofs of fidelity and attachment to Mary
                  Lee?"
               "O, poor Else! the creature's as true as steel. You saw how she clung by Randall
                  Barry, too, and protected him even at the imminent hazard of her life. But, by the
                  by, where is Lanty all this time—eh?"
               "Lanty! O, never mind him; he'll take care of himself."
               "The police may have got hold of him—the unfortunate fellow!"
               "Of Lanty Hanlon!—no, sir; there's but little danger of that. He'll turn up
                  somewhere, depend on it, before the week's out. Come, we must follow the ladies to
                  Greenmount, and see how Uncle Jerry behaves after his discovery of Mary Lee."
               "He'll go crazy, I fear, when he sees her."
               "Shouldn't wonder in the least. I told Kate, however, to prepare him for the
                  meeting. But come—I have already given directions for the removal of the body;"
                  and the speaker, taking Father John's arm, turned towards Greenmount, leaving Dr.
                  Henshaw and the light-keeper to follow after.
               They had gone but a short distance, however, when they overtook a woman in a blue
                  cloak and ruffled cap, (both looking rather worse for the wear,) and to judge from
                  the stoop of her shoulders and a distressing cough, evidently very old and
                  sickly.
               
               "Hilloa!" cried the captain, in a bantering tone, as he passed her. "What the
                  mischief brings such an old hag as you here among blood and bullets?"
               "Me!" replied the crone. "Ugh, hugh, captain, dear, it's no wondher ye say it, for
                  this cough's killing me. I'm—ugh!—ugh!—I'm racked to death's doore with it!"
               "Then why didn't you stay at home?"
               "Ay, ay, dear; true enough, captain; but—ugh, ugh—it's an ould sayin, and a true
                  one—The ould fool's the greatest of all fools."
               "Did you see Lanty Hanlon any where about here, lately?" inquired the priest.
               "Is it me—ugh! ugh!"
               "Ay, you," repeated the captain, half provoked at the delay.
               "Ugh, ugh! O dear, I can't spake a word with this terrible cough; and captain,
                  dear, it's always wuss about sunset."
               "Confound you and your cough together! Come, Father John, let us hasten on to
                  Greenmount."
               "If it's Lanty Hanlon ye mane," said the old woman, at last, "I didn't see him
                  since ye seen him yourself, captain;" and the speaker uttered a sort of low
                  chuckle, as if she saw something amusing in the inquiry.
               "What's the matter, now, old dame? what do you laugh at?"
               "To hear ye inquirin for Lanty Hanlon;" and the speaker's voice changed all of a
                  sudden.
               "What! hilloa! whom have we got here, eh!" and the captain drew back the hood of
                  her cloak. "Lanty himself! by George, it is! Why, you unfortunate vagabond, don't
                  you——"
               "Whist, whist! the constable's beside ye, there. Don't mintion my name for yer
                  life. Remimber the warrint ye sent afther me for taking the loan of Miss
                  Hardwrinkle."
               "I do—and I tell you now, Lanty, what you may rest assured of."
               "Well, sir?"
               "That you'll be hung if you stay here—you will, sir. By the Lord Harry you
                  will."
               "Me!"
               "Ay, you, sir!"
               "Hung!"
               "Yes, sir; hung by the neck."
               "That rope's not made yit, captain, dear. No, no, my pride niver carried me that
                  high."
               "Quit the country, sir; quit the country—that's my advice to you—and quit it
                  immediately, too, for I can save you no longer."
               "Cudn't ye hould out for another year, captain?"
               "No, sir; nor for another week, either. Are you not aware that the abduction of
                  Miss Hardwrinkle is a transportable offence? But why another year, pray?"
               "Well, there's a sort of a sacret in that," responded Lanty, wiping the blood from
                  his face.
               "And what's the secret?"
               "Why, then, it isn't much to spake of, captain, only in regard of a bit of a girl
                  up here, that I had a kind of a notion of, and she tells me she's not just to say
                  ready, yit."
               "Ho, ho! that's it—well, never mind, I'll make her ready. Who is she?"
               "A girl of the Kellys of Minadreen, sir."
               "A daughter of one of my tenants—very well; send her up to Castle Gregory
                  to-morrow or next day—I'll give her her outfit. Send her up, and prepare yourself
                  to leave, for you're not safe here an hour."
               "Captain," said a policeman, touching his cap, "Lanty Hanlon, I fear, has
                  escaped."
               "What? fled!"
               "Yes, sir. We have searched every where, and can't find him."
               "Shouldn't doubt it, sir, in the least," replied the captain. "By the Lord Harry, sir, you should—every man of
                  you—be drummed out for a set of poltroons. Ten constables, and couldn't make a
                  single arrest! I shall see to it, sir. You have the Yankee still in custody, I
                  trust."
               "No, sir; he has escaped also."
               "Escaped!"
               "Yes, sir; he jumped the wall, and fled in the confusion of the moment."
               "And could nobody catch him, sir?"
               "Not on foot, sir, for he ran like a greyhound, his long hair floating back on the
                  breeze. I pursued him myself for nearly a mile, but found it was of no use, and
                  gave it up as a bad job. Once I thought I had him, as he scrambled up a stone
                  fence. I seized him by his coat tail, but he left the tail behind him, and
                  disappeared."
               "So that's all that remains of him," said the captain, looking at the piece of
                  gray broadcloth in the policeman's hand.
               "That's all, sir," replied the constable, holding up the skirt for inspection.
               "Well, it's of no consequence; let him go. He has seen enough of Ireland, I
                  suspect, Father Brennan, without visiting our jails—eh? don't you think so?"
               "He's not the only one," said Dr. Henshaw, coming up behind, "has seen enough of
                  Ireland. My own expaireance of the country is vary short, but I think I've seen
                  plenty to know it's rather a hard place for strangers who are fond of their
                  comforts."
               "You must matriculate, doctor," said Father John, good-humoredly."
               "Matriculate!"
               "Certainly. And after that you'll feel quite at home."
               "Humph!" ejaculated the doctor. "My matriculation then—as you call it—is ended,
                  for I leave to-morrow."
               "To-morrow!" repeated the captain; "nonsense! By the Lord Harry, my dear fellow,
                  you'll do no such thing."
               "To-morrow, sir, at daybreak; you may rest assured of it."
               "What! and Mary Lee to be married to-night, and Uncle Jerry to dance at the
                  wedding! you mustn't think of it."
               "I've made up my mind, captain."
               "But Kate—you know Kate has an apology to make about that quarrel you've had.
                  She'll never forgive you if you don't come with us to Castle Gregory."
               "No, sir, I've been once at Castle Gregory, and that I think is quite enough for
                  me. I thank you, captain, however, for your proffered hospeetality."
               "But, my dear sir," urged the captain, "I should feel very sorry to have you leave
                  with bad impressions of the country."
               "Humph!" said the doctor, in reply, "I'm vary much inclined to think, if I
                  remained longer, they would grow worse."
               "Worse!"
               "Ay, sir, worse. Here's abduction, robbery, forgery, riot, and murder, all in a
                  single week. Good Heavens! Sir, there's not such another country on the face of
                  the globe, and what makes its condition the more deplorable is, that its religion
                  is no longer able to redeem it."
               "Its religion!" said the priest.
               "Yes, sir; there's not even the ghost of your old Katholeecity remaining. No, sir;
                  what's left is but syllabub and water gruel."
               "I'm sorry you think so."
               "And so am I too, sir. But so it is—between your deeviltry and your Katholeecity,
                  I have had enough of Ireland. Good by, gentlemen, good by!" and the doctor, having
                  taken his leave of the party, thrust his thumbs into the armholes of his
                  waistcoat, and wended his way slowly to the village inn.
               
                  
                  POSTSCRIPT.
                  DEAR READER: We have carried you through a long, and perhaps, in the main, a
                     weary, tedious narration. At length, however, it has come to a close, and such
                     as it is, you have it; or, to borrow the words of Lord Byron,— 
                        
                           What is writ is writ;
                           Would it were worthier! but I am not now
                           What I have been—and my visions flit
                           Less palpably before me—and the glow
                           Which in my spirit dwelt is fluttering, faint, and low.
                        
                     
                  
               
               
                  SECOND POSTSCRIPT.
                  THE above is the story of MARY LEE, as it came into our hands.
                  Mr. Pinkie, it seems, had not finished it when he left Ireland, and was never
                     afterwards able, on account of the rheumatism, to finish it here. We suppose
                     this must have been the way of it. Whether he actually intended to make the end
                     of Childe Harold the end of Mary Lee also, it's of course now very difficult to
                     tell—though, indeed, for ourselves, we must confess we have a strong
                     inclination to think in the affirmative, especially as, being brought up
                     together, we remember well many personal proofs of his short and snappy
                     disposition. But be that as it may, 'tis evident the tale wants another joint;
                     and so, being appointed his legatee, we have considered it no more than our
                     duty to make up for the deficiency the best way we can. With that end in view,
                     we wrote to a faithful correspondent at Rosnakill for information respecting
                     the fate of some of the principal actors in the drama, and the following is the
                     result:—
                  "In reply to your favor of recent date, I have the pleasure to acquaint you
                     with the following facts. They have been obtained after very considerable
                     trouble and inquiry, and therefore I shall expect you to put them to my credit
                     in the old account.
                  "First, then, it seems the meeting between Mr. Guirkie and Mary Lee was very
                     affecting—so much so, indeed, that the captain, stout-hearted as he is, after
                     rubbing up his grizzly hair two or three times in quick succession, and
                     plucking down his waistcoat as many more, was finally obliged to turn his face
                     to the window and whistle against the glass. Uncle Jerry's joy knew no bounds;
                     he sat her on his knee, and smoothed down her hair, and looked up in her face,
                     and wept, and vowed she was the very picture of her that was gone. Mrs.
                     Motherly, poor woman, is said to have entered the parlor just at that time with
                     her master's leggings, to button them on, but seeing what she did see, turned
                     short on her step, and drawing the door after her with a bang, quit the house
                     instantly, and was never heard of since. For the last fact I cannot vouch
                     exactly, my own impression being that she did return once more, and even had a
                     pension granted her by Mr. Guirkie for her faithful and matronly services.
                  "As you are already aware, the captain entertained the party that night at
                     Castle Gregory, and, so far as I can learn, a merry night they had of it. Mary
                     Lee and Randall Barry were married, of course, by the good Father Brennan; and
                     Uncle Jerry, curious enough, is reported to have given away the bride. It is
                     further asserted, and on excellent authority, too, that the same gentleman,
                     after slipping a check on the Bank of Londonderry for two thousand pounds into
                     Mary's hand as a marriage portion, instantly called on Kate to play the
                     'Sailor's Hornpipe,' and danced with his hands on his sides till he fell back
                     on the sofa, and there actually went to sleep from sheer exhaustion.
                  "Ten days after the wedding, the captain's yacht was seen weighing anchor at Ballymastocker, and slowly
                     moving up to the landing place under the castle. Presently a party of ladies
                     and gentlemen issued from the vestibule of the old mansion, and crossing the
                     lawn, descended the bank of the rabbit warren, and stepped aboard. The party
                     consisted of the captain and Kate, Randall and Mrs. Barry, Mr. Lee, Mr.
                     Guirkie, and Father Brennan. After a few minutes' absence, the latter came
                     ashore, and waving his hat in adieu, the little Water Hen moved off gently from
                     the wharf. She had not cleared it a cable's length, however, when a brown water
                     spaniel, followed by a tall old gray-haired man, in a long-skirted coat, was
                     seen running down to the beach. The old man kept waving his hand as he hobbled
                     along; but the dog, who had reached the shore before him, sprang into the water
                     and made for the little vessel, howling most piteously as he buffeted the
                     waves. The yacht hove to for a moment, the dog was lifted aboard, and then the
                     old man, apparently satisfied with what had taken place, fell on his knees,
                     and, with uplifted hands, seemed to pray fervently for a happy voyage.
                  "Next day the Water Hen returned, but none of the party was seen to step ashore
                     but Kate and the captain. Where the others went to, no one here can tell. It is
                     generally surmised, however, that the United States was their destination, and
                     that Lanty Hanlon and his winsome wife, Mary Kelly of the black hair, went out
                     with them, having been snugly ensconced under the Water Hen's hatches before
                     she weighed anchor on the evening of her departure from Castle Gregory.
                  "Roger O'Shaughnessy, now too infirm to venture on so long a voyage, remains at
                     the castle at his old occupation. Once or twice a week he burnishes up the old
                     silver salver as usual, and tells how often it has served wine to the lords and
                     ladies at Castle Talbot.
                  "And Kate Petersham too—I mustn't forget her. She is now, I am happy to tell
                     you, a fervent Catholic, devoted to her religion, and a model of piety to the
                     whole parish. But you must not conclude from all this, that she has changed in
                     other respects. Not at all. She practises her religion faithfully at the altar
                     and in the closet; but beyond this, she is the same reckless, light-hearted
                     being she ever was, and ready at any moment to cruise in the Water Hen, or ride
                     a steeple chase on Moll Pitcher, with the best blood in the county. She has
                     been trying hard to bring the captain over to the church too, people say. But
                     I'm afraid she'll hardly succeed—at least for the present. Indeed, the captain
                     said as much to myself, swearing at the same time he liked the religion well
                     enough, but by his Lord Harry, he never could get over the confession. 'I
                     offered to compromise the matter,' he added, 'but Father John wouldn't listen
                     to it. He insisted on the confession as a necessary condition, and I insisted,
                     on the other side, to have that clause left out. So there rests the whole
                     difficulty.'
                  "With respect to Ephraim C. B. Weeks, he made his way to Rathmelton bareheaded,
                     and with the remaining skirt of his coat tucked under, to give it the
                     appearance of a jacket. Once more only was he seen, and then at the Liverpool
                     packet office in Derry. A friend of mine, who happened to be present at the
                     time, assures me he did nothing but curse Ireland and all the darned Irish in
                     it, from the time he entered the office till he left it. He swore you couldn't
                     find such 'a tarnation set of varmints in all almighty creation,' and when he
                     'got t'other side the big pond, if he wornt a-goin to give them "Jessie" in the
                     newspapers.' And so, lighting a cigar," added my friend, "he took up his valise
                     and umbrella, and started furiously for the New York packet.
               
            
            THE END.
