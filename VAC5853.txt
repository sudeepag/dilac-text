            TO RR. JBF. DD. THE SCHOLAR, THE CHRISTIAN, AND THE
               GENTLEMAN, These Volumes are gratefully inscribed, BY THE AUTHOR.
         
         
            
            An Apology for a Preface.
            TO THE PUBLISHER. Dear Sir: It's with grief and shame I'm compelled to
               announce to you that the preface you had so earnestly requested, and I so carefully
               written, was maliciously destroyed last night by the only male relative I have in the
               world, Tobias Drippindale, Esq.; and for no imaginable reason whatever, save that he
               thought himself entitled to gratify his ill humor and envious little soul at my
               expense, because, forsooth, he sends me the reviews second hand, and pays two and
               sixpence a week for the attic.
            
               I had just mended the fire in the old grate, and sat down before my
               desk to add the last sentence to the preface for the "Spaewife," when the door opened
               without leave or liberty, and, to my inexpressible vexation, in walked the
               stoop-shouldered, snarling old bookworm, in his high-waisted, drab surtout, and
               little yellow gaiters. Nodding over at me in the slightest manner possible, he
               deposited his ivory-headed cane in the corner, as usual, unbuttoned his coat, and
               took possession of the leathern arm chair before the fire.
            
               "Well, nephew," said he at length, tapping his silver snuff box on the
               lid, and glancing sidewise at the desk, "scribbling still, I see."
            
               Not much—nothing of any consequence," I replied.
            
               "Humph!" said he, pausing for a moment, and looking at the snuff
               between his fingers; "no doubt—something like the 'Spaewife,' I suppose."
            
               "You've read the numbers, then," said I, beginning to feel a little
               uneasy.
            
               "Yes," he replied, drawing back his lips rather inauspiciously ciously; "I tried to get through
               it at the publisher's request, poor man; he seemed anxious I should read it."
            
               "Well, sir."
            
               "Well," said he; "I have no hesitation in saying that it's a very crude
               production—a very poor affair indeed; and would do little credit to a schoolboy of
               sixteen."
            
               "Cold comfort," muttered I, "after all my trouble."
            
               "Nonsense!" he ejaculated, pitching the old cat pettishly off his knee,
               (albeit she was the only inmate of the house he ever made the least freedom with,)
               "nonsense! if you must write, why don't you try some trifling thing,—something you
               can manage,—a olla podrida, like Shandy M'Guire,
               for instance; I assure you, my dear fellow, you have no genius for any thing else in
               the wide world."
            
               "Listen to me, uncle Drippindale," said I tartly, for I felt cut to the
               very root of my vanity; "did you ever in all your life give any body credit for any
               thing?"
            
               "O, fiddlesticks!—pray what business had you to expose Elizabeth in
               that style, eh? what good purpose could you serve by it? tell me that."
            
               "Why, I intended," said I, "to make her character the principal ground
               of my vindication of Mary Stuart in another story, designed to form a sequel to the
               Spaewife."
            
               "Another!" he exclaimed; "humph! good—excellent. Ha, ha! another,
               indeed; so you're resolved to write another. Upon my word and honor, that's very
               clever."
            
               "Certainly," I replied, "that was my intention, if the public don't
               absolutely forbid it."
            
               "So you're resolved to enter the lists as the redoubtable champion of
               the Queen of Scots, and break a lance with Hume, Robertson, and the rest of that ilk;
               of course, why not? By the by, Paul, you're growing a mighty courageous youth."
            
               "Very little encouragement I may expect from you, uncle, that's pretty
               certain."
            
               "But of the Spaewife," said he, returning to the sore spot like a
               gad-fly, and fixing his little green eyes on his yellow gaiters most provokingly,
               "may I presume to take the liberty of asking how you came by the secret of the
               child."
            
               "That note in Lingard," said I, "of course."
            
               "Lingard! my dear fellow, Lingard never said a word about it in his
               life."
            
               "Excuse me, uncle, you mistake," said I, handing him the book, and
               pointing to the passage. [See note on p. 6.]
            
               "Well, upon my word, that's strange," said he, drawing out his
               spectacles from the tin case, and wiping them, as usual, with the tail of his coat.
               Whilst the old man carefully perused the note, holding the book out at arm's length,
               and drawing down his dark-gray eyebrows in evident vexation, I could not help, for
               the life of me, chuckling at his chagrin, in revenge for his bitter sarcasm.
            
               "Well, uncle," said I, when he had read it through, "what think you
               now?"
            
               "Don't believe a word of it," he replied; "not a syllable."
            
               "And why not? is it so very improbable?"
            
               "Not at all; but there's no proof—no accredited documentary evidence of
               the fact; why it's but a mere statement on hearsay."
            
               "O, folly," said I; "had the historians of those times only half as
               much against Mary Stuart, they had called it true as gospel. At all events," I
               continued, "it affords some foundation dation
               for the plot; and besides, nobody will venture to charge me with vilifying her
               reputation, I suppose."
            
               "Certainly not; but it's a mean advantage, nevertheless. What! to
               charge her with such a crime on the authority of a paltry note; and then, when it
               happens to be questioned, to fall back on her depravity of character for presumptive
               evidence! O Paul, Paul," said he, shaking his head, "I did expect to find a little
               more honor in my nephew."
            
               "I'm sorry, sir, you're so much disappointed," said I, drumming with my
               nails on the arm of the chair, and feeling my equanimity not a little disturbed.
            
               "And moreover," said he, "the book's not at all edifying— indeed, it's
               hardly moral."
            
               "It's neither religious nor controversial, I admit," said I, —"and I'm
               not sorry for it, either, uncle Drippindale, for I think, in all conscience, we've
               had enough of that class,—but just what I intended it to be—a plain, simple story,
               for plain, simple people, not in the least dangerous to faith or morals. That's
               precisely what it is, make what you like of it."
            
               "And then," said he, still persevering in a most heartless manner,
               without the slightest attention to a word I uttered in my defence,—"then the thing's
               so full of blunders—blunders all over it of one kind or other—printers' blunders,
               engravers' blunders, author's blunders, and all kinds of blunders——"
            
               "Confound it!" I exclaimed, at last starting up and pacing the room;
               "this is intolerable. I almost wish I never had written a word of it. It's
               outrageous," said I, kicking the cat off the hearth, just because she looked happy
               and contented. "Good Heavens! that some can take pleasure in making others
               miserable."
            
               "And you're to have a preface, too, are you not?"
            
               "Certainly."
            
               "A very absurd custom; no one ever reads a preface."
            
               "In the instance of the Spaewife," said I, "one would suppose it very
               convenient, in order thereby to anticipate the newspaper criticisms on its faults and
               blunders."
            
               "Not the least use in the world," he replied; "they'll kill the book
               dead, whether or not. Have you written the preface yet?"
            
               "Almost," said I; "there, it's on the desk; read it if you like—perhaps
               you may discover some blunders in it also."
            
               The old man moved over to my chair, took up the paper, and then drew
               down his green spectacles from his forehead. Knowing it would take him some time to
               decipher my cramp penmanship, I left the room in high dudgeon, and went out to make a
               short visit to a friend, inwardly cursing my fate, as I hurried along, ever to have
               engaged in such an affair. When I returned, some twenty minutes after, with the fixed
               resolution of repudiating my uncle, and all claims on his bounty in future, to my
               utter surprise and confusion, the room was empty, and the preface gone. I rang the
               bell instantly.
            
               "Where's Mr. Drippindale?" said I, collaring the old porter as he
               toddled up to the room door.
            
               "Gone, sir," he replied, staring at me in amazement; "what's the
               matter, sir?"
            
               "None of your business!" said I "Did he leave a message?"
            
               "No, sir, 'cept that he burnt the paper, and said as how it was all
               nonsense."
            
               "What! burnt it!" I exclaimed.
            
            
               "Yes, sir, and laughed in his wicked old way as he pitched it in the
               grate."
            
               "Very well," said I; "you may go."
            
               Such are the facts. It is now too late, had I even the inclination, to
               begin another preface; in truth, I had set my heart so much on the one I've lost,
               that I verily believe I never again can summon courage to write another.*
               
            
            
               
               *NOTE. Though it was frequently reported that the queen had borne children to
                  Leicester, the only individual known to have appeared publicly in that
                  character was an Englishman at Madrid, who assumed the name of Arthur Dudley.
                  Mr. Ellis has published a letter about him from an English spy to Lord
                  Burghley, written on May 28, 1588. (Ellis, 2 Ser. iii. 136.) I may add a few
                  more particulars, gleaned from the documents preserved at Simancas.
               This adventurer arrived at Madrid about the end of 1586, and pretended that he
                  was going to perform a vow at Monserrate; but some jealousy was excited
                  respecting him by his frequent visits to the French ambassador. When the news
                  arrived of the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, he disappeared, but was taken
                  at Pasage, as he attempted to escape to a ship at a small distance from that
                  port. In consequence of his answers before the governor of Guispuscoa, he was
                  sent to Madrid, where he received an order to write an account of himself in
                  English. This was given to Sir Francis Englefield, to translate into Spanish,
                  on the 17th of June, 1587, who informed Philip that it contained "el discorso
                  de su education, y los argumentos, y razones que le han enducido a tenerse y
                  llamarse hijo de la reyna." The English original cannot be found, but the
                  Spanish translation states that he (Arthur Dudley) is the reputed son of Robert
                  Sotheron, once a servant of Mrs. Ashley, residing at Evesham, in
                  Worcestershire. By order of Mrs. Ashley, Sotheron went to Hampton Court, where
                  he was met by N. Haryngton, and told by her that a lady at court had been
                  delivered of a child, that the queen was desirous to conceal her dishonor, and
                  that Mrs. Ashley wished him to provide a nurse for it, and to take it under his
                  care. Being led into the gallery near the royal closet, he received the infant
                  from her with directions to call it Arthur, intrusted it to the wife of the
                  miller at Moulsey, on the opposite bank of the Thames, and afterwards conveyed
                  it to his own house. Some years later, Sotheron conducted the boy to a school
                  in London; thence he was sent to travel on the continent, and in 1683, he
                  returned to his reputed father at Evesham. He now concluded that there was some
                  mystery respecting his birth, from the different manner in which he and his
                  supposed brothers and sisters had been educated but could not draw the secret
                  from Sotheron till a few days before the old man's death, when he learned from
                  him that he was the son of Queen Elizabeth and of the Earl of Leicester. He
                  then consulted Sir John Ashley, and Sir Drew Drury, who advised him to Jceep
                  his secret, and to return to the continent. This he had done; but not before he
                  had obtained an interview with the secretary of Leicester, and afterwards with
                  Leicester himself. What passed between him and Leicester is not stated; but
                  that Philip did not consider him an impostor appears from this, that we find
                  him, even as late as a year after his apprehension, treated as a person of
                  distinction, being "very solemnly warded and served, with an expense to the
                  king of vi. crownes [almost 21.] a daye. He was of xxvii. yeares of age, or
                  thereabout."—Ellis, ibid. Lingard, Hist. of Eng., Baudry's European Lib.

            The spaewife, or, The queen's secret
            THE SPAEWIFE;
            OR, THE QUEEN'S SECRET.
            
               CHAPTER I.
               HAMPTON COURT, during the early part of Elizabeth's reign, was a busy, bustling
                  place. Never before or since her accession has the history of England presented
                  such a crowd of ambassadors, suitors, petitioners, poets, painters, and court
                  dependants generally, as then swarmed round the person of the sovereign. Hardly
                  was she seated on the throne, when nearly every royal house in Europe sent forth a
                  suitor for her hand, or an envoy to negotiate a matrimonial alliance. Sweden,
                  Spain, France, and many of the ducal sovereignties, vied with each other who
                  should be first to sue for the hand of the young queen. These were met by less
                  distinguished aspirants from amongst her own subjects and her Scottish neighbors,
                  all equally eager for the prize.
               It was like running a race, where every one jostled his competitors out of his
                  way. Nor was it young gallants only who carried their pretensions to the throne, but sires and grandsires, dressed
                  up in the stiff, fantastic costume of the times, were to be seen at every entrance
                  to the court, elbowing a passage to the footstool of the sovereign.
               Yet there was one whose pretensions met with more favor from the young queen than
                  did those of all others; and we need hardly inform the reader we mean the
                  celebrated Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, and son of the Duke of
                  Northumberland. Of a noble and graceful figure, handsome, intellectual
                  countenance, and captivating manners, he soon found himself occupying a place in
                  the queen's thoughts which he once believed he never could have dared to aspire
                  to. He who but a few years before attempted, with the duke, his father, to remove
                  Elizabeth from the succession, and for that crime was attainted, found himself at
                  length, after many preferments, master of the queen's horse and knight of the
                  garter. Constantly at court, and obliged by his office to be continually near the
                  person of the queen, he availed himself of every opportunity to strengthen his
                  hold on her affections. And he found this an easy as well as a pleasant task.
                  Encouraged by her undisguised predilection, and relying on his own merits, which
                  the ladies of the court had not failed already to acknowledge, he was bold,
                  confident, and soon successful. The queen and Dudley became at length inseparable.
                  He appeared beside her at court, in the Parliament house, in the streets of the
                  city, and in her "progresses" through the kingdom. Married to an amiable and
                  lovely woman, he denied her the privilege of her rank, and kept her a close
                  prisoner at his baronial residence, lest her beauty might excite the jealousy of
                  his royal mistress. At length scandalous reports began to circulate regarding the
                  queen's intimacy with Dudley. At home and abroad, tongues were busy with her
                  reputation. But Elizabeth, well aware of the suspicions her intimacy with the
                  handsome earl had necessarily provoked, took no means to contradict them. Either
                  she was too much infatuated by her lover to dismiss him, or she affected to be too
                  high minded to care for such vague rumors. In vain did Cecil and Walsingham use
                  all their efforts to blacken the character of Dudley in her eyes, and thus induce
                  her to abandon the unhappy intercourse. She was deaf to all their representations.
                  Cecil went even so far as to instruct Jones, his secretary in France, to come over
                  and report to her in private the remarks of the Venetian and Spanish ambassadors
                  concerning her friendship for Dudley, and the infamy attached to his name on the
                  continent. She laughed at them all, and conferred still higher honors on her
                  favorite.
               At the period of which we write, the unfortunate Mary Stuart, on the death of her
                  husband, the dauphin, had returned to Scotland, and assumed the title of heir
                  presumptive to the English crown. In the event of Elizabeth dying without issue,
                  she laid claim to the sovereignty of both kingdoms. And as Elizabeth had made a
                  public and solemn declaration not to marry, it was not at all improbable the
                  Scottish queen, being the younger, would yet succeed her on the throne. In that
                  event, the Protestant religion, which Elizabeth was now resolved, at all risks, to
                     establish tablish, would, in all
                  likelihood, be checked for years, if not entirely abolished. She resolved,
                  therefore, to try every means to preclude the possibility of such a national
                  disaster, well knowing that, in working out her plans, she would be backed by the
                  counsel and sympathy of the most powerful of her subjects. But in addition to this
                  political dread of Mary Stuart, she felt an undying jealousy of her charms and
                  accomplishments —a jealousy that never slumbered for a single moment, from the
                  time she first saw her at the court of Edward, till she at length cut off her head
                  on the block at Fotheringay.
               When it was first proposed, by the Scottish Parliament, that Mary should marry, in
                  order to secure the succession to the family of the Stuarts, Elizabeth, fully
                  alive to the consequences, determined to place every possible obstacle in the way.
                  On receiving a letter from Mary, informing her of the proposal of marriage by the
                  Archduke of Austria, Elizabeth, to prevent the match, at once caused herself to be
                  proposed as Mary's rival, vainly believing her own charms and the crown of England
                  would be preferred to those of her Scottish sister. But finding that Ferdinand,
                  the emperor, was not disposed to be duped a second time by her insincere and
                  tortuous policy, and therefore would not entertain the proposal, she despatched
                  her minister, Randolph, to Scotland, with instructions to impress upon the
                  Scottish queen the necessity of choosing for a husband one who would be likely to
                  perpetuate the friendship already existing between the two crowns; insinuating
                  thereby that the archduke was not a fit person to carry out such amicable
                  designs—being nominated by the Cardinal of Lorraine, who would gladly see the
                  crown of England a fief of France. Having succeeded in this, she persevered, still
                  covertly opposing the marriage; always finding some weighty objection to the
                  various suitors as they successively appeared, and yet publicly expressing a
                  longing desire to see her sister provided with a worthy husband. And thus she
                  brought about the rejection of the Dukes of Ferrara, Anjou, Nemours, and Orleans.
                  In order, however, to convince the public that she refused her consent to the
                  marriage of the above-named parties from pure love of her sister and for the
                  welfare of the two kingdoms, and not from any jealous apprehension, she herself
                  proposed a husband for the Queen of Scots. Who was he? was asked on every side.
                  The nobility of both realms, suspecting he was a subject of Queen Elizabeth,
                  formed various surmises as to the individual. Mary herself was kept for some time
                  in profound ignorance of the choice, when at length, after a painful delay, it
                  began to transpire that it fell on her own favorite, Lord Robert Dudley. When this
                  strange proposal was made in due form, Mary rejected it without a moment's
                  hesitation, assuring the envoy, that even if Leicester were not a subject, she
                  would be loath to remove from the presence of her royal sister a nobleman so dear
                  to her heart. This was not what Elizabeth expected. Indeed, the general belief
                  was, that she trusted the Queen of Scots would accept Dudley, in order that, with
                  a better grace, she might marry him herself.
               At length, Darnley was proposed. He was a subject ject, it is true, but yet a cousin of Elizabeth,
                  grandson of the Princess Margaret, and thus descended from the kings of both
                  England and Scotland. He was, in the opinion of the well affected of her nobles, a
                  fit consort for their queen. Again Elizabeth interposed to prevent the match, by
                  naming Dudley a second time; and, to enhance the offer, created him Earl of
                  Leicester. She informed Mary, if she accepted him, she would, as soon as possible,
                  consider her claim to the succession, and probably admit it, provided she herself
                  had made up her mind, as was very probable, to live a single life. This conduct,
                  on the part of Elizabeth, at length awoke in Mary Stuart feelings of disgust. She
                  told the English envoy she had already rejected suitors from almost every royal
                  house in Europe to please his sovereign, and that she would no longer sacrifice
                  her inclinations to satisfy one whose sole object was to make her unhappy; and
                  that, as for Leicester, she supposed Elizabeth had already determined on making
                  him her own, but had waited till such time as he might enhance his value by the
                  rejection of the hand of another princess. After this direct refusal to comply
                  with her request, Elizabeth affected to think, after more mature consideration,
                  that Darnley was an eligible match, and at last approved it, going
                  even so far as to send Mary letters of recommendation.
               But when she understood that Mary had actually married Darnley at Holyrood House,
                  her indignation against Randolph knew no bounds. It was owing to his solemn
                  assurance that the match would not go on, she had given her consent and approval;
                  and now caught in the net she had laid for herself, she was exasperated beyond
                  measure. Thus all her schemes had failed to prevent the marriage, and so weaken
                  the attachment of the Scotch to their sovereign. The issue of Mary and Darnley, in
                  the event of herself not marrying, would yet be sovereign of England. He would, in
                  all probability, be educated in France in the Catholic faith, and thus give a
                  death blow to Protestantism. The prospect of such an event would naturally injure
                  the interest of the Protestant cause, even during her own lifetime, and expose her
                  to dangers of every kind. But on the other hand, she might prevent all these
                  results by her own marriage. True, but Leicester was her favorite, and the only
                  man she would accept for a husband, and he was rejected contemptuously by the
                  widowed queen of a comparatively insignificant province. What, then, was Elizabeth
                  to do? She had the choice of two things, namely, to induce Mary, by promises or
                  threats, to relinquish the right of succession, or, if she failed in that, to
                     prevent it, and to prevent it in time, whilst France, naturally
                  her ally, was occupied with the Huguenot insurgents, and before the European
                  powers could muster to the aid of Scotland. In the first design she failed; and
                  now she was busy in prosecuting the second. How she succeeded is a fact, which
                  would to God had never been written on the page of history. But it cannot be
                  helped now. It is there in characters of blood, and will remain forever, alas! to
                  disgrace our poor humanity.
               But to return to Leicester. The most cursory reader of the history of Elizabeth
                  has, no doubt, sometimes stopped to think
                  what could have been the cause of her continued attachment to him through all the
                  jealousies and quarrels that history records to have arisen between these two
                  remarkable personages. She tired of all her lovers, one after another—Cecil,
                  Hatton, Raleigh, Pickering, with a score of others of lesser note; and yet the man
                  who often treated her with indifference, and repeatedly flouted her favors, she
                  clung to, with a fidelity that, in so capricious a woman, is certainly without a
                  parallel. Even when old age came to bring her its wrinkles and gray hairs, and her
                  favorite, once so handsome, became the bald and palsied libertine, there was no
                  change. There is a mystery in all this, which her historians and panegyrists have
                  affected to regard beyond their reach, but of which the chronicles of those times
                  will furnish the impartial reader an easy, and, we doubt not, satisfactory
                  explanation.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               MARY STUART, the ill-fated queen, had arrived in Scotland, and taken possession of
                  her kingdom, amid the smiles of the many and the frowns of the few. Never,
                  perhaps, did more devoted hearts surround the person of a sovereign, than were to
                  be found among those who welcomed the young monarch to her realm, and followed in
                  her triumphal procession, from the pier of Leith to her palace of Holyrood, on the
                  19th of August, 1561. Many a gallant Scot waved his tartan bonnet, and many a
                  loyal heart beat high with pride, as Mary, seated on her milk-white palfrey,
                  saluted her loving subjects that evening on her way to her hereditary castle. Even
                  the cold and cautious bigot forgot his sectarian animosity, and captivated by her
                  graceful mien and transcendent loveliness, joined for a time in the general
                  welcome. Who, that beheld so auspicious a commencement of her reign, could have
                  thought it would close so soon and so terribly? Who, that listened to those shouts
                  of welcome, those prayers poured forth that day from the hearts of thousands upon
                  her young head, could have imagined that, in a few years, that face, so chaste, so
                  pale, so trusting, and so beautiful, would yet lie, covered with its own blood,
                  under the axe of the executioner? But so it was.
               In the midst of that pageantry, and all that loyal greeting, there were some dark brows drawn down,
                  and some evil thoughts at work, even while the joyous procession passed. Men were
                  there, who, whilst they joined in the general jubilee, and marched nearest to the
                  person of their sovereign, were yet devising means to rob her of her honor and her
                  life. Traitors were there, who, whilst their young queen's hands pressed her
                  throbbing bosom in speechless gratitude for their professions of love, kept their
                  eyes averted from her face, like the assassin who fears the beauty of his victim
                  might deprive him of the power to kill.
               Mary had reached Holyrood, and taken possession of her ancestral halls, surrounded
                  by the chivalry of Scotland and many of the fair dames of France. She had at last
                  escaped the toils laid for her so industriously by her royal sister. Her good ship
                  had carried her safely across the channel, through the midst of the English
                  cruisers, and she felt now like a child, who, flying from death, thinks all danger
                  is over as soon as she reaches the threshold of her home. But alas! she was
                  mistaken; her home afforded her but little protection. True, the sword of steel
                  could not easily reach her there, but the sword that cuts and kills as surely, the
                  two-edged sword of scandal, which no walls can shut out, could yet find its way to
                  asperse her fair fame—to wean trusted hearts from their allegiance, and strip her
                  of those defences of respect and of honor, without which the grave itself is a
                  blessing; ay, even when the passage to it lies between the dungeon and the
                  block.
               The Parliament of Scotland, soon after Mary's arrival, submitted to her the wishes
                  of her subjects, in reference to her marriage, and even proposed a number of
                  matches, suitable both as to birth and political advantages. Elizabeth, too, was
                  not tardy in her manifestations of regard for the happiness of her sister and the
                  welfare of her kingdom. She had many a suitor to propose for the hand of the young
                  widow. But Mary steadily withheld her consent; always ready with one objection or
                  another to the nominees of her cabinet, and always clearsighted enough to detect
                  in all the husbands of Elizabeth's choice some political manœuvre to effect, or
                  some foreign relation to strengthen. In fact, Mary Stuart had resolved on wedding
                  Darnley, the man of her own choosing, and was too candid and too honorable to
                  encourage others.
               Peace was already proclaimed by Charles IX. between England and France, and
                  Elizabeth had now more leisure to pursue her designs on her rival sister, and
                  mature those plans regarding the succession which her troubles abroad had so long
                  interrupted. Every possible agency was now set to work at the Scotch court, and
                  every imaginable inducement held out to the most disaffected or most corruptible
                  of the Scotch nobles, to abandon the cause of their royal mistress. Sir Nicholas
                  Throckmorton was sent as ambassador, with secret instructions to take measures
                  with the Lord James Stuart, now Earl of Murray, the Duke of Castleherault, and the
                  Earls of Argyle and Routhes, for preventing the marriage of Darnley, and placing
                  Murray at the head of the government. When Elizabeth first heard of Mary's
                  intention to wed Darnley, she saw in an instant, as we have already stated, that
                  his birth and royal connections tions
                  would give him an influence over the Parliament which it would be soon impossible
                  for her to control, and therefore she determined to use all possible means to
                  prevent the union. In the beginning, she dissembled her dissatisfaction at the
                  news, and even went so far as to send Mary letters of congratulation on her
                  choice. But she soon changed her tone.
               At this time, the Countess of Lenox, mother of Lord Darnley, was in London,
                  enjoying the pleasures of the English court and the smiles of its queen. Suddenly
                  she found herself a prisoner, and before she could ascertain the cause, or
                  communicate with her friends, was lodged in the Tower.
               Throckmorton was again despatched in all possible haste to Edinburgh, to revoke
                  the royal permit given to Lord Lenox to visit Scotland, and to summon him and
                  Darnley to return to England, forthwith, under pain of forfeiture of their
                  estates.
               On the same week, John Hay, a messenger from Mary to Elizabeth, on reaching London
                  is conveyed to prison.
               It was on the morning of his arrest, and about the hour of noon, after the
                  secretary, Sir William Cecil, had left the royal apartments, looking grave and
                  solemn as usual, that a page, in gaudy livery, was observed to run down a private
                  stairway, and addressing a man who had been promenading the passage for some time,
                  apparently expecting a summons, as Sir Thomas Plimpton informed him that her
                  majesty had commanded his immediate presence in her private audience chamber. He
                  instantly turned to obey the royal order.
               Sir Thomas Plimpton was a man about thirty years of age, of thin, ascetic aspect,
                  tall, bony figure, somewhat awkward in his gait, and seemingly of great muscular
                  power. He wore his hair short at the poll,—a thing then very unusual at court,—a
                  high, stiff cravat, and a ruff, of many plaits and of large dimensions, round his
                  thin neck. His visage, long and dark, and naturally repulsive, was rendered still
                  more forbidding by the pointed mustache, and black eyebrows shaved down to a
                  straw's breadth and dyed, as was also his hair, after the royal color.
               As he entered the private audience chamber, he was met by the Countess of
                  Harrington, carrying a casket of jewels, from which the queen had just selected a
                  bracelet to be sent as a present to her royal sister. As the countess made her
                  last obeisance on quitting the room, Elizabeth recalled her.
               The queen was sitting muffled in an arm chair, richly carved and gilt, before a
                  table covered with dresses of the newest French pattern, and a woman, who, by her
                  language and mode of address, seemed to be a Parisian, stood opposite her majesty,
                  holding a looking glass in her hand. Elizabeth had taken up and laid down, in
                  quick succession, a number of head dresses, none of which appeared to suit her
                  fancy or her purse. She made various inquiries, as she handled the different
                  articles, concerning the tastes of the ladies of the French court—of their habits
                  and dispositions, particularly those of Catharine de Medicis, in whom she seemed
                  to take a particular interest; so that a stranger could hardly say, whether she
                  was more intent on making a choice or prolonging a gossip.
               
               Plimpton, as he entered the room, seeing the queen engaged, remained standing
                  within the threshold, his back resting against the wall; and though Elizabeth saw
                  him there, she seemed to think his presence no bar to her conversation.
               "Harrington, what thinkest thou of that green velvet?" said Elizabeth, pointing to
                  the article on the table, and then folding her ample shawl closer round her
                  shoulders, though the weather was warm enough to have the windows open.
               The countess took it up to examine.
               "We think," pursued Elizabeth, "it suits not our complexion; besides, it is by far
                  too costly for a purse so empty as ours."
               "My gracious madam," replied the countess, "your majesty must not forget thyself
                  in thy thrift to save the pockets of thy subjects."
               "Ah, countess, this sovereignty of the state brings many cares with it. If God
                  hath made us a great steward, he will also demand of us a great account of our
                  stewardship. Well, but the blue, there; what thinkest thou of the blue, and the
                  agate buttons?"
               "Your majesty hath already one of that pattern, and worn but once."
               "Ha, and by our faith, we had almost forgotten it; we wore it at our last audience
                  of the French ambassador—eh, is it not so?"
               "The same, madam."
               "And hast heard any tidings yet of the buttons lost on that occasion?" she
                  demanded. "Have they been found?"
               The countess replied in the negative.
               "Then let my waiting women see to it. These buttons cost us more than we could
                  conveniently dispense, were it not for the honor of our crown; and we tell thee,
                  countess, if they be not forthcoming, our women's wages this year will require but
                  small wallets to hold them."
               "His grace of Canterbury will so make up the loss, please your majesty, that thy
                  faithful servants may well be forgiven this one poor mishap."
               "Ah, how's that, Harrington?"
               "Doubtless your majesty knoweth that the worthy prelate hath ordered many rich and
                  costly ornaments for your majesty's use, from Boulanger, the jeweller; and Rijere,
                  the great silk mercer of Paris."
               "Ha! sayest thou so? And by our royal word, we need them much. As for the good
                  archbishop, he hath been ever thoughtful of us, knowing, as well he might, how
                  poorly our treasury hath been supplied. Well, that changes the case, my good
                  Mistress Delavere, so thou'd better take thy wares to the other ladies about the
                  court; we shall none of them at present. Moreover, we promised an audience to that
                  disconsolate gentleman at the door,"—looking towards Plimpton,—"and would fain
                  despatch him without further delay. So take thy wares with thee, good woman, and
                  Dame Fortune send thee better customers."
               As the Countess of Harrington and the French woman left the room, and Sir Thomas
                  Plimpton approached, the queen drew herself up a little, and rubbed her hands
                  across her forehead, as if to drive away all minor thoughts, in order to make room
                     for those which she knew were soon to
                  occupy her mind. Plimpton bent his knee reverently, but did not presume to touch
                  her hand.
               "Well, Sir Thomas Plimpton, how go on affairs in Scotland?" began Elizabeth,
                  looking round at the different doors of the apartment, and again drawing the shawl
                  closer about her shoulders.
               "Please your majesty, as well as might be expected. There be many noble hearts in
                  Scotland, devoted to the welfare of your majesty's person and throne."
               "Hast seen my Lord Murray? and how fares his lordship?"
               "Well, my gracious madam; and hath charged me with assurances of his hearty
                  attachment to your grace's interests and those of the church."
               "And Argyle and Routhes; what say they of the royal marriage?"
               "That, the Bishop of Dunblane having reached Edinburgh unknown to them, and
                  published the banns, it was impossible to prevent the marriage without serious
                  injury to your grace's cause."
               "Pugh!" ejaculated Elizabeth; "they faltered when they should have struck. Some
                  men there are too chicken-hearted to kill flies in a butcher's stall. Well?"
               "Every thing is being arranged for a more fitting occasion, and the utmost care
                  taken that nothing in Scotland shall long interfere between your majesty and your
                  majesty's pleasure."
               "So thou hast nothing to communicate in any wise differing from our last
                  despatches?"
               "Nothing, please your majesty."
               Elizabeth now turned her keen eyes upon her visitor, and looked at him intently
                  for a moment, as if deliberating whether she would admit him further into her
                  confidence.
               "Hast not heard," she said, rather abruptly, "of an intercepted correspondence
                  between France and Edinburgh?"
               "Not I, your grace. Hath there been such?"
               "Ay, doubtless there hath. Thinkest thou the interests of Rome require not such
                  between the cardinal and Mary Stuart?"
               "Well assured am I, madam, the Cardinal of Lorraine hath not been idle since the
                  return of his pupil to Holyrood; but I thought your majesty alluded to an actually
                  intercepted correspondence."
               "We have merely inquired," observed Elizabeth, "knowing such a correspondence to
                  be maintained, and foolishly thinking we had some in our service clever enough to
                  intercept it."
               Plimpton felt at a loss how to reply to this hint.
               "Dost not see," pursued the queen, "the value of such a packet, in the present
                  state of Scotland, when the army of the Congregation requires all the help it can
                  gather from every source?"
               Plimpton ventured to glance at Elizabeth for a second, and saw a peculiar
                  expression on her lip, and a side look in her eye, that spoke to him plainer than
                  she would dare venture in words. He caught her meaning in an instant.
               "It is probable, madam, that the vigilance of your majesty's friends may have intercepted some such
                  papers since I had conference last with the Scottish nobles; and now that your
                  grace hath pricked my dull memory," he said, laying his fore finger to his
                  forehead, "let me think—truly, yes—I do remember some such vague report, on my
                  setting out from Edinburgh."
               "Ha! we thought thou hadst forgotten," observed Elizabeth, smiling contemptuously
                  at the slave before her. "But, pray, Sir Thomas, didst ever see this queen's
                  cipher and handwriting?"
               Plimpton replied in the negative.
               "Here they are, then," she promptly answered, opening a drawer in the table, and
                  handing him two papers; "and thou wouldst do well to study both, sir. Who knoweth
                  how soon thou mightst find good use for thy knowledge of such matters?"
               Again Plimpton looked up, and saw the same expression on her lip and the same
                  glance in her eye.
               "Put them up, sir; put them up," she said; "it is surely not in the royal presence
                  thou wouldst commence so tedious a study."
               Sir Thomas bowed, and committed the documents to his pocket.
               "So this Scotch queen," resumed Elizabeth, "hath escaped our cruisers, reached
                  Holyrood, refused our choice of a husband, married Darnley, and declined a
                  conference with us at York respecting the succession; and yet she——" The queen
                  hesitated and looked up; her eyes met those of the tall, ill-favored knight, fixed
                  upon her with intense earnestness. Both averted their looks at the same instant,
                  and Elizabeth moved uneasily in her chair, as if she felt embarrassed under his
                  gaze. She soon rallied, however, and, fearing she had gone too far, resumed in an
                  altered tone,—
               "We wish thee to understand, Sir Thomas Plimpton," she said, with increased
                  dignity of manner, as if she would repress in him every thought of familiar
                  association with her—"we would have thee know, there are but three men whom we
                  have been pleased to trust with the conduct of our affairs touching the kingdom of
                  Scotland, namely, Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, Master Thomas Randolph, and Sir
                  Thomas Plimpton, the last mentioned of whom will, for sake of some very weighty
                  reasons, be careful and prudent, and do his office with due regard to the honor of
                  his sovereign. Of the other two we need not further speak. They have given
                  sufficient guaranty for their faithfulness. To these we have granted full powers
                  to act out our wishes in reference to the interests of the church in Scotland, and
                  the succession to the British crown. And now," she added, folding her arms under
                  her shawl, and putting on a look of stern resolve, "we swear by our royal selves,
                  that if they, or either of them, by accident or design, we care not which,
                  intermix us in their secret affairs, to the injury of our reputation, which has
                  been ever hitherto in good keeping, the guilty shall die without trial and without
                  respite. For thyself, Master Plimpton, we have knighted thee, not so much in
                  consideration of thy Christian merits as because of thy usefulness in our service,
                  and that the title for which, albeit thou
                  wert our constant petitioner, might give thee credit with strangers. So mark us
                  well, sir: we expect that all affairs of a certain character, intrusted to thy
                  keeping, be conducted without regard to our knowledge of them."
               Plimpton bowed again.
               "And take thee care," she continued, "that our favor do not make thee over bold to
                  run thy head into a noose, trusting to our royal hand to release thee; for, by our
                  princely word of honor, we shall ourselves be the first to strangle thee for thy
                  presumption."
               Such forewarning, however, was, in this instance, quite unnecessary. Plimpton had
                  studied well the character and disposition of the woman with whom he had to deal.
                  When he took service under Randolph and Throckmorton, he was soon made aware of
                  the dangers to which his secret duties would expose him. He saw clearly that his
                  life depended on his caution; for the moment any blunder of his tended to
                  compromise the queen, his head would fall ere he could utter a word in defence.
                  Though he was now three years or more in her employment, Elizabeth had never once
                  directly intrusted him with the management of an intrigue at the Scotch court or
                  elsewhere. She never gave him any direct handle by which he could successfully
                  inculpate her, in the event of an unforeseen exposure. And so it was in her daily
                  intercourse with her various other employees. Whether in her plots to compass the
                  ruin of Mary Stuart, or in aiding the Huguenots, or in her diplomatic relations
                  with foreign powers, she took especial care that no agent of hers had whereby to
                  charge her with criminal or dishonorable interference. She could smile her assent
                  and frown her refusal, but there was no word or overt act to endanger her honor.
                  As for Plimpton, he was a man every way fit for her purposes; cautious,
                  persevering, insinuating, and devoid of all moral principle. Full of avarice and
                  ambition, he was prepared to sacrifice every thing for wealth and titles. But what
                  afforded her the strongest feeling of security was, that Plimpton had no family
                  connection, and was therefore the fittest to thrust in the cannon's mouth; for if
                  he fell, there was no troublesome friend to take an interest in his fate.
               "Well," said Elizabeth, after a pause, during which she gazed vacantly on the
                  table, and kept tapping it with the handle of her fan—"well," she said, looking up
                  suddenly, and turning a little more towards her visitor, "now that we have said so
                  much of these perplexing affairs, and, we trust, been sufficiently explicit, pray
                  what is the object of this audience? Thou must make thy story short, sir; for our
                  physician will otherwise interrupt us in his concern for our health, which, we
                  grieve to say, is none of the best."
               "I humbly crave your majesty's pardon," began Plimpton, "for having——"
               "Well, well, sir, proceed," interrupted the queen, impatient of his presence now
                  that her own business had been settled; "what wouldst thou?"
               "I should ever regret to cause one moment's pain——"
               "Enough, sir, enough; we are much beholden to thee. But to the purpose."
               "Your majesty hath doubtless forgotten, amid the weighty cares of state that daily occupy your
                  majesty's gracious thoughts, the small matter I had the honor of laying before
                  your majesty in April last."
               "Ah, yes; something concerning an old man and his daughter, if we remember
                  rightly."
               "The same, your grace."
               "Ah, well."
               "I am again a petitioner at your majesty's feet."
               "Proceed, sir; what of the old man and his daughter?"
               "I have tendered the oath of supremacy to the one, and my hand to the other."
               "Ha, ha! thy hand, man!" laughed Elizabeth, who never could bear the sight of an
                  ungainly figure; "thy hand! By our faith, Master Plimpton, she was little likely
                  to fall in love with thy hands; and, for the rest of thee, methinks there's but
                  little to belie the relationship. Hands and feet, head and heels, have a strong
                  family resemblance. Ha, ha! And the maiden refused to have thee?"
               "Both, madam, have refused, and most contemptuously."
               "With all thy recommendations of purse and person, titles and ancestors. Gads me!
                  And how name ye the silly wench?"
               "Wentworth, please your majesty; Alice Wentworth."
               "Wentworth! We have heard the name before —Wentworth."
               "Daughter of Sir Geoffrey Wentworth, of Brockton, in Worcestershire."
               "An old man, of great learning and eccentric habits—is it not so?"
               "The same, please your majesty, and an inveterate enemy of the church withal."
               "A stanch recusant, eh? ready to renounce his allegiance to us at the bidding of
                  the pope."
               "He had the boldness to laugh most irreverently when I tendered him the oath under
                  your grace's sanction, particularly at that part touching your majesty's spiritual
                  supremacy."
               "Pugh, man! we were prepared for all that. But what thinks he of the pope's
                  temporal power? That's what concerns us most;" and her brows contracted as she put
                  the question. "What thinks he of that? Are we to be bastardized and deposed at his
                  pontifical nod?"
               "I crave your grace's pardon," responded Plimpton, still standing bent, and bowing
                  before her. "I have not dared to hazard such a question, fearing the answer might
                  provoke me to extremities."
               "Ay, thy loyalty would have been put to too severe a trial," quietly observed
                  Elizabeth, smiling incredulously at the sycophant. "But thou wouldst marry the
                  daughter, eh?"
               Plimpton assented.
               "The girl, or her lands?"
               "Both, your majesty."
               "And mayhap convert her?"
               "With God's help and your grace's."
               "But of the knight what wouldst thou?"
               "As your majesty pleaseth to direct."
               
               "Thou art well informed of the penalty for refusing to swear on the second
                  tender?"
               "I am, your majesty."
               "Well, wouldst expatriate or hang him—which?"
               "It might be unnecessary to do either; his daughter, once converted, might convert
                  him."
               "O, thou art concerned for their souls' safety, art thou? Well, Master, or rather
                  Sir Thomas, Plimpton, we rejoice to see thee so ghostly given. But as to the
                  further enforcement of the oath, we have our own opinions, and therefore must take
                  more time to consider thy petition. As respects the maiden, we shall inquire how
                  she carrieth herself in this matter."
               Plimpton saw that the Brockton estate, which he had so long set his heart upon,
                  was slipping through his fingers by a single thoughtless answer. Instead of
                  replying, as he did to her majesty's question regarding Sir Geoffrey Wentworth's
                  doctrinal opinions, had he promptly assured her of his bigoted faith in the pope's
                  deposing power, would have, in all probability, obtained the object of his wishes;
                  but, like some others of her confidential servants, he was ignorant of her
                  majesty's private sentiments on such subjects. In fact, he fell into the general
                  error—he fancied her more tenacious of her spiritual than her temporal rights and
                  privileges, and that to slight her as the supreme spiritual head of Christ's
                  church, would be to wound her in the tenderest point. Disappointed in his hopes,
                  and angry with himself for committing such a blunder, he was about to leave the
                  presence, and reserve the renewal of his petition for another and more propitious
                  occasion, when a thought occurred to him by which he might yet redeem his mistake,
                  and he resolved to take immediate advantage of it.
               Well knowing how much Elizabeth loved the Earl of Leicester, and how easily the
                  slightest indiscretion on his part excited her jealousy, he said, moving back
                  towards the door,—
               "And am I to hope that no interference shall prevail on your gracious majesty to
                  refuse me a hearing on this matter at a future day?"
               "Interference! what mean ye by that, sir? Who dares interfere between us and our
                  wishes? Thou choosest an uncourtly expression, Sir Thomas; and, wert thou of
                  better birth, we should not pardon thee so readily."
               "I am your majesty's slave and servant," replied Plimpton deprecatingly, "and beg
                  your grace to overlook the indiscretion."
               "And pray from what quarter, sir, dost fear this interference?"
               "From none, madam, since it pleaseth your majesty so to rebuke the mention of
                  it."
               "We desire a plainer answer, Master Plimpton; speak."
               "It occurred to me, the noble Earl of Leicester might prejudice your majesty
                  against my suit."
               "The Earl of Leicester! What knoweth he of thy suit?"
               "Nothing, please your majesty, so far as I can learn."
               
               "What, man! thou art wandering. Hath he seen the maiden?"
               "So report hath it; but I beseech your majesty to dismiss, me without further
                  question, for I would fain have nothing to say that might in any wise lessen your
                  grace's regard for the noble earl."
               "O, be patient, and bear with us a little, good sir; we are but a queen," said
                  Elizabeth, darting a side look at Plimpton, and assuming that quiet, drawling tone
                  which she often did when her anger was at its highest.
               "And now, what doth report say?"
               "Nothing to the maiden's discredit, madam?"
               "Verily, thou art deaf as well as dumb. We have just asked thee what report saith
                  of this Alice Wentworth. Know ye not we have means at hand to improve both thy
                  hearing and speech? Wouldst like the application?"
               "I do entreat your majesty to bear with me; but report saith little more than she
                  is passing handsome, and fit enough to wear the coronet of a countess."
               "Humph! But of my lord of Leicester—what of him?"
               "Merely that his lordship, on receiving her——"
               "Where?" interrupted the queen.
               "At Upton, in Worcestershire, during your grace's last progress."
               "Well."
               "—on receiving her at his rooms, was much pleased with her beauty and extreme
                  simplicity, and, after a private audience of an hour or so, dismissed her with
                  many tokens of regard, and a promise, moreover, that no harm should befall her
                  father. Pardon, most gracious and right royal madam, for troubling your grace with
                  this foolish story but I dreaded his lordship's goodness of heart might have led
                  him to interpose between your majesty and the impious violators of your majesty's
                  sacred laws."
               "And he promised that no harm should befall her recusant father," muttered
                  Elizabeth, scratching the tablecloth with the nail of her middle finger, while a
                  flush of crimson rose and overspread her face.
               Plimpton saw it, and shuddered lest he had gone too far.
               "Didst say she was handsome?" inquired Elizabeth, still scratching the table, but
                  without changing her tone.
               "So she seemed to me, your grace, though a poor judge in such matters. But I have
                  trespassed too long on your majesty's condescension, and most humbly ask leave to
                  withdraw, beseeching your gracious majesty to reconsider my dutiful and loyal
                  request."
               Plimpton knelt, and taking the end of the queen's shawl that lay on the ground,
                  bent to kiss it in token of his humble gratitude. But Elizabeth suddenly pushed
                  back her chair, and snapped the shawl from his fingers ere his lips had touched
                  it.
               "'Sdeath, man!" she cried; "wouldst expose our person to the cold in mouthing our
                  garment thus? Away! Such hands as thine are not made to touch the royal dress. Away, man, and leave us! We
                  dispense thee from this ceremony."
               The tall visitor left the presence, fully confident his words would not soon be
                  forgotten.
               Nor was he mistaken; for the fifth morning after brought him a warrant of search
                  for all recusants, massmongers, harborers of Popish priests, &c., signed by
                  her majesty's own hand, and stamped with the royal seal.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               SUCH love-making scenes as we have noticed in the first chapter were not destined
                  to be of short duration; they lasted almost as long as the life of the queen; for
                  as she never could summon resolution enough, or was too fond of adulation, to
                  dismiss her suitors, the number kept constantly increasing— the young pressing
                  forward in regular succession, and the old still hanging about her person,
                  foolishly hoping that one day or other they might win their way to her heart.
               Poets and painters, on the other hand, were busy extolling the virtues and
                  parading the beauty of the great Elizabeth. Her portraits, though prohibited to be
                  sold under a severe penalty, except, indeed, those from the hands of experienced
                  artists licensed by herself, were nevertheless to be seen every where, from the
                  saloon of the nobleman down to the barber's shop. The poets, too, found an
                  inexhaustible source of inspiration for their ballads in the personal vanity of
                  Elizabeth. Night and day might they be seen wandering round the walls of the
                  court, composing sonnets to the goddess of their idolatry within, or sitting under
                  the elm trees that overshadowed the enclosures, penning a distich, now and then,
                  as the muse bestowed her uncertain favors.
               It was in such a situation as this, on a bright moonlit night in the middle of June, 156-, that a
                  little man of middle age, and thin aspect, was seated on the grass under the walls
                  of Hampton, his head bent down, evidently in a musing mood, and resting on a
                  portfolio that lay open on his knees. Suddenly, he felt a tap on the shoulder, and
                  looking up, beheld a gentleman in the rich dress of the court standing by his
                  side.
               "Hark ye, clerk of the forest," said the new comer; "art reckoning how many stags
                  and pheasants her majesty hath consumed for a twelvemonth gone?"
               "Hadst thou said hearts, worshipful sir," replied the little man,
                  jumping up and closing his book, "I could better understand thee."
               "Ha! by my certie, thou wouldst be a witty knave withal," observed the other; "but
                  what art thou?"
               "A poor dependant of the court—nothing more."
               "Thou art but indifferently garmented, and exceeding thin of flesh. By my faith,"
                  said the gentleman, "thy greasy cloak, soiled ruffles, and spare chops, would
                  bespeak thee a verse maker to some lady of the cook's retinue. Eh, what sayest
                  thou to that, good fellow?"
               "I say to that, most noble sir,—for such thy scarlet cloak, embroidered doublet,
                  silk hose, and gold buckles proclaim thee," replied the little man, making a rapid
                  survey of the stranger's person and dress,— "I say thou art right and wrong. Right
                  in taking me for a poet, and wrong in selecting a theme for my verses. Cooks,
                  maids, and scullions inspire but scurvy madrigals. I sing of the queen of beauty,
                  noble sir, whose eyes are brighter than the stars; whose breath is sweeter than
                  the new-blown rose; whose neck——"
               "Halt thee there, master rhymester," interrupted the courtier; "I'll none of this
                  foolery; dost not see thou art as mad as a hare at martlemas?"
               "Mad! forsooth!"
               "Ay, mad, demented, raving like all the rest of thy tribe. But how art thou
                  called, and why in this place at such an hour?"
               "My name is Christopher Harlow," replied the rhymer, "commonly called by my
                  familiars and patrons Poet Harlow, verse maker to her majesty."
               "Humph!"
               "Thou hast heard the name doubtless at court."
               "Ay, marry, have I, man. Didst not write verses in which her majesty is a
                  shepherdess, and thyself a shepherd?"
               "So report goeth," replied Harlow, smiling and rubbing his hands in evident
                  delight that his poetic effusions had found their way into the royal household;
                  "and hath her most gracious majesty deigned to listen to that unworthy poem of her
                  most devoted slave and servant?"
               "Truly she hath, and as a requital for thy pains, gave orders to have thee
                  pilloried if ever again thou presumest to smother her grace in your beds of lilies
                  and daffodils."
               "Ho! ho! gramercy, master," cried the poet, bristling up in anger at so gratuitous
                  an insult, and forgetting at once all the respect he had manifested, but a minute
                  before, for the well-dressed and courtly
                  gentleman; "and who art thou, that affects to know so well the mind of her most
                  gracious majesty? A poet in disgrace; another rejected suitor from the borders—Sir
                  Philip Sidney, mayhap?"
               "And why shouldst thou mistake me for Sir Philip Sidney?" inquired the courtier,
                  without noticing the poet's ire.
               "Because then I might account for thy foul words, as having arisen from jealousy
                  of my reputation."
               "Thy reputation!"
               "Ay, mine, Sir Courtier, if such indeed thou art, for thy speech keeps
                  marvellously ill with thy garb; my poetical reputation—the fair fame of
                  Christopher Harlow, author of Lamb of the Flock, Sprig of Myrtle, Primrose of
                  Beauty, and the Gentle Shepherd to his Love. Doth it not pain thy ears to hear
                  these titles repeated?"
               "I shall be tempted to pain thine with my rapier," replied the courtier, "if thou
                  givest thy tongue such liberty."
               "Hast ever known a poet without a license of speech?" rejoined Harlow, not seeming
                  to mind his threat. "Why, thou art grossly ignorant, good sir, of the gentle art,
                  and I should crave pardon of the muse for suspecting thee of her
                  acquaintance."
               "Well, well, be it so, Master Madcap; but answer me—why art thou here at this late
                  hour?"
               "Wooing the sisters, gentle sir," replied the rhymer, somewhat softened; "wooing
                  them to inspire me with celestial numbers, in which to sing the angelic virtues of
                  the great Elizabeth."
               "Canst thou speak plain language? Tell me that, fellow."
               "Provided thou askest me questions which are in no wise connected with the name of
                  the most high, glorious, and Heaven-gifted sovereign of my heart, I shall answer
                  thee as thou desirest; but once breathe an allusion to her grace, and my thoughts
                  become divine, and break out despite me, like young Spenser, whom I am now
                  indoctrinating in the heavenly science:— 
                     
                        'Upon her eyelids many graces sate,
                        Under the shadow of her even brows,
                        Working belgardes and amorous retrate,
                        And every one her with a grace endows.'
                     
                   Spenser will yet do honor to his preceptor, a promising youth, I tell thee.
                  There are times, too, noble sir, when the lion, suddenly roused from a sound
                  sleep, is not more dangerous," continued the little man, "than Christopher Harlow,
                  when interrupted in the enjoyment of a poetic vision. Hadst thou disturbed me but
                  a minute before I had committed to writing that last distich on the dimple of the
                  queen's chin, Heaven only knows what would have befallen thee. I might—thou needst
                  not smile, sir—I might have torn thee to pieces. It's but an hour gone that an old
                  woman, whom folks call Nell Gower, came this way, and disturbed me when I had
                  almost mastered a heavenly idea that came to me like an angel from above."
               "Nell Gower, didst say?"
               "Ay, sir, and shouted in my ear 'to gang to bed for a lazy, harebrained loon.' I
                  started after her, sir, like a tiger in pursuit of his prey, and would have
                  strangled her, as a fox would a pullet, had she not escaped me among the
                  trees."
               
               "Knowest thou ought of this Nell Gower?" inquired the courtier.
               "Nought more than that she's an old Scotch beldam, mayhap a witch, sent here by
                  Mary Stuart, to work deviltry at Hampton court."
               "Hast seen her oft about these walls?"
               "As often, good sir, as night comes; now in one place, and now in another. Folks
                  say she knows more court gossip than the queen's councillors, though no one hath
                  ever seen her within the enclosures. But let her keep out of my reach if she value
                  a sound head and an unmutilated body, or I'll take vengeance on the beggarly
                  spaewife for the loss of that glorious thought. It was a comparison, worthy sir,
                  between—yes, between," placing his two fore fingers together,—"between the light
                  of her majesty's eye and——"
               "Peace, thou crazy varlet; peace, I say," interrupted his companion, "or I'll
                  slice thee on the instant."
               "The disloyal old traitor witch," pursued the rhymer again, disregarding the
                  threat, "she choked a thought at its birth, that would prove of more value to
                  posterity than all the doggerel verse of her Ramsays and her Hendersons."
               "And what direction did she take when fleeing from thy murderous grasp, most
                  doughty Master Harlow?"
               "By that leafless oak thou seest on the edge of the forest—canst hardly discern it
                  in the shade."
               "Know ye where she lives, or hast heard?"
               "Not I, not I. Saints forbid I should know aught of creatures, who, as report
                  saith, spend their nights riding about the country on broomsticks."
               "I would fain have speech with that woman," observed the stranger anxiously, "and
                  would guerdon him well who would bring me to her."
               "Canst raise the evil one?" inquired the rhymer.
               "No, fool! Why ask you that?"
               "Because he could find her for thee. I know of no other."
               "Here, then, take this gold piece," said the courtier; "it will buy thee a bed,
                  and a stoup of wine at the next hostelrie. So get thee gone, varlet; thou wilt
                  find it pleasanter, I fancy, to sip a pint of Canary at the tavern fire, than
                  imbibe inspirations here in the cold moonshine."
               "Heaven keep thee in grace," replied the rhymer, bowing low to his benefactor;— 
                     
                        "'Heaven give thee grace,
                        And foes give thee peace;'
                     
                   and as the inspiriting hour is past, I will even console my heart for the
                  loss of that bright and glorious thought, with a stoup of Rhenish, at the old
                  Peacock. Give ye good day, and my benison to boot, most noble gentleman."
               The latter waved his hand in adieu to honest Kit, and walked briskly across the
                  open field, till he reached the breast of the forest, close by the decayed oak,
                  which the poet had pointed out. He followed a footpath through the woods for two
                  miles and more, feeling, rather than seeing, his way, in the obscurity of the
                  shade, and hearing no sound to disturb
                  turb the silence of the calm night but the occasional falling of a decayed branch,
                  as he brushed by, or the twitter of a bird started from its repose. He had hoped
                  to find some cabin or gypsy tent, a short distance within the forest, where he
                  might obtain some intelligence of Nell Gower, but no sign of human habitation
                  presented itself. He had at length reached a spot where the path divided—one
                  branch running short to the left, down a steep declivity, and the other continuing
                  in the direction he had already pursued. He sat down here, to deliberate whether
                  he would return to Hampton or venture to penetrate farther, when, in the low
                  position he had taken, he saw between the trunks of the trees a light blue smoke
                  curling upwards in the clear moonlight. Immediately he hastened thitherward, and
                  in a few moments found himself standing on the edge of a precipice of considerable
                  height. Below was a deep ravine, or rather what is known by the homely name of a
                  "devil's punchbowl." It was almost circular, occupying a space of about two acres,
                  filled with round rocks, many of which were of enormous size, and encircled round
                  about by the precipice on which he stood, and down which the water trickled in
                  little streams through the rank fern and slimy moss that grew on its face. It was
                  a desolate spot to look down upon, lying as it did under the cold, bright rays of
                  the moon. The courtier again looked in the direction where he had seen the smoke,
                  but it was now invisible. Supposing this to arise from a change of place, he
                  returned to his former position, and bending down as before, saw it again curling
                  up against the light. He now set out upon the left-hand path, and descended. After
                  many turns and windings, to avoid rocks and briers, he at length reached the
                  bottom. Here every thing was as bright as day, yet he could see nothing that
                  indicated the proximity of a human habitation; even the smoke was no longer to be
                  seen.
               After threading his way between the huge rocks, and vainly peering up the
                  precipice in search of something to direct him, he was about to raise a whistle to
                  attract attention, when suddenly he heard a rushing as of feet among the trees
                  above his head, and next instant beheld a stag dashed upon a rock, a few paces
                  from where he stood.
               "Ha! By my halidome," said he, "this is rare sport in her majesty's forest, and
                  within a short league of the court. Ay, faith! and burr enough on his antlers for
                  a buck of the fifth summer," he continued, snatching an arrow from his quivering
                  side.
               "An wha be ye, frien'," demanded a hoarse voice beside him—"wha be ye that comes
                  to Whinstane Hollow sic a time o' night?"
               The courtier turned round quickly, and gazed at the speaker. He was startled at
                  the nearness of the voice, and hesitated for an instant ere he replied to so
                  direct a question.
               "Guid faith! ane wad hae thought ye'd seen a ghaist, ye glower sae gowkit," said
                  the person, seeing him gaze so intently.
               "Tell me, good woman," he began at length, as if he had not heard her question,
                  "art thou Nell Gower, that frequents this forest?"
               
               "Ay, so folks ca' me," replied the little woman. "Nell Gower o' Whinstane Hollow,
                  the Scotch spaewife. And wha be yer business wi' her, guid man?"
               "I would speak with thee privately on an affair of some moment," replied the
                  stranger.
               "Ay, ay, speak wi' me in private; it's no muckle it concerns me, I'll bargain
                  on't. But come ben, sir; sin' ye maun hae yer will;" and she led the way through a
                  long, dark passage, muttering as she went, "Guid preserve us! and wha'd hae
                  thought o' seein' sae bra a callant at sic an hour, under Nell Gower's lumm head?
                  Ye couldna behae yersel all warrin at the coort, and got disgraced for bein' too
                  glegg wi' the tongue or too ready wi' the truncheon. Conscience! what a time
                  there's up there, wi' a' them run deils cuttin' ilk ither's throats, and a' aboot
                  the bit lassie! Deil rin awa, if they're no gane clean daft, ane and tither o'
                  them, frae the treasurer down, down to the link-boy and kitchen chiel. And how
                  kenned ye the way, mon? and why pick Nell Gower out frae a' the rest o' woman
                  folks about the house, eh? Wha's the reason? An a cantie carl ye are, wi' yer
                  gowden buckles on yer sheen, and bra scarlet broodclaith on yer shouthers." As she
                  approached a dim light that partially illuminated the farther extremity of the
                  narrow passage, through which the stranger had some trouble to make his way, she
                  raised her voice to a somewhat higher tone. "An sae ye're come frae the coort to
                  speak wi' Nell Gower, the auld beggarly Scotch spaewife that ye'd burn wi' fagots
                  for her cantrips the hour after she'd done yer biddin'. But take a seat anent the
                  fire, and bide a wee. I'll be wi' ye in a clappin."
               Whilst Nell busied herself about her own affairs, the stranger had time to examine
                  the apartment, as far as was possible with the dim, uncertain light. Above his
                  head was an arch of sharp rocks, pointing downwards, and dripping here and there
                  with the water that oozed through and fell upon the smoother and more solid rocks
                  below. The place was dry round the fireplace, within the compass of seven or eight
                  feet, but entirely destitute of furniture, if we except a few broken chairs and
                  stools. He had reason to conjecture, however, there were other apartments in the
                  cave, and that it was an opening of considerable extent, from the fact that the
                  approaching footsteps he now heard were faint at first, but gradually grew more
                  and more distinct, till Nell, issuing at length from the darkness, stood before
                  him in the light of the smouldering fire.
               "An now, sir," she began, seating herself on the stool opposite the stranger, "I'd
                  fain ken somethin' o' yer business wi' me at this late hour."
               "Are we alone?" demanded the stranger.
               "Alane!" repeated Nell; "an wha' for no? ye dinna think there's muckle routh o'
                  gear in these wa's to bring lanloupers about us."
               "And how comes it, if thou livest alone, that the stag hath found its way to thy
                  very threshold, with an arrow quivering in his side? Methinks the hand that drew
                  the bow is not far distant."
               "Ye're no the queen's ranger, man, are ye, come down here to Whitstane Hollow to
                  spier after gypsy deer slayers? Heth gin
                  ye be, I'd hae ye tak the beast on yer shouthers, an gang look for the
                  poacher."
               Nell had seen at a single glance that the person who questioned her thus, and
                  whose inquiries she was baffling, was a courtier of the highest rank. She did not
                  gather this knowledge entirely from his outward dress and noble bearing, for in
                  both these particulars she might have been easily mistaken, but in jerking his
                  cloak over his arm, as he plucked the arrow from the stag's side, he exposed a
                  doublet that bore unequivocal signs of the wearer's noble birth and high office.
                  She resolved, however, not to notice it, and to address him without the least
                  reserve, as if she took him for a simple gentleman of the queen's household.
               "I have already said I would speak with thee on a matter of some moment," resumed
                  the stranger.
               "Vara weel," replied Nell; "sae far sae guid."
               "I will speak thee freely, my good woman, little caring who may be within earshot;
                  for well I know that word of mine shall never be repeated by thee or thine
                  associates, as long as the hangman can tie a knot at Tyburn or fire a fagot on
                  Tower Hill."
               "Hegh, man!" replied Nell; "sin ye hae sic doubts, why dinna ye gang awa, and tell
                  yer secrets to folks whase faith ye can trust wi' mair security?"
               "Had I choice, woman, thou wouldst not be the secret-keeper; but as it is, I shall
                  find means enough to keep thy tongue quiet. Without further preface, then, there's
                  a lady at court confined to her room, and in danger of losing her reputation, the
                  which thou must prevent."
               "Ay, that's the secret, is't? Hoot, man! ye might na be sae carefu'; sic things
                  are now sae common, that few wad hae fashed themselves aboot it."
               "Thou understandest, then, the object for which thy secret services are
                  required."
               "Ou, ay, sir; it's na the first mishap o' the kind Nell Gower was trusted to
                  remedy."
               "True, my good woman; fame gives thee credit for much prudence in such
                  affairs."
               "But canna the strange mediciner wha cam frae foreign parts," inquired Nell,
                  "canna he di the thing himsel, and no hae ye rin the risk o' employin' strangers.
                  He's no sae mony months about Hampton and Whitehall without some practice in sic
                  delicate matters."
               "I fear me thou mistakest, woman," promptly interposed the courtier; "no injury is
                  intended to life or limb. Nay, such is strictly forbidden. It must be well cared
                  for and daintily nurtured, as if it were the heir of a noble house. Wilt undertake
                  to remove it?"
               "Remove it?" repeated Nell.
               "Ay, remove it from the court, and keep it here for a few days, till I shall have
                  time to place it in other hands."
               "Ou! if that be a', it's no muckle," responded Nell, after a moment's hesitation.
                  "I thought ye might be expectin' mair. Weell, an if I di, what's to be my
                  recompense?"
               "Gold, to buy thee comfort, and the favor of her gracious majesty to boot."
               
               "Hoot! awa wi' ye, man!" she ejaculated. "What care I for yer gowd and siller?
                  It's little feck o' comfort it can buy me; and as for the favor o' the queen, it's
                  as fickle as Jock Ramsay's kitlin'. Na, na, I'll hae nane nor tither o' them."
               "Name thine own reward, then," said the stranger; "and if thou beest faithful to
                  thy trust, it shall be rendered thee right cheerfully, even should it require the
                  royal hand of Elizabeth to offer it."
               "Na sae fast, na sae fast, master gallant; I'll hae na promises either. I ken weel
                  the lady in trouble is no kitchen wench, or limmer lass, or ye wad na come down
                  here to strike a bargain on sic terms. Mareover, if I can trust ye, whilk I hae na
                  reason to, for yer a bra' fecfu fausant chiel, I canna but think the lady's a
                  queen's favorite, or that lassie would, lang ago, hae bundled her hame or sent her
                  to sing her lullaby in the Tower."
               "Thou hast it right truly," replied the courtier; "she is indeed a favorite of the
                  queen, and her majesty will regard any service done to her as if done to her
                  gracious majesty's own self. So name thy terms."
               "Bide awee, bide awee," responded the cautious old woman; "sic things are no
                  bargained for in a crak, like Rab Haslet's chanter. And what shall we ca the
                  bairn, gin I consent to tak charge ot?"
               "What pleaseth thee best; it matters little what name thou givest it."
               "Weel," observed Nell, after a moment's thought, "am no disposed to pry into yer
                  bit secret mair than's required; but there's aething that's no clear to my een.
                  Wha's the reason ye mak a secret o' what's na worth the claverin' about. Gin I gae
                  my ain gate, to Hampton or Whitehall, or ony ither o' her majesty's residences,
                  and tak hence a bairn, under my cloak, is't no what happened fu' aft in her ain an
                  her father's time? An it's no to be scored to the queen's ain credit, or to that
                  o' her ladies, because it happened to be born within the palace wa's; and now yer
                  after threatenin' me wi' rape and fagot, if I dinna keep a quiet tongue in my
                  head. Guid faith, sir, the hale affair is far aboon my puir comprehendin'."
               "What thou sayest, good woman, is very reasonable; but it might happen, that just
                  at this time the report of such an occurrence, at court, might breed unfounded
                  suspicions."
               "Humph!" ejaculated Nell.
               "Now thou comprehendest the reason of the secrecy."
               "Me! how could I ken state secrets? Ha, ha! yere a canny chiel."
               "Should inquiries be made hereafter by any lady of the court, nay, even by the
                  queen herself, concerning the babe, thou'lt say it died on the journey."
               "Een though the lady be its mother?" inquired Nell.
               "Ay, even its mother is not to know it lives, should you ever discover its
                  mother's name, which is utterly impossible. I shall be thy director and paymaster,
                  and none other hath right to ask thee questions concerning it."
               "Een let it rest sae," said the old woman, at length consenting to the proposal; "but I maun see
                  ye ance an again, and wha shall I ca' for and where shall I meet ye?"
               "The where and the when I shall arrange hereafter," replied the stranger.
               "Weel, weel, sir, a bargain be't. I'll see the feckless bairn be weel nursed, and
                  nane the wiser, and that's about the hale o' the business, if I ken right."
               The stranger assented, and again pressed the old woman to name her reward.
               "It's no muckle to speak o'," replied Nell. "Ye see this bit hole in the wa' where
                  ye sit; it's, na doubt, a dour and dismal place to ain like ye, wha spends yer
                  nights and days skirlin' awa' mang costly rooms, wi' ladies o' high degree hanging
                  frae yer airms; for whate'er be yer rank, it's no hard to see yer o' guid and
                  gentle birth; but for mysel, I hae a regard for this auld place, for reasons whilk
                  hae na interest for ye. Now ye ken keep yer gowd, and the queen her favor for some
                  ither puir neerdoweel wha likest and needs it mair than Nell Gower; but bring me a
                  line signed by her majesty's ain hand, and sealed by her ain seal, grantin'
                  sanctuary preevilege, to the cave, cavern, or cell, at the place commonly ca'd
                  Whunstane Hollow, for mysel and a' that shelter there whilst I live. Now, sir, di
                  ye agree to the terms?"
               "Most willingly," replied the stranger; "but canst thou live here in the cold
                  winter?"
               "Na matter, man; that's na affair o' thine."
               "Then I shall expect thee where thou mettest the rhymer an hour gone, at midnight
                  on Wednesday week," said the courtier, preparing to leave, "or, if sooner, thou
                  shalt hear from me."
               "I'll bide try'st," replied Nell, "but ye'll no forget that she maun bestow
                  sanctuary preevileges and immunities min that, on mysel an a wha tak shelter here
                  durin' my lifetime."
               "Thou shalt be satisfied," replied her companion; "and now I must ask thy guidance
                  through the passage."
               When they reached the entrance again, Nell bade him good night and fair dreams,
                  and then as she retraced her steps through the dark passage, kept muttering to
                  herself, "What a daft silly carl, wi' a' his tinsel gimcracks about him; hegh,
                  sirs, an he thinks he's bought me ower, saul and body, wi' the queen's warrant o'
                  sanctuary preevilege for the blak holes o' Whunstane Hollow. Weel, let him aye
                  think sae, he'll feel the mair comfutable. But as for the queen's warrant o'
                  protection, I wad na gie a button for't. An he's tracked the auld spaewife t' her
                  den, and, at the mither's request, too, that's no to be doubted. Humph! I see it
                  a'. His light o' love wad gie her bairn to some deil bird, like Nell Gower, who'd
                  thraw its wizen for't, while he's no disposed to part wi't himsel. Ough, ay, I can
                  see through a millstane as weel's anither, and, guid faith, they'll rise early an
                  gae late to bed, if wi' a' their plottin', auld Nell, the Scotch spaewife, dinna
                  be a match for them."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IV.
               THE courtier, having parted with Nell Gower, returned to Hampton, and passed
                  through crowds of nobles and sentinels at a rapid pace, amid profuse compliments
                  from the one class and officious attentions from the other. Having reached his
                  apartments and thrown off his hat and cloak, he touched a spring concealed in the
                  wall above the mantel. Soon a door opened, and an old man entered, in a long black
                  serge gown or habit. His shoulders were stooped, and his gait awkward and somewhat
                  unsteady from age, and, perhaps, long confinement. His thin, white hair fell,
                  neglected, in little streaks over the collar of his black dress, and his eyes were
                  red and sunken under his once bold, projecting forehead. He bowed profoundly to
                  the courtier as he entered, and, in answer to a question, replied in a foreign
                  language, "that the lady was doing as well as could be expected, and would
                  probably be out of danger in a few days." As soon as he had spoken, he again bowed
                  low, and retired, as if he knew there was no further need of his presence. When
                  the door closed, the courtier flung himself in an easy chair, and was instantly
                  absorbed in some deep and painful reflection; for the muscles of his handsome face
                  twitched, from time to time, and his brow contracted into deep wrinkles. His
                  thoughts, gentle reader, were of the queen, Elizabeth Tudor Plantagenet, the
                  proudest sovereign of Europe. But how his thoughts ran, and whither they tended,
                  is not given us to reveal. He mused long and painfully, his elbow resting on the
                  arm of the chair, and the forefinger of his right hand pressed hard upon his lips,
                  till at length overcome, perhaps by fatigue, he fell asleep.
               And whilst he dreams of the great Elizabeth, gentle reader, may we not indulge in
                  a few waking reflections on that remarkable personage? Had we proposed to make her
                  the heroine of our story, we should have followed the usual plan, and, like all
                  other novelists, left her gradually to develop her own character during the
                  progress of the tale; but we do not presume so far, well knowing how incapable we
                  are of managing so well known and therefore so difficult a subject. Nevertheless,
                  as she is the secret power that shifts the scenes and actors in our little play,
                  we must slip a moment behind the curtain, and crave an introduction before the
                  house fills, that, knowing something of the manager, we may better comprehend the
                  spirit of the acting.
               Before we approach Elizabeth on the throne, which she has now occupied for a few
                  years, let us first fall back and consult the history of her girlhood. We shall
                  take but a hurried glance at the young aspirant; yet even in that we may find
                  abundant indications of her future career.
               It was not when Elizabeth ascended the throne she began to learn the difficult
                  science of government. Her earliest education, as well as her own private studies, had the sceptre for their aim. Her
                  studies were chiefly confined to history, the great treasury of political lore;
                  and it was the intensity with which she applied herself to this study that first
                  gave evidence of the absorbing ambition that marked her course through a long
                  reign. Yet it was not the love of power simply that stimulated her; it was power
                  confirmed and sustained by popularity. To acquire that popularity, she sacrificed
                  every dearest feeling, every fondest affection of a young heart, and to retain it
                  she sacrificed the heart itself.
               Long before her accession to the throne, Elizabeth saw clearly the difficulties
                  she had to encounter ere she reached it. She saw these difficulties were numerous
                  and discouraging, and that the greatest of all was religion. On the one hand,
                  there was danger to be apprehended from the many and powerful adherents of her
                  sister Mary, if she manifested any predilection for the principles of the
                  reformers, and on the other, the danger of losing the future support of the
                  Protestant party, if she rejected their new doctrine. The game she had to play was
                  critical, the stake was a throne, and the risk, to all appearance, little less
                  than her life. Yet she played it well. She listened with the seeming eagerness of
                  a child to the religious admonitions of her sister Mary, whilst she was, at the
                  same time, intriguing with the enemies of her government for their influence, in
                  the event of her being declared legitimate and heir presumptive to the crown.
               When Mary proclaimed her intention of restoring the mass and the ancient
                  ceremonies, that were abolished in the reign of Edward, the reformers took alarm.
                  Imagining Mary would content herself with removing Catholic disabilities, they
                  were astonished when she declared her resolution to make the Roman Catholic the
                  religion of the state. At that critical period—in the gloom that then deepened
                  round the cradle of Protestantism—there was but one star to guide its votaries,
                  and that star was Elizabeth. From the moment Mary restored the mass, Elizabeth
                  became the beacon of hope to Protestant England, and round her the reformers
                  gathered, centring in her all their hopes and prospects. It was then she showed
                  her tact for acquiring popularity. She saw it was high time to set about gaining
                  the respect of the nobles and the love of the people. The former she succeeded in
                  obtaining by professing a longing desire for religious liberty, and by evincing a
                  great taste for philosophic and scriptural studies; in a word, by conforming as
                  much as was expedient to the tone and temperament of the Calvinistic party; and
                  the latter—the love of the people—she secured by the exhibition of her person, her
                  public demonstrations of attention to their wants, her graces and her smiles. Her
                  dress, her deportment, her looks, when she appeared in public, were all directed
                  to captivate the love of the people. When she appeared side by side with her
                  sister Mary, on her first public entry into London, she made an impression on the
                  hearts of the people that for forty-seven years was never effaced. Then in her
                  twentieth year, the majestic grace, the tall, finely-moulded figure, and
                  commanding features of the young Tudor Plantagenet attracted every eye, contrasting as it did so strongly with
                  the diminutive person, shrivelled face, and drooping, sickly attitude of her
                  sister queen who rode beside her.
               Mary's pride and reserve of character would not suffer her to stoop to win the
                  applause of the multitude; but Elizabeth returned a smile for every salute, and an
                  acknowledgment for every favor. Her words, looks, actions, nay, every faculty of
                  her being, was made subservient to the ever-master, ever-ruling passion of her
                  soul—love of popularity. On that day of her sister's public entry, Elizabeth
                  obtained a hold on the affections of her future subjects that she never lost till
                  the gallant and accomplished Essex, the favorite of the people, was sacrificed to
                  her jealousy. The day he was brought to the block was the last day of Elizabeth's
                  popularity and the last day of her greatness.
               When the grave charges of Somerset, the protector, against her honor had perilled
                  her succession to the throne, how wisely did she set about restoring her sullied
                  reputation! Any other girl of Elizabeth's years, then but seventeen, would have
                  shrunk back terrified at the world's insolent gaze, or if her mental energies were
                  not entirely prostrated by the shock of so gross an imputation, would have boldly
                  defied the accuser to bring forth his proofs. But Elizabeth Tudor was a girl of a
                  far different stamp. Coolly and deliberately she set to work to remove the stain.
                  She affected to consider the charges as hardly worthy of a thought, retired for a
                  time into private life, and devoted herself to the study of the Sacred Scripture;
                  and when the etiquette of the court required her presence, she assumed that
                  extreme simplicity of dress, demure aspect, and saintly bearing, which the strict
                  rules of the Calvinistic church enjoined upon its followers. The result was, says
                  one of her historians, that in a few months Elizabeth was regarded as a "pattern
                  for all the young ladies of the court."
               What incredible energy of mind must not this girl have possessed at the age of
                  seventeen! Inheriting, as she did, the violent passions of Henry, her father, and
                  the levity of her unfortunate mother, Anne Boleyn, what struggles she must have
                  gone through, to keep down the haughty pride of the Plantagenet, and assume the
                  chastened, pious look and humble demeanor of the Calvinist! When Mary Stuart, the
                  beautiful young regent of Scotland, came to visit the court of Edward, surrounded
                  by ladies from the gay Louvre, brilliant in all the gorgeous fashions of France,
                  Elizabeth, burning with a love of personal decoration,—the woman who, in after
                  years, was the possessor of three thousand gowns,—stood in the midst of that
                  glittering throng, dressed in her russet garments, the laughing stock of the gay
                  circle, looking on the pageant with a dreamy eye, and yet smiling in her heart as
                  she reflected how little the giddy strangers knew the thoughts of the girl who
                  stood before them.
               Such little facts, trifling as they appear at first, afford more light to read her
                  subsequent history than all the evidence of Burnet and Robertson.
               We have seen Elizabeth making her way, prudently and cautiously, to the foot of
                  the throne; let us now glance at the difficulties she had to encounter on
                  ascending it.
               
               For many years before her accession, the exchequer had been suffering a continual
                  drain. Notwithstanding the immense sums derived from the religious houses and
                  churches which Henry had pillaged, as well as from the infamous system of
                  peculation then so prevalent, and under which the nation had suffered so much in
                  preceding reigns, Elizabeth succeeded to an exchequer on the very verge of
                  bankruptcy. Commerce had declined to such a degree, that foreign supplies could
                  not be obtained but on the most disadvantageous terms; even cash was not taken as
                  an equivalent, except under bonds for its genuineness and currency. In fact,
                  public trust had suffered so much from the diffusion of a base coinage, that men
                  could no longer depend on each other in commercial affairs. It was then quite a
                  common thing for merchants, after receiving the price of their goods, to exact a
                  bond from their customers, subjecting them to forfeiture of real estate equal to
                  the required amount, if, in three months, the money paid was found to be spurious
                  or uncurrent. These, with other similar grievances, obstructing as they did the
                  progress of trade, pressed heaviest on the humbler classes, and reduced them to a
                  state of absolute starvation. Things had come to such a crisis, that the people
                  would gladly have welcomed revolution or civil war.
               Then there was Mary, Queen of Scots, whose title to the English crown was
                  recognized by many of the sovereigns of Europe, and supported by her
                  father-in-law, King of France, who finally induced her to assume the arms and
                  regal style of England. On the other hand, she saw Philip of Spain, whose proposal
                  of marriage she had lately rejected, pledge himself to Elizabeth of France, and
                  thus become the brother-in-law of the dauphin, her rival for the crown. In a word,
                  she found herself surrounded by dangers of every kind—dangers within and without,
                  at home and abroad—dangers to be apprehended from her own subjects, then on the
                  verge of insurrection, not less than from the rivalry of France and the hostility
                  of Spain and Scotland; and last, and greatest of all, she found herself declared
                  illegitimate by the head of the Catholic church, and that declaration confirmed by
                  half her own subjects, and by most of the principal sovereignties of Europe. Such
                  were among the difficulties Elizabeth had to meet on ascending the throne; and she
                  met them bravely. From the very beginning, she resolved to depend solely on the
                  resources of her own realms for support, knowing they were abundant, and only
                  required proper development. She set about the work like one who had studied the
                  science of government. But she required time to work out her designs; and to
                  obtain it, she began by keeping Spain busy at home or defending her possessions
                  abroad, Scotland embroiled in plots and conspiracies, and France negotiating a
                  matrimonial alliance. In all these schemes she eventually succeeded, till by her
                  prudent management she elevated England from the rank of a fourth-rate kingdom to
                  the dignity of arbitress of Europe.
               Having said so much of Elizabeth as heir presumptive and queen regnant, we shall
                  now say a little of her private character. Having regarded her as a sovereign, we shall now regard her simply as a
                  woman.
               Immediately after her coronation, her ministers, impelled by the entreaties of the
                  nobility and gentry, and these backed by the clamors of the people, presented a
                  humble petition to her majesty, supplicating her to marry, and thus bless the
                  nation with royal issue to reign over them and their children. She received the
                  speaker and burgesses of the commons very kindly, and made an extemporaneous reply
                  that has ever since been regarded as a masterpiece of cunning and adroit
                  deception. She assured them of her thanks for their good wishes in her family's
                  behalf and that of her realm, but that it pleased God to implant in her heart,
                  even from her childhood, a repugnance to a married life. It was strange, she said,
                  that thoughts of marriage, to one of such ripe years, could bring nought but pain;
                  yet so it was, and in this she could not but recognize the will of Heaven, who
                  sees and orders all things for the best; that hereafter, God, in his own good
                  time, would provide a ruler for her people. She then took the ring from her
                  finger, and holding it up before the assembly, said in a quiet tone, "This ring,
                  which I received at my coronation, is the bond that unites me to England. England
                  is my spouse, and I am England's. Had I issue, they might share the love that now
                  is all my people's. When I die, I shall covet no honor, no praise, but a little
                  inscription, that will cost but a few pence, engraved on a piece of white marble,
                  saying, Here lieth Elizabeth, who reigned a virgin and died a
                  virgin." With this she dismissed the deputation. Her conduct on this
                  occasion forms the pivot on which turned her future destiny. It was a public
                  declaration of her belief that Heaven did not will her to marry; and by that
                  declaration she felt herself bound forever after. Why she thus acted, (for no one
                  at all acquainted with the subsequent history of her private life could believe
                  for a moment it was the will of God she obeyed,) there is little room to doubt.
                  Had Elizabeth's conduct before her accession been untainted and blameless, she
                  never would have resolved to remain single. But her name was made the table talk
                  of every court of Europe before she had reached her eighteenth year. Her amours
                  with Seymour were on every tongue. In the streets of Paris and Madrid, the loves
                  of the royal maiden were sung to the accompaniment of pipe and tabor. All this,
                  too, of the daughter of Henry and Anne Boleyn, parents whose lives were but a
                  tissue of the grossest depravity. And was she to perpetuate the infamy of the
                  family, by giving the slightest reason to suspect, by an early marriage, that the
                  charges made against her by Somerset were not altogether unfounded? The truth is,
                  she dreaded to marry, lest it would be attributed to motives far different and far
                  more selfish than the wish to accede to the prayers of the people. Had the
                  petition to marry been presented twenty years after, it would have met, we think,
                  with a more satisfactory consideration. For then she was not cowering under the
                  ascetic look of the Puritan, scanning every motion and every feature, that he
                  might detect some indication of a levity for which to administer rebuke; and, moreover, men had almost forgotten
                  that she was the offspring of an illicit marriage. But it was then too late. She
                  had once solemnly declared her resolution not to marry, and was ever after too
                  proud to rescind it.
               With respect to the religious sentiments of Elizabeth there should be little
                  difference of opinion. That she was not a Catholic in practice is certain, and
                  that she was not a Protestant at heart is almost equally certain. She was
                  something of both; the degradation she suffered in being declared illegitimate
                  implanted in her heart an intense and enduring hatred for all Catholic church
                  authority, whilst her early education gave her mind a strong bias to Catholic
                  dogmas—a bias which, despite all her efforts, she never after could entirely
                  check. She was so far Protestant as to love its freedom from religious restraint;
                  it gave her an independence, a peculiar reliance on self, that accorded well with
                  her natural disposition, and which she longed so much for in her minority. She
                  thought so little of either religious systems, as to believe the essential points
                  of difference should be merged for the good of the state. Her ruling passion, as
                  we have said before, was the love of power, sustained by popularity. To obtain
                  that power, she embraced Protestantism, believing it to be the surest way to reach
                  it, and she sustained Protestantism as the best means to preserve it. Those who
                  closely examine her early life will see she was a Catholic up to the time she
                  began to turn her eyes more frequently towards the throne. But as soon as she
                  arrived at that age when she could estimate the value of support from either party
                  she began to waver. Even the Protestants were not without serious doubts as to
                  what cause she would adopt on her accession, and, even after the coronation, she
                  hesitated long before she identified herself with the interests of the reformers.
                  Her design evidently was, to feel her way cautiously and prudently, and, at last,
                  to adopt that system of religion which would be likely to bring most power and
                  influence round her throne. How clearly does this appear, in the first few months
                  of her reign, when she heard mass every day in the Royal Chapel, and behaved,
                  during the service, as a humble, pious Catholic! When she had long weighed the
                  chances on both sides, when she had reckoned her strength in the Catholic and
                  Protestant parties respectively, and found that the Protestant was fast
                  preponderating, she began gradually to lean towards them, yet did not openly
                  declare for their religion. We have a striking proof of her duplicity on the
                  Christmas day before her coronation. She attired herself in the closet adjoining
                  the Royal Chapel, and proceeded thence to her throne attended by her maids of
                  honor. She was resolved on this occasion to manifest her aversion to the mass for
                  the first time, and did so by deliberately walking out of the church when the
                  Gospel was concluded, and when the people expected to see her, as usual, approach
                  and lay her offering on the altar. This was not a hasty act, springing from the
                  spur of the moment, but one long premeditated, and done with an adroitness that
                  gave high promise of her future diplomatic powers. The act was intended to
                     prepare pare the public mind, in a
                  certain degree, for her subsequent abjuration of Catholicism, so that her
                  abandonment of the old religion might not take her subjects by surprise; and yet
                  it was not so decisive as entirely to commit her; for in the event of any
                  reclamation or disturbance on account of so gross an insult to the sacrifice. she
                  could easily have it reported that her exit from the chapel was caused by sudden
                  indisposition. Thus still was she prepared to veer accordingly as the wind blew.
                  Had Elizabeth then been placed in any inferior position in life, she would have
                  endeavored to reason herself into infidelity; so much did she despise
                  Protestantism as a religion to be saved by, and so intensely did she hate
                  Catholicity, as exercising a coercive and conservative influence.
               At her coronation, her behavior was such as to merit the contempt of her friends
                  and the disgust of her enemies. Instead of breaking at once with the Catholic
                  party, which she could then have easily done, she still temporizes. She insists on
                  being crowned after the manner of the Stuart kings of England, by the hands of a
                  Catholic bishop, takes the oath administered to Catholic sovereigns, namely, to
                  preserve the church in the same state it was in the reign of Edward the Confessor.
                  Nor was she content with this; she even received the Eucharist from the
                  consecrating bishop, and suffered him to anoint her according to the ritual of the
                  coronation, kissed the chalice reverently, and in all things demeaned herself like
                  a sincere Catholic. These instances we adduce are proof positive that Elizabeth
                  never was influenced by religious sentiments of any kind. She made religion always
                  subservient to her ambition. But it will be asked, Why did Elizabeth continue so
                  hostile to the Catholic church, after she had been firmly fixed on the throne, and
                  all opposition had ceased, if she did not believe in revelation, or, believing it,
                  had become indifferent to the duties it imposed and the faith it inculcated? Why
                  did she exhibit so much zeal in favor of the reformation? It surely did not
                  originate in the conviction that she was sent by Heaven to extirpate Catholicity.
                  Had this been the case, she could not have temporized so meanly, nor have
                  restrained herself so long after her accession. Fanatical zeal is not to be kept
                  in leading-strings, nor does it wear such an aspect as the conduct of Elizabeth
                  exhibited in the first years of her reign. The truth is, she was compelled to
                  reject Protestantism or persecute Catholicity. Had she not done so, civil war
                  would have ensued, nay, was on the very point of breaking out. Some party should
                  be dominant in the state, and Elizabeth only chose the one that promised most help
                  to maintain her authority and advance her interests. We may add to this her
                  predilection for the more easy and accommodating duties and forms of the
                  Protestant church. Nor is it to be wondered at, that, having once drawn the sword,
                  she was tardy to sheathe it. One murder will beget another, even in the most
                  peaceable times; but how much more prolific in times of religious dissensions,
                  when factions are rife, families are divided, and father and son become the
                  champions of jarring creeds! Having once begun the system of extermination nation, she could not stop; persecution
                  gave birth to plots and conspiracies, to repress which she had recourse to the
                  severest measures. In these conspiracies, real or fabricated, not the enemies of
                  the queen only, but the personal enemies of her ministers, were easily made to
                  take a part. Cecil, her secretary, the deadliest enemy of Catholicity in the
                  kingdom, even before the death of Mary, was the prime mover of all the machinery
                  of the state. His power was visible not only in the great measures of national
                  policy, but even the most minute details of the sumptuary and municipal laws. His
                  influence with Elizabeth was illimitable; whatever he advised she listened to with
                  attention, and he advised many cruelties to gratify his own personal malice. A man
                  so capable as he proved himself to manage the helm of state in times so fraught
                  with the seeds of anarchy and revolution from within, and with the danger of
                  foreign invasion from without, it was strange to find envy and jealousy form such
                  prominent features in his character. It was his misfortune that he served a
                  mistress so capricious as Elizabeth. Had she been less fanciful in her
                  attachments, less indiscreet in the distribution of her favors, more desirous of
                  promoting the welfare of the state than of indulging her own selfish and ambitious
                  aspirations, he would, besides being a greater, have been a happier and a better
                  man. But her childish vanity and levity crossed him at every turn, and kept him in
                  a sea of troubles. Strongly attached to herself personally, and laboring with all
                  his might to advance the welfare of the nation through her, he felt keenly the
                  smallest slight, or the least indication of a want of confidence, on her part.
                  When he advised, she generally acquiesced; but she often acted in state affairs
                  without his knowledge, and that galled him to the quick. If she bestowed an
                  office, received a suspected nobleman, granted an interview to a deputation,
                  pardoned a convict, or signed a death warrant, without his advice and approval, he
                  was instantly piqued. Once offended, he never forgave, and as he would not
                  manifest his chagrin to the queen, he visited those whom she favored, or their
                  immediate friends, with his dire displeasure. In this way many of the cruelties in
                  the first twenty or thirty years of Elizabeth's reign may be justly accounted for.
                  But as she grew old, she also grew less of scrupulous; frequent shedding of blood
                  made her at length reckless of human suffering, and as the summer of her life had
                  passed away, the winter set in in storm and darkness.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER V.
               WHEN Nell Gower returned, she observed something shining brightly on the floor,
                  and picking it up found it was one of the stranger's shoe buckles, that had fallen
                  off in his egress from the cavern. She placed it carefully in her bosom, intending
                  to examine it more minutely on the following day, and proceeded down the cave for
                  a considerable distance, till she came to an aperture in the face of the rock,
                  merely large enough to admit a child of eight or ten years of age, without
                  stooping. Extinguishing the torch, she crept through, and turning to the right,
                  drew back a dark, heavy curtain, and entered a well-lighted and comparatively
                  comfortable-looking room. It was an apartment of the cavern about twenty feet by
                  twelve, but irregular in form. The arch above was so high that the eye could
                  hardly reach it, and the sounds produced by the old woman's footfalls echoed and
                  rumbled away in the dark and distant recesses of the roof. In a corner of this
                  room, opposite the entrance, was a rock, apparently detached from the wall, (if we
                  may so call it,) some four or five feet square, and flat on top. Above it, and
                  against the wall, hung a large silver crucifix, and on each side several small
                  paintings, set in black frames. Round the walls, and scattered disorderly over the
                  floor, as if they had been recently occupied, were a number of seats. Some were
                  limbs of trees lopped of their branches and supported at either end by blocks of
                  stone, and others constructed of rough boards hastily put together. It was easy to
                  conjecture that the place was used as a chapel in which the few scattering
                  Catholics of the neighborhood might assemble for divine worship without danger of
                  surprise. From the year 156-, the mass was proscribed, the altars thrown down, and
                  the worshippers subjected to the most unremitting persecution. Up to that date the
                  Catholic priest was permitted to defend his creed by public disputation, and even
                  in his turn to impugn the reformed doctrines; and many were the discussions held
                  in public courts before learned divines and commissioners appointed by the queen,
                  and many the quarrels and heartburnings that grew out of them. In the court and in
                  the alehouses, the subject of each day's controversy was discussed over wine cup
                  and beer can. The nobles disgraced the court, and idle hangers-on of the taverns
                  made the night hideous with their recriminations and blasphemies.
               "The state of the church and religion at this time was low and sadly neglected,
                  occasioned in a great measure by those unhappy controversies about the church's
                  government and other external matters of religion, which so employed the thoughts
                  and zeal of both clergy and laity that the better and more substantial parts of it
                  were neglected. The church-men heaped up many benefices for themselves, and,
                  residing upon none, neglected their cures; many of them alienated their lands,
                  made unreasonable leases and wastes of their woods, granted reversions and advowsons to their wives and children, or
                  to others for their use. Churches ran greatly into dilapidations and decay, and
                  were kept nasty, and filthy, and undecent for God's worship. Among the laity there
                  was little devotion. The Lord's day greatly profaned and little observed. The
                  common prayers not frequented. Some lived without any service of God at all. Many
                  were mere heathens and atheists. The queen's own court a harbor for epicures and
                  atheists, and a kind of lawless place because it stood in no
                     parish."—Strype's Parker.
               
               But things could not long remain in this state; something definitive must be done,
                  and at length the queen's spiritual supremacy was proposed as a test of orthodoxy.
                  It is needless to say how this was received by the Catholic party. They were not
                  prepared for such a large demand on the virtue of obedience. Indeed, so glaring an
                  outrage on men's consciences could not fail to create astonishment and
                  indignation, not only among the English Catholics, but throughout Europe. A
                  refusal to acknowledge the queen's spiritual supremacy banished the Catholic
                  clergy to the continent, or sent them to take shelter in huts and caverns.
                  Sometimes they happened, in their wanderings, to fall in with Catholic families of
                  distinction, who still adhered to the old faith, and there they privately
                  administered the comforts of religion to the inmates and others intrusted with the
                  secret of the priests' hiding-place. Not only were the priests proscribed, but all
                  who gave them shelter or attended at mass; so that the clergy who still remained
                  firm, and who would have publicly battled against the progress of Protestantism in
                  defiance of the penal statutes, were restrained by the dread of involving so many
                  others in their ruin. The enactment, therefore, declaring Queen Elizabeth supreme
                  in matters of faith, and spiritual head of the church of England, put a stop to
                  all controversies; the Catholic should either acknowledge the claim or forfeit his
                  civil rights. Nor was it the officers of the law alone the Catholic clergy had to
                  fear, but every stranger they met in their journeys from place to place was to be
                  carefully guarded against as a spy or informer. We cannot, therefore, be surprised
                  to find the priest and his followers assembling in the most remote and desolate
                  places for the purposes of instruction, and the receiving of those sacraments
                  which they dared not publicly approach.
               As Nell Gower entered the room, she was met by a man of tall stature and portly
                  bearing. He was about thirty years old, and of an active, athetic figure. His
                  countenance was frank, open, and strikingly handsome, and his small mouth, and
                  dark eye, turning leisurely on Nell's face, gave evidence of a strong, energetic
                  mind, and of a will self-reliant and firm of purpose. His dress was a loose black
                  robe, confined round the waist by a silk belt, such as was usually worn by the
                  Catholic priest. Yet about his person there was nothing to denote the ecclesiastic
                  but the dress. His crown was untonsured, and his brown hair fell in long and
                  graceful curls on his shoulders, after the fashion of the time, and his step was
                  firm and bold, as one conscious of power and dignity.
               
               "Eleanor," said he, "Whitret Macbairn, here, hath been telling me of a courtly
                  visitor thou hast received in thy antechamber. Who is he?"
               "I did na hear his name, father; he wud na tell; but I hae guid reason to think
                  his name's no unknown at Hampton court."
               "Thou hadst a long colloquy, mehought."
               "Nane too long, father, replied Nell; "weighty work, maun aye get time to
                  consither on't."
               "Ha! came to employ thy services in court matters?"
               "Ay, and bra' wark it is to manage," responded the old woman, folding her arms and
                  looking up at the priest; "but wae's me, wae's me, what a warld we live in! the
                  fear o' God is maist a' gane clean out o' men's sauls, and wimen hae nane
                  ava."
               "Men's minds, Eleanor, are much depraved, and morality is at a low ebb in this
                  country, and more especially about the court; but we must not despair of better
                  times. The human mind undergoes revolutions as do kingdoms and rations, and will
                  come out the stronger and the purer from the struggle. The cloud that tests upon
                  England, Eleanor, has been long gathering, and those who ought to have dispelled
                  it were idle when they should have been laboring to bring back the sunshine that
                  once brightened the land. Nevertheless, God will scatter the cloud in his own good
                  time; not, perhaps, till long experience shall have taught men that the church is
                  the creation of Heaven, not the production of earth, and that her abuses are not
                  to be remedied by her total suppression, in order to make room for a new one, but
                  by an ardent and pious zeal on the part of her children to remove those unsightly
                  blemishes that may have gathered upon her face and marred her queenly beauty. But
                  of this we shall speak again, at a more befitting time. And now, may I know the
                  object of this late visit to Whinstone Hollow?"
               Nell related the conversation that had taken place between the stranger and
                  herself, not omitting, however, to make her comments as she proceeded.
               The priest sat down on a box behind him, and motioned Nell Gower to another. The
                  description the old woman gave of the stranger, and of his anxiety to secure her
                  services, together with his precautions against either the discovery of his own
                  name or of the lady's, caused the priest to reflect for some time in silence.
               "Know you aught more," said he at length, "of this Dr. Maraski? And think you
                  still he is no heretic?"
               "Na mare a heretic than yersel, father," replied Nell confidently.
               "Humph!" said the priest; "be cautious, Eleanor; trust not too much to appearances
                  in such a place as Hampton court."
               "Weel, father, na doubt in sic times and places ane canna be too carefu'; but
                  Grace Goodniff, wha's as true as hazel gad, is ready to mak aith to me she saw him
                  ae mornin' usin' his rosary as natural as if he'd been a monk at his penance."
               "And did he not care to expose himself thus to the danger of detection?" inquired
                  the priest, doubtingly.
               
               "Ou, ay; but ye ken, father," replied Nell, "he's a wee bit bothered i' the lugs,
                  and did na hear her fit on the floor."
               "Hast seen him since I left here?"
               "Ay, an mair nor aince."
               "Of late?"
               "It's na twa weeks gane, whin I gaed him the letter the laddie brought frae
                  France, and trusted wi' Oliver Goodniff at the Whitehorse, the blate body, that
                  dis na ken his ain value in sic thrawin' times, or he wud na be sae dowie as he
                  is."
               "Thinkest thou still, Eleanor, this Dr. Maraski corresponds with France?"
               "Maist assuredly; did na Grace Goodniff, that same daft Oliver's ain sister's
                  daughter, gie half a score o' letters this twa months to Whitret Macbairn for
                  Oliver, to be secretly despatched to Paris?"
               "Doth Whitret still haunt the court? and how is he thought of?" inquired the
                  priest.
               "Na ane minds him; he's aye deaf and dumb, ye ken."
               "Any news of the duke since I saw thee last?"
               "He's comin' over to marry her, they say, gin the queen's weel enough to receive
                  him."
               "I don't credit that, Eleanor," observed the priest.
               "Ye dinna believe Anjou would marry Elizabeth!"
               The priest shook his head.
               "And why for no?" demanded Nell, as if she knew not of the queen's caprices.
               "Because Anjou is a proud, high-minded prince, and, in a word, he never liked
                  Elizabeth."
               "Guid preserve us! and wha gars De Foys, the French ambassador, keep sae close wi'
                  the queen, giein' her presents o' rings, bracelets, and sic bawbles, if the duke
                  didna fancy her?"
               "The presents are Catharine's, not the dukes," replied the priest.
               "Aweel, aweel," observed Nell, "she's a canny auld carl that same Catharine the
                  queen mother, like a' the rest o' her house; yet I wudna trust her, wi' a' her
                  Catholeecity. She'd hazard her saul to benefit her family."
               "Wouldst not like a union of the crowns?" demanded the priest.
               "An whar'd be the guid o' that, sir?"
               "Protection to Catholics, and the conversion of the queen mayhap."
               "Na, na, father Peter; ye'll ne'er see that day, if ye lived as lang as the lassie
                  hersel, the whilk's na vera probable, seein' yer set aready like a Highland
                  muirfowl. Na, na, Elizabeth canna bide to consort wi' Rome. And e'en if Anjou were
                  her ain sworn husband the morrow, she'd mak him a heretic, or send him hame to
                  plot wi' his mother."
               "What if Catharine induced her to marry Alencon, her second son? He would be more
                  pliable in the queen's hands, and equally promote his mother's ambitious
                  designs."
               "What, man!" replied Nell, astonished at the question; "is it Elizabeth
                  Plantagenet, the proudest woman in a' England, marry the ugliest cur that e'er was
                  whalpit in France? Guid be about us!—sic a question!"
               "The match is spoken of, nevertheless; and Catharine arine de Medicis will have her influence at work to
                  bring it about."
               "Na doubt," replied Nell; "and Elizabeth is na the lassie to reject the proposal
                  as lang's she can mak Catharine usefu' in promotin' her ain interests. O, faith,
                  guid sir! Bessie's na blate in matters o' state policy."
               "I agree with thee, Eleanor," replied the priest. "Catharine will yet find her
                  match in Elizabeth."
               "Atween plots an counterplots, they've baith a busy time on't."
               "So much so, Eleanor, that, no time is left for the service of God. Whitehall and
                  the Louvre could once boast of saints; but now they're more like taverns, where
                  roisterers, and gamblers, and blasphemers frequent, than the palaces of Christian
                  princes."
               "Atween the twa," said Nell "the puir Queen o' Scots is made a spatchcock to fling
                  at ane anither."
               "Poor Mary hath little protection to expect from the one, or mercy from the other.
                  God guide her and save her! she has troubles enough to meet."
               "Pray for her, father—pray for her," earnestly exclaimed Nell, "that the guid God
                  may free her frae the toils o' her persecutors—frae fause friens an open' foes, an
                  gi' peace and plenty to bonnie auld Scotland."
               "I seldom forget them at the altar," responded the priest.
               "Nor the auld countrie, father—ye'll no forget that in yer prayers," she added,
                  kneeling, and pressing the priest's hand to her lips, while the tears ran down her
                  thin cheeks; "dinna forget that."
               Father Peter assented, observing, as he raised her up, that she had not yet lost
                  sight of her queen and country.
               "I forget them!" repeated Nell. "Na, na, man; whilst these auld banes hang
                  thegither, I'll ne'er forget them—the purest and loveliest woman e'er sat on a
                  throne, and the kindliest spot o' earth the sun e'er shone upon. But I'll ne'er
                  see ain or tither mair," continued Nell; "my mind tells me that; I'll never see
                  them mair. Still, I hae a promise frae ain that ne'er deceived me, that this auld
                  carcass wad yet tak its last sleep in the kirkyard o' Stirling. And now," she
                  added, kneeling before the priest, "I crave yer benison, father, and bid ye guid
                  night; for I maun prepare Whitret Macbairn to gang wi' me to the Whitehorse o'
                  Wimbleton."
               "To-night?"
               "E'en the night, father; there's na time to lose."
               "Eleanor," said he, as the old woman turned to leave, "I cannot omit to mention,
                  that in thy conduct of this business in which thou hast engaged, thou'rt bound by
                  thy religion as a Catholic, and by thy honor as a woman, not to divulge any secret
                  thou mayst be intrusted with, not even to thy confessor, unless thy conscience be
                  disturbed."
               "Canna I make use o' the secret to save a frien?" demanded Nell.
               "Thou mayst in private, with the person implicated."
               "Weel, but gin I endeevor to see the person privately, and canna?"
               "Thou'lt still preserve the secret."
               
               "Humph!" ejaculated the old woman. "I thought I cud make use o't for my ain honest
                  purpose."
               "Thy purpose might be honest, Eleanor, and yet thy means of accomplishing it
                  dishonorable and sinful."
               "I ken that," said Nell; "but wha's the advantage o' the secret, if I canna use
                  it?"
               "Time may tell," said the priest; and taking his Breviary, he knelt down to recite
                  his matins before the altar.
               "An time maun tell, muttered Nell, "if I can mak it. Let's see, now,"
                  she continued. "The bairn's nathing mair nor less than some ill-begotten wee thing
                  o' some light's love at the palace. But whase is't? Ay, that's the neet question.
                  She's nane o' laigh degree—na, na, deil a bit o't; I'll tak my aith o' that. Weel,
                  then, whilk o' the ladies is sick or complainin' at coort? Wha's to tell that? Wha
                  but Grace Goodniff, Oliver's ain sister's daughter? a canny woman for hersel, I'll
                  warrant her. She has mair ears nor tongues in her head, I ween; but the deil's in
                  her pot if I canna fish the haggish out o't. I'll send Oliver to her. She loes him
                  weel, and maks mair o' the earl than he's worth, and nathing the less, I trow, for
                  expectin' a' his gear, when the bairnless body dies o' his fat some o' these days.
                  I'll ferrit out the secret, if I maun lose my head for my pains; and gin a' be as
                  I suspeckit, guid faith! I wudna gie the bairn for a' the wealth o' Lon'on. It's
                  no that I care a bawbee for the brat, but I'll mak it stan' in the gap atween them
                  I ken an harm. Hegh, sirs, it's a guid send, these kittlesome times, when ane
                  disna know, if they lie down in peace, but they'll rise wi' their throats cut.
                  That coort gallant is na ither than the fayther o' the bairn, I'd swear it. I
                  cudna get a glimpse o' his face in the mask he wore; but he's no puir
                  dependent—na, na—he's no puir deil livin' on his wits, that's clear to wir een,
                  blin' as we are. Then there was a minit jist when he jerked the whitter frae the
                  stag, when I thought I cud spier through a' his disguise, and tell his name as
                  well's himsel. But, ha! I amaist forgot—guid gracious! bide awee, bide awee," and
                  she drew forth from her bosom the shoe buckle the courtier dropped in his exit
                  from the cave. "Ay, ay, maybe this might gie us some insight—wha kens, wha kens?"
                  and she brought it close to the light by which father Peter knelt reading his
                  prayers. It was a square buckle, of pure gold, and of the finest French
                  workmanship, jewelled at each corner. Nell examined it closely, hoping to discover
                  the owner's name, but she could see nothing save two or three marks, of which she
                  did not comprehend the meaning. Once or twice she looked at the priest, as if she
                  wished to submit the trinket to his inspection, but hesitated to disturb him at
                  his devotions. So she laid it safely by, intending to examine it more minutely at
                  another time.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VI.
               NELL GOWER, accompanied, or rather followed, by Whitret Macbairn, set out from
                  Whinstone Hollow after midnight, and hoped to reach the Whitehorse of Wimbleton by
                  sunrise. The night was fine, and the journey short.
               Though Nell had already passed her sixtieth year, and her once raven hair turned
                  white as flax, yet she tripped along the banks of the Thames, and passed through
                  the suburbs of London, her long staff grasped firmly by the middle, with nearly as
                  much elasticity of step as when she used, long ago, to hie to a wedding on her
                  native hills. Her face, though thin and pinched, and tanned by exposure to the
                  storm and sunshine of more than half a century, had lost little of its naturally
                  bold yet benevolent character. Her large gray eyes and prominent forehead, over
                  which her white hair projected in a thick roll, and then combed back and confined
                  under her hood, gave an expression to her countenance that repelled familiarity
                  whilst it commanded respect. She wore a light gray cloak, confined by a narrow
                  leather belt round the waist that buckled in front, and the hood covered her head
                  so closely that no part of her countenance could be seen but her large, prominent
                  eyes, looking out from the dark recesses of its folds. Summer or winter, sunshine
                  or shower, she was never known to cross the threshold without the gray cloak; and
                  many were the surmises regarding it. Some said the secret of her witchcraft lay in
                  the cloak, and had come to her like the mantle of the prophet; others, that, being
                  a spaewife, she must have certain charms concealed in the hood, without which she
                  could not tell fortunes; and, finally, there were not a few who boldly averred she
                  wore it to hide her hair, which she kept cut short behind in fulfilment of a vow
                  once made to that effect. Whatever may have been her reason or her fancy for
                  continually wearing the cloak, certain it is her hair was always cropped short at
                  the poll. Yet with all the repulsiveness of look which this strange dress was
                  calculated to lend her countenance as well as her person, Nell was of a kind and
                  gentle disposition, and seldom provoked to anger or passion, except indeed when
                  her religion or her friends were traduced, and then she was implacable. When she
                  met those longwinded preachers who were to be seen every where at this period, in
                  the streets as often as in the pulpit, denouncing the idolatries of Rome and the
                  sins of the "scarlet lady," her anger rose instantly, and her hand grasped the
                  staff the tighter. But when she happened to fall in with one of the many
                  emissaries of the Congregation, on his way to London, with fresh scandals from the
                  Scotch court to feed the greedy ear of Elizabeth, she lost all patience, and
                  spared neither hand nor tongue in administering castigation on the offender. On
                  such occasions Nell was a very Fury. Many a street preacher, in the midst of his
                  well-bought blasphemies against the church, felt himself suddenly hurled from the top of his barrel into the
                  gutter by a blow from Nell's tough crabtree; and many a vilifier of Mary Stuart
                  was dragged from his midnight orgie, and well soused in the nearest horse pond, by
                  some of Nell's adherents, in payment for his dastardly calumnies. Nell knew every
                  body, and every body seemed to know her; and yet she had but few intimates, seldom
                  seen in the company of any but Whitret Macbairn, and even then she was always in
                  advance, like the cuckoo and her faithful moss-cheeper. Yet with all this seeming
                  repugnance, on Nell's part, to associate with her neighbors, she was not without
                  followers and friends, in various district's of London, ready to espouse her cause
                  and execute her orders at a moment's warning. Who they were, where they lived, or
                  how she could gather them so soon on certain sudden emergencies, no one could
                  tell; at all events, they were at her elbow when she required their services. Such
                  was Nell Gower; much beloved and trusted by the few whom she admitted to her
                  confidence, but regarded by all others as a gypsy, a fortune-teller, and a
                  dangerous woman.
               The creature who now trotted after her on the road to Wimbleton, as the reader has
                  been already informed, was the unfortunate offspring of Grace Goodniff, niece of
                  Oliver, the host of the Whitehorse. He was now in his twentieth year, a
                  diminutive, misshapen thing, seemingly deaf and dumb, and without a spark of
                  intellect or a semblance of feeling. Who his father was no one knew, and Grace
                  would never tell. When spoken to, he always shook his head and pointed to his
                  tongueless mouth; and yet some said he was known to speak, and sing, and enjoy
                  himself at certain times as well as the best of them.
               When the travellers reached Wimbleton, the stars were fast paling out before the
                  dawn of the morning, and the lights in Oliver Goodniff's hostelrie windows had
                  grown small and dim. As Nell approached, the curses and shouts of drunken revelry
                  and clashing of doors that rung in his ears, gave strong proof that her friend
                  Oliver had slept little or risen early. To Nell Gower this was no matter of
                  surprise, for, often as she passed the Whitehorse, night or day, she seldom found
                  it without customers for the well-served platter or the foaming beer can.
               As she entered the front door, a tall, soldier-looking fellow, with his neck bare
                  and his shirt and doublet sadly torn, was holding a pint pot somewhat unsteadily
                  in his hand, and disputing angrily with the master of the house. In brushing by,
                  Nell happened to touch his arm, and spill some of his liquor, which so annoyed
                  him, engaged, as he was, in the heat of argument with his host, that he turned
                  instantly on the intruder, and roughly laying hold of her hood, demanded who
                  presumed to pass so unceremoniously.
               Without deigning to answer so uncivil a question, and provoked by the gross
                  assault on her person, Nell struck him a sharp crack on the knuckles with the end
                  of her staff, that made him suddenly loose his hold.
               "A plague on thee, old beldam!" cried the fellow, smarting from the blow; "thou
                  deservest the bastinado for thy uncivil behavior."
               
               "Nay, then," said Oliver, "she hath punished thee right justly for thy foul
                  speech, Master Houghton."
               "Out on thee for a white-livered ox!" responded the fellow; "how darest thou
                  defend so rank a Papist as Sir Geoffrey Wentworth in my presence? Gadzooks, what a
                  crabbit old she-devil!" he added, examining his fingers. "Who is she, Oliver?"
               "That's more than I can tell thee, Master Houghton."
               "Hast not seen her before?"
               "Ay, marry have I; and yet I know her not."
               "She's indifferently well versed in the ways o' the house—see! she's gone down
                  among the kitchen wenches. Ho! I'll have at her again, by the belly of Bacchus!
                  I'll try another bout with her." And emptying his can, he hastened after the old
                  woman.
               "Ho, there!" he cried; "ho, Dame Beelzebub! where art thou?"
               Nell took her position near the fireplace, scanning with her keen eyes the faces
                  of three or four men seated round a table in the kitchen, garnished with various
                  drinking vessels, some of which were full and others empty and upset. They all
                  seemed, from their sleepy and disordered looks, to have spent the previous night
                  in a long drunken carouse. One of them had a book open before him, that appeared
                  to have sustained its own share of the debauch, for its leaves were wet and
                  stained in various places with filthy drops. As Nell entered the apartment, the
                  occupants were engaged lustily discussing some grave Scripture question; and the
                  man who held the book open before him on the table, whilst advancing vancing his
                  opinion, kept turning over the leaves in search of his proofs, which, it appeared,
                  were rather difficult to find.
               "The queen's gracious majesty, Master Langton, is a woman," said the one who held
                  the book, sententiously. "What sayest thou to that?"
               "A woman! ay, faith, and a virgin woman withal; a most excellent virgin woman is
                  our royal queen," replied Langton, striking the table, and making the wine stoups
                  and beer cans bounce in corroboration of his loyal assertion.
               "Now hold thee there," pursued the first speaker, "and listen to what followeth
                  after, as 'twere the point in consequence. The queen's a woman: good. Now, a
                  woman's a human being. Well, how say you to that, so far?"
               "I say to that, Master Millar, that thou'rt lame in thy premises; the queen's
                  majesty's not a woman."
               "How so, honest Jacob?"
               "Why, I hold she's an angel, and a virtuous virgin angel; and I say, Master
                  Millar, thou'rt guilty of treason to call her an unconditioned woman, and, by my
                  troth, dost well deserve the pillory for such scurvy speech."
               "And therefore I say, Master Langton, thou'rt helping me to prove my argument, as
                  'twere, for her spiritual supremacy; and the Bible here doth so declare it when it
                  saith, 'I shall,'—it beginneth with 'I shall,' or 'Thou shalt'—humph! I cannot
                  find the place here," he muttered, turning over the leaves, "but I insist on it
                  that she govern the church, and frock and unfrock priests and bishops as she
                  listeth. Who dares say aught against it
                  lieth in his throat, and will be damned for't. So here's long life to our good
                  queen, and Sir Thomas Plimpton, our most noble and worthy master, and confusion to
                  all Papistry, say I!"
               Here Houghton burst into the room in search of Nell Gower. "Hilloa, there, old
                  rue-decocter! come hither, I say, and answer me forthwith;" and he drew her by the
                  arm from the kitchen to the tap. "Art thou a devil, old hag? Quick—answer—or I'll
                  have thee hung uncontinently on the sign post."
               "A deevil, mon!" responded Nell quietly. "No, I'm no a deevil, or ye'd ken me
                  better, I ween."
               "Thou'rt a Papist, then, at least?"
               "An gin I be, what can ye mak o't?"
               "Thou confessest! Ha! a Scotch Papist, from the borders, I'll warrant thee. Now,
                  sit ye there, and listen whilst I tender the oath of supremacy." And the drunken
                  soldier thrust his filthy hand into the pocket of his jerkin, and drew forth two
                  or three papers or parchments, one of which fell on the floor. Nell saw it, and
                  signed to Whitret Macbairn to pick it up.
               As Houghton opened the copy of the famous oath of supremacy and abjuration, and
                  prepared to read it in test of Nell's faith, Oliver Goodniff waddled into the
                  room, wiping the perspiration from his fat, round face with the end of his
                  apron.
               "How now, Master Houghton!" he ejaculated, "what wouldst thou with the woman?"
               "Test her loyalty, my fat host, and thine thereafter, mayhap. Away! out with thee!
                  and leave me to do my office. But first, good Mistress Witch," he continued,
                  "thou'dst better first renounce the evil one, so thou canst forswear the pope
                  without hinderance and with a clear conscience."
               "Mind thine own business, Sergeant Houghton," interposed Oliver, pushing him back
                  from before Nell Gower; "the queen's uniform gives thee no right to maltreat the
                  queen's lieges. Let the woman go her way in peace."
               "Ho, gramercy, sir host! what knowest thou of rights and lieges?" replied
                  Houghton, balancing on his heels and grasping at Nell's cloak. "Hilloa, there,
                  most learned Master Millar! come hither, and leave thy points and reasonings.
                  Here's a Papist, or a devil, or something o' that kind—help me to arrest her in
                  the queen's name."
               "What, man!" muttered Millar, a strong, thick-set, clerical-looking man of about
                  fifty yeas of age, staggering up to Houghton, "dost not know the woman? Gads me!
                  that's the spaewife, and's as mad as a March hare. Away!" he continued, "away,
                  thou crazy old baggage, and rid us thy presence instantly!" and he pointed to the
                  door; "out with thee, and begone!"
               "Thou knowest her, then?" observed Houghton.
               "Ay, right well do I."
               "A murrain take her, the wicked, ill-tempered, old she-witch!"
               "Ay, faith, she's like her native thistle; she pricks thy fingers if thou but
                  touch her. And so thou wouldst test her—ha, ha!—did she crack thy knuckles, that
                  thou feelest them go?"
               "Ay, marry hath she."
               
               "Well, sergeant, she hath but given thee a token, in those swollen fingers, to
                  remember her by; so put up thy papers, and let's be going. Our stay at the
                  Whitehorse has been somewhat of the longest, and Sir Thomas may expect our
                  presence in German Street. So have at thee once more, Master Oliver, and let's
                  drink the parting stoup to——"
               "Gadzooks! how's this?" interrupted Sergeant Houghton, taking out various papers
                  from his pockets, and looking round the floor of the tap.
               "What concerns thee, friend Houghton? Hast lost thy purse?"
               "Curse take the purse! No; I tell thee I've lost what's of more value than ten
                  purses."
               "A paper, was't?"
               "Ay, a paper; hast seen it?"
               "Truly, yes, thereabout on the floor, but thought it of little moment. Marry, I
                  saw the dumb creature pick it up. Hoa, there, dwarf, or evil spirit, where art
                  thou?" And Millar, followed by Sergeant Houghton, proceeded to search for Whitret
                  Macbairn.
               When Nell Gower left the tap, she took the paper from Whitret, and quietly
                  ensconcing herself in a small room off the kitchen, opened it, and read as
                  follows:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              Written at HAMPTON, the 16th day of June.
                              SERGEANT HOUGHTON:—
                           
                           Be ready with thy guard to accompany me, three days hence, to
                              Worcestershire, there to execute the commands of her most gracious
                              majesty in reference to what I have already made known to thee. Be
                              careful that thy roistering propensities loosen not thy tongue to my
                              prejudice, lest the old fox carry off his young ere we reach his lair.
                              My sign manual attached hereto will give thee access to me at Hampton
                              Court or elsewhere, and also lend thee proper credit with thy
                              associates. Thy patron and master, as thou deservest,
                           
                              THOMAS PLIMPTON, Bar't.
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               "Now may the guid God be thanket," said Nell, whispering to herself, and refolding
                  the letter, "for this wee bit winfa'. Little kens the writer that mair een than
                  his ain hae been watchin' the auld fox o' Brockton an his bonnie young one. But
                  I'll be afore him yet, ay, wull I, if I maun wear my auld banes through the skin.
                  I'll di it, and no think muckle trouble o't either—the bonnie bairn, that
                     she loes so weel! May God gie me strength," she continued,
                  crossing herself reverently, "to save her frae the hands o' this wicked carl, and
                  bring her safe to Holyrood, into the airms o' her ain trusty frien'! I'll mak the
                  trial; an gin I die in the effort, why, it's the last o' Nell Gower, the Scotch
                  spaewife, that's a'— the guid for naething auld donnerd body, that's ower long
                  lived for a' the grace that comes o' her."
               "Nell Gower, didst thou say?" muttered a half-smothered voice from the bed beside
                  her.
               Nell turned round hastily on the trunk where she sat, and, much to her surprise,
                  recognized the face of Grace Goodniff half concealed under the bedclothes.
               "Weel, now, if that's no queer," said Nell. "An how cam ye to leave Hampton,
                  lassie, and what gars ye keep sleepin' here, an the sun blinkin' through the winnock there. Ye've been packed awa,
                  I'll warrint."
               "Packed awa," repeated Grace; "how many times hast asked me that question? I tell
                  thee, as I oft did before, there's but little fear o' my dismittance."
               "An how cam ye here, then?"
               "I came last night with a letter."
               "Frae the auld doctor?"
               "Ay, from Dr. Maraski to the queen mother."
               "Why, the auld mediciner an ye maun be unco gracious, whin ye think sae little o'
                  trudgin' frae Hampton to Wimbleton o' nights to obleege him," said Nell, in a
                  gossiping tone.
               "He seemeth a very godly-living man," observed Grace, "and I'd fain do his
                  pleasure, seeing there be few about the court to care for his comfort. As for
                  being gracious, verily I cannot say, for I have never spoken with him or seen him
                  but once."
               "But once!" repeated Nell, surprised at the admission; "why, woman, I thought ye'd
                  been as intimate as the weft and the warp. Sure ye maun see him when he hands ye
                  the letters."
               "He hath never handed me a letter, Nell."
               "No, woman? ne'er handed ye a letter? An how cam ye by them, bairn?"
               "I've always found them in my room, with the directions for me written. Mayhap the
                  old man cannot speak our language so well as he can write it."
               Nell paused for a moment to reflect, and then inquired if she could see the
                  letter. But Grace told her it was already on its way to France, being given last
                  night to the foreign post.
               "I'd gie a crown to see it," said Nell, thoughtfully; "but na matter now. I hae
                  ither things to speak o', and had thoughts o' sendin' Whitret Macbairn for ye to
                  Hampton. Sae I'm mare nor a trifle pleased to hae ye here at my elbow. So the
                  queen's no to say jist weel in health?" inquired Nell, cautiously.
               "Hush!" responded Grace, glancing at the door; "there be long ears in
                  Wimbleton."
               "Na doubt on't, lassie; na doubt on't," whispered Nell; "and it's, as we maun say,
                  atween us twa, a little subject to brauch, een in the kiln pot. So I'll pit a
                  kippin in the hesp, and draw the kist nearer the bed for mare security."
               As we are bolted out, gentle reader, we must not be tempted, as many have been
                  before us, to play the eavesdropper. So we leave Nell Gower and Grace Goodniff to
                  their secret gossip, and proceed with our story in another chapter.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VII.
               IT was a beautiful moonlight night in June, and the dews on the flowers before the
                  parlor windows of Brockton Hall, the residence of Sir Geoffrey Wentworth, imparted
                  a delightful and soothing fragrance to the air. The moonbeams, struggling through
                  the dense foliage of the elm and sycamore, silvered the well-trimmed avenues with
                  checkered streaks. The brook below the garden wound its tortuous course through
                  the alders and dwarf hazel that grew thickly on its banks, and intertwining their
                  branches, covered it over like an arbor. The lights had been long extinguished in
                  the front rooms of the old mansion, and the dark shadows which the aged trees,
                  planted there some centuries before, threw upon the venerable pile, gave it a look
                  of loneliness and desertion. Not a sound was astir, if we except the dreary and
                  monotonous murmur of the little brook below that came ever upon the ear like the
                  hum of a distant wind-mill. Yet under those sombre towers of Brockton, still and
                  lonely as they looked, there were sad hearts and waking eyes.
               A large white staghound lay stretched at full length in one of those streams of
                  light that fell upon the avenue before the house, enjoying the cool air after the
                  fatigue of the chase. The poor fellow had doubtless run many a long mile under the
                  warm sun of the preceding day, and laid himself down to rest his wearied limbs and
                  cool his fevered blood under the night dews. He was, as he lay there, the very
                  picture of repose and contentment. Yet, motionless as he seemed, he was not
                  asleep, for ever and anon his eyes would suddenly open, fix themselves steadily
                  for a moment on some object within the parlor window, and then slowly close again.
                  The interest he seemed to feel in something there was apparently the only cause of
                  his watchfulness; for every thing around him, even to the leaves and flowers,
                  after a long effort to sustain life through the sultry day, had at length sunk
                  exhausted in a profound lethargy. Whilst the dog was thus enjoying his sleepless
                  rest, a figure might be seen stealing along the side wall of the house, in the
                  direction of the open window, watching the dangerous animal, and treading lightly
                  on the greensward. The figure was that of a woman, wrapped closely in a
                  gray-colored cloak, the hood of which covered nearly the whole face. As soon as
                  she had approached within a few yards of the window, the dog saw her, and sprang
                  up growling; but the woman spoke to him as he rushed forward, and he instantly
                  crouched and returned to his place. When she reached the window, she touched some
                  one within, who awoke with a start, demanding who was there, or if that was Nell
                  Gower.
               "And guid save us," said the person addressed, in broad Lowland Scotch, "hae ye
                  fell asleep under the cauld night air? Woot, lassie, ye maun tak tent ye dinna
                  harm yersel."
               
               "O dear, Nell, I have been waiting so long! What hath detained thee?"
               "Nathing ava," replied the old woman, climbing over the window sill. "I made as
                  muckle haste as my auld banes wad admit o'."
               "And what tidings bringest thou, Nell?"
               "Weel, the tidins might be waur," replied Nell, untying the ribbon under her chin,
                  and throwing back the hood over her shoulders. "The news is no sae pleasant as I'd
                  fain hae to tell ye, Mistress Alice; but it might be waur; ou, ay, it might be
                  waur, lassie."
               "Didst see Whitret Macbairn, and hath he been to Hampton?" eagerly inquired Alice,
                  looking apprehensively in the face of the old woman.
               Nell Gower nodded assent, and then sitting down on the low stool at the feet of
                  her companion, took her delicate hand, and pressed it affectionately within her
                  sunburnt and bony fingers, gazing tenderly in her face as she spoke.
               "Now, my bonnie bairn, the news I bring frae Whitret Macbairn are no sae bad, and
                  they're no to say sae guid either; but still they might be waur, and that ye ken
                  is nae sma' comfort. Weel, its na mare than what ye hae been expectin' these four
                  months gane, an if this deil bird, Sir Thomas Plimpton, be comin'
                  here to mak the second tender to Sir Geoffrey, why it's een a' the
                  better, hinnie; it's ay well to ken the warst, as my auld grandmither ust to say.
                  If the war maun come, let it come, and if ye canna fight, ye maun flee."
               "I knew it, Nell—I always knew it: my mind hath ever been telling me we should one
                  day be driven from Brockton."
               "Ou, weel, lassie, times maun change, ye ken, an folks maun change wi' them; its
                  an auld sayin', an na doubt comes o' the will o' Providence."
               "Yesterday," said Alice, "whilst Sir Geoffrey was taking his walk after breakfast,
                  I wandered round the old place, through the flower beds and the aviary, and along
                  the pond, and through the rabbits, and called out the ponies, and fed them; and
                  all that day something was telling me I would never see them again; and I
                  thought—but I suppose it was only fancy— that the rabbits came nearer to me than
                  they used to do, and the ponies lay down beside me and ate the apples from my hand
                  more gently than they ever did before."
               "Its a' fancy, bairn; dinna fret yersel wi sic foolish thoughts; its a'
                  fancy."
               "And after I had turned from the stables, I looked back again, and there was
                  Pepin, with his neck stretched out from the stable door, gazing and neighing after
                  me, as much as to say, "God be with thee, Alice; thou wast ever a kind mistress to
                  me."
               "Weel, dear, dinna fret, dinna fret, but tak heart o' grace, an a' may yet be
                  weel. Only think o' the martyrs, an a' the ills they suffered; many a cantie lass
                  parted wi' mair nor a' the flowers and ponies, an' sic trifles aboot Brockton, to
                  preserve the faith; ay, lassie, and right thankful they were to hae sic a blessed
                  and hopefu' destiny to meet."
               "True," said the young girl, as Nell Gower wiped the tears from her eyes, "but they were saints,
                  Nell, and I am but a weak, timid thing, that never knew what it was to encounter
                  difficulty or danger."
               "Na matter, Alice Wentworth; dinna fear for a' that; God will no desert ye in yer
                  need, for ye wur, aye, a prayerfu', pious bairn. O, weel I remember to see ye a
                  wee winsome thing at Linlithgow, where Father Leslie said mass, under the auld ivy
                  waas o' the castle. It was the day poor Jack Nicolson, the daft bailie, was
                  buried; and ye wur kneeling by Sir Geoffrey, the comeliest knight in a' that
                  getherin'. O, weel do I remember. It was the first time since his weddin' I e'er
                  set eye on his honest, sonsy face; an' mair, betoken, he was married the very day
                  the holy Abbot of Glastonbury was carried prisoner to Newgate."
               "That was the beginning of our misfortunes, Nell; when are they to end?"
               "Hoot, lassie dear, and what's a' the misfortune can e'er befa' ye, to the rack an
                  skeath I hae endured? There's my twa lads, as douse callants as e'er drew bow or
                  braidsword, cut down in a' their pith and might, an now lyin' low in the auld
                  kirkyard o' Stirling, an a' because they wudna tak up airms for Glencairn, the
                  fause heretic boon. An there's my last bairn, shot in my airms comin' frae the
                  auld abbey o' Whippinscauld; and there's my bit cabin, where I was born, an a'
                  afore me sin' the days o' guid King Robert, burnt to the ground, an no as much as
                  a kippin left. Weel, an where's the injury—wha's the evil it did me? Pugh! deil a
                  bodle's worth. And why for no, hinnie? Why, een because I keep aye sayin' to
                  mysel, Its a' right, its the will o' Heaven. Things maun change; an if for the
                  better, let's be thankfu'; an if for the waur, why, lets e'en mak the best
                  o't."
               "As for myself, Nell, I would cheerfully bear all the evils they could inflict,"
                  replied Alice, "if they but spared Sir Geoffrey in the old place. To part with
                  Brockton, I fear, will break his heart."
               "It's a bra' stately auld mansion, I'll no deny that," responded Nell, looking up
                  to the carved ceiling and round the oaken wainscoting, partially illumined by the
                  moonlight, "an it gars me greet amaist to think it may yet fa' to the lot o' a
                  heretic like Sir Thomas Plimpton, who na doubt's impatient to desecrate the wee
                  chapel, an the bonnie altar, where mony a mass was sung, and mony a fecfu' babe
                  was christened that's now the head o' a princely house."
               "And then," murmured Alice, communing with her own thoughts rather than in reply
                  to her companion, there are the old family pictures, which he visits every day,
                  and speaks to, as if they understood him; there's the oratory, where he goes every
                  evening to pray, at my mother's tomb; there's the shrine of the Abbot of
                  Glastonbury, whose bones he carried from Newgate, and on which he hath seen mass
                  offered up, on the first of every month, for five and twenty years; there are the
                  trees in the garden on which he hath chronicled many a national event, and the
                  name of many a martyr; and there's the fish pond, and the falcons—O Nell," she
                  cried, throwing her arms round the old woman's neck, and weeping bitterly, "it will surely kill
                  him to part with Brockton."
               The dog, hearing the plaintive tones of his mistress's voice, leaped through the
                  open window, fawned upon her, licked her hand, and then lay down whining sadly at
                  her feet.
               Nell Gower brushed back the auburn locks from the fair forehead of the young girl,
                  and kissed it affectionately, while a tear, that would not be repressed, trickled
                  down her own thin and wrinkled cheek. "Weel, now," she muttered in that low
                  endearing tone so peculiar to the Scotch, "I'll gang awa, I'll gang awa and leave
                  ye, if ye dinna tak tent and listen to me. I little thought ye'd tak on sae
                  childish, an a' aboot nathing ava; ye'll be a puir comfort to the bonnie queen o'
                  Scots when ye gang wi' me to Holyrood, twa three days hence; just think o' her,
                  how she suffers frae fause friends an open foes, the bonnie bird that a' the
                  English kites an Scotch kestrils are pursuin' o'. And wha'll console Sir Geoffrey,
                  when his ain bairn, who ought to be a stout staff to lean upon in his auld age, is
                  nathing but a windle straw, that bends wi' the first breath o' the storm. Hoot,
                  lassie, dinna be sae doonhearted."
               But though Alice, leaning her head upon her old friend's shoulder, seemed to
                  listen attentively to her kindly advice, she was all the time thinking of her
                  father.
               "He's displeased with me, Nell," she said.
               "Who?"
               "Sir Geoffrey. I told him yesterday, when thou went to make inquiries at the
                  village, that I would right cheerfully marry Sir Thomas Plimpton, to save him and
                  Brockton."
               "Gude preserve us, lassie; yer clean daft!"
               "And that God might yet give me the grace to love him as a husband, and then we
                  might all be happy, and live forever in the old place."
               "Weel, and what said the knight?"
               "He rose up from the breakfast table, and walked out to the garden without saying
                  a word. I followed, and found him sitting on the green plot under the sun-dial,
                  and plucking up the grass in a very sullen mood. I spoke to him, but he answered
                  not a word. He kept his eyes still fixed on the ground. I then knelt beside him,
                  and, kissing his forehead, while he endeavored to turn away, begged him to forgive
                  me if I said any thing to vex him. He rose up, and would not speak a word. When I
                  returned, however, and began to copy from the old manuscript as usual, he came in,
                  and opening the door, told me never again to speak of marrying that man, or he
                  would burn the manuscript and employ Goodman Whitherstone, the village
                  schoolmaster, as his confidential secretary."
               "An where's the wonder, I'd like to ken," replied Nell Gower; "saints preserve us!
                  who e'er heard the likes o't? Marry a man who first a's a rank traitor, whate'er
                  the queen may think; an secondly, has na mair regard for yersel personally, than
                  for the dourest wench in Fleet Street!"
               "I know full well," responded Alice, "he seeks my fortune rather than my love; and
                  were the happiness of my dear old
                  father not involved in my refusal of his hand, I would sooner wed the humblest
                  peasant in England. Yet if he come here again, he will surely make a second tender
                  of the oath, and my father will as surely refuse; and being a commoner, Sir Thomas
                  may sequestrate his estate, transport him, or even bring him to the scaffold. God
                  direct me in this trying difficulty."
               "Difficulty!" said Nell; "there's nane ava, woman."
               "And perhaps, after all, it may be the will of God."
               "What mean ye?"
               "That I marry this man."
               "Heaven forfend, Alice; an its no clear to me, child, but it's sinfu' e'en to
                  speak o' sic a thing. God cud na wish any creature to mak sican a sacrifice as
                  that."
               "He might make it the means to attain some great object, Nell; we cannot fathom
                  the designs of Providence."
               "Hoot awa wi' ye, bairn! Marry a lang-faced villain, an ill-favored miser, a son
                  of Watt Plimpton, the Sussex smuggler, who's gane, lang since, to gie in his
                  accounts o' murders, an shipwrecks, enoo to bring the wraith o' Heaven on a' his
                  kith an kin for twa centuries to come. An a' to benefit Sir Geoffrey Wentworth!
                  Hoot, woman! he'd rather see ye dead, an Brockton an a' its pictures, an sic
                  bawbles, down Ailsa Lynn, than see his bonnie linnet mated wi' sic a raven. Haud
                  yer tongue, lassie, an dinna speak to me sic fashion. I canna thole it ava."
               "O, but Nell——"
               "Now, dinna open yer lips mair aboot it," interrupted Nell Gower; "it gars me feel
                  dolefu' to hear sic foolish things from ane who ought to ken better;" and the old
                  woman arranged the dishevelled tresses of the young and innocent girl, and threw
                  them back over her shoulders, with the tender fondness of a mother.
               "Methinks, Nell, thou'st told me a little time ago, that thou didst love thine
                  husband very tenderly, though thou also confessed thy parents compelled thee to
                  wed him."
               "Me?" replied Nell; "compelled me, lassie? Ou, no, it was na jist compulsion; the
                  case was very different—ye ken——"
               "So I bethought me," continued the simple girl, "that if I married this man, I
                  would save my father from exile, nay, from death; and then, perhaps, God would not
                  blame me for it, even though it were a union without love; and may be, in a little
                  time Heaven would vouchsafe me grace to cherish him as a husband, just as thou
                  didst cherish Archie Gower long ago in the little cabin on the Pentland
                  Hills."
               "Vera weel," replied Nell, smiling at her simplicity, "vera weel, but ye'll tak
                  this wi'ye, whilk maks a waefu' differ, that Archie Gower loed me for mysel, and
                  Sir Thomas Plimpton loes ye for yer siller."
               "And what then shall we do?" murmured Alice, in a tone of despair, when she saw
                  the visionary hope she indulged of sacrificing herself to save her father suddenly
                  dissipated. "O, dear Nell, can nothing else be done, and must my father quit
                  forever the retreat which, of all
                  places in the world, he loves the best?"
               "I didna say fore'er—na, na, not fore'er; jist twa three years, till the storm
                  blaws by—he'll no fin' the time passin' awa in bonnie France, where na doubt he'll
                  be weel befriended by the queen mither."
               "Nell Gower, thou dost not know my father. I tell thee, he will never quit
                  Brockton alive. It was but yesterday he came to announce his resolution of putting
                  the castle in a state of defence against the royal pursuivants; and when I essayed
                  to dissuade him from the folly of such a step, he went directly to the library,
                  and bringing down an old folio, opened it there before me, and began to read some
                  ancient chronicle of a church that was successfully defended against the Goths, in
                  the time of Leo X., by three priests."
               "God guide him," said Nell; "he'll soon be daft a' thegither. Weel, Mrs. Alice, I
                  hae jist been thinkin' it o'er in my mind," she continued, after a pause of some
                  length, "if we canna persuade Sir Geoffrey to quit the auld place through a
                  reasonable dread o' the law, why canna we devise some plan of whilin' him awa? Nou
                  gin ye come wi' me to Whinstane Hollow, we'll een send Whitret Macbairn wi' a
                  letter, ye ken, written wi' yer ain hand, entreetin' him to come an see ye. He'll
                  no refuse ye, na fear o'that; an, when I hae him there, dinna fear I'll no provide
                  for his safe keepin'. So come awa, my bonnie bairn; we hae but little time to
                  spare."
               "I could not find it in my heart to leave him, even for an hour, Nell, he's so
                  simple and so thriftless. Besides, there's no one here he speaks to but Reddy and
                  myself."
               "Is na the gatekeeper there, an the laundress, an the steward? wud na they screen
                  him frae the harpies for twa three days? But guid be aboot us, lassie, who comes
                  here!" And turning, both beheld Sir Geoffrey Wentworth issuing from an inner room,
                  carrying a light in one hand and a paper in the other.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VIII.
               THE countenance of the old knight (for he had turned his seventieth year) was as
                  fresh and rosy as if he had numbered but thirty summers. Yet his once active
                  though slender frame had changed much since Nell Gower saw him at Linlithgow; he
                  was now bent under the weight of years, and the unremitting studies of almost a
                  quarter of a century, and the hand that carried death to many a stout soldier at
                  Pinkie now trembled as it held up the lamp through the shadowy and silent
                  apartment. As he advanced, the light fell upon a massive, antique gold crucifix,
                  that appeared within the folds of his open doublet. Behind his right ear he
                  carried a pen, the feather of which lay against his glossy temple, while the point
                  behind concealed itself in the recesses of his long white hair. There was a black
                  streak upon his chin, and the upper part of his doublet was covered with ink
                  stains so thickly that a stranger would have taken it for another garment.
               He had crossed the room nearly half way, passing within a few inches of the
                  watchers, who hardly breathed, lest the noise should disturb him, when he stopped
                  suddenly, as if to reflect, and then retracing his steps to the door whence he
                  issued, called in a low, stealthy voice, "Reddy—Reddy Connor, ye villain, come
                  hither! I had almost forgotten gotten the box." Immediately footsteps were heard
                  faintly falling in the direction of the door, then a few hurried whispers, and the
                  knight returned.
               Whilst Sir Geoffrey was engaged speaking to the person already named, Nell Gower
                  whispered Alice her suspicion that her father had heard of Plimpton's cominging,
                  and was preparing to remove some valuables from the house.
               "Hush!" replied Alice, "he's returning."
               Sir Geoffrey, looking neither to the right nor the left, walked straight to a door
                  that opened into a small private apartment, and entering, left it carelessly ajar,
                  little thinking he should be seen by any of the few inmates of Brockton at so late
                  an hour. On the wall, above the table on which he placed the lamp, hung a
                  crucifix, and various pictures on either side. Many of them were apparently new,
                  as if they had been lately executed, and seemed, from the glory that surrounded
                  the heads and the palms they carried in their hands, to be chiefly martyrs who had
                  recently died for the old faith. Three or four larger ones, that hung side by side
                  in a row, were evidently of an older date and by better artists. There was one,
                  however, that rested upon the table, in a simple frame of coarse wood, and covered
                  with a dark veil. When the old man laid the lamp down, he took from the capacious
                  pocket of his ample doublet a small and richly-ornamented rosary, and kneeling,
                  prayed for a few minutes before the crucifix. He then rose, and taking the veil
                  off the picture on the table, sat down beside it. Alice and Nell Gower, who stood
                  up as the knight first appeared, in order to greet his approach, remained in the same position, silent spectators of
                  the scene.
               "So they're coming," began Sir Geoffrey, directing a meaning look at the picture
                  on the table, (it was the arrest of the Abbot of Glastonbury whilst in the act of
                  offering the mass,)—"they're coming at last to tear me from Brockton, just as they
                  tore thee from the holy altar, my well-beloved cousin and school-fellow. Ha, ha!
                  and right slightingly they think of me; they opine, mayhap, I have forgotten the
                  use of the arquebuse and the bow. Ha, ha! gramercy, friend, they'll find my books
                  have not yet entirely loosed my thews and sinews, nor obliterated the science of
                  war we once learnt together in Somersetshire. Here is the missive," he said,
                  laying the paper on the table, "to inform me of the hostile visit of Sir Thomas
                  Plimpton, and I pray thee let it be my apology for so late a conference, seeing
                  it's a matter requiring urgency of despatch. Thou'st seen the father of this
                  heretic knight, some thirty years gone, at Bristol, on trial for piracy on the
                  high seas. Ay, faith! and now his worshipful son, Sir Thomas, under thy favor,
                  cometh hither in ghostly mood, with the warrant of Mr. Secretary Cecil to search
                  my house for recusants, and arrest my poor person, and sequestrate my estate, if I
                  persist in refusing the oath of the queen's supremacy. Holy saints of heaven," he
                  continued, taking off his little black skullcap with his finger and thumb, and
                  bowing reverently, as he looked around in general appeal to all present—"heard ye
                  ever the like! Elizabeth Tudor, the offspring of Henry—and—hum! that other one,"
                  again bowing deprecatingly, as if he had gone too far—"the head of the church of
                  Christ. Thou hast doubtless heard the reports which have been circulated— for they
                  have even reached Brockton—respecting that young lady and the Earl of—but no—well
                  —no—thou'rt right—no—I must not speak here of such things. I humbly beg thy
                  pardon. Verily I had almost forgotten in whose presence I sat. And this Plimpton
                  fellow would fain marry my Alice forsooth, and, in exchange, consent to cancel the
                  order of arrest and forfeiture; nay, I doubt me not, could be prevailed on to
                  accord us the privilege of all manuscripts, books, pictures, and ponies at
                  Brockton for our use and behoof forever. Ha, ha! Voluit me
                     vivere, prostravi et vixi. As for turning reformer, why, it wouldn't
                  do at all! I should begin to banish the memory of myself, which, it seemeth, I
                  never could effect. For verily I have lived for five and twenty years and more out
                  of the world, though it might appear to men I lived within it. The old body was
                  here always to be seen wandering round the old place, but the spirit and the
                  thoughts were with ye, holy saints. Many a pleasant hour we spent together— if the
                  truth must be told, many a spicy piece of controversy we have had together. Ha,
                  ha! thou'lt not forget that, St. Augustine; thou rememberest how I pitched thee in
                  the corner once, and refused to acknowledge thy acquaintance, on account of thy
                  article de justificatione, till St. Thomas
                  explained the difficulty, and brought about a reconciliation. So, if I turned
                  reformer, as they call it, I should turn my back on ye all, and never think of our happy
                  associations more. I should forget the spirit world I lived in so long—the world
                  through which thought carried me so many years, and sustained me so pleasantly. I
                  was just thinking—St. Thomas of Aquin, thou wilt understand me best—how lonely I
                  would be if I lost my memory, and forgot all at once the grand old times when the
                  proudest nobles of the land, surrounded by their countless retainers, knelt on the
                  flagged pavements, under the ancient Gothic roofs, to hear the holy mass and
                  receive the bishop's blessing, ere they marched against the infidel; when the
                  vesper song rose from every cloister through this once happy land; when the
                  portals of the old monasteries lay open night and day to receive the weary
                  wanderers; when queens and princesses, and lordly nobles, and knights of high
                  degree, came to the shrine to confess and do penance at the bidding of the priest;
                  and still further back, when the old monks enlightened, and the old saints
                  purified, and the old popes governed and gladdened the world. I was thinking, if I
                  lost my memory, how lonely I would be. I could no longer wander away through the
                  distant ages of faith and Christian chivalry. I could no longer leave the earth,
                  and rise up in thought to other spheres. I would be like a poor bird, whose wings
                  were cut off. I could never fly again. Nay, if that ever happen, I pray God to
                  take old Geoffrey Wentworth to himself, for without memory an old Catholic
                  recusant has no business here. O, no, setting aside salvation altogether, that
                  would be black ingratitude to ye, my friends, who kept my company so long, and
                  never wronged me even by a suspicious thought. And thou St. Thomas Aquinas, most
                  eminent of doctors, whilst I must needs confess I disagree with thee on some
                  points, especially on that question of the sacrifice of Abraham, nevertheless, I
                  must admit I am deeply indebted to thee for thy beautiful theories and
                  metaphysical arguments. Still, though we differed sometimes, thou'lt candidly
                  acknowledge I never permitted the patriarch to occasion any serious trouble
                  between us; not at all—and well I wot that sorry would he be to cause any
                  estrangement. As for thee, St. Bernard, I always reverenced thee at a distance; I
                  never tried to imitate thee, for well I knew that was impossible; but I followed
                     longo intervallo, and like thyself I might
                  say, 'Vixi inter vestibulum et altare.' O, thou
                  dost not agree to that!" continued the knight, interrupting the course of his
                  speech as he looked up to the painting of the doctor, and fancied he saw it move.
                  "O, well I know, of course, that's true. But what could I do? I never could have
                  observed thy strict rules at Brockton, and thou knowest I told thee, twenty years
                  ago, when thou once spoke to me of entering a monastery, I could not part with my
                  child. Yet have I not written much on retirement, and the consolations of the
                  religious state? Look at that manuscript folio! I dedicated it and presented it to
                  thee as a sort of amends for all my backslidings; and Father Peter, my confessor,
                  who has been for many years on intimate terms with thee, and, as he saith, can
                  speak in thy name, gave me to understand thou wert content. I speak of those
                  things now because I would fain have no misunderstanding with thee when we part.
                  Indeed, St. Bernard, and St. Thomas,
                  not forgetting thee either, St. Augustine, I always loved ye next to God and my
                  child. I was never happy but when in your company, reading with ye one while and
                  conversing with ye another; and if I ever disputed your proofs, it was only on
                  minor points, and we loved each other nothing the less for that. Sometimes I
                  thought ye looked a little jealous when I played too much with the ponies and the
                  falcons; but that was only fancy. So I'll go down now on my knees and ask your
                  pardon if ever I did ye wrong, by thought, word, or deed, or omitted to do your
                  bidding, or take your advice, if it was not for sickness, or the weakness of human
                  nature; and I beg ye will pray God to forgive me my sins, for your sakes. Now,"
                  said he, rising up, and again casting a melancholy look at his three favorite
                  saints, "I won't see ye for a few days, face to face, but I'll be near ye—I'll not
                  part company with ye; so ye need not be the least uneasy on that score. I'll
                  protect ye as long as I can, and if this Sir Thomas Plimpton meets me on the way,
                  and attempts to carry ye off, I'll surely kill him. Not at all," interrupted Sir
                  Geoffrey, replying to a fancied admonition of the picture. "I will not—I shan't
                  obey ye in that; ye have no right to speak in your own case. I will not provoke
                  him—certainly not. I promise ye I won't provoke him. But I'll defend ye to the
                  death. Ha, ha! wouldst thou not look well, St. Thomas," pursued the knight,
                  chuckling to himself, "in possession of that heretic villain, who'd poniard thee
                  with as little concern as he would a meal sack!"
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               WHILST the old man was concluding his soliloquy, or rather his dialogue, he had
                  mounted on a chair, and having taken down the pictures, began to detach the canvas
                  from the frames; and Nell Gower, taking Alice by the arm, led her from the
                  apartment, whispering as she went, "Dinna greet, bairn, dinna greet; sure it's na
                  desertin' the auld place he is, hinnie; it's but takin' awa frae the hands o' the
                  spoiler a' whee pictures and books to a place o' safety. Now haud ye there," she
                  continued, as they entered Alice's little chamber—"haud ye there and mak ready,
                  whilst I gae mysel to hurry honest Reddy wi' the ponies."
               Nell Gower had already taken precaution to acquaint Reddy of her designs in
                  reference to Alice and Sir Geoffrey, and directed him to make the necessary
                  arrangements for their flight, intending, as she said, to notify the knight of his
                  daughter's place of retreat as soon as they had reached it. She supposed, however,
                  that sufficient time might be had to provide the young girl with books, music,
                  &c., to relieve the ennui of Whinstone
                  Hollow, but, to her great regret, found she was mistaken. Sir Thomas Plimpton had
                  set out from London, with his escort and warrant of search, some twenty-four hours
                  before the expected time; and Whitret Macbairn had just arrived in breathless haste, with the embarrassing news that
                  they were making all speed to reach Brockton before sunrise. Nell, foreseeing the
                  danger of awaiting Plimpton's arrival both to Sir Geoffrey and Alice, resolved to
                  lose no time in hastening their departure. Alice was to quit the place as
                  privately as possible, and unknown to any one save Reddy; and when beyond the
                  reach of pursuit, Sir Geoffey to be informed of the route they had taken. The
                  knight, on the other hand, was to be assisted by Reddy to make his preparations,
                  which, to Nell's great satisfaction, the old man had himself already commenced;
                  and when all had been arranged, Reddy Connor was to follow his young mistress to
                  London with as much speed as possible.
               When Nell had delivered her various instructions and admonitions to the trusty
                  servants she returned to the chamber where she had left Alice but an hour before,
                  and to her no small surprise found that young lady ready equipped for the journey,
                  and looking as composed as if she felt no regret for leaving her father and
                  Brockton Hall.
               "Why, lassie, yer a' ready!" said Nell, with some astonishment.
               "Ready? Yes," replied Alice; "art thou?"
               "Guid faith, Alice Wentworth! ye hae dried yer een sae weel, and look sae
                  sprightly, that ane id hae thought ye ne'er grat sin yer nursery days."
               "I've wept enough," replied Alice, "these six months, and would now fain try
                  another course."
               "Right weel said, lassie; and I tell ye, woman, it gies me muckle pleesure to see
                  ye gather courage enow frae the auld bluid, to tak this step."
               "I feel, Nell, I must quit Brockton Hall, at least for a time, if I wish to save
                  my father; for well I know he would never leave without me; and therefore have I
                  striven against my natural weakness so successfully, that methinks I have at last
                  summoned resolution enough to quit the old place. My father will return to-morrow,
                  to barricade the house, after depositing his pictures, books, &c., in a place
                  of safety, and expect to find me here. Alas! what will the old man think, when he
                  finds I have abandoned him?"
               The calm, confident tone in which Alice spoke, contrasting so strongly with the
                  puerile fears she betrayed but an hour before, excited some apprehension in the
                  old woman, notwithstanding her expressions of pleasure, that excessive grief was
                  producing a baneful effect on her mind; and taking the young girl by the hand, she
                  said, looking up doubtfully in her face,—
               "An what gars ye look sae composed, bairn, at sic a time as this?"
               "Composed? and why not, Nell? Surely, I need both energy and composure to meet the
                  dangers that beset us."
               "Weel, weel, I ken a' that; but yer sae muckle changed, Alice, and sae suddenly,
                  that I dinna weel what to mak o't."
               Alice smiled, and patted Nell playfully on the cheek. The simple movement, instead
                  of allaying, augmented her fears.
               "And what be this?" she demanded, taking up a poniard of curious workmanship that
                  lay on the table.
               
               "A plaything," replied Alice.
               "Guid faith! a plaything?"
               "Ay. My mother toyed with it once, whilst receiving a visit from Henry VIII., and
                  was so bold as to prick his arm, just to let him feel that the humblest and
                  simplest rose hath its thorn to protect it."
               These words had so evident an allusion to the danger she herself was about to
                  encounter, in the event of her meeting with Sir Thomas Plimpton, and pronounced
                  with such calm decision, that Nell could not help ejaculating,—
               "Hegh, woman! ye speak sae howe, that I canna say whether I be mair frekened or
                  pleased."
               "We have but little time, I fear, Nell, to waste in bootless words. Listen to me:
                  I would not again witness such a scene—I would not see that old man kneel thus and
                  speak such words again, to escape the gallows or the block. The sight of it hath
                  changed every feeling of my nature, it hath transformed me from a child into a
                  woman. I will no longer brook this tamely, as I have done. Come, Nell, I am ready.
                  I have made a vow, with God's good help, to see the queen face to face, and shall
                  not rest till I have accomplished it."
               Nell threw her arms behind her back, as she always did when any thing astonished
                  her, and gazed at Alice.
               "The queen, lassie!"
               "Ay, the queen."
               "Why, God keep ye in yer senses, bairn, ye canna see the queen. It maks me shake
                  like a windle straw to hear ye speak sic fearfu' things. But Guid be thankit, yer
                  no daft a'thegither, for yer words hae sense an pith, though they're no the words
                  o' gentle Alice Wentworth."
               "Be of good cheer, Nell," said the young girl, laying her hand fondly on the
                  shoulder of her old nurse, "and fear not for me."
               "But she'll send ye to the Tower, bairn, ere ye spake twa words to her."
               "Well," replied Alice, "I will run the risk, nevertheless."
               Nell's keen perception enabled her at once to see that a change had come, even in
                  one short hour, over the spirit of Alice Wentworth. True, Nell had seen changes in
                  others as strange as this, but seldom one so sudden. Yet as she now reflected on
                  the past, she seemed to remember some faint indications of a strong, nervous will,
                  breaking out occasionally through the simple habits and mild temperament of the
                  young girl. She knew also that incidents in life the most trifling in appearance
                  often direct human destiny—that thoughts which might long have lain still are
                  often waked up from the depths of the soul by the slightest emotion, and lead to
                  developments of character which years of education and social intercourse could
                  not elicit. So it was with Alice. Gentle, timid, artless, and weeping as she was
                  when Nell left, she now stood before her with a serene, unclouded brow, firm in
                  the consciousness of a high and holy purpose, and in possession of a will and an
                  energy sufficient to accomplish it. She assumed no haughty air of self-reliance,
                  no wrinkle of the forehead told of anger or resentment against those who wrought her father ill. Her looks
                  only expressed a calm, steady, and abiding resolve. Poor thing! she little knew
                  the risk she was running.
               Educated, for the most part, under the roof where she was born, she knew little of
                  the world and its customs. The cross was the only fashion she studied, and the
                  altar the only shrine at which she worshipped. Her morning and evening calls were
                  made to the oratory, and her associates were her books. When her hours for
                  recreation came, she would call out the ponies, to gambol with them on the green
                  round the old sun-dial, or saddling Pepin, take a canter round the park; or she
                  would sit on the brink of the fish-pond, and divide the crumbs between the trouts,
                  assembled in the water beneath her, and the rabbits, sitting with ears erect on
                  the greensward at her side. She was entirely ignorant of the etiquette of society,
                  except, indeed, what she gathered from books and from Nell Gower's stories during
                  the long winter nights; and for her scanty knowledge of passing events, she was
                  indebted to the stray minstrels who came to ask a night's lodging and guerdon for
                  their ballads at Brockton Hall. Father Peter, during his stealthy visits, seldom
                  conversed with her but on religious subjects, and her father, forever immersed in
                  scientific researches or theological studies, had little leisure and less
                  inclination to enlighten her on the ways of the world. So that Alice was but ill
                  prepared for a visit to queen Elizabeth. The simple, unsophisticated girl felt all
                  this; yet she was resolved to go and hazard her liberty and her life to save her
                  father. She thought, as no one knew the old man so well as she, no one could plead
                  his cause so well before his sovereign. She would tell her of his simple habits,
                  his extensive charities, his constant studies, his sleepless nights, his retiring
                  disposition, and his innocent eccentricities, and she felt, if Elizabeth were not
                  entirely devoid of all human sympathies, she would cancel the warrant, and restore
                  him to the undisturbed possession of Brockton Hall.
               Alice was right. Elizabeth would have granted her prayer, had she still retained a
                  single sympathy for human kind. But, alas! she had none.
               Nell preceded Alice to the stables, and there found Pepin saddled and ready for
                  the journey. The affectionate animal neighed in recognition of his mistress as she
                  appeared; and Peto, her faithful staghound, followed close behind, looking
                  sorrowful and crest-fallen, as if he knew she was leaving Brockton for ever.
               When Alice had mounted and taken the reins, Nell directed Reddy to return and
                  assist Sir Geoffrey in his preparations, and when he had seen him in a place of
                  safety, and left the house in charge of the steward, to follow them to London
                  without delay. She then mounted on a pillion behind Whitret Macbairn, and all
                  three rode off at a smart pace, followed by Peto, who kept a considerable distance
                  in the rear, lest his mistress should see him and order him to return.
               And now we must retrace our steps, and endeavor to ascertain what Sir Geoffrey had
                  been doing in our absence.
               When Reddy Connor reached the door of the little study, he saw the knight of
                  Brockton seated at a table, and apparently
                  asleep. The paintings he had detached from the frames lay neatly rolled up, and a
                  number of books piled, one upon the other, ready to be packed in a box placed on
                  the floor. Reddy entered the room on tiptoe, and noiselessly stole behind Sir
                  Geoffrey, to ascertain if he really were asleep at such an eventful time. But what
                  was his astonishment when he beheld the old man wide awake, his head bent down,
                  and his eye fixed steadily on a butterfly, the tips of whose wings at their
                  greatest extension were pinned to the table.
               "Bad luck to me," muttered Reddy, in a sort of half soliloquy, "if that disn't
                  flog the nations out an out!"
               Sir Geoffrey dropped the glass, through which he had been examining the insect,
                  and turning suddenly, stared at the intruder.
               "Well," said he, after a pause, "what brings thee here?"
               "Begorra, master, I'm afeerd yer gone entirely," said Reddy, not thinking the
                  question worth his notice.
               "Gone! where?"
               "I tould ye, ye'd fix yourself, one day or other, at them things. There ye'r now,
                  after spendin' yer night with a buttherfly, when ye ought to be thinkin' i'
                  Newgate, or makin' yer sowl, may be, for it's not long ye'll have to live if
                  Plimpton gets a hoult i' ye. O, the curse i' the crows on that divil what brought
                  it here at all, at all."
               The knight picked up the lens, and found it had fallen on and crushed the
                  insect.
               
               
                  
                     "See that! thou'st killed it, Reddy; and only six days since it was
                        born."—PAGE 119.
                  
               
               "See that! thou'st killed it, Reddy; and only six days since it was born."
               "O, murther, born! Maybe, it was christened, too. Faith, I wouldn't wondher at all
                  if it was."
               "I mean that but six days have elapsed since its transition from the chrysalis to
                  the lepidopterous state."
               "O king i' glory!"
               "What meanest thou by that exclamation?" slowly demanded the knight.
               "Me? O, nothing in the world; you're all right, av coorse. Hem! Sir, are these
                  books to be packed, and these picthers?" continued Reddy, pitching a large quarto
                  volume into the box.
               "Stop, ye villain!" and the old man seized him by the arm. "Dost know what thou'rt
                  doing—eh? Art in thy perfect senses?"
               "Av coorse not," replied Reddy; "why should I, an my masther out i' them?"
               "How dar'st thou fling him, then, with such irreverence?" demanded Sir Geoffrey,
                  pointing angrily to the book in the box.
               "Him? What di ye mean, sir?"
               "I mean St. Thomas of Aquin. Take him up again, sir, and quit the room."
               But the Irishman had no thought of quitting the room without his master.
               "Irn't ye afeerd Plimpton will arrest ye, an him at the gate there below?"
               "I'm afraid of no man, sir. I never turned my back on friend or foe."
               "But the books and picthers?" persisted Reddy.
               
               "Ah, very true; that's another affair." And pushing his servant aside, he began
                  himself to pack the books carefully, one by one, in the box. When all were in,
                  Reddy nailed down the lid, and then carrying it out to the stable yard, deposited
                  it in a vehicle.
               When Reddy returned, and expected to see his master, sword in hand, prepared to
                  leave, he found him standing on the table, vainly attempting to reach a book on
                  the upper shelf of the library, whilst both pockets were crammed and swelled out
                  to an enormous size with the pictures and various instruments for scientific
                  purposes which he could not conveniently pack in the box.
               "D'ye mane to come at all, Sir Geoffrey?" cried Reddy, looking up at his master;
                  "or what, in the world, ir ye gropin' there for, and the queen's messengers at the
                  gate?"
               "I can't reach him, Reddy."
               "Reach what, sir?"
               "St. Augustine. I can't leave him here, and all the rest of the holy fathers
                  gone."
               "Av coorse not," replied Reddy; "it id be a burnin' shame." And jumping up, he
                  snatched the volume from the shelf, and handed it to his master. "Now, sir, ir ye
                  ready to start?"
               The knight followed Reddy to the entrance hall, and taking his baldric and sword,
                  buckled them round his well-worn doublet, and was about to ascend the staircase,
                  when Reddy stopped him.
               "Not at all," said Reddy; "it's out iv all rason."
               "Why, I must see my daughter, man; let me pass."
               "Begorra, ye won't this time, deil a step."
               "Merely to bid her adieu for a few days."
               "Bad scran to the length i' my nose, an that's none i' the longest either."
               "I promise thee, Reddy, I will not awake her. I merely wish to see her—to see—to
                  see how she looks. I can't leave without seeing her; she would never forgive me.
                  O, no, you don't understand it all. Let me pass."
               "Would ye have me brak my oath?" said Reddy, as a last resource.
               "Certainly not," replied the knight.
               "Weel, I'm book sworn; now that's enough."
               "Humph!" ejaculated the old man; "that alters the case. It was very wrong of thee
                  to swear at all, Reddy; but I will not be particeps
                     criminis. Well, thou'lt convey to her my loving regards, Reddy, and
                  tell her I shall return, Deo volente, in a few
                  days; that I wish her to send for the porter's daughter in the mean time, and
                  retire with her, on the first notice of Plimpton's arrival, to the deacon's cell
                  under the western tower, and remain there till after his departure. Here is a
                  letter to that effect, which I purposed leaving on her pillow, and which thou'lt
                  hand her on the morrow, or to-night, if there be need. Tell her also of the sinful
                  oath thou hast taken, and that it was therefore I could not see her before I left.
                  Say to her that I never had any serious thoughts of employing Goodman Whiterstane
                  as my secretary, and she will always be my amanuensis as before. Tell her——"
               "To be sure," interrupted Reddy. "I know. But come, sir, ye can speak to me on the way," and the
                  faithful fellow, trembling for his master's safety, took him by the arm and pushed
                  rather than led him from the house, where all his happy associations centred, and
                  from the company of his child, round whose sleeping form his fond fancy still
                  lingered, realizing every feature of her beautiful face. Had he known the
                  truth,—had he suspected that Alice had quitted the house,—Reddy Connor, much as
                  his master esteemed him, would not have found him so submissive a charge.
               "God be with her! God be with her!" he muttered to himself, looking back in the
                  direction of her apartment, as Reddy gently pushed him forward. "God be with her!
                  I may never see her again?"
               "Reddy," he said, as they stepped into the vehicle, "thou must take good care of
                  the rabbits whilst Alice is in confinement."
               "Sartinly, sir; sit over a bit farther, av ye plaze."
               "And the ponies, Reddy; take great care of the ponies, especially of Pepin."
               "Yes, sir, av coorse, sir."
               "And the fish-pond, Reddy; and thou'lt not forget to see the falcons well grailed
                  and mewed, eh?"
               "Niver fear," replied Reddy, not attending to a word he uttered; and snatching the
                  reins from the man's hands, he drove down the avenue and passed the gates.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               REDDY CONNOR, having passed through the little village of Brockton, turned off
                  from the great road, and directed his course, by his master's orders, to the ruins
                  of an abbey some four miles distant from the Hall. The approach to it was now a
                  rough, grass-grown avenue, but still bearing the marks of former care. As the
                  rumbling and cumbrous vehicle neared the old walls which Sir Geoffrey had selected
                  for his retreat, he pointed out to his attendant the grounds that once belonged to
                  the abbey, now, alas! fallen into other hands. There above was the orchard, on the
                  hillside behind the ruins, and below the spacious lawn, which his great ancestor,
                  the first lord of Brockton, had presented to the Lord Abbot of Allanbury. It was
                  on that lawn the neighboring poor for twenty miles around were wont to assemble
                  twice each summer, on St. Barnabas and St. James's eves. There the poor mendicants
                  had their reunions. There on the greensward they recounted to each other, over
                  cans of nut-brown ale, manufactured by the fat brewer of Allanbury, their
                  wanderings over hill and dale, the sights they had seen and the dangers they had
                  encountered since they met there last. There they danced to the fife and jingling
                  tambourine, and sung in chorus the ballads of olden times, in which the monks
                  themselves were often paid off in smart allusions sions to their portly bellies and shaking sides,
                  and at which they laughed more heartily than their merry guests. There, too, was
                  the Maypole, round which the youth of the district assembled, and beyond it the
                  mews where the abbot's falcons were kept. And there was the little entrance to the
                  chapel, through which the neighbors passed each morning to hear the mass, and
                  there the walls of the larger church, whose wide portals, thrown open on Sunday
                  morning, invited the faithful for miles around to come in and assist at divine
                  service. All was now a heap of ruins; the rank weeds grew up and choked the
                  various openings and passages, the lone fern filled the windows, and the nettle
                  and chick grass crept along the steps, and spread, like a vesture, over the great
                  hall. The swallows, who had built their nests for centuries under the roof slate
                  undisturbed, had now boldly entered the chapel, and taken possession of the
                  cornice above the very altar. There, too, the feathers, which the house sparrow
                  had so industriously gathered from the neighboring barns to build his nest in the
                  sanctuary, lay scattered through the ruins by the mischievous urchins who came
                  from the adjacent villages to rob their nests. All now was desolation. The cold
                  moonlight falling on the pointed gables, and breaking into various little streams,
                  in redeeming the scene from utter darkness, only served to render it the more sad
                  and dreary to look upon.
               Sir Geoffrey, having at length arrived in front of the abbey, stepped from out the
                  vehicle, and ordering Reddy to await his return, and on no account to fall asleep
                  with such a precious treasure under his charge, ascended the steps leading to the
                  chapel. As he entered the vestibule, he reverently uncovered, as in former times,
                  and turning aside to dip his finger in the holy water font, saw it was broken
                  down, and lay in fragments on the floor.
               "Humph!" he ejaculated; "I'm always forgetting. Indeed, I believe I must be
                  somewhat defective in memory of late. But God forgive them; they did it just on
                  the very threshold, as if to bow us down the moment we enter, and leave no hope
                  whatever; it's just as if they said, in plain terms, Ye need go no farther; all is
                  demolished; we have effaced all the objects round which old memories cling and old
                  associations linger."
               When he gained the farther end of the chapel, after passing over broken statues
                  and blackened timbers, he found himself in front of the altar, at which he and his
                  ancestors for centuries before had been baptized in the faith. The moonlight shone
                  brightly through the stone window sashes, leaving the altar beneath in deep
                  shadow. Here and there the rays of light were tinged by the colors of the stained
                  glass that still adhered in small pieces to the angles of the deep sashes. The
                  roof over the altar, and for some distance beyond, seemed still in comparative
                  preservation,—sufficient at least to afford shelter to the birds that came there
                  in quest of a night's lodging. It was evident, also, from the absence of moss or
                  weeds upon the steps and about the altar, it was still an object of care to some
                  one who loved to linger round the venerable relic. Sir Geoffrey knelt down on
                     the lowest step before the shrine,
                  and taking the crucifix from his breast, kissed it fervently, and then commenced
                  to tell his beads. He rested his hands, one over the other, on the head of his
                  cane, and looked up to heaven through the broken window. The beams of light that
                  fell on his face revealed but too painfully the working of the spirit within, and
                  the tear that rolled down his cheek, and fell upon his ink-stained doublet, spoke
                  more plainly than words of the sorrow that was crushing his heart. The knight had
                  knelt in that posture for nearly half an hour, and so perfectly still and
                  motionless that one might have taken him for a statue, raised up from out the
                  ruins, and placed there in very mockery of Catholic worship, when, all of a
                  sudden, he stood up and looked around, as if something had disturbed him.
                  Presently he thought he saw a human form, wrapped in a dark cloak, advancing from
                  the shadow of the opposite wall, and halting for an instant, in its slow and
                  stealthy progress. There was nothing to distinguish it from the broken columns but
                  the motion. Hardly had he fixed his eyes, however, on this figure, when the light
                  was suddenly obscured, and turning, he saw some one leap from the window down upon
                  the altar, and heard, at the same instant, a shout and the ring of a carabine in
                  the court, not two hundred yards from where he stood. The new comer, seeing a man
                  directly before him, as if to intercept his escape, stood, for a breath or two,
                  irresolute whether to retreat or advance, when the shout was again repeated, and
                  Reddy Connor's voice heard in high altercation with someone at the front door. Sir
                  Geoffrey's first impulse was to draw his sword, and, believing the man before him
                  to be one of Sir Thomas Plimpton's escort, resolved to defend his pictures at the
                  risk of his life.
               "Another step, thou villain," cried the knight, "and I slice thy scurvy ears off.
                  Ha! by my faith, I shall teach thee better manners than to desecrate God's
                  altar."
               "I mean thee no injury," said the stranger; "and as thou seest, I am unarmed."
               "Stand back," repeated Sir Geoffrey, not heeding the reply, "and leave this place
                  as thou camest, or thy death be on thine own head."
               "What! is it possible!" and the man leaped down on the stone platform. "What! Sir
                  Geoffrey Wentworth, of Brockton Hall, here at this hour?"
               "Ay, and what wouldst thou of him?" stoutly demanded the knight.
               "Protection against my pursuers—not a sword to bar my flight. Why, dost so soon
                  forget thy friend, Father Peter?" continued the stranger, taking the old man
                  confidently by the hand, and drawing him hastily in the direction of the place
                  where the shadowy figure appeared. "Come, haste thee, friend; the enemy is within
                  arrow shot. Ha! hearest thou that?" and a bolt from an arrow broke on the pillar
                  at his side.
               "Father Peter," muttered Sir Geoffrey: "eh, sirs! and by my good sooth," he
                  continued, looking in his face, and following somewhat tardily, "I believe thou
                  art the very man. But my books are all exposed to the fury of these murderers. There's St. Thomas,
                  and St. Bernard, and——"
               "Hush!" said the priest; "and come instantly, or we are both lost."
               "But," persisted Sir Geoffrey, dropping his voice to a whisper, and still
                  suffering his frend to drag, rather than lead him along,—"but, Father Peter, I
                  made a vow never to part company with St. ——"
               "Nonsense, sir; this is mere folly. I shall not permit thee to endanger thy life
                  and mine for an object so trifling."
               "Trifling!" repeated Sir Geoffrey, astonished at the priest for using such an
                  expression; "why, I tell thee, man, St. Bernard, and St. Thomas, and St. ——"
               "Peace, Sir Geoffrey, I beg thee, peace, and follow unresistingly;" and the
                  priest, preceded by the muffled figure, led the old knight through the deep shadow
                  of the wall, until they came to a marble slab, which formed the inner square of
                  the base of a column immediately behind the altar, and which, even in broad
                  daylight, had nothing to distinguish it from the rest. When they reached this
                  spot, they could see the soldiers leaping and stumbling over the broken statues
                  and pillars, in their eagerness to arrest the fugitives, and hear their bows
                  clanging, and their shafts striding against the stones beside them, whilst they
                  themselves were unseen in the darkness. They lost but little time, however, in
                  making observations, for the slab opened, and Sir Geoffrey, preceded by the
                  priest, and followed instantly by the man in the cloak, passed through the
                  aperture. When the slab again closed behind the little party, the guide opened a
                  dark lantern, and bidding them follow, descended a long flight of steps, till he
                  came to a broad, flagged pavement, and there pushing back a heavy oaken door,
                  ushered them into a large and dimly-lighted apartment. As soon as he had done so,
                  he disencumbered himself of his cloak, and set about preparing some refreshment
                  for the travellers.
               Whilst the monk—for so he was—busied himself at his scanty and ill-furnished
                  larder, and Father Peter threw off his disguise and resumed his clerical habit,
                  the knight had leisure to examine the apartment. It was of large dimensions, but
                  the ceiling was very low, and flagged, probably the floor of the church above,
                  and, as far as Sir Geoffrey could judge, immediately under the sanctuary. The
                  wall, oposite where he sat, was covered with rough shelves, filled with books of
                  all sizes and bindings, and in the farther end of the room what seemed to be tombs
                  of various kinds and styles of architecture, according to the date of their
                  erection. But there was one of which the knight took particular notice; it was a
                  plain, black flag, some six feet square, and supported by four pedestals, somewhat
                  higher than the rest, and occupying a prominent place in the group. It was covered
                  with a white cloth, bearing the initials I. H. S., and a simple Roman cross cut in
                  front. On this tombstone was also placed a small tabernacle; and above it a
                  tapestried canopy of cloth of gold, whose folds encircled it round about, and fell
                  in rich piles on the floor. Sir Geoffrey perceived, at once, it was used for an
                  altar, and thinking it the most suitable ble place he could select to deposit his treasure, carefully drew out his rolls
                  of pictures from the capacious pockets of his doublet, and reverently laid them
                  thereon. As he approached the altar and glanced around, the truth flashed upon him
                  in an instant, that he was amid the graves of the abbots and monks of Allanbury,
                  and despite all his natural firmness, he could not help shuddering at the
                  thought.
               When Sir Geoffrey selected Allanbury Abbey for his retreat, he never imagined it
                  contained such a hiding-place as this. He supposed Father Peter's cell, of which
                  he heard so much, was nothing more than a few boards, or flags, huddled together,
                  and covered roughly over to protect him from the storm. And he intended to seek it
                  among the ruins, and take up his abode there, with a pitcher of water and a loaf
                  of bread for his temporary sustenance. Whether the priest, during his frequent
                  visits to Brockton, purposely withheld a full description of the place for prudent
                  reasons, or did not think it a matter of interest to the knight, certain it is
                  that Sir Geoffrey had entirely mistaken its character.
               "Father Peter," said he, laying his hand on the priest's shoulder, "tell me, is
                  this the place thou hast frequented so much these two years gone?"
               "The same."
               "The graves of the dead?"
               "Even so, Sir Geoffrey."
               "And that's the altar on which thou offerest the holy sacrifice?"
               The priest assented.
               "It's the tomb of William Santon, second Abbot of Allanbury, and the tabernacle
                  and canopy are among the few things we have saved from the wreck. This is the cell
                  where I have spent many a long night; and there," pointing to the books, "are the
                  companions of my solitude. I say the mass every morning I am here, with none to
                  assist but that old man, brother Felix. He never leaves the place; indeed, he has
                  not been one day absent from the abbey since his reception as a lay brother,
                  thirty-five years ago. The faithful of the district come to seek me here when my
                  services are required at the baptismal font, or the sick bed; and he manages to
                  see them and receive their instructions without admitting them to the secret of my
                  hiding-place. It was in the discharge of that duty you saw him to-night, waiting
                  under the shadow of the old walls. The few Catholics in the vicinity supply him
                  with abundant food for our support, and he lives here contented and happy. His
                  chief employment, in my absence, is copying the old manuscripts of the order,
                  which have been much effaced and stained by the burning of the abbey, and picking
                  off the moss and weeds from the altar and the sanctuary. Dost see that round stone
                  in the ceiling? It turns on a pivot, and admits both air and light; and yet, from
                  its peculiar position in the pavement of the church above is not easily detected.
                  There is the flue through which the smoke passes from the fireplace. It runs along
                  the ceiling to the very extremity of the chapel wall, and escapes through a broken
                  chimney, more than a hundred feet from where we stand. Nor does the smoke, during
                  the day or night, excite the least suspicion. This will somewhat surprise thee, but it is not the less
                  true. Brother Felix, who, from his long residence at the abbey, knew all the
                  secret places, retired here after the demolition of the building, and while the
                  roof and walls were still burning, lit his fire in that very hearth. It has never
                  since been extinguished. Night and day the smoke ascends from the same old
                  chimney, and years have passed since our enemies abandoned all hopes of
                  discovering the cause of the extraordinary phenomenon. The general belief is,
                  among the Protestant peasantry of the neighborhood, and many of the better classes
                  also, that the devil has lit a fire under that chimney, to burn the bones of the
                  monks of Allanbury, and never to be extinguished till the day of judgment."
               "But that's impossible!" exclaimed Sir Geoffrey; "absolutely impossible, I can
                  prove beyond question, morally and physically. Sive
                     questio sit de spiritu ab inferno, sive——"
               "True," replied the priest, interrupting the knight, "thou canst easily prove its
                  impracticability, if proof were necessary; but I have merely stated the nature of
                  the superstition."
               "They cannot defend the theory at all," urged Sir Geoffrey.
               "By no means," replied the priest.
               "And moreover," pursued the knight, "it's not at all clear to me, that the devil
                  has the power to enter these walls under any pretence whatever. As for burning the
                  bones of the sainted dead,—ha, ha!— the wretch, he dare not lay a finger on
                  them."
               Brother Felix now made a sign to the priest that supper per was prepared, and the
                  latter, beckoning the knight to follow, led the way through a narrow door into a
                  very small apartment, in which hung a lamp before a little altar decorated with
                  the richest and most costly ornaments. The tabernacle was covered with a thin
                  veil, but through it shone filigree work of the purest gold and most elaborate
                  workmanship; and round its little door were wreaths of diamonds and precious
                  stones, apparently of great value. Sir Geoffrey saw, the moment he entered the
                  little room, he was in an oratory, and before the blessed sacrament. This was
                  evident from the lighted lamp, as well as from the superior quality of the
                  ornaments on the altar. Both knelt, in profound silence, for a few minutes, before
                  the altar, and communed with their Savior, as was their daily custom before meals;
                  then rising and reverently quitting the oratory, they sat down to their simple
                  repast.
               During the discussion of their little pasty, and a bottle of sack, which the
                  knight might have recognized as once an occupant of his own cellar at Brockton,
                  various questions were asked and answered on both sides. The priest informed Sir
                  Geoffrey, among the rest, that Queen Elizabeth had resolved, at every risk, to
                  extirpate Catholicity from her realms, and had spies set on the hapless Queen of
                  Scots, ready to report to her the slightest change in her rival's conduct or
                  policy. He had been at Hampton, where Elizabeth kept her court for the present,
                  and learned much of the intrigues she practised, and the diplomatic relations she
                  intended to establish between England and the Netherlands. Her chief object now was to gain time for the concentration
                  of her own resources at home, and the establishment of a powerful alliance with
                  the Protestant princes abroad; but when these were once attained,—when she felt
                  herself strong enough to defy opposition from her own subjects, and interference
                  on the part of France and Spain,—she would endeavor all her might to blast the
                  hopes of a succession through the Stuarts, and destroy the Papal power in England
                  forever, by fair means or by foul. "She is not," continued the priest, "a lover
                  either of Lutheranism or Calvinism; nay, so far as I can judge, she despises both
                  thoroughly; but she hates the Catholic church because he who declared her
                  illegitimate is her spiritual head, and she knows the surest way to annoy him is
                  by encouraging the enemies of the church, and aiding them in the war they are
                  waging against him. For my own part," said the priest, "I cannot hope to escape
                  much longer, and I fear the queen's pursuivants, who, being Londoners, are much
                  less superstitious than the neighboring peasants, will track me here, and not
                  relinquish the search till they have found me, or, what will amount to the same,
                  till they have discovered my hiding-place, and all it contains. Two weeks ago,
                  they hunted me from a small house in Fenchurch Street, in the city, and pursued me
                  below Hampton Court, to a place called Whinstone Hollow. And tonight, whilst in
                  the act of baptizing a child, I was surprised by the entrance of a trooper in the
                  queen's livery, and had hardly time to escape through the window in the rear of
                  the house. If I am taken, I can hope for no mercy at the queen's hands, for I have
                  used all my influence in public and private, as often as I happened to be safe
                  from immediate arrest, to thwart her projects and expose her intrigues in Scotland
                  and at the Hague. I have also preached to the poor persecuted Catholics wherever I
                  found them, were it even under the walls of the court, and have imparted the last
                  rites of the church to the dying even in her very palace. All this she knoweth
                  well, and will not forget it when the order for my execution cometh before her.
                  But the will of God be done. I shall endeavor, whilst life remains, to be found
                  wherever my official duties as a minister of God may call me, and shall leave the
                  rest to an ever just and merciful Providence, without whose permission not a hair
                  of our head can fall. To-morrow I leave for the city, again to meet some of my
                  brethren in the ministry, and devise plans for the better evading the new law, and
                  for making enlarged provisions for the wants of the city mission. For thee, Sir
                  Geoffrey, it is difficult to determine what course thou oughtest to pursue. Being
                  but a titled commoner, thou art exposed to the second tender; and well I know Sir
                  Thomas Plimpton will not fail to make it, if once he find thee in his power. His
                  escort hath, no doubt, already reached Brockton Hall, and searched every nook and
                  corner in the building for the old recusant."
               "Not every nook and corner," interrupted the knight, rubbing his
                  hands in glee at the thought of his enemies' discomfiture; "Alice is safe there
                  yet."
               "I hope so," replied the priest; "God help her, if she fall into his hands!"
               
               "Hope so!" repeated Sir Geoffrey. "Why, man, she is in the deacon's cell, under
                  the tower, and will remain there till I return. So, at least, I have directed her,
                  and she is as dutiful a child as ever old man was blessed with. She never
                  disobeyed me yet—never."
               "Heaven guard her!" said the priest, fervently clasping his hands. "She is dearer
                  to me than all earthly ties beside. She is amongst my brightest hopes, for I will
                  offer her to God on the day of judgment as a compensation for all the sins of my
                  life. She is thy daughter, Sir Geoffrey, in the flesh, but she is mine in the
                  faith. She is the jewel which thou gavest the church, but which
                     I polished, to bring out its native lustre. God save her from
                  those who would be hard-hearted enough to work her ill!"
               "Amen!" echoed the knight. "But I cannot agree to that last observation, Father
                  Peter, respecting the polishing. Nay, I insist thou hast not taught Alice
                  Wentworth all her acquirements. Thou hast doubtless instructed the maiden right
                  faithfully in what appertaineth to thy calling—her religious duties and pious
                  exercises of divers sorts and kinds; but thou'lt please remember she is beholden
                  to me for her knowledge of birds, beasts, insects, flowers, metaphysics, and
                  theology, not to speak of the ancient languages, whereof she is not entirely
                  ignorant. Nay, reverend father, thou goest somewhat too far. Humph! I say,
                     Sutor crepido. Ha, ha! every man to his
                  trade. If thou hadst a hand in polishing the gem, so had I also. Let every one
                  have his due. I denied thee not the merit of teaching Alice her morals als, for I
                  must confess I was never well versed in that department; but I tell thee I was
                  sound on the dogma—eh?—I was sound on the faith." And the old man rubbed his hands
                  and chuckled heartily.
               The priest assented, smiling good naturedly at the cause of his jealousy, and
                  observing it was then late and full time to retire to rest.
               Sir Geoffrey, however, expressed the uneasiness he felt respecting his books, and
                  wondered if he might not venture up to seek them amongst the ruins, but the priest
                  convinced him of the imprudence of such a step, whilst the queen's constables were
                  lying hid, perhaps, in the chapel; so with an explicit understanding that Reddy
                  and the box would be the first objects of his search on the morrow, the knight
                  sought his pastor's blessing, and retired to his pallet.
               The corner of the spacious apartment in which the knight of Brockton lay was
                  directly opposite the open door of the little oratory in which the blessed
                  sacrament was kept, so that when the torches in the larger room were extinguished,
                  he could plainly see every object on and about the altar by the light of the lamp
                  that hung before it. The old man's pallet consisted simply of a bundle of straw
                  spread on some boards laid on the floor, and covered with a blanket, over which
                  brother Felix had considerately thrown the large black cloak he had worn whilst
                  keeping watch in the chapel. There was no part of Sir Geoffrey's form to be seen,
                  as he lay there on his side, looking at the altar of the oratory, and wrapped in
                  the cloak, but his face from the chin to the forehead; the rest of the head being covered with a red handkerchief, in
                  lieu of a nightcap, knotted firmly in front. After earnestly recommending Alice,
                  his books, and all else he held dear at Brockton Hall, to the care of divine
                  Providence, he tried long to induce sleep to visit him, but his heart was ill at
                  ease, and sleep refused to come. So, as a last resource, he gave wings to thought;
                  and he thought of Alice, concealed under the western tower, and wondered if she
                  felt very anxious about him, and whether she might not catch cold from the
                  dampness of the place; and then turned to his library and philosophical
                  instruments, his ponies and falcons. Every object of his attachment came before
                  his eyes so plainly, that he fancied he could speak to them; and he did speak to
                  them, and it did him good; but he spoke in low and earnest whispers, as if he
                  feared to be overheard. "Alice, Alice, thou rogue, I see thee, though thou dost
                  not think so; I see thee sitting, with thy companion, beside the pile of old
                  armor, and fearfully listening to the noises in the court and the sounds above thy
                  head in the guard room. But don't fear, Alice— don't, dear—for I am near thee.
                  Don't weep, child, don't weep. Ah, it's for me, is it? O, well, don't, dear—don't
                  weep for me. Thou thoughtest I would never desert thee. But thou
                  knowest, dear, I dare not leave my kind and venerable companions exposed to
                  danger—O, no; that would be base ingratitude. Keep quiet, and don't leave the
                  place till Reddy Connor goes to release thee. Reddy Connor, Reddy Connor, thou
                  villain, where art thou? Ah, thou art there—ha, ha!—behind the pillars, and the
                  precious box, covered with rubbish, beside thee. Excellent well, Reddy; so thou'st
                  escaped, and left the horse and vehicle behind? O, never mind the horse and
                  vehicle —that's nothing. Pah! what are five hundred horses? Bones and sinews—mere
                  carrion, Reddy, mere carrion, compared with the only complete copy of the four
                  great fathers—volumes, man, which contain the food of angels. O, thou'rt there,
                  too, Plimpton! Thou tall, thin, yellow, canting knave, thou wouldst, forsooth,
                  have me believe thee in love with Alice? Ha, ha, kestral! thou'st lost the
                  qluarry; the bird hath jinked. thee. Ha, ha! gramercy for thy pains."
               Here Sir Geoffrey's apostrophies to the images his own fancy had created were
                  suddenly interrupted by something passing between him and the light; and looking
                  up, he beheld, to his utter astonishment, a human figure descending through the
                  ceiling, and alighting on the floor not twenty feet from where he lay. Instantly
                  Sir Geoffrey remembered the priest having pointed out the revolving flag, and
                  concluded, whoever he was, he must have known the secret of the aperture, and
                  found ingress through it. Nor was his surprise the less when he had surveyed the
                  person of this new comer. His height, so far as Sir Geoffrey could judge from the
                  position he occupied, did not exceed three feet, but his body was thick-set,
                  square, and muscular, and his head, which appeared disproportionately large,
                  seemed buried between his shoulders. As soon as this person had alighted on the
                  floor, he advanced to the oratory with an ambling gait, like that we observe in
                  most people of diminutive size and misshapen form. His gabardine descended scended to the calves of his legs, and
                  his unshod feet were broad, flat, and covered with mud. As he proceeded to the
                  oratory, he took off a large fur cap, and made a profound genuflection at the
                  door. The priest, who had been kneeling before the altar since he parted with the
                  knight, either noticed not the slight noise the dwarf made in his descent through
                  the ceiling, or if he did, would not be interrupted in his devotion. The dwarf,
                  apparently unwilling to disturb him, leaned his shoulder against the door, in
                  order leisurely to await his notice, and in that position, the light of the little
                  altar lamp falling full upon him, Sir Geoffrey could see distinctly every feature
                  of his face. It was a countenance which the knight had certainly seen before, but
                  where, he could not remember.
               He fancied he saw it in or about Brockton. It occurred to him that he detected it
                  peering through a window somewhere in the dusk of the evening, or he met it in
                  some corridor of the hall when the lamps went out and the moon shone in. That
                  broad face so full of marks and wrinkles, that gash on the brow, that nose so
                  curved and pointed, those eyes so small and piercing, and that great head so red
                  and bristly,— it surely was not the first time he saw them. The figure was
                  familiar to him, yet he knew not whether he had seen it in a month or in twenty
                  years; there was, in fact, a dreamy definiteness in his recollection of that
                  ungainly form which he knew not how to account for.
               The dwarf—for so he may well be called— patiently waited till the priest had
                  concluded his adoration of the blessed sacrament, and then kissing his hand,
                  placed in it a packet which he took from the breast of his gabardine. Father
                  Peter's countenance expressed no surprise when, on turning from the altar, he saw
                  the dwarf standing in the doorway; but when he had read the letter, he dropped his
                  hands by his side and bent his head on his breast. The packet consisted only of
                  the following words:—
               
                  
                     
                        
                           "A. is captured by P. himself, who takes her to London, and leaves
                              Sergeant Houghton with a small party to arrest Sir G., and take
                              possession of Brockton. Let brother F. search for the old man, and
                              detain him at the Abbey, whilst thou hasten to London. Reddy will
                              follow Plimpton, and meet me in the city. Haste thee, father, haste
                              thee, for thy child is in the fangs of the evil one.
                           
                              N. G."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               When the priest read the letter, he seemed to Sir Geoffrey to be greatly affected
                  by the information it contained, but of which the latter had not the slightest
                  suspicion. He still kept his eyes fixed on the ground, as if he were trying to
                  collect his thoughts after the shock so sudden an announcement had given him. At
                  length he looked up in the dwarf's face, and seeing there a plain confirmation of
                  the melancholy intelligence, sank down on a low stool by the wall, and buried his
                  face in his hands.
               "That's a sorry sight," whispered Sir Geoffrey to himself, still peering out from
                  between the cloak and the red handkerchief. "Indeed, it's very painful to look
                  at—the hunted priest sitting there weeping over the misfortunes of his people at the feet of
                  his Savior. News of murders and assassinations, I trow, and all for God's sake. O,
                  poor Father Peter, God console thee—God console thee—for thou hast a heavy heart!
                  It's a very melancholy scene, altogether," he continued, looking round the room;
                  "this damp and desolate vault, with its rain-drops falling in the corners from the
                  green, mildewed walls, and dripping like the beat of a clock, so regular and so
                  lonely. I could not feel the loss of little Alice more than he feels this news—no,
                  indeed. I wish I saw that packet. What business had that misshapen villain to come
                  hither at all? God be praised, Alice is not here, instead of her old father! The
                  sight of those graves looming up there, half defined in the uncertain light and
                  half blended with the darkness, would frighten her to death. O, I wish I could
                  sleep, and shut out these objects from my sight. Sancta,
                     Maria, mater Dei, ora pro nobis."
               Father Peter at length slowly raised his head, and refolding the letter, signed to
                  the dwarf to await his return. He then lighted a lamp, and traversing a narrow
                  passage leading to that part of the vault where the dead were buried, disappeared
                  behind the tombs.
               When the priest returned, Sir Geoffrey's eyes had almost closed in sleep. The
                  lassitude that succeeds fatigue and unusual excitement came over his senses, and
                  gradually weighed down his eyelids. He was in that state of somnolency when one is
                  conscious of the presence of an object, but cannot exert sufficient power of voice
                  or vision to look or speak. Yet the knight knew the priest was there, and had
                  exchanged his clerical habit for an ordinary doublet and hose, and that the dwarf
                  had strapped upon his shoulders something in the shape of a box, and was preceding
                  the priest in the direction of the doorway through which they had first entered
                  the vault. He essayed once or twice to ask the priest whither he was bent, and
                  when he would return; but though the lips moved, there came no sound; and hardly
                  had the indistinct forms of the missionary and his strange companion disappeared
                  in the gloom of the passage, when the knight of Brockton was in the land of
                  dreams.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               NELL GOWER and her fair charge, having bid adieu to Brockton for a time, hastened
                  with all possible speed to a cross road near the small village of Upton, and there
                  turned from the great London thorough-fare, hoping thereby to escape Sir Thomas
                  Plimpton, now in full march upon the Hall. The road they took, on quitting the
                  main one, was narrow and seemingly unfrequented, for the walls and dikes on either
                  side were broken down, and decayed branches of trees lay here and there, as if
                  there were none left to take an interest in their removal. Obliged to be cautious
                  in avoiding these impediments, and now out of the direct line of her enemies'
                  march, Alice and her faithful companion travelled more slowly along the lonely and
                  deserted by-way.
               The young girl, though silent and abstracted during the greater part of the
                  journey, was yet more composed and collected than Nell Gower had expected to find
                  her. The latter had anticipated a reaction in the feelings of her protégé, as soon
                  as she had fairly realized her situation and reflected on the dangers she had to
                  encounter in the prosecution of her design. But she was mistaken; Alice's
                  resolution to carry out her project seemed to grow stronger the farther she
                  proceeded on her journey. In this Nell was considerably disappointed; for she
                  hoped to induce her to fly to Scotland, and seek an asylum in the arms of Mary
                  Stuart, as soon as she could bring Sir Geoffrey to Whinstone Hollow, and there
                  make arrangements for his flight to France. Two or three times Nell ventured to
                  remonstrate against the folly—nay, the recklessness, of such a step as that of
                  casting herself a supplicant at the feet of Elizabeth, the inveterate enemy of her
                  church and her house. But Alice was inflexible, and Nell dropped the subject for
                  the present, trusting to time and reflection for that change which her counsel
                  could not effect.
               Nor was Alice herself insensible to the difficulties she had to encounter. She
                  felt she had now set out on her first entry into the great world, where she was
                  unknown and uncared for. She knew not a single human being in whom she might
                  confide, but the weak old woman who rode beside her. She was on her way to
                  London—to the great city —there to be exposed to dangers and temptations of every
                  kind—to the libertinism of the dissolute, and the sneer of the impious; the one to
                  lay snares for her innocence, and the other for her faith. She was conscious of
                  her inexperience of the world and its ways. She felt like a bird escaped from the
                  cage in which it had been confined since its first hour of life, scarce knowing
                  how to use its wings or whither to fly. Then she had undertaken a hazardous task,
                  in the fulfilment of which she might involve herself in the intrigues of the
                  court, nay, provoke, perhaps, the hostility of the queen. These sad anticipations
                  had a dispiriting influence on her heart from time to time, as she permitted
                  herself to indulge them. Still she
                  thought of her father, the good, simple old man, driven from his home or pining in
                  a dungeon, and then she would raise her soul to God, and ask his blessing and
                  assistance in her dutiful undertaking. Amid all the dangers that seemed to
                  threaten her, she never for a moment faltered in her trust and confidence in her
                  heavenly Father, who never suffers any of his children to be tempted beyond their
                  strength, and whose providence is ever watchful to guide and guard them.
               Alice Wentworth was brought up a strict Catholic, and had well learned the value
                  of those weapons which the Church puts into the hands of her children to defend
                  them against temptation. Father Peter, once the resident chaplain of the family,
                  and still a welcome visitor of the Hall, as often as he could steal in under the
                  cloak of night, had stored her mind with the lights of faith and the principles of
                  genuine piety. Under his careful direction, she studied the saints of old, and
                  found in their lives the best illustrations of the virtues that distinguish the
                  true Christian character, and accustomed herself to regard their examples as her
                  surest guides through the perils of life. Like them, she shrunk from intercourse
                  with the world, and chose rather to fly danger than brave it. Yet, like them also,
                  when duty called her forth, she went full of hope and confidence.
               With respect to her faith, she was not one of those who simply believe and
                  practise religion, content with the divine assurance that it is ordained of
                  Heaven, and give themselves no trouble to discover the hidden beauties it
                  contains. No, she studied it thoroughly under her pious and affectionate pastor,
                  and made herself acquainted with the genius and spirit that dictated and pervaded
                  all its parts. She learnt to discover in every minute ceremonial, as well as in
                  the most important precepts, the evidence of an infinite wisdom. To her eyes its
                  routine of duties and multiplicity of details were the best consultations for the
                  wants of man. She saw in the church the exercise of those qualities of divine
                  wisdom and goodness which so remarkably distinguished her divine Founder. She saw
                  her making herself all to all that she might gain all to God. She saw her studying
                  human nature in all its lesser qualities as well as in its prominent
                  characteristics, and making, for every need and every want, an appropriate and
                  salutary provision. While she saw her propose the precept to her children, she
                  also saw her hold out allurements to entice them to its fulfilment. She saw the
                  church stoop to the most simple inventions in order to attract, and the most
                  loving blandishments in order to conciliate and to please. Pictures, music,
                  images, ceremonies, vestments, lights, ornaments were but so many means she
                  adopted to address the soul through the channels of the senses; she spread them,
                  like so many nets, to capture the hearts of men. All this she understood to be the
                  result of a holy policy. The crucifix was to her, not an object of adoration, but
                  a pious emblem by which the church intended to captivate her senses, and thus win
                  her love. It was a book always open before her, in which she might see, at one
                  glance, the wickedness of man and the goodness of God; and she wore it on her
                     breast, and loved it for the
                  thoughts it inspired. The statue of the Virgin Mother, in the church or in her
                  chamber, was not an idol to worship, but an object to suggest pure thoughts and
                  holy aspirations; and she kept it on the mantel, that the original might be ever
                  present to her mind. In the Eucharist she saw a proof of the unspeakable love of
                  God for his creatures, who, in his infinite wisdom, knew of nothing else by which
                  he could adequately express its abiding intensity. And often did she think, when
                  meditating before the tabernacle, what a cold and dreary void the absence of such
                  a warming and life-giving sacrament would leave in the human heart; nay, she
                  sometimes fancied to herself, were it nothing more than a pious fraud of the
                  church, that God might pardon it for the sake of the insatiable love that prompted
                  it, and the piety and goodness it engendered in the soul. Then, again, the
                  confessional was to her, not a divine ordinance merely, which, as a Catholic, she
                  was bound to obey, but a holy place into which she entered to whisper to the
                  Divine Spirit an acknowledgment of her faults, a petition for forgiveness, and a
                  promise of renewed allegiance. It was to her, not so much a duty of obedience as
                  of love. She went there to open her heart to her confessor in the double capacity
                  of minister of God and friend of the sinner, and she felt, in leaving it, that,
                  were it nothing more than a human institution, it deserved the blessing and the
                  protection of Heaven for the consolations it afforded the sorrowful and stricken
                  hearts that went there to seek its soothing influence.
               Such were the estimates Alice Wentworth formed of the various elements of
                  Catholicity. She saw wisdom in all its institutions and beauty in all its details.
                  She saw it speaking to man's soul through every avenue, through his sight, his
                  hearing, his affections, his intellect, his imagination, in a word, addressing him
                  in all the wonderful complexity of his nature, and she felt that a religion which
                  could thus reach every constituent of humanity, and supply it with an appropriate
                  help,—which, whilst it exercised so powerful an influence over millions, had yet a
                  special and distinct influence over each,—must have come from Heaven, were even
                  revelation itself but a dream.
               But, besides all this, Alice saw a poetry in the Catholic religion, if we may so
                  call it, which endeared it still more to her heart. Its music, its songs, its
                  doctrine of communion of saints and of guardian angels, gave an inexpressible
                  harmony to the whole machinery of its operations, and awoke in her breast an
                  enthusiastic admiration of its power and grandeur. Hence it was she could never be
                  brought to understand how it happened that men impugned the doctrine of
                  Catholicity. And if she were told—as she often was by Father Peter—that apostasy
                  from the faith was always the result of licentiousness, and never of a holy
                  conviction, she would still wonder how men could be so foolish as to barter so
                  dear a legacy for so poor a recompense.
               It was under the inspiriting influence of such thoughts as these that Alice
                  determined to brave every danger in order to save her father. She trusted in God,
                  and she went on her way hoping for the best.
               
               They had now travelled through the woods which lined the road, on either side, for
                  three or four miles, the bright moon shining clear and cold through the openings
                  in the trees, when the sudden bark of the dog, who had trotted on, snuffing among
                  the brambles and brushwood, some hundred yards in advance, followed by the noise
                  of horses' feet, roused their attention. Alice drew her rein, and thought of
                  leaping the fence, and secreting herself amongst the trees till the traveller
                  passed by; but Nell assured her there was no need, as the noise was that of a
                  single horse, and therefore not likely to be of Plimpton's escort. As the horseman
                  approached the little party, the dog preceded him, barking all the while; and when
                  he came within a few yards of Alice and her companion, Peto so annoyed him by
                  leaping at his horse, that the stranger drew his sword and made a lounge, more to
                  scare, perhaps, than punish him for his incivility. Unfortunately, however, his
                  sword, owing to the sudden curvetting of his mettlesome steed, instead of taking
                  effect upon the noisy animal, struck Pepin on the neck, scratching him severely
                  and cutting the bridle rein. The gentle creature, unaccustomed to such rough
                  treatment, ran off affrighted, and disappeared in the deep shadow of the trees.
                  Hardly had the stranger dealt the blow, when he saw the awkward blunder he had
                  made, and leaped from his horse to repair the damage as best he might; but Alice
                  was gone. Throwing off his short cloak, and flinging his sword and belt on the
                  wayside, he ran in pursuit of the startled pony, followed by Nell Gower and
                  Whitret Macbairn. They had not gone half a mile, when they came in sight of an
                  old, dilapidated house, and saw Pepin standing before it, neighing loudly for help
                  for his mistress, now stretched on the grass at his feet, and Peto, a minute
                  before so loud in his repulse of the stranger, whining piteously and wagging his
                  tail for assistance.
               "Awa' wi' ye, man!" were the first words Nell uttered, as she descended from her
                  horse, and knelt down beside the insensible Alice; "awa', and fetch water frae the
                  burn. Yer glowerin' there canna cure her, I ween."
               The stranger obeyed, and Alice soon recovered on the application of the water to
                  her forehead, already as cold and white as marble.
               "Look up, lassie; dinna ye ken me?" whispered Nell.
               Alice found, in a few moments after her consciousness returned, that she was more
                  stunned than hurt, and blushing to appear thus in the presence of a stranger, rose
                  up, leaning on the arm of Nell Gower, and thanked the gentleman for his courtesy,
                  timidly raising her eyes to his face.
               The stranger, with the ease and grace of a courtier, expressed his deep regret
                  that such an unluckly accident should have happened through his awkwardness, and
                  having, by the most earnest inquiries, satisfied himself of the lady's safety,
                  begged the privilege of accompanying her on her journey, for a time at least, till
                  she recovered her spirits, after the shock she had received; but Alice modestly
                  declined the honor of his escort, assuring him she was now quite composed and able
                  to proceed.
               
               Whether it was the stranger's countenance or voice that struck Nell, now that she
                  had leisure to look and listen, we cannot say; but she peered up suddenly in his
                  face, exclaiming, as she crossed her arms behind her, "Weel, the deil's in my ears
                  if I didna hear that voice afore; eh, mun, yer na came frae Embro', are ye?"
               "I'm journeying from that direction," replied the stranger, unwilling to hazard a
                  more direct answer to so abrupt a question, "and by advice of my honest host of
                  the White Hart there beyond, had taken this short cut to Brockton Hall."
               "To Brockton Hall," repeated Nell—"humph!"
               "Is that not the name of Sir Geoffrey Wentworth's residence in these parts?"
               "Ay is it," responded Nell; "is yer business wi' the knight himsel?"
               "With Sir Geoffrey himself," responded the stranger. "I am the bearer of a packet
                  of some importance, and would fain deliver it with as little delay as possible,
                  since I am denied the pleasure of further company with thee and thy fair
                  companion."
               "I didna expect so plain an answer," observed Nell, "in sic kittlesome times; if
                  ye mak ilka traveller ye meet on the road acquaint wi' yer business, in that
                  fashion, ye'll prove but a vera untrusty messenger, gude man." And she drew, as
                  she spoke, a packer's needle from her wallet, and began sewing the broken ends of
                  the bridle rein together.
               "Thou hast forgotten, methinks," said the stranger, smiling, and pointing to the
                  crest on the saddle, "that every traveller cannot boast of such a coat of arms as
                  that. But how comes it thou takest such an interest terest in my trust, good
                  woman? Thou seemest to know me."
               "Know ye," repeated Nell: "humph! guid be aboot us, yer no so muckle changed, I
                  trow! Weel, I hae na leisure nou to claver wi' ye; but this young lady, whase life
                  ye hae jist pit in jeopardy wi' yer loupin' an' rantin', is Mistress Alice, Sir
                  Geoffrey Wentworth's ain daughter, at yer guid service, and I'll wager a bawbee to
                  a pund Scots, gin ye gie her the packet, she'll tell ye it cam frae Holyrood, an'
                  written by ane whase troubles are somewhat akin to her ain."
               The stranger again uncovered, and respectfully saluting Alice as the daughter of
                  Sir Geoffrey Wentworth, expressed his concern that any thing should trouble one so
                  young and so dear to his mistress.
               Nell, who knew more of the stranger than she cared at first to confess, now
                  ventured to acquaint him with the cause of their setting out so early, and of Sir
                  Geoffrey's intention of absenting himself from home for a few days.
               "Then," said he, "since thou hast confided in me so far, and are thus unprotected,
                  I'll be bold enough to claim the privilege of accompanying ye both to a place of
                  safety."
               Alice, who had retreated a step or two, and was leaning against a tree, with her
                  head bent, looking at a little pebble, which she moved to and fro with the toe of
                  her shoe, raised her eyes timidly to the face of the person who expressed such an
                  interest in her behalf.
               He was a tall, athetic, handsome young man, about twenty-five years of age, of
                  distinguished mien, and dressed
                  somewhat in the style of a Scotch courtier of that day. He wore a cap of tartan
                  plaid, with a short black feather rising from the band, where it was fixed by a
                  diamond of some value. His doublet was of green velvet, edged with silver, and his
                  close-fitting jerkin richly ornamented with gold lace. His hose were covered to
                  mid-thigh by heavy riding-boots, which buckled by a strap to a narrow buff belt,
                  in which he carried a dagger. His long brown hair fell over the collar of his
                  doublet, and waved to and fro under the light breeze of the morning, as he stood
                  uncovered before Alice Wentworth.
               Alice again declined the proffered services of the stranger, thanking him for his
                  courtesy, and moving towards the pony, bade him adieu, and a pleasant journey.
               "Now, my certie, old friend," he said, addressing Nell, "this maiden of thine
                  seemeth more disposed to decline my services than I can well account for."
               "Hegh, man! an if she kenned ye as I ken ye," replied Nell, chuckling behind her
                  hood, as she drew it round her thin face, "she wadna think hersel' far
                  astray."
               "And what knowest thou of me, grandmother?" he demanded.
               "Mair than ye wot o', Rodger O'Brien."
               "Ha! so thou'st seen me before—humph! I little thought, when I left Scotland, I
                  should be recognized by the first old woman I met in the woods of Worcester."
               "An I leetle thought, master madcap, ye'd hae changed sae muckle for the waur in
                  twa three years."
               "How so, good mother?"
               "Why, yer no sae faithfu and loyal to yer bonnie queen as when you sliced the lugs
                  o' Bailie McPherson, twa years ago, for stappin the royal guard at the castle
                  gate, or ye wadna forget her for the first blink o' a countrie lassie."
               "Thou'rt mistaken, dame; I but asked——"
               "Out! gae wa' wi' ye, mun! I ken ye weel, frae the spurs to the tappin'. Whin ye
                  were carried to Father Leslie's, wi' a braken airm an a hole in yer side ye might
                  stap a parritch stick in, that ye got frae ane o' black Murray's men, an didna
                  wink yer een, nor ken yer priest, nor ope yer mou, for twa lang weeks an mair; na,
                  na, I was na a stranger ti ye then, lad."
               "So thou'rt the Nell Gower I heard so much of. By my faith, Nell, I'm right glad
                  to see thee;" and Rodger stretched out his hand.
               "Ay, ay, ye'll ne'er be at a loss for the sweet word, I'll bargain on't. Many a
                  crown ye cracked wi' yer cudgel in the castle close, and plastered it ower again
                  wi' that same Irish balsam, twa minits after."
               "Why, gadzooks, Nell——"
               "Heth, it's na wonder," she continued, disregarding his interruption, "it's na
                  wonder ye amaist kilt the bairn there, for ye wur aye a neerdowell for a' sorts o'
                  diviltry. D'ye no recollect, mun, whin ye first landed at Leith, after the storm,
                  wi' yer skein at yer belt, an yer rabbit skin bonnet on yer head, an ye no in yer
                  teens yet. Dinna ye recollect when the wee chiels on the pier hooted at yer trews,
                  how ye drew yer bit steel an sent them skirlin' awa amang the millstanes?"
               
               "Thou'lt suffer me, at least," said Rodger, as soon as the old woman had paused to
                  take breath—"thou'lt suffer me to thank thee, at least, however inadequately, for
                  thy faithful services. I do not remember thee, Nell, for my senses had left me,
                  and only returned when the death of a near relative called thee away. But well I
                  know, and have oft been told, that to thee I owe my life. Here, Nell Gower, take
                  this purse, and my thanks to boot, and if ever——"
               "Hoot!" said Nell, contemptuously, "tak it awa, tak it awa!" and she pushed back
                  his hand; "what care I for yer gowd and siller. Gin I wanted siller, it's no to ye
                  I'd gang to look for't, whase wealth is a' yet in his hanger; and as for thanks, O
                  lad, I hae the thanks o' ane whase ae wee word is mare to me nor a' the thanks o'
                  the hale world beside; so pit yer siller in yer pouch again, and haste ye back to
                  Embro', where yer mare wanted than daffin' after a lassie wha cares no a bodle for
                  yer company, and tell her ye wot o' that I'm gane to London wi' a daft silly
                  bairn, who'll no be easy till she hae speech o' Elizabeth;" and Nell raised her
                  voice and turned a deprecating look at Alice, who stood behind her patting the
                  pony.
               "But this packet," said O'Brien, (taking it from his breast, as a last resource,
                  and advancing to Alice,) "I must give to thee, fair maiden, since I'm not likely
                  to find Sir Geoffrey, and beg thou wilt at once acquaint thyself with its
                  contents, for if I mistake not, they are of some moment."
               "Nay, nay," replied Alice, "it may contain commands which I dare not disobey, but
                  which for many reasons I am now disposed to evade. Farewell, sir; we are much
                  beholden to thee for thy good wishes."
               "In good sooth, fair lady," responded Rodger, moodily replacing the packet and
                  assisting her to mount, "I like not this business by the half. What excuse I shall
                  make to my mistress for thus deserting thee, I cannot conceive. Must I confess
                  that I found so little favor with her fair friend as to be deemed unworthy to
                  protect her on such a hazardous journey. Verily, she will scold me, right roundly
                  for my ungracious behavior."
               But Alice merely smiled, and bowing to the persevering stranger, shook the reins
                  and cantered off, followed somewhat tardily by Whitret Macbairn and Nell
                  Gower.
               "He's a bra callant, that," began the latter, as she came up with her
                  companion.
               "A very courtly gentleman, methinks," responded Alice. "Doth he belong to the
                  Scotch court?"
               "Ay, that he does, an ane o' the queen's favorites, forby. He's o' the auld stock
                  o' the O'Briens, and fled wi' his father to Scotland, and thence to France, some
                  dozen years ago. He has aye been about the French court since, till he came ower
                  again wi' Mary Stuart. He's a bra' douce callant, but ower ready wi' his weapons
                  for his ain comfort."
               "That seems to be a pretty general failing among his countrymen, is it not?"
               "Failin'," repeated Nell; "weel, as for that, I canna say. It's no jist a
                  failin'——"
               "I mean the Irish are easily provoked to quarrel."
               "Provoked? Ay, ay; weel ye may say that, lassie; they're a' downright deevils, ilk ain o' them. Ye
                  canna look them crooked, or e'en touch their claes as ye pass them by, but they'll
                  draw on ye in a clappin'. I wadna doubt but that same chiel will revenge his
                  disappointment on half a score heads yet afore he sees Holyrood."
               "Nell, thou'rt surely not serious. He was right civil and courteous to us,
                  methinks."
               "Ou, ay, was he! the deil himsel's no civiller to woman folks, like a' the rest o'
                  his race; but gin he see ithers daffin' wi' them, guid faith, they maun look to
                  their windpipes. Why, it's no a month gane, sin he gaed out wi' a bra' party o'
                  lads and lasses boatin' on the Frith o' Forth, and because young McGregor o'
                  Rappinheugh sat down beside his ain sister, wi' whom Rodger was claverin', he
                  griped him by the neck an heels, and afore he could mak him sensible o' his
                  mistake, flung him frae the boat, as he'd fling a herrin'."
               Thus conversing, the little party travelled now somewhat faster, as the road
                  improved. They had not proceeded far, however, when, turning an angle, they came
                  in front of a small hostelrie, where half a dozen horses stood reeking and covered
                  with foam. Lights were in the rooms of the lower story, and men's voices raised in
                  angry colloquy both within and without. As our little party came in front of the
                  tavern, they saw three carabineers, in black helmets and long, coarse boots,
                  holding their flagons under a beer can from which a woman was pouring the liquor,
                  whilst they rated her roundly for not using greater despatch. Nell Gower, who rode
                  between Alice and the soldiers, stretched her arms round Whitret Machairn, and
                  suddenly reined up her horse, motioning Alice to do the same, as soon as her eye
                  caught sight of the helmets. She recognized in an instant the escort of Sir Thomas
                  Plimpton, and suspected he had taken this unfrequented road in order to reach
                  Brockton as secretly as possible. She remained holding the reins for an instant,
                  irresolute whether to advance or retreat. If they turned back, they might be
                  overtaken by the soldiers, who would certainly be in their saddles in a few
                  minutes more; and if they rode forward, it must be through that stream of light
                  which must infallibly expose them to the revellers at the door. At length she
                  concluded to retreat, and get into the woods on the roadside till the danger had
                  passed, rather than run so great a risk of detection, and accordingly gave the
                  reins to Whitret, motioning him and Alice to return. But they were not destined to
                  escape so easily; for Pepin, in wheeling round, unfortunately caught sight of the
                  strange horses, and neighed so loudly as to attract the attention of their
                  masters.
               "Hilloa, there, fair ladies!" cried the tallest of the group, as he caught a
                  glimpse of Nell Gower's blue cloak; "come back, and help us to quaff a can with
                  our friend of the White Hart."
               "Ride on, lassie," said Nell in an under tone, "and hide yersel amang the bushes,
                  while I daff wi' these topers."
               "Beshrew me, if ye pass without a Christian greetin, fair demoiselle!" shouted the
                  same fellow; and throwing down his ale flagon, he sprang forward and caught Nell's horse by the bridle rein.
                  "Hoa, comrades! Gadzooks, come hither! Here's Beelzebub and his mother on
                  horseback. I say, dame Bluebottle, get thee down, and tell our fortunes. What! a
                  fair lady, too, of thy honorable company? Houghton, in the saddle with thee, man,
                  and bring her back! We would fain have her to speech with our noble master, to
                  answer for her early rising. Hie thee, comrade! she runs like a greyhound."
               "An what's a' this for, guid man?" demanded Nell. "To stop the queen's lieges at
                  this gait's agin a' law an reason."
               "Come, come, dame, thou must try a draught of Worcestershire ale this cold
                  morning; it will warm thy heart, and make thee laugh like a jolly midwife at a
                  christening."
               "Out! awa wi' ye, and drink yer bout, Master Goodfellow. I'm no inclined to join
                  ye in yer roisterin', an sic sinfu', warldly ways. Is this a time to be spendin'
                  yer hours in drunken revelry, when mair sacred things ought to employ yer
                  thoughts? D'ye no——"
               "Down with thee!" he repeated, taking her by both arms and depositing her on the
                  ground; "there's neither honesty nor good fellowship in thee, to pass us by
                  without a pot to the queen's health. And as for the pretty maiden who left
                  Brockton so early, doubtless Waglippit here will find a cold capon's wing and a
                  cup o' sack for her, when she returns."
               Nell Gower saw there was no longer a chance of escape. They were betrayed by some
                  one in the village, where she had gone the evening before to meet Whitret Macbairn
                  on his return from London. Some enemy had watched her movements, and reported them
                  to Plimpton. She hoped, however, to be able to deceive the half-stupid revellers
                  by some trick or device, and thus gain time for Alice to reach a place of
                  concealment; but that was now impossible.
               By the time the soldier had led Nell by the arm into the house, Alice was half a
                  mile or more in advance of her pursuers. She spurred Pepin to his utmost speed,
                  regardless of all danger from the rough stones and broken branches that covered
                  the road. But when she came in sight of the old farm house already mentioned, she
                  descried a horseman meeting her at full gallop; and supposing him to be one of
                  Plimpton's men, who had taken another route from the village, she gave up in
                  despair, and slackened her pace. Hardly had she done so, when one of the party
                  from the tavern passed her at a furious rate, and suddenly checking his horse,
                  crossed the road to intercept her passage, and a second, dismounting, laid his
                  hand on Pepin's neck.
               "Why, fair lady, thou must not travel so fast on this dangerous road," said the
                  soldier. "I am much concerned for thy safety, and pray thee come back; there's a
                  right noble gentleman at the hostelrie, would gladly be thy companion on the
                  journey."
               "I know not," replied Alice, "whom thou meanest, or why thou detainest me thus.
                  Surely I did thee no wrong." And as she spoke, she dropped her veil.
               "But dost not think——(O, thou needest not drop thy veil, fair mistress; we are all trusty servants
                  of the queen and Sir Thomas Plimpton;)—dost not think it savors of disloyalty, I
                  say, and rank Papistry, to fly thus the company of her majesty's troops, who, thou
                  must well know, are for the protection of all her faithful and liege
                  subjects."
               "Pray, let me go, good sir," repeated Alice. "If I have done wrong, I will answer
                  for it."
               "Why, thou wrongest me even now. Dost not cheat me of a sight of thy fair face?"
                  And as the ruffian raised his arm to tear off the veil, it was broken in two by a
                  powerful blow from behind, and at the same instant he fell crushed under a horse's
                  feet.
               "Haste thee on, Mistress Alice," said a voice at her ear, "and seek safety in the
                  woods, whilst I cut off the pursuit of these cowardly villains."
               Alice, though trembling and confused, recognized the voice of Rodger O'Brien, and
                  without waiting a moment for reflection, gathered up the reins, and again galloped
                  forward.
               Rodger, thinking he had now but one to contend with, had instantly closed with
                  him, when a third voice, more authoritative and commanding than the rest, shouted,
                  within a few feet of him,—
               "Hoa, there, Lewellyn! Pursue the maiden, and leave this fellow to me."
               These words were delivered in a tone that indicated as much self-possession and
                  confidence in the speaker as if he were only about to chastise a naughty boy for
                  contumacy.
               O'Brien turned, as the soldier left to execute the order, and beheld a tall, wiry,
                  sharp-nosed man, with a dark countenance, apparently twenty-eight or thirty years
                  of age. He wore a black morion, of the latest fashion, without a plume, a
                  dark-colored doublet, and the long riding mailed boots of the period buckled under
                  the kneepan.
               Rodger, the instant he saw this person, was convinced he was in the presence of
                  Sir Thomas Plimpton, and about to engage with him in mortal combat.
               The latter, however, did not give his antagonist much time to make his
                  observations, for before O'Brien could wheel his horse round, so as to meet his
                  adversary full in front, he made a desperate thrust of his long rapier, (just then
                  introduced by Rowland York,) intending doubtless to take his life; but O'Brien
                  foresaw his aim, and sinking the rowels of his spurs in his horse's flank, bounded
                  forward like an arrow, causing the deadly weapon to pass along the back of his
                  coat, and carrying the owner flat upon the neck of his horse.
               Whilst Plimpton was recovering his seat, Rodger had turned, and both met face to
                  face, resting the points of their swords for an instant in their stirrups.
               "Sir Thomas Plimpton, if I mistake not," said O'Brien.
               "And who art thou, Sir Scot," glancing at his Highland bonnet, "who dares thus to
                  obstruct a queen's officer?"
               "Scot or not," replied Rodger, "I'll protect the maiden from thy impious hands,
                  were the queen of England at thy elbow."
               "Now a murrain on thee for a beggarly Scotch churl! I'll whip thee right soundly for thy
                  unmannerly speech;" and again he aimed a desperate blow at the young Irishman, who
                  parried it with an adroitness that made the other pause, and reflect on the
                  necessity of greater caution.
               Had O'Brien fought on equal terms with his antagonist, the quarrel would likely
                  have soon ended; for indignant at the cowardly advantage the other had taken, and
                  impatient to follow Alice, he would have devoted little time to the courtesies of
                  honorable fight. But, unfortunately, his weapon was a short sword, whilst his
                  antagonist's was a rapier, and somewhat longer than the law permitted; so that he
                  found it difficult, under such untoward odds, to do more than defend himself.
               They had now been engaged for four or five minutes, when Plimpton made a pass, and
                  O'Brien, to evade the blow, checked his horse so suddenly as to throw him almost
                  on his haunches. Plimpton, seeing the advantage, determined to avail himself of
                  it, and advanced with deadly intent; but O'Brien, with his Irish blood and French
                  science, was again too quick for him.
               Fearing, however, that more of Plimpton's men might come up and overpower him, if
                  he did not soon bring the quarrel to a close,—for he well knew his antagonist
                  never left London with only two or three followers,—he resolved to hazard his life
                  and the capture of Alice on a single chance.
               "Now then, Saxon churl, have at thee!" he cried, dashing forward, as if he would
                  run himself on his adversary's point, and holding up his right arm, so that his
                  side was entirely exposed; "have at thee, and God defend the right."
               Plimpton rushed on, aiming for O'Brien's undefended breast, and confiding in the
                  length and strength of his weapon, threw all his force into one desperate thrust.
                  The young Irishman saw his assailant's object at a glance, and as the long, deadly
                  blade approached within an inch of his person, he rose in his stirrups, and, quick
                  as lightning, struck his adversary's rapier with the back of his short sword,
                  shivering both blades into fragments. Plimpton, confounded by the suddenness of
                  the act, sat motionless for a second, hardly conscious of what had happened; but
                  Rodger, without a moment's hesitation, spurred on, and ere Plimpton could raise
                  his arm, dealt him such a blow on the head with the hilt of his broken sword, as
                  to hurl him from his horse.
               "Ha! Sir Englishman," he cried, as the silver handle crashed against his cheek,
                  "the Celt's arm is surer than thy Toledo."
               Now, turning his horse, he shook the reins and started after Alice and her
                  pursuer, just as the clatter of feet became audible behind him. On he went,
                  trusting to the strength and speed of the noble animal he rode to outstrip the
                  half-drunken soldiers far enough to assist the fair fugitive. In a few minutes, he
                  found he was rapidly gaining ground; for the noise of the pursuing party was
                  becoming every instant less distinct as he turned to listen, when his horse's feet
                  chanced to fall on the soft turf of the old road. Then he had only one to
                  encounter, and the thought itself was encouragement. But with what? His sword was broken, and he had thrown away the
                  hilt. What could he do? Why, do as he often did before— trust to chance. And on he
                  rode, with as much confidence as if he were charging at the head of a troop.
               When he came up with Alice, he found her, as he had expected, captured by her
                  pursuers. Lewellyn was standing on the road by the side of her horse, holding the
                  reins with one hand, while he kept off Peto with the other. Had he reflected for a
                  moment on the possibility of his being so soon overtaken, he would not have
                  ventured to leave his saddle; but he never imagined his master's assailants could
                  have escaped so numerous a party. Now, it happened that, owing to the furious
                  barking of the dog, Lewellyn was not aware of O'Brien's approach till he was
                  ordered to stand back and let the lady pass. The instant, therefore, he recognized
                  the voice of his late antagonist, he made a motion to unsling his carabine; but
                  Peto again sprang forward, and compelled him to defend himself with his sword.
                  O'Brien now paused for a single moment, as if to measure the distance between
                  Alice and her captor, and then, unbuckling his sword belt, he struck Lewellyn's
                  horse such a blow on the head with its heavy mounting, as to make him turn round,
                  like a top, and dash forward at a furious gallop on the road he had just
                  travelled. O'Brien now saw there was a chance to save Alice, and leaving Peto in
                  charge of the soldier, he advanced and laid his hand on the maiden's shoulder.
               "Mistress Alice," he said, "I think I can rescue thee. Wilt trust me?"
               She murmured something, raising her eyes a little to look at the speaker; but
                  O'Brien interrupted her, half piqued at her hesitation.
               "Your horse is already exhausted—mine will carry both—come;" and as he spoke, he
                  leaned over, lifted the young girl with as much ease as he would a child, and
                  placed her on the saddle before him.
               "Now," he cried, "now, Diermod, my boy! thou'st never yet failed me at a pinch: on
                  with thee, and God give thee strength in the good cause."
               The noble animal snorted and pricked up his ears, as if he understood every word
                  his master spoke, and then set off at full speed. Aware of the danger of tripping
                  over the loose stones and broken branches on the road, Rodger was obliged to hold
                  a tight rein with one hand, while he kept Alice in her place with the other. Speed
                  alone could now save them, and on he went. Suddenly, he felt the maiden's head
                  fall heavily back against his breast, and looking at her face, found she had
                  fainted. At the same moment, he heard the tramp of horses close upon him, as they
                  turned the last angle of the road. But there was no time to stop. She might soon
                  revive, and one moment's delay would place her at the mercy of her pursuers. He
                  concluded, therefore, it was better to trust her to God than Sir Thomas Plimpton;
                  and on he drove, spurring his good horse to his very utmost stretch. He had now
                  reached the foot of a hill, where the road divided, one branch running to the
                  left, and the other straight forward. He chose the straight course at a venture,
                  and had passed the junction some half dozen leaps, when he felt his horse suddenly
                     brought up by a high fence thrown
                  across the road to prevent travel. This was an awkward check to receive, just at
                  the moment he began to feel certain of escape. There was no remedy, however, but
                  to return and face the danger. Back he came, without a moment's delay, hoping, to
                  gain the other road before the pursuing party could reach it; but, alas! he was
                  too late: the soldiers, seeing his mistake, had ranged themselves across the road,
                  and received him, on his return, with levelled carabines, and threats of instant
                  death if he attempted to pass. Rodger saw in a moment he was fairly caught, and
                  that all further attempts to escape would be madness. He therefore drew in his
                  foaming horse, and surrendered himself and his insensible charge to the hands of
                  his pursuers.
               Alice soon recovered, on the application of the usual restoratives, and then all
                  returned to the tavern.
               Whilst Plimpton and his fair captive were engrossing the attention of the host and
                  hostess of the White Hart, and the soldiers refreshing themselves with sundry
                  flagons of ale, after the sharp exercise of the chase, Rodger felt the skirt of
                  his doublet suddenly plucked from behind, and turning round, saw a little woman in
                  a gray cloak leave his side and pass through a dark doorway in the farther corner
                  of the taproom. He followed her.
               Ten minutes after, neither Rodger O'Brien, Nell Gower, or Whitret Macbairn was to
                  be found.
               Sergeant Houghton, who had just received orders to proceed to Brockton with his
                  party, asseverated most lustily that the two latter personages were none other
                  than the devil and his mother, who carried off the Scotchman.
               And Plimpton, from whose temples Dame Waglippet was washing some blood stains,
                  swore he had good reason to think they were all of the same family.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XII.
               IT was the eve of St. John the Baptist, and all London was astir; some in groups,
                  looking from the open windows on the marching watch as it passed by, and others
                  joining the throng in its clamorous progress through the narrow streets. The
                  cressets and flambeaus, as they advanced, appeared like a dense column of moving
                  fire, blinding with its glare the occupants of the windows and house tops.
               First came the cresset-bearers and their numerous attendants; then the regular
                  marching watch, that, in bluff King Harry's time, numbered nearly two thousand
                  men, and which still, though much reduced, presented a goodly array; then came the
                  lances and the demilances, carabineers, and pikemen; then the archers, in their
                  shining corselets and white tinselled coats, carrying sheaves of arrows and bent
                  bows; then the arquebusiers, with their antique wheel locks slung round their
                  breasts; then came the constables on their heavy Flemish horses, prancing along on
                  each side the ranks in their shining armor, glancing from under their scarlet
                  scarfs. Each constable wore a gold chain round his neck, and was attended by six
                  cresset-bearers. On either side were his henchman and marshal. Then followed the
                  waits of the city; then the morris dancers, jingling their bells and tripping
                  merrily along the sides of the houses, and catching the pennies in their caps as
                  they fell from the thronged windows above. Last of all, and closing the
                  procession, came the mayor of London, in his robes of state, whose deep folds hung
                  down on each side of his horse, covering him almost to the pasterns. Around this
                  important functionary alone, in those merry days, were attendants enough to make
                  an imposing procession; and to judge from his look of gratified pride, he was
                  fully conscious of the honors with which he was surrounded. On his right and left
                  were his henchman and minstrel; behind him his twelve harnessed footmen; after
                  them his six giants, and interspersed here and there his twenty-four pages in
                  gaudy costume. If we add to the above programme the various bands of music
                  attached to the different corps, blowing their trumpets and rattling their drums
                  so furiously that noise, rather than music, seemed to be the object of their
                  ambition, the reader may conceive a faint idea of a midsummer eve procession in
                  the jolly days of "Good Queen Bess."
               The cavalcade had already marched through a considerable portion of the city. It
                  had passed through Cheapside, along Cornhill, down by Leaden Hall, and as far as
                  Aldgate. As the last file of the procession, treading on the heels of the lord
                  mayor's escort, had reached the corner of Gracious Street, an accident occurred,
                  which, trifling as it was, we must stop to describe.
               It was customary with the costard-mongers, then, as well as now, to erect their
                  stalls or station their carts at the corners of the principal streets. But they
                  were not content, like the fruit sellers of the present day, to spread their goods before the eyes of the
                  public, let buy who will. They found it expedient to imitate the mercer's
                  apprentices by vociferating lustily the qualities and prices of their stock in
                  trade. And so importunate and annoying did they become at last to the citizens,
                  that the municipal government found it necessary to place them under such severe
                  restrictions, that, in a few years subsequent to the date of our story, they had
                  almost entirely disappeared.
               One of those costard-mongers had blocked up the corner of Gracious and Fenchurch
                  Streets, leaving barely room for one person to pass at a time, so that a crowd had
                  gathered in consequence, from which arose loud imprecations against the fruit
                  vender for impeding the passage. Amidst the noise and confusion, a constable and
                  his guard, accompanied by a tall cavalier in black costume, rode up, and in a
                  stern voice commanded the costard-monger to remove his cart, and let the people
                  pass. Behind this person, and surrounded by half a dozen billmen, with their heavy
                  bills and glittering aprons of mail, rode a lady, whose sombre dress and
                  melancholy attitude bespoke her one who took little interest in the festivities of
                  the night. Her face was concealed by a black veil, that fell over her shoulders
                  and covered nearly her whole person. Whilst the constable was issuing his orders,
                  a little old woman, in a gray cloak, the hood of which covered the greater part of
                  her face, and tied under her chin, had been observed to crush through the throng,
                  and make her way to the costard-monger. She had spoken to him but a second or two,
                  when one of the crowd bade her begone for an old Scotch beldam, and not stay there
                  babbling her uncouth Gaelic. The fruit seller seemed instantly to understand her,
                  for he glanced suddenly across his shoulder at the lady on horseback, and took a
                  rapid view of the position of the constable's guard and the crowd surrounding it.
                  Then, quick as thought, he jumped upon the cart, crushed down his dinged,
                  weather-worn hat over his forehead, snatched a hard-favored cudgel from the bottom
                  of the vehicle, and spitting on it, after the fashion of scrimmage makers, in a
                  certain "green island of the west," laid on the jaded and sleepy-looking animal in
                  a manner well calculated to dispel his dreams of the manger, if any he indulged
                  in. Whether it was that the man knew his horse's stubborn disposition, and
                  resolved to profit by it on this special occasion to further his own ends, we have
                  never been able to learn; but certain it is, the animal backed furiously, instead
                  of bounding forward, thereby upsetting a number of bystanders, and breaking the
                  ranks of the constable's guard. The cresset-bearers, and those who stood next,
                  were the first through whose midst the cart passed, dashing them one against the
                  other, and extinguishing the lights, which, as they fell amidst the dense crowd,
                  occasioned a scene of indescribable confusion. Every effort was made to stop the
                  horse, but in vain. One of the billmen caught him by the halter, and was dragged
                  under his feet. The constable, separated from the lady by the waving of the crowd
                  to and fro, and not seeing her in the darkness that now prevailed, shouted lustily
                  to his guard to close up and secure the maiden.
               
               "Bills and broadswords, take heed she escape not!" he cried, spurring his horse
                  furiously through the uproarious multitude.
               "Stab the crazy varlet, Houghton. What's the men doing there?" cried another.
               But it was too late. The costard-monger, seeing the moment had arrived, jumped
                  from the cart, and with his stout oaken staff literally broke his way, through
                  cracked skulls and shattered arms, to the veiled lady—the crowd receding as he
                  drove on. When he neared the spot, two pikemen, who had still maintained their
                  places close by the side of the prisoner, presented their blades, and were about
                  to rush on the costard-monger, when half a dozen stalwart fellows, in blue
                  blouses, having their hats crushed down flat on their heads, sprang on them, and
                  wresting the weapons from their hands, laid about them in a most alarming fashion,
                  shouting, as they thrust their pike points through the dense mass, "Irishmen, to
                  the rescue! Down with the Sassenaghs." The horseman with the black morion, who was
                  no other than Sir Thomas Plimpton, having been separated from his captive in the
                  beginning of the melée, now spurred his charger
                  over every obstacle, regardless of life or limb, and was about to lay hold of the
                  lady's bridle rein, when his horse, receiving a pistol ball in the flank, leaped
                  and vaulted through the crowd, unseating his rider, and adding tenfold to the
                  confusion. The costard-monger had now reached the side of the lady, who, though
                  trembling with fear, and incapable of estimating her danger, still kept her
                  saddle. He had laid his hand on her horse's shoulder, and spoke a word or two in
                  an under tone, when the long veil that covered nearly her whole person was
                  suddenly torn off by some ruffian of the crowd, and exposed the lovely form and
                  modest, blushing face of Alice Wentworth.
               Alice had just reached the city, a prisoner in the hands of Sir Thomas Plimpton,
                  who joined the cavalcade, as the safest escort on such an occasion of riotous and
                  noisy carnival.
               Just then a cresset-bearer had relighted his torch, and its broad glare, falling
                  full upon the maiden, illumined her whole person. The moment the crowd saw that
                  countenance, so young and so beautiful, a half-uttered cry of admiration and pity
                  arose from a hundred lips; and then a noble, handsome-looking man, in court dress,
                  wearing a blue velvet cap, whose heavy gold tassel fell upon his shoulder,
                  tight-fitting hose, a scarlet doublet, and cloak trimmed with gold, spurred his
                  horse recklessly through the dense throng. Every eye for an instant turned from
                  the young girl to the horseman. He was then, perhaps, verging on thirty, but
                  seemed much younger. His finely-turned nose, small mouth, so expressive of pride
                  and self-reliance, his eye that seemed to take in every thing at a glance, and his
                  high, ample forehead, over which the cap was pushed back to the very root of his
                  auburn hair, bespoke at once the courtier and the noble.
               "Make way there for the noble Earl of Leicester," shouted several voices as soon
                  as he was recognized. "Long live the queen and the Earl of Leicester!"
               "How now, honest lieges," he demanded. "What game call ye this on a midsummer eve?
                  Ha, by my halidome, a most comely wench; and pray, my pretty maiden, why art thou here in such a broil and at
                  such an hour?" he added, prancing up to Alice. "Thy name fair one, if it be not
                  over bold to ask thee. Methinks we met before."
               "Alice Wentworth, may it please thee, my lord."
               "Grantworth, ah! and a right doughty name it was once at the battle of Pinkie,"
                  replied Leicester, mistaking the first syllable in the confusion; and he would
                  have pursued the conversation, with as little concern for the safety of the lady
                  or himself as if there was no danger to be apprehended. But the costard-monger
                  again appeared, making towards Alice at the head of a small party of ill-dressed,
                  yet merry-looking fellows, who seemed to enjoy the sport right heartily, and break
                  more bones with their oak staves and crab trees than the urgency of the case
                  required. Alice, too, caught a glimpse of the costard-monger, and her eye seemed
                  to brighten as she saw him approach.
               "Ho, there, varlets!" cried Leicester, suddenly turning in his saddle, and
                  speaking to his squires in waiting, who seemed fitter for the drawing room than a
                  street quarrel; "hoa, there, ye lazy knaves! on with ye, and drive these mad
                  rascals off the street. Come, fair lady," he added, in a lower tone, "let me be
                  thy guardian and slave;" and Leicester had just laid hold of Alice's rein, when,
                  strange to say, he found he was leading a horse without a rider. The
                  costard-monger, who had gallantly fought his way three times to her side, and been
                  as often repulsed, now at last succeeded in snatching her from the saddle, and
                  carrying her in his arms through the throng, his band of trusty followers breaking
                  a passage before him, and covering his retreat behind. As he passed the corner of
                  Gracious Street, he cried, "Out with the lights! out with the lights, boys, or
                  we're lost!" and he bore her on, over prostrate bodies and smouldering torches,
                  many of the mob now cheering him right heartily when they saw his noble and
                  gallant rescue of the fair maiden.
               "Tak the neest corner, lad, an awa wi' ye through the passage!" cried the old
                  woman of the gray cloak, whom the reader will easily have recognized as Nell
                  Gower; "tak the neest corner, lad, and mind ye dinna harm the bairn," she
                  screamed, through a broken window, as the costard-monger swept past with Alice in
                  his arms.
               The passage alluded to was very narrow, affording merely room enough for two
                  abreast to pass. The costard-monger turned the corner, and entered it, his retreat
                  still covered by the blue blouses, with the crushed hats and oaken cudgels.
               "Out the way, ye scurvy churls!" vociferated Plimpton again, on horseback, and
                  rushing towards the entrance of the passage at the head of some score halberdiers,
                  his naked sword gleaming in the flickering torchlight. "Cut down these traitors
                  and fautors of Papistry!" he cried, aiming a blow at a man who stood barring the
                  passage. The latter parried it with his staff. Plimpton then spurred his horse
                  closer, and renewed his attack. This time, however, his sword, instead of hitting
                  his man, struck against the wall and broke in pieces: so blinded by passion was he
                  that he did not observe the strait into which he had run.
               
               "Aisy avourneen, machree! aisy, or ye'll spail yer knuckles agin the wall!" cried
                  the guard, with a slightly foreign accent; and slapping his dinged hat closer down
                  upon his head, he sprang forward, and caught Plimpton's bridle rein. The horse
                  suddenly fell back, jerking up his head, and the Irishman, taking advantage of the
                  movement, followed, and still holding on by the rein, dealt Plimpton such a blow
                  with his trusty staff as made him reel in the saddle, and would have unhorsed him
                  but for the pressure of the surrounding crowd.
               "Hegh!" cried the Celt, as the tough oak crashed against the Englishman's temple,
                  "there's a touch o' Irish Papistry for ye;" and letting the bridle go, he
                  retreated through the passage, now that he had guarded it long enough for the
                  escape of the costard-monger.
               Leicester, when he saw how matters stood, and unwilling to embroil himself further
                  in a night quarrel, had quitted the fray, and was turning down Goldden Street, on
                  his way home, accompanied by his suite, when he saw the costard-monger spring upon
                  a horse's back at the south end of the narrow alley, and snatching the lady, place
                  her before him on the saddle.
               "Now, Diermod, away once more, my boy, and God guide thee, for I can't!" cried the
                  pretended apple vender, in tones sufficiently audible to the earl and his train.
                  In another minute, the reports of two or three petronels rung out from the mouth
                  of the passage; but after the noise had died away, the clatter of horses' hoofs
                  was still heard retreating in the distance.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               THE gates of Hampton Court Palace were securely barred and bolted. The din and
                  bustle that resounded during the day, along the halls and corridors, had long
                  since subsided into silence and quiet. Nothing was now to be heard but the
                  measured tread of the sentinel, as he passed to and fro before the gates, or the
                  occasional scream of the peacock (the queen's favorite bird) from the walls. It
                  was pitchy dark, the atmosphere thick and foggy, and the few lights which gleamed,
                  here and there, in the rear of the royal residence, looked large and dim.
               Nell Gower, true to her appointment, had been sitting for a full half hour under
                  the great elm tree, opposite one of the rear entrances to the court. She was
                  wrapped, as usual, in her gray cloak, the hood of which, thrown carefully over her
                  head, left no part of her person visible but the face. She sat, as she herself
                  would say, upon her hunkers, rolled up into a very small bulk, and looking out,
                  from under the hood, like a weasel from its hiding-place.
               She had already begun to feel somewhat impatient at the delay of her noble
                  employer. Not that she cared for being alone at so late an hour, within bow shot
                  of Hampton walls; nor that she doubted, from the anxiety he seemed to feel about
                  the affair, he would endeavor, for his own sake, to be punctual to the hour; but she dreaded some unforeseen
                  obstacle might have been thrown in the way of his arrangements.
               "Aweel, aweel," she muttered to herself, drawing the cloak closer round her arms
                  and shoulders, "there's na use in frettin'. It's his ain business; so e'en let him
                  tak his ain time. I'll bide his comin'."
               She had hardly arrived at this conclusion, when the gate before her opened, and
                  two men (as she judged by the tread of their steps on the hard pavement) issued
                  forth, and giving the countersign to the sentinel, passed on to a bench within a
                  few feet of where she sat.
               "So, Master Millar, thou bringest but small tidings of the wench!" began one of
                  the party.
               "Most gracious sir, I have searched every nook and corner in Fenchurch
                  Street."
               "Humph! and to no purpose. But what of the Scot?"
               "He hath not been seen since he carried her off."
               "Nor the old beldam?"
               "Report saith she's in the neighborhood, and was seen yesterday at the Peacock
                  Tavern, in the village."
               "Report is a very convenient informant of thine, methinks, Master Millar. Thou
                  hast so fed me with reports, for three weeks or more, that I would fain have
                  something more substantial for my gold. I'm sick of reports. One cannot always be
                  swallowing reports. But what sayeth report of the old Papist, Sir Geoffrey. Hath
                  it been busy with him also?"
               "I have already informed thee, Sir Thomas, that he was seen for the last time,
                  sitting in the ruins of Glastonbury, replacing the leaves of a great folio, which
                  the party under Houghton had torn and cast away among the walls."
               "The miserable old driveller!" ejaculated Sir Thomas. "I fear I shall never come
                  within reach of him. But hark thee, Millar. The maiden is not far from the Scotch
                  crone, Nell Gower. Seek her and find her before another week passes, or thy
                  connection with me ceases. I'll have no more reports."
               "And the girl—thou'rt resolved to have her at all risks?"
               "Ay, marry am I, should it be necessary to sow up her lips and pinion her arms.
                  Bring her to me. I'll marry her, should she die at the altar."
               "But who will hold me scathless in this matter, if her majesty come to hear of our
                  maltreating the daughter of so old and honorable a house, Papist though it be, as
                  that of the Wentworths of Brockton?"
               "Have I not already pledged thee my protection, knave? Dost require more?"
               "Good, Sir Thomas, but mayhap thou hast not reflected that the queen's favor is
                  somewhat of the ficklest; and though to-day thou mayst enjoy her confidence,
                  to-morrow may find thee in the Tower."
               "Nay, nay, most cautious Master Millar; I've been too long about court not to have
                  provided against such contingencies. There's but little danger to me of such an
                  untoward event."
               "And her majesty hath promised to forward thy suit?"
               "Ay hath she, and would like much to see her under my husbandship, for her own good reasons, not
                  to speak of others which interest myself more immediately. I know full well the
                  maiden doth not affect me, but I care not for that a barleycorn. I need her
                  fortune to repair some recent losses I have sustained in her grace's service. As
                  for the rest, I shall bestow her on thee for the asking."
               "Well, well, noble sir, do not yet despair. I shall risk my neck to find her; and
                  once under thy gracious protection, we shall be able to estimate more correctly
                  the value of the dangers I must needs run in thy honorable service. And now, sir,
                  for the warrant of search."
               "Here," said Plimpton, "here's the warrant. I have taken care to provide it. It
                  giveth thee free ingress wherever thou suspectest recusants, or harborers of
                  priests and mass-mongers, to reside. And here's a well-filled purse to buy thee
                  secrets. And now begone, for it's almost daybreak."
               "Deil brack his neck when he is gane," muttered Nell, crouching like a toad at the
                  foot of the tree.
               "And whither shall I carry her, noble sir?" inquired Millar, following his
                  employer a step or two, as he approached the gate.
               "To Blinden Lan; have I not already told thee so? But hark thee, Millar; thou hast
                  so long worn this disguise of a priest, that I fear me thou'lt be discovered.
                  Canst speak Latin and mumble the breviary?"
               "Ay, can I that, master, as well as any long gown in Rome. So Heaven guide thee,
                  most worthy Sir Thomas Plimpton, and long live the queen, to prosper the glorious
                  cause of civil and religious liberty."
               "And look thee, Millar—a thing I had almost forgotten. It may happen that affairs
                  of moment detain me in Scotland longer than I can forecast. Should I return not
                  within the week, thou'lt see that the girl or the knight, or both, once in thy
                  power, be strictly guarded till my return. Give thee good den, Master Millar."
               "Ha, ha, guid gracious me!" chuckled Nell. "Heh, sirs, what a discovery! Heaven be
                  praised for this night's secrets ony way. Ha, ha! patience will hae its ain
                  reward. Little kens the puir bairn o' the wicked work that's a-doin'; an a' aboot
                  her bit gear. Weel, weel, bide awee, bide awee; gin I get my hands on the bairn,
                  it ill gae hard wi' me or I'll mak it worth the nursin'."
               As Sir Thomas Plimpton reached the gate, he gave the countersign, and the
                  sentinel, respectfully saluting him, threw open the wicket. On turning from the
                  soldier, after placing a piece of money in his hand, and whilst yet in the act of
                  speaking, he struck against some one coming out, and, irritated by the sudden
                  check, demanded, in an angry tone, who came there at such an hour.
               "Give way," said the new comer, in a deep, authoritative voice, "and let us
                  pass."
               Sir Thomas looked closely at the stranger, but his face was enveloped in the folds
                  of his cloak. He then turned to an individual who had retired behind the
                  speaker.
               "Ha, by my certie," he cried, "and a lady too, with a precious burden in her
                  arms;" and he attempted to peer under her hood.
               
               "Guard, drive this fellow back," muttered the man in the cloak, without changing
                  his tone or position.
               "And who art thou, that speakest so imperiously to the royal guard? Thy name, Sir
                  Stranger?"
               "Give way, master," interposed the soldier, coming up to Plimpton, and pressing
                  his arm significantly.
               "Give way and let the lady pass. My lord," he continued, addressing the muffled
                  man. But he had hardly spoken the word when he was commanded to be silent, and
                  execute his orders.
               As the wicket again closed, and Plimpton found himself inside the park wall, he
                  crossed his arms, and gazing at the gate with the feeling one experiences at
                  finding a door contemptuously slapped in his face, began to reflect on the
                  rencontre. "That man is Leicester," he muttered to himself. "I could swear to his
                  voice, notwithstanding its disguised tone. His height, his motion, the prompt
                  obedience of the sentinel, every thing contributes to put the matter beyond
                  question. And the woman! Ah! he called her a lady—a lady removing an infant from
                  the royal palace. I heard its tiny cry under the muffling. Humph! well, the bare
                  fact is not surprising; if report speaks truth, it's not the first within the
                  twelve-month. But a lady and the noble Earl of Leicester engaged in such a
                  business! Ay, it's that makes the affair mysterious. Well, we shall see. Most
                  potent Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, the court hath been too narrow of late to
                  hold both thee and me comfortably. Thou'rt a Knight of the Garter, and the owner
                  of many a goodly acre: what an I could induce thee to barter a portion of thy
                  wealth for my silence! What construction, think'st thou, my noble lord, shall her
                  majesty put on thy night walking with a lady carrying such a love token in her
                  arms? I have long been waiting for some such lucky chance to repay thee for thy
                  slights and scoffs—thy supercilious frowns and contemptuous language. It hath
                  failed thee to banish me the court, or bar me the writ of arrest for the
                  idolatrous old knight and his fair daughter. Thou little dreamest—though thy
                  dreams be of a throne—how my knowledge of state secrets could win me favor, even
                  against thy will. Ha, ha! thou'rt caught at last, proud minion! Earl, forsooth, so
                  powerful and haughty, that knights of degree must hold thy stirrup, and doff their
                  beavers to thy lordship. But thou'lt fall, Dudley, if I know aught of her majesty.
                  She hath given thee substantial proofs of her condescension; nay—if I may make so
                  bold to say it —she hath not at all times taken pains to conceal her more than
                  ordinary friendship for thee; but take thee heed she yet forget she is a woman,
                  and remember suddenly she is a queen. Take thee heed, my good Lord of Leicester.
                  Didst never read the fable of the tigress, that was wont, for many years, to
                  fondle her master, and stroke his face and hands with her velvet paws; and yet
                  became so jealous, once on a time, of his fondness for a favorite rabbit, as to
                  change the velvet for the talons? But hush! I hear steps approaching from without,
                  and I must not be caught here."
               As Plimpton retired within the shadow of the wall, the two individuals who had
                  gone out again passed through the wicket.
               
               "I crave thy mercy, my noble Lord of Leicester," said the sentinel, respectfully
                  saluting his superior, "if in speaking thy honorable name I have done amiss."
               "Thy duty, fellow,—and thou'lt do well to remember it,"—responded the earl, "is to
                  guard the gates of Hampton; not to busy thy foolish tongue with the names and
                  titles of every courtier who passeth in and out on the service of the state. See
                  to it that thy garrulity lose thee not thy office. But who is this court gallant
                  we have met just now, Master Guard? Methinks I recognized him."
               "Sir Thomas Plimpton, if it so please thee, my good lord."
               The lady, who clung close by Leicester, uttered a faint exclamation of alarm as
                  the soldier pronounced the name.
               "And whither hath he gone?"
               "I know not, my lord."
               "Hark thee, fellow, and think on't," said Leicester. "There be two things I would
                  have thee take heed to; one, that thou forgettest having seen me here at this hour
                  and in this company; the other, that Sir Thomas Plimpton pass not the gates of
                  Hampton again before daybreak. Keep thee a close mouth and a close gate, if thou
                  wouldst thrive under my patronage." And Leicester and his companion, turning from
                  the sentinel, entered the royal palace.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               IN a spacious boudoir at Hampton Court, a few weeks after the occurrence of the
                  events we have just related, sat Elizabeth Tudor, the greatest female sovereign of
                  Europe, and beside her the Countess Harrington, the most faithful and devoted of
                  royal handmaidens. Both were sadly and silently gazing on the pictures that
                  covered the walls of the apartment. Neither seemed disposed to speak; yet, to
                  judge from the stealthy glances they cast at each other, and again quickly
                  withdrew, their thoughts must have been painful and embarrassing. Elizabeth's
                  head, wrapped in a scarf, after the fashion of a turban, and gathered on the
                  forehead under a diamond of the finest lustre, lay back against the cushion of the
                  chair in which she reclined. The place was darkened so much by the close-drawn
                  window curtains, that, entering suddenly from out the glare of the antechamber,
                  one could hardly distinguish the objects in the apartment. Directly above the
                  mantel, before which the queen sat, hung a portrait of her father, by Holbein, his
                  right hand resting on the hilt of a two-edged sword that lay across the leaves of
                  an open Bible. Various pictures and statues, some of them of small merit, but of
                  religious character, lay here and there on tables and pedestals, or hung suspended
                  from the walls. These ornaments, with the single exception of the first mentioned, were calculated to impress the mind of
                  the visitor, as he entered and looked about him, with feelings of religious
                  respect for the place and the occupant. There was the little marble font of
                  blessed water near the door, the crucifix upon the table, and the image of the
                  Blessed Virgin overlooking all from the wall opposite, as if the queen of angelic
                  purity had been chosen to guard that holy sanctuary. Elizabeth's face was pale and
                  cold as marble, and her form lay as still as if life had left it. Her eyes, that
                  but a few weeks before beamed and flashed with their hereditary fire, were now
                  languid and expressionless, and her features thin and pinched, like one worn out
                  by long suffering. Yet she had given peremptory orders that morning, despite the
                  remonstrance of her physician, and Lady Harrington, her faithful attendant, to be
                  carried in her chair from her bed chamber to her boudoir. Dr. Maraski, who had
                  been watching at her bedside for three days and nights incessantly, had retired to
                  rest by her express command, notwithstanding his having assured her majesty that
                  she stood in imminent danger of a fever from the least imprudent exertion, and
                  therefore needed his most constant attention.
               There was a long interval of painful silence, during which her ever-active mind
                  had been busily thinking. Her thoughts had travelled back to bygone times—to
                  Seymour, and the Protector, and the prison, to the dreams of her youth and the sad
                  realities of her maturer years. She had been endeavoring to realize what the world
                  thought of her—how she stood in the estimation of her friends and enemies mies.
                  She dwelt long on the possibility of losing that virgin reputation which she had
                  been so long laboring to acquire. She had thought, too, of God and eternity, of
                  death and judgment. But there was one image that constantly obtruded itself upon
                  her thoughts, and disturbed them beyond all others—it was the image of Mary
                  Stuart, as she saw her at the court of Edward, the object of universal adoration,
                  looking the very personification of meekness, grace, and loveliness. And she was
                  now the enthroned Queen of Scotland and heir presumptive to the British crown—the
                  woman in whose presence she feared to appear, lest her superhuman beauty would rob
                  her of those hearts and eyes she so long labored to captivate, and in whom, after
                  her own solemn declaration against marriage, the hopes of the nation must
                  necessarily centre. This thought was ever uppermost; if she crushed it down at
                  all, it was but for a moment; it rose again more powerful and distressing than
                  before. Mary Stuart was the spectre that hovered round her, sleeping and waking;
                  the demon with the angel form and face that forever came to interpose between her
                  and happiness. After a long indulgence in these bitter musings, her form still
                  reclining motionless in the chair, and her arms stretched listless at her side,
                  she started suddenly, and screamed as if a viper had stung her, and brushed her
                  dress quickly with her hand, as if to drive away the poisonous reptile. Lady
                  Harrington flew to her side in an instant.
               "Ha!" ejaculated Elizabeth, her eyes glaring with the fright, "methought she had
                  killed me!"
               
               "Who, most gracious madam?" inquired the countess.
               "That—that—O, nothing! I thought an adder had stung me; nothing more."
               "Your majesty's thoughts are still troubling thee," said the countess, kneeling
                  and kissing the queen's hand affectionately.
               "I cannot help thinking," replied Elizabeth, smiling faintly.
               "O, be not dispirited, my dear and gracious madam; be not dispirited," said the
                  countess; "all will yet be well. Thy faithful people and right loyal and loving
                  clergy are offering their orisons without ceasing in the churches in your
                  majesty's behalf, and they will surely be heard. Be comforted, my queen; this
                  despondency ill beseemeth the great Elizabeth."
               "Great!" repeated the queen, emphasizing the syllable, and looking languidly in
                  the face of her attendant.
               "Ay," reiterated the countess, "great, and good, and noble, and kind. What
                  though——"
               "Stop!" ejaculated Elizabeth, closing the lips of the too candid countess with her
                  open palm, and pressing them significantly; "not now; some other time we shall
                  speak more at our leisure of that misfortune. Give us the drops."
               When she had tasted the medicine, and felt somewhat invigorated, she asked if
                     he had been to inquire lately.
               "May it please your majesty," replied her confidant, "he is here always; he never
                  leaves the antechamber."
               "How looks he?"
               "Pale and sleepless, madam, yet full of his habitual self-possession."
               "Whisper," said Elizabeth, interrupting the course of the subject in her eagerness
                  to learn something that troubled her mind, and which lent her countenance, even
                  whilst questioning her friend, a look of distraction. "Whisper," she repeated,
                  stealing a glance at the door, and bending down her head till her lips almost
                  touched the cheek of the countess; "tell me, hath that been
                  removed?"
               The countess bowed, and pressed the queen's hand, which she still held in
                  hers.
               "Thinkest thou—that is—hast reason to believe, it will live?" pursued the queen,
                  hesitatingly.
               "It's dead," responded the countess.
               "Ha, dead! Who told thee? Hast seen it dead?"
               "I have not seen with mine eyes, my liege; but——"
               "But who hath told thee?"
               "He did himself, most gracious madam."
               "Only he! Ah, alas! alas! then I must still be in doubt!"
               "He assured me, please your majesty, it was dead."
               "Ay, assured thee! Ah, trust him not, Harrington; he's full of deceit. Yet if he
                  deceives us in this, he dies—ay, dies by this hand, should none else be found to
                  avenge us. Interrupt us not, woman, and learn to be silent when a queen speaks! He
                  will not live to govern us by the fear of exposure. We'll crush him as a worm
                  under our shoe!" and as she spoke, the
                  blood rushed, for an instant, to her face. It was the blood of Henry VIII.
               "O, my gracious queen, these thoughts will kill thee, if thou dost not repress
                  them," said the countess, in accents of pity and terror, at the sight of so much
                  mental agony; for she feared that excitement, acting on a frame so weakened with
                  sickness and confinement, would deprive her of her reason. "I beseech your majesty
                  will spare thyself this——"
               "Peace, woman! and listen to us," interrupted the queen. Thinkest thou the secret
                  in thy keeping gives thee a right to be bold; listen, and answer us: when hath he
                  seen this Alice Wentworth?"
               "The Earl of ——?"
               "Ay, when hath he seen her?"
               "I know not, my liege."
               "Countess, didst thou ever lie? didst thou?— speak!" and the queen caught her by
                  the arm, and squeezed it with such muscular power, weak as she was, that the poor
                  lady winced under the pain.
               "Lie, your majesty!"
               "Ay, lie! wouldst tell a falsehood to relieve us from mental suffering. We are a
                  queen—wouldst lie to please a queen?"
               "O, your majesty, thou'rt not thyself, or thou wouldst not speak thus," said the
                  countess. "I implore your majesty——"
               "Answer us, minion, answer us truly, or we'll pluck thine eyes out. Hath he seen
                  her since our progress in Worcestershire?"
               "Never, my gracious sovereign—never to my knowledge;" and Lady Harrington burst
                  into tears.
               "Paugh!" cried Elizabeth, "we care not for tears; they're but poor weapons to
                  defend thee against the anger of a Plantagenet. Give us the drops."
               "Countess," she resumed, having swallowed the medicine, and suddenly, as usual,
                  repressed the violence of her passion—"countess, we fear we have done thee wrong
                  in suspecting thee of deceit, though it was only for a moment. We know thou art
                  well tried and right faithful; but the experience of the duplicity and treachery
                  of professed friends hath made us so fearful and suspicious, that we sometimes
                  think we should mistrust every one about us."
               "Be calm, then, my gracious mistress, and endeavor to court some repose, after the
                  terrible agonies thou hast endured, both of mind and body, for the few last days.
                  I will sit here at thy feet, and tend thee with the fondness of a sister, and the
                  humility of a slave, till thou art again able to meet thy faithful and loyal
                  people."
               "Love," repeated the queen, with a languid and meaning smile; "hath not thy love
                  been less ardent and less respectful of late?"
               "Not a whit, my sovereign. O, do not think so, or thou'lt break my heart."
               "We do not think so, countess; no, we merely asked thee. If we
                  thought this—this late event had lessened thy respect or attachment, we should
                  have taken care to provide for thee, my friend,"—and she tapped the lady's cheek
                  playfully as she spoke,— "in such a manner that thy secret would run no risk of
                  disclosure."
               Lady Harrington, not in the least unprepared for such a threat,—for she well knew the character of
                  the woman into whose perilous confidence she was admitted,—replied in the same
                  pleasant humor her majesty had affected, that she would willingly receive any
                  provision of the kind her grace would condescend to offer, but hoped,
                  nevertheless, the time was far off when her majesty would deem such a measure
                  necessary to her happiness. And the countess was sincere in every word she
                  uttered; for she loved Elizabeth more truly and devotedly than all the rest of her
                  numerous attendants; not for her virtues, nor for the possession of those
                  qualities of the heart which create and preserve friendship, but because she was a
                  queen, and thought her worthy of her confidence.
               "Trust in me, my gentle mistress," continued the countess, kneeling before her,
                  and looking up beseechingly in her face; "do not doubt me for one moment. I would
                  gladly lay down my life a thousand times to defend thee from ill."
               "Nay, we know well thou wouldst make any personal sacrifice; but what boots it if
                     that thing live to imbitter our days. Ah, the thought is a very
                  hell to us. We would see it dead, countess."
               "Thou shalt never see it, madam; it is doubtless long ago removed from human
                  sight."
               "Doubtless! paugh! And thou hast but his word for this deed, and he but the
                  promise of an old Scotch recusant, mayhap the creature of Mary Stuart. Gads death!
                  it's hard to bear this terrible uncertainty. Hand us the drops." But the intense
                  dread of exposure, caused by the latter reflection, was too much for her exhausted
                  frame—she fainted ere the medicine reached her lips.
               Lady Harrington flew to the door, and sent a messenger for Dr. Maraski.
               The old mediciner, thin and cadaverous, and dressed in his sombre habiliments,
                  appeared almost instantly at the door, staggering from the weight of years and
                  long-continued watching. Immediately behind him came Cecil, her faithful and
                  intriguing minister, and Leicester, her handsome favorite, both hesitating on the
                  threshold, as if they felt doubtful of the propriety of the visit. Cecil, however,
                  confident of his sovereign's high regard and his own deserts, took courage and
                  approached. Leicester, whose countenance betrayed some secret apprehension,
                  following the secretary, knelt beside the queen, and throwing back the scarf from
                  her forehead, just began to chafe her temples when she recovered from the
                  swoon.
               The earl's face was the first object the queen saw when she awoke to
                  consciousness, and instantly recognized it. Supposing there was no other in the
                  room but the Countess of Harrington, she snatched her right hand from his, in
                  which it was clasped, and struck him a blow upon the cheek, faintly hissing out
                  the words between her clinched teeth, "Begone traitor, thou hast undone me."
               Cecil, who overheard the words, glanced at the countess an inquisitive look; but
                  that lady, conscious his eye was turned upon her, expressed nothing but concern
                  for her mistress.
               Leicester rose, without a word of reply, and meekly retired behind her chair.
                  Cecil approached, and kneeling down, took the queen's hand reverently, and kissed
                  it.
               
               "Why, what's this!—ah, my good secretary, thou here! and looking as if thine eyes
                  had just beheld the extinction of all earthly royalty. We imagined (perhaps it was
                  a dream) that we had just buffeted the ears of the noble Earl of Leicester, for
                  having so long neglected his suit with the handsome Queen of Scots, and thus
                     undone all our political calculations. Eh! sirs, was it but a
                  dream?"
               "My gracious sovereign," replied Cecil, "hath but to command the noble earl to
                  step from behind her grace's chair, and methinks the blood which yet tingles in
                  his cheek will easily remove the doubt, if any there be."
               The last words of the wily statesman sounded somewhat equivocal to the queen's
                  ear; but she affected not to notice them, and turning her head slightly to look at
                  Leicester, who now presented himself at her side, said, in a tone of bitter
                  reproof, "Hadst thou been as solicitous to gratify our wishes in reference to the
                  happiness of our sister of Scotland as thou seemest about our health, which is in
                  the Lord's keeping, and who will not fail to watch over it without thy aid, thou
                  hadst pleasured us more, my Lord of Leicester."
               "Gracious madam," began the earl, in a humble, supplicatory tone.
               But the queen interrupted him with a request to be alone with Sir William Cecil,
                  and directed Lady Harrington to remain in the antechamber.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               "I HAD just come to inquire after your grace's health," said the secretary, when
                  the door closed behind the Countess of Harrington, "and was about to leave the
                  palace, rejoiced at your majesty's recovery, when I was told of your sudden
                  indisposition, and made bold to enter your majesty's apartment, for the which I
                  humbly crave your gracious pardon."
               "We pardon thee right willingly, Sir William; firstly, because thy visit was
                  prompted by thy love for our royal person, and, secondly, because there was no
                  affair of so delicate a nature as to require thy exclusion."
               "It affords me exceeding pleasure to hear your majesty speak so flatteringly of my
                  poor devotion to your gracious and right royal person," replied Cecil, kneeling
                  before her in an attitude of profound veneration, "and that your grace's health is
                  again restored so much as to enable your grace to leave the royal bed
                  chamber."
               "Thou speakest like a loyal subject, Sir William, and we thank thee for thy
                  devotion. Rise, sir, and sit thee down beside us. We have not yet forgotten the
                  friendly relations we have formed in the days of our imprisonment, and care not to
                  subject thee now to the rules of court etiquette."
               
               Cecil rose, and having made a profound obeisance, seated himself on the stool
                  beside her.
               "Doth your majesty find the new mediciner skilful in his art?" he inquired.
               "Beyond expectation," replied Elizabeth; "and we regret much his intention of
                  again returning to Florence."
               "Your majesty's regret for such a step," observed Cecil, "should be equal to a
                  command, were he even so blind as not to see the honor it conferred. I had not
                  heard of his intention to leave your majesty's service."
               "We would fain detain him here as our special physician, had he been our own
                  subject; but we cannot"—and Elizabeth hesitated, as if doubtful what to say—"we
                  cannot detain the subject of another."
               "If it be your grace's wish, he shall remain," observed Cecil,
                  confidently.
               "Nay, we shall have no service from compulsion," replied the queen, "and least of
                  all that of a physician, as thou must needs well know, my good secretary; but if
                  he were loyal, and corresponded not with Italian conspirators, the which, we fear,
                  he hath done, and were disposed to serve us well, according to his knowledge, we
                  should sleep the sounder of his presence in our royal palace."
               "Correspond with Italian conspirators against your majesty's kingdom and life!"
                  repeated Cecil; "most gracious queen, this should have been seen to. I tremble
                  when I reflect that your majesty's life has been in such hands!"
               
               "Nay, we did not say that either," quickly responded Elizabeth; "we cannot and do
                  not aver that he hath in verity corresponded with such men; but a report savoring
                  strongly of it hath come to our ears, and given us much uneasiness."
               "The matter shall be thoroughly investigated, gracious madam, and with all the
                  despatch the mightiness of the case demands."
               "We would not have thee precipitate, neither, Sir William; but if you discover
                  treason, it is needless to say it must be punished. Right gladly would we see the
                  old man acquitted of the charge, for we could trust much to his knowledge of the
                  healing art; but it ill suiteth a crowned head to be at the mercy of disloyal
                  servants."
               Whether Cecil himself had reason to suspect the doctor maintained a secret
                  correspondence with the agents of the Italian conspiracy, so called, whose object
                  was to support the claims of Mary Stuart as heir presumptive, or that he imagined
                  Elizabeth was willing to implicate him in it for her own private reasons, certain
                  it is he at once resolved not to suffer the doctor to leave the kingdom. Having,
                  in accordance with this resolution, again assured the queen of his immediate
                  attention to a case of such weighty importance, he ventured to allude to some
                  state affairs of great and pressing moment, but feared it would fatigue her
                  majesty too much to prolong the conference.
               "Fear not, sir," replied Elizabeth; "we shall listen to thee without
                  inconvenience. Give us the drops."
               The queen, fearing, in the consciousness of her guilt, that Cecil might form dark suspicions of her
                  recent retirement, and attribute an exhaustion so unusual to other causes than
                  that of her well-known rheumatism of the leg, determined to grant him an
                  interview, and go through it with all the energy and self-possession she could
                  summon to her aid.
               "But first, Mr. Secretary," she resumed, after swallowing a few drops of the
                  invigorating medicine, "what of the recusants?"
               "They still refuse the oath, my liege, trusting, no doubt, to your majesty's
                  wonted clemency."
               "And thou still persistest in the opinion that so severe a measure is necessary
                  for the well being of religion and safety of the state?"
               "Most certainly, madam, under your gracious favor, I do still think so."
               "Tut, tut, Sir William, say not so; the enforcement of that law would shed the
                  blood of half our subjects. We can never approve, sir, of so bloody a
                  statute."
               "I most humbly crave your majesty's indulgence, when I say that, in my poor
                  opinion, your majesty's safety, and that of religion, nay, even of the state,
                  depends on the rigorous enforcement of the oath of supremacy."
               "And is not the forfeiture of property and perpetual imprisonment a sufficient
                  enforcement?" demanded the queen.
               Cecil dissented.
               "What, sir, will nothing satisfy thee but the gallows for all who refuse to
                  acknowledge us supreme in matters of faith?"
               "And is not your majesty head of the church?"
               "And yet a woman."
               "A woman, selected by Heaven to be the recipient and the agent of its power on
                  earth," subjoined Cecil.
               "Perhaps—perhaps it may be so," observed the queen, whilst a faint smile gave a
                  peculiar expression to her countenance. "But to be supreme, we should be
                  infallible, Sir William; and thou, who so stoutly deniest the infallibility of the
                  pope, canst not easily find a solid reason for according it to us."
               "Your majesty's words betoken doubts which——"
               "Are our own affairs," interrupted the queen, "and for which none shall hold us
                  accountable."
               "I humbly crave your gracious pardon," apologized the cautious statesman,
                  unwilling to irritate the queen, and yet anxious to press the matter to a final
                  settlement; "but the doubts your majesty hath expressed would ill serve the cause
                  of Protestantism, were they known to your majesty's subjects, and therefore I
                  sincerely grieve to hear your majesty so speak."
               "Enough, sir, enough; thou hast known our sentiments, on this same subject of
                  religion for many years, and more intimately than any other member of our council;
                  and it surpriseth us not a little to hear thee now express regret at doubts which
                  thou knowest, well to have long occupied our mind. Let us, then, once for all, be
                  understood. We shall endeavor all our might to defend and support the crown we
                  wear; and as the suppression of Catholicity, the extinction of Popish influence,
                  and the establishment of an
                  antagonistic religion (for the people must have some one) are the surest means of
                  securing that crown, we will devote ourself to the accomplishments of these
                  objects; but as to our private views of religion, we shall suffer no dictation,
                  and receive no instruction from any man, be he peer or peasant."
               "I am but your grace's humble servant," responded Cecil, in a tone of resignation
                  to her supreme will. "Yet I feel as if the withdrawal of this bill was the removal
                  of the strongest pillar from under your majesty's throne."
               "The pillars of our throne are exposed to more imminent danger, Mr. Secretary.
                  Mary Stuart and her allies may yet concentrate their strength, and pluck the crown
                  from our bastard brow. Ah, what thinkest thou, sir, oft that prospect?"
               "She is but the heir presumptive, my liege."
               "Ay, marry is she, and the heir apparent, since we have resolved to live and die a
                  virgin," replied the queen. "What, Man! tell us not of penal statutes against the
                  fautors of the pope. Thinkest thou men who look forward to a Catholic queen, or to
                  her issue, will not soon tire of the reigning Protestant sovereign? Mary Stuart
                  wields a power that may soon weaken the allegiance of our subjects, and eventually
                  demolish our throne. Look to her, sir; we must not suffer her issue
                  to be the young hope of England."
               "And yet your majesty hath but to consent to the wishes of your faithful lieges,
                  and thus preclude all possibility of a Catholic succession."
               "By marriage, meanest thou?"
               "Even so, your grace; thus will your majesty's throne be made secure, and your
                  power in a little time irresistible in Europe."
               "And whom wouldst thou have us marry, Sir William Cecil?"
               "My liege, there are at this moment no less than fourteen suitors for your
                  majesty's hand."
               "Ay, fourteen suitors for our throne, mayhap."
               "Sovereign princes always marry for issue, not always for love," responded Cecil,
                  casting his eyes respectfully on the floor.
               "Paugh!" ejaculated the queen; "the idea is disgusting."
               "It's not necessary either, madam, that your majesty marry one whom your majesty
                  hates for the good of the state. Love and policy may be combined."
               "Sir, our destiny is fixed, and we must endeavor to fulfil it. If God willeth we
                  should have issue, he will provide us with a husband, and no doubt impart us the
                  grace to honor and love him as becometh a wife. But for the present we know
                  nothing of what men call love, and we think, judging from the past, we never shall
                  experience the feeling. From our girlhood we ever felt an abhorrence of marriage.
                  Doubtless this antipathy was constitutional, and, mayhap, an ordination of
                  Providence; but, be it as it may, we shall always regard our vows of perpetual
                  virginity as obligatory on our poor conscience till Heaven shall ordain the
                  contrary."
               "O my sovereign queen and royal mistress!" said the secretary, falling upon his
                  knees, "retract these terrible words,
                  and destroy not thus forever the hopes of thy loving subjects!"
               "Rise, good secretary," said the queen, putting her handkerchief to her eyes,
                  "rise, and when thou meetest my people, tell them that the queen loves them well,
                  nay, would willingly shed her blood to secure their happiness, but that she loves
                  her virginity more. Elizabeth hath vowed her heart to Him she loves
                  best," and the queen raised her eyes towards heaven as she uttered the words.
               "Thou art more than woman," said Cecil, staring at the queen, and speaking as if
                  to himself. "Heaven hath made thee so, in order that thy greatness might be in
                  keeping with thy destiny."
               "And what an awful destiny it is, Sir William Cecil! We are surrounded by
                  difficulties on all quarters; Scotland on one side, Spain on the other, and our
                  own rebellious subjects every where ready to sacrifice us at the bidding of the
                  pope; and, what is harder to bear than all these together, the treachery and
                  duplicity of our professed friends. Yet," she added, bending her head meekly, "we
                  try to suffer with resignation, like Him whose image is ever here beside us, and
                  whose pure life we would make the model of our own."
               During this speech, in the enunciation of which the queen labored painfully, her
                  voice faltering more and more as she proceeded, Cecil, who could read her inmost
                  thoughts better than any other living man, gazed in her face, and doubted if he
                  were not still in ignorance of her true character. Even when she had concluded,
                  and let her head fall back against the chair, he sat stupefied at the language and
                  the tone she assumed in his presence. He was in reality ashamed of himself—ashamed
                  to think Elizabeth could estimate his penetration so lowly as to imagine she was
                  able to deceive him. He had often flattered her himself on the
                  excellence of her mind and heart; nay, even extolled her for virtues which she did
                  not possess. But it was in order to control her fitful temper, to mould her to his
                  wishes, and bend her to his will. Yet he did not imagine for a moment she thought
                  he had really formed so high an estimate of her perfections as he professed.
                  Sovereigns expect to be flattered and praised beyond their deserts, and in this
                  sense he supposed his language to be understood. But he now found he was
                  mistaken—— mistaken in the woman whom he had been indoctrinating in the mysteries
                  and intrigues of state policy almost from her very childhood.
               "My sovereign liege," said he at length, "will your majesty condescend to inform
                  me if I be included among the false friends to whom you have just alluded?"
               Elizabeth, whom direct questions always offended, promptly answered,—
               "Nay, good secretary, we will not be questioned beyond our pleasure. If we had
                  reason to believe thee unfaithful, we should crush thee as quickly as we do this
                  piece of paper on the floor. But tell us, Sir Minister," she added, with an irony
                  for which there was no apparent cause, "tell us how thou'st fared at Buxton. Hath
                  its waters cured thee of the gout, or
                  hath the lovely Queen of Scots furnished thee an antidote from her French
                  physics?"
               "I have not seen the lady your majesty speaks of," humbly replied Cecil.
               "No, nor hast flattered her, as whilom thou'st flattered us," pursued Elizabeth,
                  in one of her inexplicable fits of jealousy.
               "I do not understand your majesty."
               "Ah, marry thou don't? humph! Thinkest thou, Sir William, thy visits in the
                  neighborhood of Buxton have been so secret as to escape the vigilance of those who
                  long have envied thy elevation? Tut, tut, sir! shame—shame, that a married man
                  should ever make such shifts as thou hast made to catch a glance of a pretty
                  face."
               "Your majesty cannot credit the calumny," rejoined Cecil.
               "Ha, ha! mayhap thou thinkest us jealous!" said the queen, endeavoring to
                  laugh.
               "Nay, nay, my honored sovereign. I know full well my poor preferences have long
                  since become matters of indifference to your grace. But after the evidences your
                  majesty hath seen of my hostility to the Queen of Scots, if your majesty still
                  suppose me capable of being seduced by her pretty face, methinks it high time I
                  was dismissed your majesty's councils."
               "Thou shalt remain, Sir Minister, whilst it suits our pleasure. And when thou
                  leavest, take ye good heed thou leavest not the court for the Tower. We would now
                  be alone, sir."
               But the statesman would not be dismissed in such a humor. "May it please your
                  majesty," said he, rising and bending low before the vain and angry woman, "I am
                  ready to leave thy presence, and to die, the moment I shall be so
                  unfortunate as to lose the confidence of my gracious and royal mistress. Life can
                  afford me no enjoyment when I have lost the regards of so great and virtuous a
                  princess."
               "Ha, by my faith, well said, sir," replied Elizabeth, softened down in an instant,
                  and for the thousandth time, by the despondent tone and well-directed flattery of
                  her trusty counsellor. "Thou hast well learnt how to deprecate our displeasure by
                  thy honeyed words and false flatteries. But though we are not vain enough to
                  believe in half what thou averrest, yet we do not mean to dispense with thy
                  services so readily, either. The tortures we have endured for the last seven weeks
                  from this frail leg of ours hath almost driven us mad. So sit thee down, Sir
                  William, and tell us of this Sir Geoffrey Wentworth, of Brockton Hall."
               "He hath not been heard of, madam, since his escape from Sir Thomas Plimpton, but
                  probably is under cover somewhere in the city among the recusants."
               "And his daughter; what of her?"
               "She hath been seen last at the Peacock Tavern, in the village; but no one knows
                  whither she went."
               "What!" said Elizabeth, her eye again firing up as she spoke, "within arrow shot
                  of the court!"
               "So report hath it, my liege."
               "God's death!" she screamed aloud, carried away by the madness of jealousy, and dashing the
                  footstool from under her suffering limb. "She may be within the very walls of our
                  palace. How's this? Shall my Lord of Leicester presume on our indulgence so far as
                  to make our royal residence a sanctuary for bawds and traitors. Bring hither the
                  gartered minion"——But the passion was too powerful for her weakened frame. She
                  again sank back in her chair, and fainted.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               A few nights after the meeting of the courtier and Nell Gower, at Whinstone
                  Hollow, the landlord of the Whitehorse of Wimbleton was aroused from his sleep,
                  and finally from his arm chair, by a loud knocking at his front door. And we
                  mention the fact, not because Goodman Goodniff himself regarded a knock at his
                  door at midnight as at all unusual in those stirring times, much less suspect it
                  would yet form an important incident in the history of his life, but because it
                  was the first time in fifteen years he was known to answer a summons in person.
                  And because Dick Curry, the hostler, who was peremptorily ordered to bed again
                  when half way down the stairs, swore, next morning, that either his master was
                  bewitched, or something serious or extraordinary was about to happen. Thus the
                  event, trifling as it was, gave cause for gossip and surmise for a whole month
                  after, and Dick, whose measurement of time was by no means precise, regarded the
                  night as an era to date from, as historians and statesmen now regard the battle of
                  Waterloo, or the treaty of Vienna.
               "What ho, within there!" cried a voice at the door. "Oliver Goodniff! up, I say,
                  and admit thy customers."
               The innkeeper, who had been expecting a call,— for he had not retired to bed, but
                  sat dozing in his arm chair before the
                  kitchen fire,—heard the second blow of the traveller's horsewhip, and started to
                  his feet.
               "Goodniff ho, Goodniff!" again shouted the traveller, impatient for admittance.
                  "Am I to stand here all night on the threshold of a tavern, and almost in sight,
                  too, of our good queen's castle. Open, or by the rood I'll be tempted to break thy
                  door and thy cranium to boot."
               "Who knocks?" demanded the cautious innkeeper, selecting the proper key from a
                  bunch at his girdle. "Who art thou, friend, coming at this late hour to disturb
                  her majesty's peaceful and liegae subjects?"
               Again the knock was repeated.
               "Good faith," gruffly muttered Goodniff, as he turned the key in the lock, "thou
                  makest as much to do as if thou hadst been a queen's messenger."
               "Confound thee for a sleepy dolt!" shouted the stranger. "Hast got drunk last
                  night on thy ale barrels?"
               "Grace and patience, Master Southron; be not so wrathful, or folks will say thou
                  forget'st thyself."
               "How so, varlet?"
               "Ay, good sooth, varlet! marry come up with thee, Master Southron. I say again, if
                  thou makest such a pother at the hostelries of Middlesex as thou makest here,
                  where albeit thy coming was to be a secret, people will say——"
               "I wear a sword to slice the ears of lazy innkeepers."
               "Not so fast, friend; rather that thou art pretentious, and forgettest thou wert
                  thyself once a tapster at an inn."
               "Peace, knave, peace!" said Southron, placing a chair before the fire; "and now
                  get thee to the tap, and draw me a pint o' sack, and then see to my nag, that he
                  fares well at the meal tub.
               "Ha, that flagon," he resumed, as the innkeeper approached with the wine, "comes
                  to cheer the traveller's heart, like a blink o' the sun in January— give thee
                  health and grace, honest Goodniff."
               "Ay, ay, honest Goodniff forsooth! thy tone is changed somewhat of the
                  suddenest."
               "In vino veritas, master tapster, as Roger
                  Ascham said when Fairfax proclaimed the queen's divinity over a bumper of
                  Burgundy. But haste thee, haste thee, friend; don thy doublet and steppers, and
                  hie thee to the stable."
               Southron, by which name the innkeeper received the traveller, soon divested
                  himself of his cloak and boots, unbuckled his small sword, and sat down before the
                  cheerful fire, seemingly well pleased with his quarters. His appearance had in it
                  something remarkable. He was about forty years of age, middle height, but of a
                  thick-set, powerful frame. His shoulders were broad and square, and his limbs bent
                  outwards, indicating an extraordinary strength of muscle. His features were those
                  of a Yorkshire farmer, heavy and expressionless, but somewhat relieved by the
                  large mustache and long hair he wore after the fashion of the prelatists of the
                  day. These, together with his dark, bushy eyebrows, which he could raise or lower
                  at pleasure to an unusual extent, gave him a look of dogged severity.
               
               "And so, Master Oliver Goodniff, thou wert abed," said Southron to his host,
                  returning from the stable.
               "There thou mistakest, good sir; I was asleep in my chair, not in my bed; weary
                  travelling through London all day, I was fain to rest a while, my limbs not being
                  so active as when we once played bopeep together round the old church at Evesham;
                  and so I've overslept myself."
               "True, Oliver, thou wert then but a diminutive pint pot; but now, good sooth,
                  thou'rt a hogshead. Yet it likes me not to hear thee speak so glibly of Evesham
                  tales and pastimes as thou'rt wont to do," observed Southron tartly. "Thou
                  shouldst teach thy tongue better marnners, or it may make thee a greater fool than
                  thy friends take thee for."
               "Grace and patience!" ejaculated Goodniff— "thinkest thou, most circumspect keeper
                  of Ashley Park, that I have kept the Whitehorse of Wimbleton for nearly twenty
                  years, and not yet learnt to measure my speech, as I do my ale, to suit my
                  customers?"
               "I know not," replied Southron, "how thou pleasest thy customers; but I know thou
                  wouldst pleasure me more if Evesham was farther removed from the top o' thy
                  memory. Such things, being uppermost in thy ale-bloated pate, might escape thee,
                  like barm from thy barrels, when least expected."
               "Humph! grace and patience! that's delicate," said Oliver quietly.
               "For thine own sake, I say, beware thy tongue, or it may lose thee thy
                  windpipe."
               "Tut, tut," responded the persevering innkeeper, "there's no man living whose
                  treachery I fear; and for thyself, master, thou hast too much wit to risk thine
                  own breath for the stopping o' mine."
               "Ah," said Southron, looking up, "thou threatenest, dost thou?"
               "As thou pleasest, good sir."
               "So thou leanest on that staff, humph! But if a certain man thou wot'st of had
                  thee tucked up in a halter, to stop thy slippery tongue, where would be thy
                  remedy?"
               "As to remedy," responded Goodniff, "that would be as chance willed it; but
                  methinks I could find a way of requiting him for his pains."
               "As how?"
               "E'en by finding him an axe instead of a halter and gallows; the former being more
                  honorable, and best befitting his high deserts."
               "Goodniff, thou'rt in a serious-minded humor," observed Southron, suddenly
                  changing his tone, when he found his companion was not to be won by intimidation.
                  "I spoke but banteringly, man, and lo, thou'rt huffed in a minute, like a country
                  bumpkin."
               "I have just told thee," observed Oliver, sententiously, "that I measure my
                  speech, as I do my ale, to suit my customers."
               "Well, well, a truce with this foolery; I have other work on hands to-night, and
                  would fain ask thy counsel and aid, mayhap," said Southron, cautiously.
               "Humph! council and aid; well, let's hear o't."
               "And thou'lt promise?"
               
               "Nay, nay, I promise nothing but what's in limits of my soul's keeping,"
                  interrupted Goodniff; "if thy behest extend to the stopping o' breath, or maiming
                  o' horses, I tell thee right roundly, Master Southron, thou must carry thy
                  herrings to another market."
               "How now!" cried Southron, surprised at the gruff, serious tone of his companion;
                  "art smitten, and wouldst turn Calvinist?"
               "Not so, worshipful sir; I'm not knave enough to turn Calvinist; but to be plain
                  with thee for once, I had some misgivings of my past life, as far at least as
                  spent in thy honorable company, and would see to it in time; when Death comes, he
                  gives but short time to settle the reckoning."
               "And so thou wouldst mend thy life by turning beadsman or Calvinist," laughed his
                  companion; it verily, honest Goodniff, thou'rt too fat for a psalm singer, and too
                  lazy for a beadsman."
               "Natheless," promptly replied the innkeeper, "a fat psalm singer or a lazy
                  beadsman is nearer heaven, I trow, than the gulltrop of Master Southron of
                  Evesham."
               "True, and then thou mightst turn up a saint, and thy tap room a shrine, where thy
                  adorers would honor thy memory in dagger ale and huffcap. Think on't, think on't
                  most virtuous dealer in lambswool and rosemary; more marvellous things have
                  happened."
               "True again, most facetious Master Southron, for doubtless thou'st heard the
                  queen's majesty hath resolved to live and die a virgin."
               "Ay, marry have I; and what seest thou so wonderful in that?"
               "Nothing beyond credence, since thou persuadest me I may be a saint. Verily, the
                  reformation, as great folks call it, is but a child's gimcrack, after all the
                  pother it's making. Soul o' my body, I once thought it little less than a miracle;
                  but now, since— ha, ha! grace and patience!" added Oliver, chuckling as the
                  thought tickled his fancy.
               "Since what, man?" urged Southron.
               "Why, if Queen Bess is to live and die a virgin, and Oliver Goodniff turn out a
                  saint, the reformation, compared with it, is but a soap bubble, after all. Look
                  there; seest thou that picture anent thee on the wall, with the long face and
                  single white feather? It's Sir Thomas Seymour's." And Goodniff laughed at the
                  recollections it inspired.
               "What meanest thou by that, impudent varlet? Wouldst slander the queen's majesty?"
                  demanded Southron, turning on his chair, and searching for the handle of his
                  dagger.
               But Goodniff busied himself to mend the fire, and affected not to hear the
                  question, nor to notice the threat. After a minute's silence, he resumed,—
               "As to my saintship, there thou mistakest again, Master Southron, and art wrong in
                  the premises; the new religion can furnish no saints, and therefore——"
               "And therefore," interrupted Southron, "though thou canst not be a saint de jure, yet thou mayst de
                     facto. So keep heart o' grace, man, cut short thy hair, learn to turn
                  up the whites o' thine eyes, eat garlic, reduce thy flesh, attend the prayer
                  meetings, of the God-fearing and well-beloved Master Taresoul, and thou'lt bid
                  fair for a saintship."
               
               "Grace and patience! Master Southron, the sack hath warmed the cockles o' thy
                  heart, even to make thee witty—a quality for which thou wast never very remarkable
                  in thy youth; ha, ha!"
               "Thou mayst yet be a saint, I repeat, man; hold thy peace, and consider on't."
               "Faith, sir, I fear me," replied Oliver, leering at his guest—"I fear me my
                  saintship would turn out from the hands of Master Taresoul what folks say the new
                  religion did from the hands of its craftsmen."
               "Ha! and that was——"
               "A very crude production. Ha, ha! grace and patience!"
               "Well, well, enough of this; and now for thy gossip. How go on affairs at Hampton
                  Court?"
               "Indifferently well."
               "And the queen?"
               "The queen still aileth, yet is declared out of danger."
               "Hast heard within the week?"
               "As late as yesterday, Master Crimp; her majesty's messenger, on his way to
                  Liston, alighted to quaff a stoup o' Canary, and averred she was yet ailing, but
                  out of danger. Folks say the mediciner is right cunning in his art, and rises high
                  in favor."
               "Heaven save her majesty, I say, friend Oliver,— and that's a loyal wish,—and long
                  may she reign over us, as she doth right royally; but I tell thee, Goodniff, it
                  likes me not to hear of strange doctors, with outlandish names, come over here to
                  take the life o' the queen, as 'twere, out o' the safe keeping of her majesty's
                  own peaceful and liege subjects."
               "A foreigner, saidst thou, Master Southron? grace and patience! a foreigner!"
               "Ay, good sooth, is he; and there are some who suspect him to have cast the
                  horoscope of Elizabeth for that most astute and cunning woman—that Amalekite, as
                  Taresoul would call her, Catharine de Medicis, before his head rested once on his
                  pillow at Hampton."
               "Hast heard so, and from what source?" inquired Goodniff, again mending the
                  fire.
               "I say report hath it so."
               "What, man! report's no authority. I wonder much a man o' thy high pretensions and
                  marvellous wisdom would believe the breath o' report in such stirring times. Who
                  hath ever heard that report hung a man on the gallows, or made a virgin of a
                  queen, unless there was reason for't aforegone? I therefore ask thee once more,
                  what cause exists for this suspicion?"
               "I have already told thee, numskull," replied Southron; "dost not believe it?"
               "If such report passeth my credence, another don't," observed Goodniff.
               "And what is that, I pray thee, most incredulous innkeeper?"
               "That her majesty's own lawful physician hath been dismissed her service in
                  disgrace, some five weeks gone."
               "Ha! sayest thou so? and how camest thou by this knowledge?" demanded Southron,
                  desirous of knowing how far his host had penetrated into the secrets of the
                  palace.
               
               "Why, dost forget that I sell wine to noble customers who honor my poor hostelrie?
                  and though the law bath forbidden more than five yards of cloth for hose and
                  doublet for linkboy or apprentice, in the good city of London, yet it hath no
                  statute for plugging innkeepers' ears, against state gossip."
               "My Lord of Leicester is a noble gentleman and a good," quietly observed Southron;
                  "and if he brought over this new mediciner from Ostend, he hath been well assured
                  of his skill in the healing art."
               "My lord is indeed most loyal in his devoirs to her majesty," added Goodniff; "so
                  much so that the lady in waiting, the Countess of Harrington, hath thought proper
                  to prohibit his presence in the antechamber, lest his health suffer from
                  overmatch."
               "And who's thy informant, honest Goodniff?" carelessly inquired Southron.
               "It matters not," replied the innkeeper; "if I find thou deservest confidence, I
                  may tell thee, mayhap."
               "Dost doubt my honesty, school-fellow?"
               "Nay, good friend; but thou gavest me such reason just now for guarding my
                  slippery tongue, that I am fain to profit by it once in my life."
               "Hoot, man, thy reason is flat. Say thou mistrustest me, and I'll understand thee
                  better."
               "Mistrust is safer than confidence," responded the innkeeper, smiling provokingly,
                  and thrusting his hands into the pockets of his doublet. "I've seen many a tongue
                  stopped at Tyburn for speaking, but not one for holding its peace."
               Southron rose suddenly from his chair, his face flushed with anger.
               "Hast forgotten, Goodniff, thou'rt but living on sufferance?" he demanded, hissing
                  out the syllables, and fixing on his companion a look of stern severity. "Out upon
                  thee for a dunghill, a Papist, a hogshead, a cozening varlet; thy impudence is
                  marvellously great to speak me thus, when thou knowest a breath of my lungs would
                  hang thee on thine own sign post. But thou canst not cozen me, Oliver Goodniff;
                  thou'rt itching this half hour to tell what thou wouldst fain have a secret, and
                  natheless, if broken, would prove but a blind nut, not worth the cracking. But
                  enough of this now; keep thy secret, if any thou hast, and mayhap, when we return,
                  I may bring Nell Gower, the spaewife, with me to unravel it."
               "Return!" repeated Goodniff, with affected surprise.
               "Ay, did I not say return?—return or come back again—it siganifieth reversion.
                  Hast forgot thy learning, too? We go to Hampton Court, or thereabouts, to-night,
                  and return against daybreak."
               "Heigh ho! Hampton Court, forsooth!"
               "Dost know Nell Gower of that neighborhood?"
               "The Scotch spaewife?"
               "Ay, the same."
               "Gadzooks, man, thou art mad. The sack hath made away with thy brains. To Hampton
                  at this hour! Grace and patience! and what bringeth thee to Hampton Court, Master
                  Southron? Dost forget there be arquebuses on gate, and tower, and keep, enough to
                  garrison the whole city of London?"
               "I said 'Hampton or thereabouts,' and there be many places for three miles round the palace
                  besides the court. So I ask thee again, knowest thou where liveth Nell Gower, the
                  Scotch spaewife?"
               "What is thy business, friend, with Nell Gower at this time o' night?" demanded
                  Goodniff evasively.
               "Much that concerns me and others."
               "And didst come hither to inquire her residence?"
               "Ay, marry have I."
               "Then thou'lt find her either at Whinstone Hollow, or meet her riding on a rush
                  blade between Hampton and Whitehall," replied Goodniff.
               "And as I know not where lies Whinstone Hollow, thou'lt accompany me thither. So
                  get thee again to the tap, and draw me another flagon, that we may keep courage
                  within and cold without; for our duties may require steady hands and light hearts
                  e'er the sun doffs his nightcap on the morrow; haste thee, friend; the night wears
                  apace; get thee to the tap."
               "As I live by my honesty, Master Southron," said the fat innkeeper, "thou makest
                  as little ado of my going to Hampton as if I were but a boy, fit only to run
                  errands for a grocer in Cheapside." And whilst the speaker appeared deeply
                  offended at his companion's contemptuous tone, a close observer might easily
                  detect something like a desire on his part to visit the palace,
                  notwithstanding.
               Goodniff saw that something was about to happen of rare importance, in which he
                  was expected to take a part; but what it was he could not for a moment imagine. He
                  reflected that, whatever it might be, it should be accomplished in the night, and,
                  therefore, a secret; and again, being about Hampton Court, it was likely to be
                  some affair of moment. It was clear to him, also, that he was not of Southron's
                  selection, for that gentleman of late days had taken pains to avoid his company as
                  much as possible; he concluded, therefore, that the very equivocal message left at
                  the Whitehorse on the previous morning by Whitret Macbairn, during his absence in
                  London, namely, —"Be cautious and prudent, or thy fortune will be as cogglesome as
                  the pillion on which thou must mount,"—referred immediately to his cooperation in
                  the business which Southron had in hands, and in which, he doubted not, Nell Gower
                  had connected him in some way. These reflections passed rapidly through his mind,
                  and caused him to feel rather uneasy at the undefined prospect before him.
               "Heth!" he continued, after a moment's interruption, during which he stood before
                  the fire twirling his thumbs in a maze of conjectures, whilst his companion
                  emptied the wine flask—"heth! here I am ordered out o' my house at midnight,
                  without a why or a wherefore. Gadzooks! friend of mine, lets hear at least the
                  errand."
               "That's to be learnt, master innkeeper; so content thee, and the sooner we reach
                  Whinstone Hollow, the sooner wilt thou know the secret, if so be thou'rt not
                  spitted for thy inquisitiveness e'er the time come. Ha, ha! what a belly that is
                  to oil a rapier in!" he added, tapping honest Goodniff on the paunch with the but
                  of his riding whip.
               "True," persisted the innkeeper, determined not to abandon himself entirely to the guidance of his
                  companion without another trial; "but why in Death's name hast chosen me for thy
                  helpmate, seeing the encumbrance thou mockest at may retard our progress. Methinks
                  thou might have chosen one o' lighter limb than Oliver Goodniff."
               "Hark thee, man," replied Southron, taking Oliver's whisker between his finger and
                  thumb, and pronouncing his words with a peculiar intonation, "there may be men
                  more active to use their legs and arms in times like these, when the word is, who
                  can ruffle it best, I grant; but there are few who can find prettier reasons for
                  keeping quiet tongues in their heads than thou, friend Oliver, in my employment.
                  Factions and clans have so bought up other's secrets now, that close tongues are
                  nearly as scarce as masses. No, no, Oliver, I mean not to put thy prowess to the
                  task, but I've selected thee as one who will hardly venture to deceive Robert
                  Southron, and who knows more of the Scotch spaewife I'm in search of, if report
                  speak true, than his neighbors. But, friend Oliver, I still grieve to find thy
                  memory of that affair so fresh."
               "As fresh as when it happened twenty years ago; and i' faith, the stars hid their
                  faces that night just as they do now when thou flung it among the tombstones."
               "Hush, thou dolt!" ejaculated Southron, looking stealthily round the kitchen, as
                  if he were afraid of eavesdroppers; "ay——"
               "Ay, something like this night, if my memory slip me not."
               "And—let me see—that's just twenty years ago to the hour."
               "Well, and what seest strange in that, Oliver?"
               "Strange! Why, dost forget, man, the madrigal the weird woman sang thee that night
                  at Evesham? It ran thus:— 
                     
                        "It twenty years more thou'lt be just twoscore;
                        There's a secret that night to be told
                        That will wake thee or ward thee,
                        For a queen will reward thee
                        With a collar of hemp or gold."
                     
                  
               
               "Enough, Master Goodniff; a truce with this folly," ejaculated Southron,
                  impatiently handing the empty flagon to the innkeeper. "And now move thy legs
                  quickly, or I'll smarten them. Get thee to the stable, and then to the road."
               "On a knave or a fool's errand," muttered Goodniff, waddling off.
               "Thou'lt make it so by thy going, doubtless."
               "A snare to inveigle us to our ruin."
               "Out upon thee for a craven," replied Southron, "thou chicken-hearted capon! Who
                  cares for thy ruin? Art thou of such importance in the state, that men should plot
                  thy destruction?"
               "And how am I to accompany thee, worshipful sir?" demanded Goodniff, turning on
                  his step, and pursing up his lips with an air of importance; "thou shouldst know I
                  keep no horses for my pleasure."
               "And therefore thou shalt ride on the pillion behind me."
               "On the pillion!" repeated the burly innkeeper, with affected surprise at the proposal; "no, no,
                  good sir; my neck is yet o' some value to myself, though it may not be worth a
                  Scotch bodle to thee; and therefore I'll none of thy pillion. If thou broughtest a
                  pillion here all the way from Evesham, to perch Oliver Goodniff thereon, and pink
                  him to Hampton, thou mistakest me confoundedly."
               "Goodniff, thou needest not speak so loud," calmly observed Southron, when his
                  companion had exhausted his breath by the unusual length of the sentence; "I have
                  already said," he continued, fixing his keen eye on Goodniff, "thou shalt
                  accompany me; and thou shalt."
               "Shall!" repeated Goodniff; "ay, forsooth, shall! Grace and patience! thou
                  regardest me but as a makeweight at the Gloster races, a man of two hundred and
                  forty——"
               "Mind not the weight," interrupted his companion; "my horse is strong, and will
                  carry thee as safely as her majesty's new state coach."
               Oliver at length suffered himself to be prevailed on, partly by entreaty and
                  partly by menace, the latter of which seemed the more effectual, to consent to the
                  perilous enterprise.
               Seated high on a pillion of unshaven calfskin, his heels tightening on the horse's
                  flank as his pace quickened, and his right arm wound round his companion in a
                  loving embrace, Goodniff was borne rapidly on towards Hampton.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               WHEN Southron and his companion reached the few scattering houses which then
                  formed the village of Hampton, they were not surprised to see lights in the
                  windows of the inns, and horses here and there, hooked to the trees and door
                  posts; for in those days, inns and taverns, night and day, resounded to the roar
                  of ribald song and drunken clamor. The immigrants and wandering soldiers from the
                  Netherlands had introduced their customs of nightly revelry and drunken debauch
                  among the English. Footmen and messengers, occupied during the day in attendance
                  on their masters, devoted the night to their own special pleasures, and spent it
                  in the drinking booths that surrounded the court, in uproar and carousal. During
                  these revelries, many were the disputes that arose among the lackeys and followers
                  of rival parties, each endeavoring to uphold the credit of his employer, often
                  ending in loss of life and limb, and not unfrequently giving rise to feuds and
                  quarrels, that involved the nobility themselves in interminable lawsuits. If this
                  could be said of inns and taverns generally in and round the city of London, it
                  was doubly true of those in the vicinity of the court. There not only the
                  innkeeper found a driving trade and a bustling employment, but the tailors and the
                  hairdressers might be seen, busy through all hours of the night, fitting out the newly-arrived squire or
                  country gentleman for the court visit of the next morning.
               "Get thee down, Oliver," said Southron, reining in his horse; "we shall see if
                  Matthew Linkwater still keeps the sack butts he boasted so much of last
                  Shrovetide. I'll deposit thee here, on this mounting stone, where the descent is
                  trifling. So down with thee, and stretch thy limbs."
               Oliver, disengaging his feet from the pillion strap, slid down the horse's side,
                  as directed, but unfortunately alighted on the outer edge of the flag, instead of
                  the middle, causing it to upset and throw him back under the horse. The mettlesome
                  animal, startled by the falling of Goodniff's bulky form against his feet, broke
                  off at full gallop, and ran for some distance beyond the village before Southron
                  could rein him in.
               In the mean time, Goodniff, imagining the horse had trampled him to death, lay on
                  his back, sprawling and kicking, like a capsized frog, and groaning piteously for
                  help. He had not been long, however, in that position, when two men ran from a
                  barber's shop, on the opposite side of the street, and assisting him to rise,
                  conveyed him thither, to have his wounds and bruises examined.
               Whilst the barber was in the act of applying some healing balsam to a slight
                  scratch on the back of Oliver's head, Southron had returned, and giving his horse
                  to a groom, entered the shop.
               He saw at once, in the smirks and gestures of the barber, an evidence of
                  Goodniff's safety, if indeed he could have any doubt regarding it.
               "What, man," said he, approaching and striking him between the shoulders with his
                  open hand, as if to rouse him from his lethargy, "art dying, that thou lookest so
                  pale?"
               "The pillion—the pillion!" muttered Goodniff, in great distress. "I told thee
                  'twould be so."
               "But thy wound's not deeper than a brier scratch; pshaw! a man like thee, so
                  lion-hearted of old, to he thus slanderous of thyself. Dost feel pain?"
               "Pain enough," responded Goodniff; "the fall hath skaken me into a mass."
               "Thou wert that already, methinks," said the barber, corking up his balsam bottle,
                  and turning to the customer he had quitted.
               "Then the Lord Arundel is not at court?" observed the person seated in the
                  barber's arm chair, with a white napkin spread round his neck, and his long, weavy
                  hair thrown back over his shoulders.
               "He left London yesterday," replied the well-informed barber, "with a single
                  retainer, and was met by Secretary Jones riding posthaste in the direction of
                  Dover."
               "Art sure of that?"
               "Positive; the honorable secretary's confidential servant hath informed me. I tell
                  thee so, most gracious sir, for I know thou'rt a gentleman, and to gentles and
                  squires of noble birth alone do I ever open my lips on state affairs."
               "I see thou'rt wondrous prudent, friend; but what reason hast thou for thinking
                  the earl's departure an affair of moment?"
               "Pardon me, gracious sir, but I have been so long in the company of noble lords, and, I might take
                  grace and say, kings and princes, both in their palaces and in my own humble
                  abode, that I have learnt to value, not only so overt an act as the departure of
                  the Earl of Arundel for France, at such a time when the Duke of Anjou hath
                  proposed for the hand of our good queen, but even the most trifling expression,
                  nay, a nod of their noble heads, as having something in it beyond vulgar
                  sight."
               "Hast heard of the queen's health this morning?"
               "Not yet, not yet, worshipful sir. Secretary Jones has but just arrived; when his
                  servants come on the morrow to have their hair dressed, we shall know more. What
                  shade did you say, sir?—dark red?"
               "As you please," replied the stranger; "I have no choice."
               "Yes, dark red," pursued the barber, holding a bottle between him and the light;
                  "dark red becometh gentlemen best, as my friend Sir Walter Raleigh observed, when
                  I last had the honor of dressing his hair; it's much affected by her majesty, he
                  saith, and very fashionable at court. This hair dye, honorable sir, I've obtained
                  at great expense, from an herb very rare, and to be found only in the Highlands of
                  Scotland, and given me by a servant of the late Lord Arran. Now, sir," he added,
                  as he applied the liquid, "thy hair shall be as glossy as flax, and when it
                  reddens with this powerful extract, her majesty will doubtless be kind and
                  gracious to the handsome and gallant wearer."
               "Her majesty's life, is no longer in danger then?" observed the stranger, heedless
                  of the compliment.
               "So report saith; yet none are permitted sight or speech of her majesty, save her
                  lady in waiting and physician."
               "Not even my Lord of Leicester?" said the stranger, with a smile; "methought he
                  was a standing exception."
               "I know not, worshipful sir," replied the barber, prudently preserving the same
                  undertone he had assumed. "I know not how he fares at Hampton; tongues there are
                  not so long as they were at Whitehall. As for the Lord Robert, he is right
                  bountiful and right honorable, and far be it from me to speak him ill."
               "So thou'rt of a mind, therefore, with her majesty the queen," observed the
                  stranger, as he rose from the chair and prepared to leave.
               "I shall ever feel honored in thinking like her majesty, worshipful sir," replied
                  the barber, bowing to his customer, as the latter deposited a small piece of gold
                  in his palm.
               "And if her gracious majesty doth favor to my Lord Dudley," broke in Southron, who
                  had been listening attentively to the foregoing conversation, unobserved by the
                  speakers, "who so bold as to gainsay his merit?"
               "And who art thou, sirrah, that presumeth thus to meddle in such matters?"
                  demanded the stranger, now drawn up to his full height, and turning his head round
                  to look at Southron, with scorn and contempt marked on his handsome countenance;
                  "things have come to a pretty pass when the queen of England is beholden to such
                  defenders;" and the speaker, picking
                  ing up a Scotch bonnet from the table, placed it on his head.
               "Thou hast demanded who I am," responded Southron, "and I tell thee I am one who
                  suffers no Scotch churl to speak slightingly of my noble Lord of Leicester
                  unrequited."
               "Ah! a puissant champion of the court favorite," retorted Rodger O'Brien, for the
                  speaker was no other, "and prepared, doubtless, to clear the noble earl of the
                  stain of attainture for endeavoring to remove the queen from the succession. His
                  newly-born loyalty, I doubt not, hath grown up in the smile of his sovereign, and
                  will die in her frown."
               "Plague upon thee for a coxcomb," shouted Southron, laying his hand on the hilt of
                  his sword; "thy insolence is beyond bearing; be ye noble, or be ye henchman, I'm
                  half inclined to chastise thee for thy foul words."
               Southron's powerful voice, now raised in angry recrimination, attracted half a
                  score of idlers from the neighboring tavern, who, learning the cause of the
                  dispute, joined in with him, and loudly demanded who dared asperse the fame of the
                  noble and gallant Lord Leicester.
               "Back, minions!" cried O'Brien, in a voice that made itself heard and feared; "
                  away to your ale barrels; I seek no quarrel with this fellow;" and he strode out
                  of the shop, the new comers making way for him as he passed.
               "Know you that man, honest barber?" inquired Goodniff, who had till now remained a
                  silent spectator.
               "Never saw him before, worthy sir: howsomever, he guerdoned me well for future
                  services, and must, from his high bearing, be of gentle birth."
               "Goes he to court on the morrow?"
               "Ay does he; I have just dyed his hair for a court visit."
               "But he cannot see her grace—she's confined to her chamber."
               "Well, good sir, he will be likely to learn that when he reaches the palace."
               Southron, actuated by some new thought, buckled his sword and belt tighter round
                  his waist, passed quickly through the shop, and was about to hurry down the
                  street, probably in pursuit of the stranger, in order to provoke a quarrel, when
                  all of a sudden he felt the skirt of his cloak plucked from behind, and, turning,
                  beheld Whitret Macbairn at his side.
               "What, in the fiend's name, art thou, or what dost want with me?" demanded
                  Southron, vexed at the interruption, and surprised at the sudden appearance of the
                  dwarf.
               Whitret placed his finger on his lips.
               "Speak, or, by the rood, I'll open thy lips with the point of my dagger."
               The dwarf shook his head.
               "Thou liest, thou elf of Beelzebub; thou canst speak if thou wilt."
               Whitret opened his mouth, pointed to his tongue, and then motioned Southron to
                  follow. The latter, expecting an immediate revelation of some mystery, no longer
                  hesitated, but followed his guide in silence. They passed some distance beyond the
                  village, and then entered a wood so
                  dark and dismal that Southron began to feel some misgivings of his safety in such
                  a place and with such a conductor. The moon having set for some time, the farther
                  he proceeded the more the darkness increased, till at length he was obliged to
                  take the hand of Whitret Macbairn between the tips of his fingers; so low was the
                  creature that he hardly reached his knees. At length, they stopped at what
                  Southron supposed to be a hut; for he felt the mud walls with his hands. Here the
                  dwarf whistled low and stealthily; and immediately a door opened, and a tall man,
                  wrapped closely in a dark cloak, and wearing a broad-brimmed hat pressed down over
                  his forehead, stepped out into the darkness. The richly-laced cloak, of unusual
                  length and of French pattern, bespoke the wearer a gentleman of rank. He stood,
                  however, with his back to the dim light of the doorway, so that Southron could not
                  see his face.
               "Art thou Robert Southron, of Evesham." demanded the stranger.
               "I am," was the concise answer.
               "Didst receive instructions from Ashley, of Ashley Park, and art come hither in
                  consequence?"
               "I am here to execute the orders of a noble of the court, who should meet me at
                  Whinstone Hollow, near the place frequented by Nell Gower, the Scotch
                  spaewife."
               "Hast thou a companion, and canst trust him?"
               Southron replied in the affirmative.
               "A second was more than I stipulated for; why didst bring him without directions
                  to that effect?"
               "Because I knew not the way to Whinstone Hollow, and wanted a guide."
               "Where hast thou parted with him?"
               "At the barber's shop in the village."
               "Where thou wert about to embroil thyself with a gallant of the court."
               "He spoke irreverently of the noble Earl of Leicester, and of her majesty the
                  queen, and therefore deserved a whipping by the town beadle," replied Southron
                  confidently.
               "Dost know the Earl of Leicester?" inquired the unknown.
               "I have seen him once, but might not recognize him now."
               "Art ready to execute my orders?"
               "When I know who gives them, perchance I may."
               "That thou shalt never know."
               "Then I shall not execute them," replied Southron resolutely, as if he had no
                  suspicion of the person whom he addressed.
               "I'm directed by the Earl of Leicester to command thee execute my orders under
                  penalty of his displeasure."
               "Ah, the Earl of Leicester! If my devoir be of service to his lordship," said
                  Southron, suddenly softening his tone,"I am ready to receive his commands from
                  himself or substitute."
               "If thou dost fail, thy life will pay the forfeit; didst reflect on that
                  possibility?"
               "As for life," responded Southron, "I never expected it would last long; and
                  should it end now, why, I shall not be
                  dissappointed besides, no doubt it will be lost in honorable service."
               "I like thy manner of speech," observed the unknown, "and if thy intentions accord
                  with it, thou'lt suit any purpose marvellously well."
               "And that purpose is one that likes the night better than the day, if I can judge
                  by the circumstances," subjoined Southron.
               "Nay, if thou thinkest to be employed in a deed of darkness, good fellow, thou art
                  much mistaken; no darkness shall accompany the deed but the darkness of the
                  night."
               "And if so, why not intrust me with thy name?"
               "Well," replied the unknown, "I might say because it so pleaseth me, and that
                  should satisfy thee; or I might say my name hath nothing to do with the business
                  in hand; or I might tell thee it would be unsafe ever again to recognize me: which
                  of the three will content thee?"
               "Neither," responded Southron.
               "And what shall content thee?"
               "Thy name, to give me confidence; men don't risk their necks in such employment as
                  thine promises to be, without a reason."
               "Listen, then," said the stranger. "I shall give thee two reasons why thoul't do
                  my bidding and yet discover not my name. The first is, that if thou refusest to
                  comply with my orders, or fail to accomplish them, I'll make thee shorter by the
                  head before the sun sets tomorrow; the second, that if thou consentest thy guerdon
                  shall be of more value to thee than my name."
               "Both reasons are solid," replied Southron, "could they be realized."
               "Doubt you my power or my purse, fellow?— which?"
               "Say I doubt both, good sir, what follows?"
               "Proof," replied the stranger; "here, clutch this;"— and he flung him a
                  well-filled purse;—"what thinkest thou now?"
               "Good," replied Southron, jingling the precious metal it contained; "it's certie a
                  weighty reason."
               "And now for the power—see!" and the unknown threw back his cloak, and pointed to
                  the breast of his doublet, which shone brilliantly in the uncertain light.
               Southron touched his Milan bonnet, and bowed obsequiously.
               "Proof beyond question, most noble sir. I await thy orders."
               "Follow me, then," commanded the stranger, "and be silent."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               A FEW days after the rescue, Alice Wentworth and Nell Gower ventured out from the
                  dark recesses of Whinstone Hollow, for it was to that wild and desolate retreat
                  Rodger O'Brien at length succeeded in conveying the young girl. They crept forth
                  from their hiding-place, to steal a glance at the green earth and the smiling
                  heavens. Alice, accustomed from her childhood to roam as free as air through the
                  groves and meadows of Brockton, to pull the wild flowers on the hillsides, and
                  chase the rabbits through the glens, could ill brook so dark and dismal a prison.
                  And short as was the period of her confinement, it wrought a visible change in her
                  appearance. The rosy blush of health, that mantled on her cheeks but a few days
                  ago, had disappeared, and the flash of her dark, lustrous eye was dimmed by her
                  tears. Her hair, too, was neglected, and fell over her shoulders in disordered
                  tresses. No wonder; she had done little else, since she was carried there, but
                  kneel before the little altar, weep and pray for her father, and then sit down
                  exhausted, to seek solace in the caresses of her old friend. Often did Nell
                  contemplate her there in silence, with her rosary and crucifix hanging
                  unconsciously from her fingers, and her head resting on her hands, musing over the
                  fate of her father. And oft did the old woman's eye light up again with the
                  indignant fire of former years, as she looked at her sinking form, and thought of
                  the authors of her sorrows.
               They had stolen out, and ascended the green bank above the entrance of the cavern
                  by an easy foot-path, Nell preceding her fair companion, and carrying something
                  carefully wrapped under the folds of her gray cloak.
               It was a delightful summer evening; every thing around them seemed happy and
                  joyous under the rays of the sun, now sinking behind the tall trees that breasted
                  the forest. The birds were singing their last evening carol, and bidding adieu to
                  the bright orb under whose beams they hopped and sung so cheerily through the long
                  day. Whitret Macbairn, too, seemed to participate in the pleasures which nature so
                  abundantly furnished, and quitting the little foot path, jumped from rock to rock,
                  amid the holly bushes and dwarf hazel that grew on the face of the precipice,
                  plucking the stray flowers that hung within his reach.
               "Nell," said Alice, turning her tearful eyes up to the face of the old woman, as
                  they both sat down on the greensward—"Nell, I can stay no longer in this dreary
                  place; I will go see the queen on the morrow, even should I go alone."
               "Gang alane! hoot, lassie, ye mauna think o' sic a thing. It's no in the woods o'
                  Brockton yer noo, ye ken; na, na; guid gracious! ye cudna di that, bairn; be aboot
                  us, gang alane! did ony body e'er hear the like?"
               "I dreamed last night my father was dead, Nell, and that his spirit came to
                  upbraid me for deserting him."
               
               "Dinna fash yersel, lassie, about desertin him; ye cudna help it; better leave
                  fayther and mither, an a' the hale warld, than fa' in the fangs o' Sir Thomas
                  Plimpton."
               "Could I but see him once more, Nell, just to clasp him again in my arms, and
                  receive his blessing, and feel his old, withered hands on my head, I would be
                  satisfied to bear all the misfortunes fate could crowd upon me."
               "Weel, weel; dinna ye greet, dinna ye greet, bairn, an tak courage; there's ane
                  awa in search o' Sir Geoffrey, that ne'er returned without his erran'."
               "Whither could he have gone, Nell, after leaving Glastonbury? The man thou callest
                  the gaberbunzie, who sent the message by Whitret, saw him last, wandering through
                  the ruins and searching for something he had lost. What could it be, Nell?"
               "Ou, his bit pictures and beuks, I'll warrint; puir daft body, he's amaist as
                  muckle a bairn now as e'er he was. But dinna fret, Alice; yer trials maun soon be
                  ower, an then we'll gang, Sir Geoffrey an a', to Holyrood. Why, woman, jist think
                  o' that—to be daffin wi' our bonnie queen an a' the guid hearts at Holyrood. An
                  then what care we for a' the warld else? Let Elizabeth tak yer lands if she will,
                  an bestow them on her minions—let her burn an rack a' the sacred things that aince
                  gied her kingdom a fair name an a saintly character—blot out the Henrys, the
                  Richards and the Edwards, no to speak o' the Alfred's an mony mair, frae the
                  history o' the nation, an then mak a new dynasty, wi' Henry VIII. for its head,
                  and the royal arms quartering a Bible on the ain side, and a Venus on the
                  tither—lechery an bastardy an Arianism, supportin the word o' God on their
                  shoulders, hegh, sirs." Here Nell's rhapsody was interrupted by a tiny scream from
                  under her cloak. "Ay, an there's mare o't," she muttered, uncovering the babe, and
                  laying it down on the warm green grass beside her. "It's head's as red as her ain;
                  puir thing! little it kens wha' trouble it's makin, and may yet mak in the warld.
                  See the black mole ahint its lug, aboot the size o' the puirtith pieces she gies
                  hersel to the beggar bodies, whan she gaes boatin off Whitehall Stairs."
               "Whom mean ye, Nell?" said Alice, looking up. "Ah! but I forgot I must ask thee no
                  questions respecting the child."
               Whilst this conversation was passing, Whitret Macbairn, after gathering what he
                  sought among the bushes, came climbing up the precipice, unobserved by the
                  speakers, swinging by the branches of the stunted copse from rock to rock; now
                  disappearing in the deep fissures, and again suddenly emerging, till he reached
                  the summit. Alice lay on the grass, leaning on her arm, and looking at the babe.
                  Whitret crept along noiselessly as a snake, till within a few feet of the young
                  girl, and there he stopped—his head almost invisible amongst the brushwood—and
                  gazed at her so intensely that his whole soul seemed to shoot from his eyes. He
                  had lain thus some ten or twelve minutes, when the bouquet of wild flowers he had
                  gathered fell from his unconscious hand. The slight noise it made attracted the
                  attention of Alice, who, turning her head, beheld two large, fiery orbs peering out from behind the fern,
                  and fixed upon her with so greedy a stare that she screamed and started.
               Whitret immediately rose, and picking up the flowers, approached Alice, and
                  presented them with a low reverence, kissing her hand as she held it out to
                  receive the offering.
               "What gard ye jump, lassie?" inquired Nell Gower, looking round for the cause of
                  the fright.
               "Nothing," replied Alice, trembling like a frightened fawn; "nothing but Whitret
                  here, whose eyes I just detected gazing at me with so fixed a stare through the
                  twigs and fern, that I took him for a——"
               "A tiger or a basilisk, eh?"
               "Ay, good sooth, his stare startled me—it seemed almost to eat me up."
               "God be aboot us," muttered Nell, speaking to herself as her eye followed Whitret.
                  "It's the curse o' his race; the sins o' the parents are to be visited on the
                  children, to the fourth generation."
               "Once before," pursued Alice, "I caught his eyes fixed upon me whilst telling my
                  beads at the altar, and he perplexed me so that I was obliged to interrupt my
                  devotions."
               "Humph! ay, that's mair o't—the chapel or the cloister, or the—ou' it's a' the
                  same; look at that," continued Nell, pointing to the dwarf, who had sat down on
                  the grass and taken the babe in his arms. "He little kens whose child he fondles;
                  weel, weel, the deil 'ill hae his ain yit."
               "Poor Whitret's so gentle," observed Alice, "that only for that wild look of his,
                  methinks I could like him much."
               "That's his fayther's look, bairn, an a proof o' his parentage. An for his
                  gentleness, it a' comes o' his mither."
               "His mother!"
               "Ay, his mither, ye maun ken," said Nell in a confidential tone, "was a gentle,
                  modest bairn as e'er a puir honest farmer body was blessed wi'. Mony's the time I
                  hae seen her, a wee winsome thing, trippin ower the bonnie green knows o'
                  Gabbincleugh, to milk her fayther's kaye, wi' a white piggin on her head, liltin a
                  guid auld strathspy as blithely as the laverock aboon her head. God be guid an
                  mercifu' ti her, the puir saul; it was no gien her to hae as muckle as a blink at
                  her ain bairn; she died ere it was weel born, an the donnie thing itsel was picked
                  up twa hours after in the auld wa's o' Westlow Abbey, where it was flang amang the
                  tombstones, wi' it's back brucken an it's wee bit body a' covered wi' bluid."
               "O, how horrible!" exclaimed Alice. "What an inhuman act, to attempt the murder of
                  the innocent creature! So, then, Grace Goodniff's not his mother."
               "No mair his mither than yersel, lassie, but his mither's trusty frien, that cudna
                  bear to see the puir thing perish."
               "And who was so inhuman, Nell, as thus to attempt the murder of the poor
                  infant?"
               "Its uncle, Mistress Alice, its ain mither's brither, an nabady else, an ill-favored, ill-sauld wretch,
                  wha ne'er had a guid heart for frien or foe."
               "His sister's guilt drove him mad, mayhap."
               "Her guilt, woman! hoot awa! he didna care a thistle down for her guilt; na, na;
                  he wudna mind it, 'gin she bartered her vera saul to the deil, but he wudna hae
                  the fruit o't live for folks to wink their een an wag their fingers at."
               "So Whitret is but Grace's foster child."
               "Na mair; an she's aye been a guid mither to the puir lad these twanty years;
                  still after a' she disna ken the fayther o't."
               "Strange, the unfortunate mother never disclosed the secret to so dear a
                  friend."
               "Ah, lassie, ye little think how hard the task for an honest man's bairn to mak
                  her shame known e'en to her bosom frien; the words wad hae choked puir Jeannie
                  Southron."
               "And none knows of Whitret's paternity?" said Alice, looking up sadly in Nell's
                  face, and playing with the string of her hood.
               Nell hesitated for a moment, as if reflecting on what she should say in reply.
                  "Wha's his fayther, ye mean; weel, indeed, then, Mistress Alice, I wudna jist say
                  right bauldly there is ane that kens, and I wudna care to say there
                  isna either," she said, adroitly evading the inquiry. "In sic thrawin times, its
                  aoguy kittlesome thing to meddle wi' births and parentage; an sin nabody's sure,
                  lassie, so nabody's hanged for lack o' speech, neither."
               "He might be of gentle birth," said Alice, musingly.
               Nell smiled. "An wha kens," she replied, "he might be a prince o' the royal bluid,
                  as like's a souther's bairn. An what gard the thing be mair secret, nane suspecket
                  puir Jeannie till she sent for the priest an the midwife. Her mither was dead twa
                  three years, an nane aboot the biggin but the auld man, an honest, guid-hearted
                  body, wha thought his een was gien him far na ither use than spierin after his
                  craps and kine. Her brither Robert was aye frae hame poachin ower the border, wi'
                  hell pets like himsel, an when he showed his dark dower face at the auld
                  hamestead, it was but ainst an awa again. Now, as fate wad hae it a' its ain gate,
                  that night, o' a' the nights o' the year, Oliver Goodniff had just left
                  father—a—na matter aboot the name—wi' the puir girl, when he met Robert loupin the
                  dike anent the house, wi' his game in his pouch, an his crossbow on his shouther.
                  When the lad gaed in an asked for Jeannie, nane could say whare she was; the auld
                  man didna ken, an Oliver wudna say; so he ran out to seek her. Weel, I need na
                  tell the rest; its a sad an dolefu' tale, an no fit for ears like yours. Na, na,
                  my bonnie innocent bairn," and stooping, she kissed the young girl's forehead
                  affectionately, "na, na, far better we kenned less o' the warld's sinfu'
                  ways."
               "But the priest and the midwife; what of them?"
               "Ou, I darna, I darna tell ye," replied Nell, shaking her head; "na, na, the hale
                  secret maun be reserved for ither ears an anither place. But the twa are yet
                  leevin; ay, are they, an whin the hour comes to mak the disclosure o' Whitret's
                  parentage, by my saul, lassie, the highest heads in the lan' will blush at their near relation wi' the hunchback
                  o' Whinstane Hollow."
               Here Whitret made a mumbling noise to attract attention, and then pointed across
                  the chasm.
               "There he's at last," muttered Nell, shading her eyes with her hand, and looking
                  in the direction indicated by the dwarf.
               "Who?"
               "The gaberbunzie; come awa, lassie; he can tell us something o' auld Sir
                  Geoffrey;" and again taking up the babe in her arms, she led the way down the
                  steep precipice to the cavern, followed by the impatient Alice.
               As Nell threw back the heavy curtain that hung before the narrow entrance to the
                  chapel, Alice saw the gaberbunzie and Father Peter earnestly conversing near the
                  little altar, and bounding quickly through the opening and across the rocky floor,
                  she knelt at the priest's feet and craved his blessing.
               "And now, good man," she said, turning round to the beggar, "what tidings bringest
                  thou of my father? Speak, and tell me the truth, as thou'rt a Christian and a
                  Catholic. Is he yet living?"
               The person whom she addressed was a tall, stout man, seemingly above fifty years
                  of age. His appearance was very remarkable. He wore a long, gray beard, that fell
                  in profusion on his breast, a gabardine of coarse drab frieze, confined round the
                  middle by a thick cord or rope, and a black cap, that fitted close to his head and
                  tied under his chin. He wore sandals too, instead of buskins, so that his ankles
                  and feet were bare and browned from exposure to the weather. As he stood there
                  before Alice under the uncertain light of the flickering torches that illuminated
                  the chapel, he looked the very genius of that dreary and desolate place.
               "Is my father yet living?" repeated Alice, looking fearfully up in the man's face;
                  "tell me—or is he a prisoner?"
               The beggar paused for a moment, leaning on his long staff, and gazing at the young
                  girl. Her eyes were fixed on his, watching every motion of his countenance, and
                  her hands joined before her as in the act of supplication. Never, in all his
                  checkered life, had he seen so lovely a face and so graceful a form as then
                  suddenly appeared before him. He seemed spell bound as by a vision; or perhaps he
                  was tracing in those exquisite lineaments some resemblance to features he had seen
                  in his dreams, or somewhere long ago, away amongst the mists of former years.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIX.
               "WHY dost look at me so pityingly, good pilgrim?" said Alice. "Is my father dead?
                  Speak, I entreat thee."
               The mendicant seemed not to hear her voice. He gazed at her as if she were a
                  statue on a pedestal, bending forward and leaning on his long polestaff. At
                  length, his lips began slightly to tremble, and then his eyes, which kept moving
                  leisurely over her face and form, scanning every feature, became gradually
                  suffused with tears.
               "My father's dead," said Alice, in a voice scarcely audible, as she saw the
                  pilgrim's tears fall on his coarse gabardine.
               The words, though but few, and uttered in almost the tone of a whisper, were yet
                  so full of anguish and despair, that they instantly recalled the stranger's
                  wandering thoughts.
               Slowly the old man stretched out his hands, and gently laid them on the head of
                  the fair girl, saying, in accents tremulous with emotion,—
               "Thy father lives, my child, and sends thee his blessing by these hands; receive
                  it and that of an old outcast also, who loves thee almost as well."
               Alice knelt and raised her eyes towards heaven in speechless gratitude. Then
                  taking the beggar by the hand, she imprinted a kiss on his hard, sunburnt fingers.
                  "Hast seen my father?" she inquired.
               "Ay, truly have I. He is still at Brockton, with the faithful Reddy, who seldom
                  leaves him even for a moment. I informed him of thy place of refuge, and he will
                  soon venture hither to see thee."
               "How looks he? is he much altered?"
               "Nay, I cannot answer thee in that, my child, having but seen him for the first
                  time in seventeen years. It will be seventeen years come Holentide since we parted
                  at Annie's grave—I mean at his wife's grave. I shook his honest hand for the last
                  time across her open tomb, ere the earth had entirely covered her coffin from my
                  sight. And since that day, we have been both learning to forget each other, and
                  the world also—he in his little library at Brockton, whence he hath shut out all
                  profane converse, and I in the woods and wilds of England, a roaming outcast
                  without a shelter or a home."
               "So thou didst know my mother, good man," said Alice, laying her hand on the
                  beggar's arm, and looking up wistfully in his face.
               "Thy mother—ay, I knew her—once," he replied with suppressed emotion.
               "Then speak to me of my mother; I long to hear some one speak of her; people say
                  she was very kind and gentle. Alas! I never saw her; she died in giving me birth,
                  and so there's a void in my heart I would fain fill up with her image. Say,
                  pilgrim, canst paint her to my fancy? I will listen to thee most attentively."
               The mendicant turned his head aside, and drew his hand quickly across his
                  eyes.
               "Pardon me, good man," said Alice, as she saw the motion, and understood it, "I fear me I have
                  awakened some painful recollection."
               "Nay," replied the mendicant; "it's but a foolish weakness;" and he raised himself
                  up to his full height, and planted his staff firmly on the rock, as if to nerve
                  himself for the trial.
               Father Peter and Nell Gower were conversing at the farther end of the cell, and
                  casting a look occasionally in the direction of the speakers.
               "Nell saith I'm somewhat like my mother. Good man, dost think so?" inquired
                  Alice.
               "Like thy mother, my fair child? Ay, thy face is somewhat like. But the face is
                  only a small part— a hundred such faces were not worth a heart like hers."
               "She was so good?"
               "Ay, and so noble and so grand of soul."
               "Ah!"
               "And yet so humble, so charitable, so pure, and so truly Catholic. Hold, I'll
                  question thee as to the resemblance, and then tell thee mayhap in' how much
                  thou'rt like thy mother."
               "Speak on," said Alice; "I'll answer thee right faithfully."
               "Hast been good to the poor beggar who came to beg an alms and shelter? and didst
                  give him the kind word at meeting, and the secret dole at parting?"
               Alice hesitated.
               "She hath," replied a deep voice from a distant corner of the chapel.
               Alice started, somewhat surprised at the solemn sound, but the mendicant seemed
                  not to notice it.
               "Hast worshipped thy God in the night and in the morning?"
               "She hath."
               "Hast been frequent at the sacred confessional and the holy altar?"
               "She hath," responded the same voice, a third time.
               "Dost love thy religion better than thy life?" demanded the pilgrim, in a sterner
                  tone, still leaning on his staff, and looking steadily at the young girl; "answer
                  for thyself, maiden."
               "Methinks I do," she at length replied, casting her eyes bashfully on the ground,
                  and playing with the chain of her cross. "But I'm only a simple country girl, and
                  have not yet been greatly tempted."
               "Good," said the mendicant. "And art ready to sacrifice thy life for thy
                  faith?"
               "Ay, willingly!" responded Alice, in a tone of increased confidence.
               "Hearken to me, child. Thy religion is a low, mean, and contemptible thing. It's
                  driven out from the royal courts and princely halls of thy native land, where it
                  once ruled triumphant, to dwell with the ignorant and the poor. It's forced to
                  seek shelter in woods and caves. It's banished the presence of the great and
                  powerful, despised and scoffed at even by the learned; nay, it's flung from their
                  houses like a ragged garment, and fit only to be worn by wretched beggars like
                  myself. Ha, girl! thy religion is the scorn of thy compeers—like the Christian
                  name in the times of the Dioclesians, it's a disgrace and dishonor to acknowledge
                  it."
               
               "I care not," said Alice; "was not my Redeemer despised for his religion?"
               "And art bold enough to meet the contemptuous smiles, and withstand the winks and
                  nods, of the enemies of thy faith, as thou passest them by?"
               Alice answered not in words, but she raised the cross from her bosom, where it
                  hung, and reverently kissed the lips of the image of the Savior.
               The mendicant understood the silent reply, and proceeded:—
               "But of thy father. Wouldst abandon him to preserve thy faith? Wouldst see him
                  dragged on a hurdle to the gallows, amid the shouts of the rabble, when thy
                  apostasy would save him?"
               "What! is he a prisoner?" she cried, fearing the mendicant had hitherto been only
                  preparing her for some dreadful announcement.
               "Nay, answer me, maiden; wouldst save thy father by apostasy?"
               "Never!" responded Alice, raising herself to her full height, and crossing her
                  arms on her breast as she spoke. "Never! I love him as fondly as ever daughter
                  loved a parent—nay, I would give my life cheerfully to save his; but I would see
                  him hanging on the gallows at Tyburn till the wind and sun had bleached his bones,
                  rather than renounce the religion of my God and the honors of my ancestors."
               "Ha! thou wouldst, girl!" said the mendicant, catching her hand and gazing full in
                  her face. "Then thou hast learnt to feel as a Catholic."
               "Ay, and as none but the descendant of Catholic ancestors can feel, who have a
                  past to look back on," said Alice. "And what would we be without a past? Nought
                  but isolated beings, like those breakers of God's covenant, without a name or a
                  memory to cling to. And what is lineage or blood to me, were it not ennobled and
                  purified—not by centuries of military glory and heroic achievements, but by
                  centuries of faith, the mother of virtue and of honor. No, stranger, whoever thou
                  art, who seemest to take so much interest in my soul's affair, I tell thee, I
                  would not embrace Protestantism were it even possible to be saved thereby, and
                  renounce the glory of Catholicity to snatch my father's head from the axe of the
                  executioner."
               "What!" said the mendicant, "were't even possible to be saved thereby?"
               "Ay, I've said it, pilgrim. I would rather live in rags like thee, with the
                  memories of the past to sweeten my hard and bitter crust, than sit on a throne
                  without them. They may persecute us, beggar us, trample us; but they cannot wrench
                  from us the history of the past—that dominion of thought— that lies far above the
                  earth, and far beyond the grave."
               "Enough!" said the mendicant. "Thou hast proved thyself like thy mother. O God, I
                  give thee thanks!" he cried, letting his long staff fall neglected from his grasp,
                  and raising his hands in fervent gratitude. "I give thee thanks that I have lived
                  to hear such words from the lips of the daughter of Annie Howard. Go, then, my
                  noble and courageous girl— go as thou hast purposed—go before the face of the
                  queen—ay, before her whose very frown is death— and beg thy father's pardon. She will not—dare not
                  refuse thee."
               As Alice listened to the stranger's words, and saw the dignity of manner with
                  which he pronounced them, she felt she was conversing with a man whose birth and
                  breeding were far above his apparent condition. There was a certain culture in his
                  language, and a native grace in his motions, that accorded ill with his coarse
                  habiliments.
               "And who art thou, good man," she said, "whose words and bearing so contradict thy
                  outward seeming? Thy voice, methinks, sounds somewhat familiar to my ears."
               "A poor pilgrim," replied the mendicant, "who has been tired of the world since
                  before thou wert born, and longs to be at rest from its troubles."
               "But thy name?" pursued Alice.
               "Folks call me the gaberbunzie, along by the Scottish borders," he replied,
                  picking up his polestaff, and sitting down on one of the rocks that lay scattered
                  about the floor; "and hereabout they call me the big beadsman, and sometimes the
                  beggar monk."
               "But thy baptismal name?" persisted Alice. "Thou much resemblest one long unheard
                  of, and whose portrait still hangs in my mother's room, at Brockton Hall."
               "Ay, doubtless some distant relative, lost in the troublesome times of the eighth
                  Henry."
               "Nay," replied Alice; "he was my mother's brother, Henry Howard. He fought at the
                  battle of Pinkie, and hath never since been heard of, living or dead. Some said he
                  escaped to the continent, and took holy orders; others, that he is still wandering
                  through England, in poverty and disguise. O that I knew he were living! I would
                  seek his protection for my poor father who has no relative now to confide in but
                  his child. Alas! that only child hath abandoned him at the first approach of
                  danger." And Alice again covered her face with her hands.
               The gaberbunzie, taking advantage of the moment, raised his staff and motioned
                  Nell Gower to remove her.
               "Stay, Nell!" she cried; "let me speak but one word more——"
               "Out awa wi' ye, bairn," muttered the old woman; "come ben here and speak wi'
                  Father Peter, gin ye maun speak; but no a word mair to the gaberbunzie. Ouh, my
                  troth, lassie, he's no the ane to be misleard wi' yer foolish claverin. Come awa!"
                  And she forced Alice gently by the arm down the apartment, to where Father Peter
                  was sitting.
               The mendicant's eyes followed the form of the fair girl, as it receded, step by
                  step, from his sight, and became at length indistinct in the shadowy distance, and
                  then slowly reclining against the side wall of the cavern, he threw back his head,
                  and gazed up, unconsciously, at the dark and distant roof, in a long, absorbing
                  reverie.
               The priest, having addressed a few words to Alice, congratulating her on her
                  father's health, and freedom from arrest, approached the mendicant, seemingly with
                  the intention of conversing with him, now that he was disengaged, and halting
                  directly before him, appeared respectfully to await his notice.
               
               The stranger, however, was now entirely unconscious of his presence. Indeed, so
                  wrapped was he in thought, that one would have supposed he had suddenly fallen
                  asleep, were it not for the peculiar motion of his head, against the rock, and the
                  convulsive movement of his fingers round his oaken staff. No, he was not asleep,
                  but thinking. It was old memories, which the sight of Alice had awakened once
                  more;—it was the long-dormant sympathies of his heart—the neglected, but still
                  inextinguishable feelings of his nature, which the voice of the maiden had
                  rekindled. The poor pilgrim had snatched a moment from the sorrows of the present,
                  and flown back on the wings of memory to the pleasures of the past.
               As the priest stood there, and fixed his eyes on the mendicant's upturned face, he
                  saw something rolling down his cheeks and falling on his long, gray beard. It
                  might be drops from the slimy arch above, or it might be tears. "I cannot find it
                  in my heart to disturb thee now," said the priest, and he turned away and joined
                  the two females at the opposite side of the chapel.
               That night Alice retired earlier than usual. She was fain to seek the refreshing
                  influence of sleep, after the many perplexing anxieties she suffered during the
                  day, and as her mind was now restored in some measure to its wonted calm by the
                  news of her father's safety, nature soon reasserted her power over her wearied
                  senses.
               The night was far advanced, and the last cinder had fallen buried in its ashes on
                  the little hearth, near which Alice had lain down to rest, when she awoke from her
                  first sleep, and looked around in search of her old protectress. But Nell Gower
                  was not there. She called her in whispers, and yet no answer came. The place where
                  she lay was a small recess or cell in the rock, and separated from the chapel by a
                  curtain, which served instead of a door to cover the low and narrow entrance, and
                  so dark that she could see nothing save the curtain waving to and fro before the
                  aperture. As she kept looking, however, for a time at this object, her eyes became
                  accustomed by degrees to the light that struggled faintly through the thin fabric,
                  and she could see, at length, sundry figures passing and repassing before it, as
                  if busied in some hasty preparations. Presently she heard voices whispering low,
                  through the hollow-sounding chapel without, and at short intervals, the tread of
                  footsteps approaching by the long, winding corridor, through which Nell Gower had
                  a few days before conducted her courtly visitor. As she listened a while to these
                  strange sounds, her eyes again closed; but she could not sleep. The few hours'
                  rest she obtained had not sufficiently refreshed her wearied senses, and yet the
                  unusual sound of voices without, and the passing of so many figures before the
                  curtain, had so excited her imagination that she feared to resign herself entirely
                  to forgetfulness. In this state of half consciousness, without the power to keep
                  awake, and without the courage to sleep, she felt, or thought she felt, the
                  breathing of something within the distance of a few feet, nay, could almost feel
                  its warmth upon her arm, that lay extended on the floor by the side of her bed. She would have
                  looked to see who or what was there, but the place was dark, and she could not
                  summon energy enough to speak. Then it seemed to her she heard voices conversing
                  distinctly behind the curtain, in low but earnest tones; and she tried to reason
                  with herself, whether it was fancy or reality, but reason also was too sleepy to
                  decide. She thought, moreover, the first voice that spoke was somewhat familiar to
                  her ear.
               "Art sure the child is hers?"
               "Ay, most certain."
               "Beware thou judgest not rashly."
               "Nay, I saw it leave the chamber in the arms of the countess of——"
               "Woman, I desire not to hear names—proceed."
               "I have long been planning vengeance against her, and now——"
               "Vengeance is the Lord's," interrupted the first speaker, "who will repay in his
                  own good time. What wouldst thou?"
               "Proclaim her."
               "And who would believe thee, a poor kitchen wench?"
               "I have proof."
               "What, thy eyesight?"
               "Nay, nay, the written confession of her mediciner, Dr. Maraski."
               "How—is he not a close prisoner in the Tower?"
               "Ay, but he hath communicated, through Whitret Macbairn, with the queen mother,
                  that her son might be saved from so unholy an alliance."
               "Well!"
               "I have the packet."
               "Ha! give it me."
               "Nay, I will not part with it."
               "Listen to me, woman," said the questioner; and he spoke so sternly that Alice
                  slightly moved, like one disturbed in a dreams by the closing of a door or the
                  rustling of drapery.
               "Hearken, woman, and remember thou my words. Thou'rt bound, by the laws of God and
                  man, to destroy the packet, and carry the secret with thee to the grave."
               "But she is the enemy of thee and thy church," persisted the other.
               "Admitted."
               "And her vaunted chastity maketh her over-bold to persecute."
               "Doubtless."
               "And her power would die with her reputation, and her reputation by the mere
                  telling of the truth."
               "Ay, verily, but truth is not always to be told; wouldst like thy secret sins to
                  be published through the city?"
               "I am but a humble servant, whose private life can in no wise affect the welfare
                  of religion; but the disclosure of this Jezebel's crimes might save the church
                  from ages of persecution."
               "Woman, woman! that thought is a temptation of the devil. Dost not know thourt not
                  to do evil that good may follow?"
               "Evil?"
               "Ay, blast a woman s reputation to serve religion."
               
               "It's already blasted."
               "Ah, thou referrest to the past."
               "Nay, I speak of the present—there be six privy to the secret of her guilt."
               "So many? ah, indeed! so many?"
               "Ay, the earl, the countess, the doctor, the priest, Nell Gower, and myself. Dost
                  imagine so many tongues can keep a secret?"
               "My child, I have nought to do with any but thee, and give counsel accordingly.
                  From the rest, I may venture to say there is but small danger of a disclosure. The
                  first two will not dare to make it, for the sake of their heads, and for various
                  other grave reasons; the third will die in prison, a convicted conspirator; the
                  fourth is a Catholic priest, whose office compels him, under penalty of anathema
                  and excommunication, to preserve the secret inviolate; and——"
               "But the priest hath not come to the knowledge of it in the confessional."
               "Nay, it matters not, my child; it hath been confided to him as a priest of the
                  church. The fifth, Eleanor Gower, with all her reckless habits, and strange,
                  wayward disposition, is yet a conscientious woman, and will take counsel of her
                  confessor. Therefore, thou'rt thyself the only one of the six from whom danger is
                  to be dreaded; and I warn thee, if thou but breathest a breath to propagate this
                  report, notwithstanding the woman's insatiable persecution of thy church, thou'rt
                  guilty of a heinous sin against her, and dost wound the charity of Jesus Christ
                  thy Savior, who pardoned Magdalen, and saved the adulterous Samaritan. Wilt
                  promise thy God, then, in this holy place, to reveal nought of this woman's secret
                  guilt?"
               Here there was a pause. Both were silent for the space of a minute—the one
                  awaiting the answer to his question—the other, deliberating between submission to
                  God's will and the gratification of her own. Alice had all this time lain
                  perfectly still, and entirely unconscious of the importance of the subject of
                  conversation. But when the speakers ceased, the sudden pause caused her to open
                  her eyes, as the sudden cessation of the rocking of a cradle sometimes wakes a
                  child. As she looked for a moment in the direction whence the sounds proceeded,
                  she felt the warm breath she had only fancied to have felt before, now burning hot
                  on her cheek; and then turning her head a little sidewise, beheld two large,
                  gloating eyes riveted on her face. "It's but the cat," thought Alice—"Nell's black
                  cat; poor thing, I shal not disturb it."
               "Wilt promise?" repeated the questioning party after waiting a considerable time
                  for the answer.
               "She hath beheaded my uncle, banished my father persecuted my church, is an enemy
                  to——"
               "Peace, woman, and answer me. Wilt promise to preserve the secret?"
               "No, father, I will not promise."
               "Then begone, sinner, for I cannot absolve thee."
               Alice started and screamed. "Absolve thee!" she ejaculated; "my God, what have I
                  been doing— listening to the secrets of the confessional?" Hastily she sprung up
                  from her recumbent posture, and
                  throwing back her hair, made a step towards the curtain, when it opened, and Nell
                  Gower stood before her, attracted by her scream. Alice had taken but one step, but
                  that step made her scream yet louder than before, for it rested on the crouching,
                  trembling form of Whitret Macbairn.
               "Saints o' heaven, what's a' this?" cried Nell Gower, holding up the curtain and
                  revealing the prostrate and ungainly body of the hunchback, stretched on the floor
                  under the foot of Alice Wentworth.
               The young girl stood still in the same position, as if she had not the power to
                  withdraw her foot, looking down at the hunchback, and breathing hard, like one who
                  had thrown an adversary after a desperate struggle.
               "Speak, woman," cried Nell, an dinna stand there starin doun like ane wha'd lost
                  their speech athegither. What mean ye?"
               "Whitret!" ejaculated Alice; "he hath frightened me again; take him hence," she
                  cried, "take him hence."
               By this time a number of persons had crowded round the door of the little cell, to
                  ascertain the cause of the scream, and kept looking over each other's shoulders at
                  Alice, wondering who she was, and how so young and beautiful a girl had found her
                  way into that secret apartment.
               Nell, who seemed in a moment to comprehend the cause of Alice's horror of the
                  dwarf, and unwilling to expose matters further, motioned Whitret to withdraw, and
                  requested the bystanders to retire also, assuring them "it was nathing ava but
                  jist a wee touch o' the nightmare the bairn had;" and then, seeing Father Peter
                  approaching, she raised her voice somewhat higher. "Stan back," she cried, "canna
                  ye? an let the priest come here. Heigh, sirs, ane wud he thought yed be mair
                  concerned aboot yer saul's safe keepin, the twa three hours left ye frae the
                  pursuit o' the enemies o' God's church, than glowerin there and speirin aboot wha
                  disna concern ye. Hugh! ay, ye canna hear a screagh, but yer a' aff yer knees to
                  ken wha's kilt, or if the roof's fa'in. Gae wa ilk ane o' ye, an min yer ain
                  business; an there's yersel, Grace Goodniff, that shud hae mair sense, starin wi'
                  yer een fixed on the lassie, like a stickit rabbit."
               "What hath he done, Nell?" inquired Grace.
               "Done? wha done?"
               "Whitret—hath he harmed the maiden?"
               "Harmed the deil," responded Nell. "Guid forgie me that I shud say it. Hugh! I
                  wonder ye did na gae down to Hampton for the doctor."
               As the inquisitive and wondering group withdrew from the door of the cell at the
                  bidding of Nell Gower, Alice saw, amongst the last who retired, a tall, portly
                  personage, wearing a coarse black cassock, a small skullcap of the same color, and
                  a confessor's white stole round his neck. As he walked slowly away, the crowd fell
                  back on each side, opening a passage, and saluting him reverently as he
                  passed.
               "Father," said Alice, laying her hand on Father Peter's arm, and glancing at the
                  retiring form of the tall ecclesiastic, "I would crave thy patience for a moment, whilst I confide to thee a
                  matter of conscience."
               Nell adjusted her hood and retired, as she heard the request.
               "Thy shrift must be short," said the priest, "for it's well nigh time to begin the
                  holy mass."
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               WE must now request the reader to return with us to Hampton Court, and witness
                  such events as occurred there, immediately connected with the course of our
                  story.
               Without the aid of such details as we are enabled to give, the reader will
                  doubtless have already learnt from the history of the period, that the two great
                  subjects of Elizabeth's thoughts, during the first years of her reign, were the
                  overthrow of the Papal power and the ruin of Mary Queen of Scots. To the
                  accomplishment of these ends her energies seemed to be chiefly directed, nor can
                  we find any thing in her public life or private memoirs so clearly indicative of
                  her true character as the untiring assiduity with which she at last achieved them.
                  Yet, when we reflect that her persecution of the Catholic church arose, not from a
                  blind, misguided zeal for the cause of God's truth,— for that would be some
                  extenuation,—but from personal hatred of the man who dared to brand her with
                  illegitimacy and dispute her right to the crown, and that of Mary Stuart, almost
                  solely from jealousy of her personal charms, our wonder is, she could be so far
                  lost to all sense of moral responsibility as to suffer such private pique to lead
                  to so unwarrantable an exercise of her sovereign power. It would seem, indeed,
                  that she wielded the sceptre more for the gratification of her resentment than for the interests of the state. And still
                  the wonder increases, when we recollect what powerful ministers she had to deal
                  with, and what cogent reasons they had learnt from the despotism of her father to
                  restrict the powers of the monarch. But Elizabeth knew well her ministers were the
                  enemies of Rome and of Scotland, and would therefore give themselves little
                  trouble to inquire into the real motives that prompted her acts of cruelty. It was
                  enough for them, if her ostensible objects were the destruction of Catholicity,
                  and the removal of an aspirant, whose probable succession to the British crown
                  would jeopardize their titles to the confiscated property of the church, and
                  embarrass their efforts for Protestant ascendancy. She might be an angel or a
                  devil in her heart for aught it concerned them. As long as she carried out their
                  views, they had few scruples respecting the feelings which influenced her
                  conduct.
               If there are still some to be found in the world who believe Elizabeth to have
                  persecuted from conscientious motives, and under a solemn conviction of the
                  necessity of religious reform, such, no doubt, will find abundant apologies for
                  her intrigues, and, excuses for her atrocities. But we think there are few now
                  hard enough to adventure such a theory. The lapse of three hundred years has done
                  much to cool down sectarian prejudice and religious fanaticism, and well nigh worn
                  out the veil that so long covered from the sight of honest men the vices of the
                  virgin queen.
               Elizabeth had now completely recovered from her dangerous illness, but found she
                  was more involved than ever in the difficulties she had herself created. The hints
                  she had occasionally thrown out regarding a matrimonial alliance with France had
                  brought a number of envoys from Catharine with proposals, whom, during her
                  confinement, she was unable to receive; and now, at her first public reception,
                  one of these, De Fays, had returned to press the suit of the Duke of Anjou, she
                  having declined that of his brother, King Charles IX. On the other hand, she had
                  just received intelligence that Murray, and his fellow-conspirators, had been
                  routed at Biggar by Mary Stuart, at the head of a force of ten thousand men, and
                  attended by the Earls of Huntly and Bothwell; and that the Earl of Bedford had
                  been driven back from Carlisle, whither he had marched to support the rebels. She
                  found dangers approaching her on both sides—the destruction of all her hopes in
                  Scotland if she failed to counteract the movements of her rival, and open
                  hostilities from France in favor of that monarch if she refused the hand of the
                  duke. Indeed, it was only by a pretended desire of alliance with the house of
                  Valois, that she succeedecd so far in warding off the arm of France, and acquiring
                  time to mature her plans for the overthrow of Mary Stuart.
               It was yet the early morning, and Elizabeth had already written a number of
                  letters with her own hand, and read through a pile of others she had just
                  received, seated alone, in her private cabinet. Her face was paler than usual, and
                  her countenance expressive of vexation and trouble. Her ample headdress, so
                  brilliant when she appeared on all public occasions, was on this morning more gorgeous than usual, and lay back from her
                  high and expansive forehead, exposing her features to full view, as they worked
                  under the various changes her correspondence produced. Round her neck and under
                  her ruff she wore a red scarf, fastened with a diamond clasp on her breast; and on
                  the table before her lay a small crown or coronet, studded with jewels, and the
                  royal arms wrought in silver on each side. It was evident, from the care she had
                  taken to have her dress so scrupulously adjusted, that she intended to receive
                  some personages of distinction. Never, perhaps, did she look so interesting as on
                  this morning, her first appearance after her severe and dangerous illness. Her
                  eyes had lost much of that intensity of look, which usually lent an expression of
                  severity to her countenance; her cheeks and neck had parted with their freckles
                  and their flush, and her clear, white forehead seemed the very type of
                  chastity.
               When she had finished her morning letters, some of which she threw carelessly on
                  the table half read, and placed others in the drawer beside her, she took up a
                  small mirror, set in a richly-carved ebony frame, and looked at her face in the
                  glass for the space of a minute, and then secreting it about her person, rang her
                  bell.
               "Announce Sir Thomas Plimpton," she said, as the master of the black rod appeared,
                  "and inform our privy council that we meet them presently."
               The tall, raw-boned knight entered the presence as awkwardly as McPherson, the
                  Scotch Covenanter, once did afterwards in the court dress of Charles I. His long,
                  aquiline nose projected from the centre of his pointed ruff; his knees knocked
                  together, and chafed his crispy silken hose, as he approached; and his long, bony
                  arms hung as stiff by his side as if they had been welded to his shoulders.
               "Ha, ha!" said Elizabeth, as she saw the knight striding across the chamber. "By
                  our royal honor, Master Plimpton, thou wouldst make but a sorry dancing master.
                  Nay, nay, good sir," she continued, as Plimpton knelt to take her hand, "we
                  dispense with that ceremony, and believe thee as liege and faithful a subject as
                  if thou hadst been smacking our hand by the hour—the which may Heaven forfend. But
                  to thy task, sir; we have little time to devote to thy pleasure. What news from
                  Scotland?"
               "Somewhat of the dullest, please your gracious majesty," said Plimpton, spreading
                  his rough, brawny hand on his breast, and bowing profoundly to the queen; "matters
                  have gone but ill in Scotland."
               "We have already heard of the discomfiture of my Lord Murray and his friends,"
                  observed Elizabeth. "So, if thou'rt come to speak us on that subject, thy news
                  will be rather stale for our ears. Verily, we had thought thy length of limb had
                  made thee a speedier messenger." And she ran her eyes over his gaunt form, as if
                  he had been a wild beast in a menagerie. Plimpton felt the contempt which
                  accompanied the look, but dared not permit his countenance to show it.
               "Please your majesty," he submitted, "I reached the palace at midnight, but failed
                  to obtain an audience."
               
               "And didst present thyself with buskins clean and hands washed?" inquired
                  Elizabeth.
               Plimpton bowed and replied, in a humble tone, "My buskins were clean and my hands
                  washed, may it please your majesty; but your grace's royal equerry, the noble Earl
                  of Leicester, hath been pleased to bar my entrance."
               "Ah, he deemed thee too late a visitor, mayhap." "That could hardly be, gracious
                  madam, for he had just come forth from your majesty's chamber. I met his lordship
                  at your majesty's door where I had been awaiting his exit for a good half
                  hour."
               "Waiting at our door," said Elizabeth, her brows contracting as she spoke.
               "Nay, I humbly crave your majesty's pardon if my zeal in your royal service hath
                  carried me beyond prudence; but I have been honored by your grace's commands to
                  present myself on my arrival, whatever might be the hour, and I merely obeyed
                  them."
               Elizabeth's pale face grew red at the insinuation conveyed by the tone more than
                  by the words of the speaker; but repressing her irritation, and relaxing her
                  contracted brow, she said, without any visible emotion,—
               "Thou shouldst have requested one of our gentle-women, sir, to acquaint us of thy
                  arrival; for notwithstanding that my Lord of Leicester had some weighty matters to
                  communicate, we should have postponed their consideration."
               "Your majesty's ladies in waiting," persisted Plimpton, "had just retired when I
                  reached the court, and I was therefore obliged to await the termination of his
                  lordship's visit to your majesty's chamber."
               "And he refused thee admittance?"
               "Ay, truly did he; and I crave your grace's leave to say, with as haughty a
                  bearing as if he were king consort."
               Elizabeth bit her lip, and glanced a suspicious look at the speaker.
               "His lordship hath but small respect for your majesty's servants, be they dukes or
                  squires," pursued Plimpton, taking advantage of the queen's silence, yet conscious
                  all the while of the irritation his words were producing. "It's but yesterday he
                  told the Duke of Sussex, your majesty's most faithful friend and servant, that
                  your gracious majesty knew better than to reprove him for his insult to Sir John
                  Harrington."
               "Knew better!" repeated Elizabeth; "ah, what meant he by that?"
               "I know not, your majesty; I'm but a poor dependant on your grace's indulgence,
                  and little versed in such affairs; but the words of the noble earl have given much
                  cause for court gossip."
               "Dare he speak thus?" muttered the queen to herself.
               "And the Spanish ambassador, as report goeth," continued Plimpton, "had thoughts
                  of praying your majesty to say if it were your grace's pleasure that all foreign
                  ministers should doff their hats to his lordship when he passed, and hold his
                  stirrup when he mounted."
               But Plimpton had gone too far; his hatred of Leicester was too strong for him to conceal under a
                  show of regard for the queen's reputation, and his words, therefore, fell short of
                  the effect he intended them to produce.
               "And if the Spanish ambassador," replied Elizabeth, smiling provokingly at the
                  enemy of her favorite, "had prayed us for the information, we doubtless might have
                  said that such honor to our trusty and right faithful servant should pleasure us
                  much, seeing it were only a proof of his great respect for our royal self. But how
                  comes it, Sir Thomas Plimpton, that thou dost affect the noble earl so
                  marvellously ill? Hath he been scoffing at thy ignoble blood, or laughing at thy
                  ungainly figure?"
               "Nay, your majesty," replied Plimpton, "but were it even so, it might ill consort
                  with my humble dependence on your grace's goodness to bandy words with a noble
                  gentleman, so far above me, and so highly favored by his royal mistress."
               "Well, to thy business, man; we've heard enough of this. Whither hath the Lord
                  Murray fled, and what are his further intentions?"
               "He is on his way to Hampton, to crave an audience of your majesty," replied
                  Plimpton.
               "What, sir," ejaculated Elizabeth, "a rebel to his crowned and lawful queen to
                  present himself at our court!"
               Plimpton looked up in the queen's face for an instant, as if he understood not the
                  meaning of her words.
               "The Lord James Stuart, now Earl of Murray, please your majesty——"
               "Ay, sir, we've heard thee——"
               "Your gracious majesty will remember," continued Plimpton, "how much the noble
                  lord hath risked for your majesty's behoof, and doubtless will requite him
                  accordingly."
               "Risked for us, sir!" said the queen, in affected surprise.
               "Ay, truly, madam, had he been taken at Biggar, his head had fallen a sacrifice to
                  his zeal in your majesty's cause."
               "'Sdeath, sir," she cried, provoked at his thus pressing instead of ignoring the
                  earl's claims upon her gratitude, "dost think us bound to save every madman who
                  flourishes his sword in God's cause and ours? We tell thee, man," she continued,
                  forgetting every thing but herself, "that we take it ill of my Lord Murray to run
                  thus under our sceptre for protection, when he knoweth right well it will bring
                  upon us the displeasure of France, Spain, and Scotland."
               Plimpton stood silent for a moment, not knowing how to reply to this unexpected
                  declaration. He saw the queen was resolved to repudiate all knowledge of Murray's
                  conspiracy for the dethronement of the Queen of Scots; but how she could have the
                  hardihood to do so in his presence, the very man whom she made the bearer of her
                  letters and her gold to these same conspirators, was what completely confounded
                  him. He remembered, it is true, that these letters were not written by her
                  majesty's own hand, but by himself at her dictation; still he never dreamed she
                  could disavow the obligations they involved, to his very face, and alone, as they
                  then were, in her private cabinet. "Is
                  it possible," thought he, "she only intended to use me as a tool to work out her
                  own selfish ends, and sacrifice me, if she failed, to assuage the anger of Mary
                  Stuart and her foreign allies?" Plimpton, nevertheless, thought he knew well how
                  he stood with the queen, and had taken precautions accordingly. He did not
                  entirely rely for safety on the secrets Elizabeth had intrusted to him, but took
                  care to ferret out others which she would have carefully concealed from the whole
                  world, and had sufficient address to hint at them in such a manner as to excite
                  her fears without provoking either anger or inquiry.
               And now, as the clouds of fortune began to lower a little, another secret had come
                  to his knowledge— the encounter at the gate with Leicester and the lady removing
                  the infant under her cloak. He had taken both time and trouble to sift this
                  strange affair to the bottom, and having ascertained that the Countess of
                  Harrington was not to be found at a certain hour that night, when a messenger
                  arrived at court to announce the death of her sister, the Lady Granby, and certain
                  that the tall man wrapped in the cloak could be no other than the Earl of
                  Leicester, his suspicions were excited; and once excited, he found circumstantial
                  evidence enough to confirm them. But now the difficulty was, how to communicate
                  his knowledge of this secret to the queen, without the necessity of an
                  explanation; and on the other hand, might not his knowledge prove as fatal to him
                  as it did to Maraski, the physician, whose imprisonment in the Tower he had little
                  trouble to account for? These reflections passed rapidly through his mind, and
                  left him doubtful and uneasy. Yet on the success of Murray his hopes of future
                  advancement were as much dependent as on the favor of the queen; so that, should
                  Elizabeth withdraw her countenance and support from the arch rebel, the latter
                  must inevitably fall, and his own hopes, from the ruin of Mary Stuart, fall with
                  him. He resolved, therefore, to press the consideration of his friend's claim,—
                  though at some hazard to himself,—and reserve any allusion he might make to the
                  night adventure for some more favorable occasion.
               "And please your majesty," resumed Plimpton, "my Lord Murray hath doubtless
                  fancied he could find no shelter so sure, and so welcome, with your grace's favor,
                  as behind the throne for whose weal he risked his life."
               "Our throne, sir, requires no foreign arm to protect it," said the queen proudly,
                  "and by God's good help it never shall; and if this Lord Murray turn his sword
                  against his rightful sovereign, on pretence of his zeal for God's truth, and love
                  for our royal person and throne, why, God's mercy, sir, he must not tumble in
                  here, after his routing, and make our palace a sanctuary—ay, sir, a sanctuary for
                  traitors and rebels!"
               "But your majesty's connection with——"
               "With what, sir?"
               "I fear me, gracious madam, that your majesty's letters of encouragement to the
                  Scottish lords——"
               "Letters of encouragement!" cried Elizabeth, rising, and pushing back the table
                  before her, in a burst of anger. "Now, by our royal patience, Sir Fellow, thou
                  must be demented, or just come hither from the alehouse. What! speaks to us of letters of
                  encouragement—of complotting with rebel subjects of our good sister and cousin!
                  Away, sir—quit the presence." And she pointed to the door as she spoke. "Right
                  well we deserve this reward, for having taken such a blundering, base-born churl
                  into our secret service. Begone, sir."
               But Plimpton would not be dismissed so easily. He had some matters of grave
                  personal interest still to submit to her majesty, which could not well be
                  postponed.
               "Pardon, most gracious madam," he said, clasping his hands and falling on his knee
                  before her; "I humbly entreat your majesty to bear with me."
               "Ay, that thou mayst have leisure to insult us, Sir Knave."
               "Nay, if I've been overbold, madam, it cometh of my zeal for your majesty's
                  honors."
               "Our honor, varlet! our honor! Ah! and thou presumest to speak of thy paltry zeal
                  and our royal honor in the same breath!"
               "And how could it be otherwise, madam? Thy honor, and thy glory, which are ever
                  safe in Heaven's good keeping, are the source of my breath and of my life."
               "Ah, sir, wouldst parley," said Elizabeth, somewhat softened, "and tarry here
                  despite our command?"
               "I beg but for my life," replied Plimpton, letting his long arms fall by his side,
                  and his cropped, over-grown head upon his breast, in an attitude of abject
                  abandonment.
               "Thy life! pugh, sir, we grudge thee not thy life. Why, man, thou wouldst make but
                  poor quarry for our talons. God's mercy, fellow, we fly not at corncrakes and
                  cormorants."
               "Nay, I fear not so much the death that cometh from the axe of the headsman, as
                  that from the displeasure of my gracious and right royal mistress," replied
                  Plimpton, in the accents of a slave before his sultan.
               Elizabeth smiled contemptuously at the crouching form before her, and turned away
                  a step in disgust; and yet, strange to say, she felt her pride gratified by the
                  fears and the fulsome adulation of even so mean a sycophant.
               "If her gracious majesty frown upon her poor servitor, he dies," continued
                  Plimpton, his hands still clasped before him in an attitude of supplication, "and
                  his royal mistress loses a faithful and devoted servant,—but alas! alas! one whose
                  blunt zeal and uncombed speech are ill besuited to the etiquette of a royal
                  palace."
               The queen relaxed her brows, and paced the room for a minute or two, deliberating
                  whether she would send him out of the way, till she had exculpated herself before
                  the foreign ambassadors of all share in Murray's conspiracy, or still use him as a
                  tool to help her in the difficulty. At length she stopped before him, and tapping
                  him on the head with the end of her fan, said, in a still severe, but less angry
                  tone,—
               "Hark thee, Master Plimpton; we fear us much thy memory is over-good for thy place
                  at court."
               "My memory, please your grace?"
               
               "Ay, verily, thy memory, man; it may lose thee thy head, mayhap. Court dependents
                  should be like Popish priests, who betray not even to the penitents
                     themselves the knowledge of their secrets told in the confessional.
                  Didst not say, just now, something of letters and gold thou'st whilom conveyed to
                  these Scotch insurgents?"
               "Letters, my liege?" repeated Plimpton, with well-affected embarrassment.
               "Ay, sir, letters and money, or something like—— nay, perhaps thou didst but fancy
                  it."
               "Fear of your grace's displeasure hath doubtless confused my poor senses,"
                  responded Plimpton.
               "Ah, thou didst but fancy, then, or, as thou sayest, the fear of our sovereign
                  displeasure hath made away with thy wits. Well, well, get thee up. We pardon thy
                  indiscretion for this bout, but would have thee to know, nevertheless, that should
                  report ever touch our ears of letters of encouragement to these ungracious lords,
                  written by thee in our name, (ay, thou muttered'st something, we think, thatwise,)
                  nay, if thou but murmur such vagaries even in thy dreams, so that itching ears
                  might catch the meaning from the mumping, by our royal self, we shall send thee to
                  babble thy tales to stone walls for the rest of thy life. And hark thee, sir; as
                  for my Lord Murray, we've thought better of it, and may prevail on our forbearance
                  to receive him an hour hence in our council chamber; seeing he may come not so
                  much to seek our protection (the which God forefend we should e'er refuse to the
                  truly repentant, or to the sufferer in a good cause) as to beg our intercession
                  with our good sister, and to exonerate us before our council, and in especial
                  before the French and Spanish ambassadors, of charges in respect to this wicked
                  and traitorous brawl. These, peradventure, may be the purposes of this Scotchman
                  journeying in such haste towards us; and if so, we must see to it that we requite
                  him accordingly. But we will have him know, Master Plimpton, that it suits not our
                  pleasure to grant him a private audience, and shall see him only in our council
                  chamber, before our faithful friends and right trusty councillors, so that no
                  malicious tongue may have cause to slaver its suspicions on our royal house. And
                  if thou'rt concerned for his welfare, see to him presently, and caution him that
                  he trip not—for an he trips, he falls. As to thyself, Sir Thomas, learn to shorten
                  thy memory on occasion, or it may run away with thy head. So now get thee gone,
                  master," she concluded, and waiving him off, resumed her seat and rang her
                  bell.
               "Who waits?" she inquired, as Bouyer, the gentleman of the black rod, made his
                  appearance.
               "The noble Earl of Murray and the Abbot Killwilling, please your majesty."
               "What, sir, renegade traitors so bold as to crave a private audience! Send them to
                  the council chamber, sir; we shall there deal with them presently— away with
                  them."
               When Bouyer disappeared, Elizabeth's quick ear caught the sound of angry voices in
                  the antechamber, and again ringing her bell, sharply demanded who were so bold as
                  thus to raise their voices in her hearing.
               
               "My Lord of Leicester, please your majesty," responded Bouyer, his voice coming
                  short and thick, like one much excited. He would force an entrance against the
                  royal order."
               "Ay, sir, my Lord of Leicester, brawling at our chamber doors!"
               "And I pray your gracious majesty to decide," continued Bouyer, "whether the noble
                  earl is master in your majesty's palace, and, as he saith, can dismiss all court
                  officers at his good pleasure."
               Elizabeth rose suddenly, ere Bouyer had done speaking, and crossing the apartment,
                  threw open the door, and confronted the disputants.
               The instant the queen appeared, every eye was bent and every voice hushed. The
                  Duke of Sussex and Sir John Harrington, who stood at the recess of one of the
                  windows, looking on and laugning at the fray, suddenly checked their mirth, and
                  even Leicester himself seemed to quail before her angry frown, though he well knew
                  he possessed a secret charm, by which he could obviate the consequences of her
                  displeasure, did he but choose to employ it. Perhaps Elizabeth herself at this
                  moment suspected there was some hidden mystery on which he relied for security,
                  and the consciousness of which made him thus bold to set her orders at defiance.
                  Ever since her recent illness, his bearing and manner, even in her presence, had
                  become less courteous and respectful; and she had learnt from report, that his
                  behavior towards the members of her council, and especially to Cecil himself, was
                  marked by greater hauteur than usual. As these
                  reflections crossed her mind, she felt, or rather feared she was in the earl's
                  power, and that he might use it to tie her hands and seal her lips in future, if
                  she did not at once crush his efforts and his hopes. It seemed to her this attempt
                  to force an entrance into her private cabinet, in direct opposition to her express
                  orders, was his first trial of strength between the secret and the sceptre. Had
                  Elizabeth's blood been of a lower temperature, she would have promptly rebuked and
                  dismissed the disputants, and then taken an early occasion to ascertain the cause
                  of Leicester's extraordinary conduct, and adopt the best means to correct it. But
                  she was a Tudor Plantagenet, and the blood in her veins had descended to her
                  through fiery channels.
               "How now, my Lord of Leicester," she demanded; "hath our royal favor made thee so
                  bold as to contravene our orders in our very hearing?"
               "Please your gracious majesty," began the earl, bowing profoundly, and then
                  drawing himself up again to his full height, like one about to enter on a long
                  explanation; but Elizabeth stopped him ere he had well begun.
               "Peace, my lord—peace with thy stale apologies, they're flat as small beer. We
                  have wished thee well, Sir Earl, but our favor was not so locked up in thee that
                  we care not for others. Gad's death, my lord, if thou thinkest to rule here, we
                  shall see thee forthcoming."
               "Most gracious mistress," persisted the earl, again bowing almost to his shoe
                  buckles, and yet with little show of concern for her displeasure, "your grace's
                  gentlemen ushers have become so malapert under your majesty's favor, that the nobles of the court
                  must stand aside as they pass."
               "Nay, my lord, hadst thou been less confident of our forbearance, thou'd have
                  thought our servants more courteous. Thy audacious pride, my lord, is a stumbling
                  stone in thy way, and may one day break thy neck if thou cast it not aside."
               "I have already measured my steps, please your grace, and learnt to tread without
                  danger of tripping," responded Leicester, in a tone of such mock humility and
                  assurance as to provoke the queen still more.
               "My lord, we shall repress thy presumption," she cried, stamping on the floor, and
                  forgetting at once the modesty of the woman and the dignity of the queen. "We
                  shall have but one mistress here, and no master; and look ye well that no ill
                  happen to our trusty servant, lest it be severely required at thy hands."
               "I meant the good gentleman no ill, please your sacred majesty," replied
                  Leicester, looking over at Bouyer, and smiling as he would on a froward child, who
                  had just raised a staff to strike him, "but had merely thought of pulling his ears
                  for his impertinence. Had I known, however, that your grace would resent the
                  indiscretion so warmly——"
               "And what art thou, my Lord of Leicester," interrupted the queen, cut to the quick
                  by the significant sneer with which the earl accompanied the last sentence, "that
                  we should fear to assert our authority against thy good pleasure?"
               "Verily, a man of small account," replied Leicester ter, again making a humble
                  obeisance to the queen, ere he turned to leave; "but one, nevertheless, whose
                     claim on your majesty's forbearance this disgrace cannot reach,
                  and which must still survive were I sent to the Tower or the
                  block."
               As Leicester spoke, the queen gazed in his face, completely astonished at the
                  bold, measured tones in which he addressed her; but when he had concluded, and his
                  terrible words left her no room to doubt his meaning, she staggered back a step,
                  and the blood rushed from her face to her heart, freezing as it went. She stood
                  there for an instant, pale and speechless, before a crowd of courtiers, each
                  waiting with breathess anxiety to hear her order for the earl's arrest, for they
                  attributed her sudden paleness to excessive rage at his bold language and haughty
                  bearing; but no order came. The Countess of Harrington, who had entered the
                  antechamber shortly after her majesty, and stood close to her person, took her
                  hand as she staggered back, and squeezed her fingers hard to nerve her against a
                  weakness that might defeat all her precautions.
               "It lives," whispered Elizabeth in a voice only intended for the ear
                  of the countess; "there's no longer doubt, and, therefore, I must submit to this
                  indignity."
               "May it please your majesty," said the Duke of Sussex, approaching the queen, now
                  that her color had returned, without bringing back to her features, however, any
                  sign of anger or resentment, and speaking in his usual brusque manner—"may it
                  please your majesty, I think it would be well if your grace appointed his lordship director at once of the
                  black rod, the stole, and the bed chamber."
               "How so, my lord duke?" said the queen, turning an angry glance on the enemy of
                  her favorite.
               "Why, under your majesty's favor," replied Sussex, "since the noble earl holds all
                  offices of trust at home and abroad, he should, methinks, hold those also of your
                  majesty's household."
               "My lord duke," responded Elizabeth with strong irony, "we doubt not your grace
                  would gladly elevate my Lord of Leicester to a yet higher place than even our
                  bounty could bestow, wer't but in your grace's power."
               The earl, having made his last obeisance to her majesty with a peculiar smile on
                  his lip which he intended for her alone, and of which she knew well the meaning,
                  and waving his plumed hat in adieu to the courtiers present, turned to leave, when
                  he found himself directly in front of the Duke of Sussex, then on the act of
                  addressing the queen. Leicester halted on his step, and gazed insolently in his
                  rival's face, whilst the latter uttered his biting sarcasm, and then, bowing low,
                  touched the hilt of his rapier significantly with his fore finger, again glanced
                  at the duke, and strode from the room, the crowd falling back respectfully as he
                  passed.
               The queen, whose eye, though turned on Sussex, followed every motion of the earl,
                  and detected the secret movement of his finger, and the duke's nod of
                  acquiescence, said, as the door closed behind the former,—
               "Now, my lord duke, we would have thee see to it that no court broil grow out of
                  this affair."
               "Nay, but the noble earl, please your majesty," laughed Sussex, "is willing to
                  suffer chastisement for his insolence, and hath but signified his wish to receive
                  it at my hands. By my certie, it's a right charitable deed, and methinks your
                  majesty should not bar it."
               "Gadzooks, man," said Sir John Harrington, taking advantage of the fool's
                  privilege which her majesty always seemed to accord him—"gadzooks, man, let the
                  earl be; what business is't o' thine? Let them who spoiled the broth sup the
                  broth, an they like it;" and taking the duke by the arm, led him to the door of
                  the apartment. As it opened, however, the queen saw the Earl of Leicester standing
                  in the passage without, awaiting the exit of Sussex, his arms crossed on his
                  breast, and his face flushed with anger.
               "Hark thee, my lord duke," said Elizabeth, motioning his grace to return; "thou'lt
                  pleasure us more to pass through this door on the right,"—and she spoke in a voice
                  of stern severity,—"and confine thyself to thy apartments till our further
                  pleasure be known."
               "I crave your majesty's pardon," replied Sussex, somewhat sulkily, "but——"
               "Hush, hush, man," whispered Harrington; "art mad? Another word, and she'll send
                  thee to the Tower."
               The queen stamped on the floor, and without deigning another syllable, pointed
                  with her extended arm to the door, and
                  kept it in that position till the duke and Sir John Harrington had quitted the
                  chamber. As the door closed behind them, she cast a single glance at the
                  statue-like form of Leicester in the passage, and motioning to the crowd of
                  courtiers around her, withdrew, leaning on the arm of the Countess of
                  Harrington.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               WHEN the queen reëntered the privy chamber, followed by Lady Harrington, she
                  clasped her hands in a paroxysm of despair, and throwing herself into her fauteuil, motioned the countess to a seat beside
                  her.
               "O my God, it lives! it lives!" she ejaculated, in a voice broken and husky from
                  the terror which the threat of the Earl of Leicester had inspired, and looking as
                  pale as if she had just risen from the grave. "It lives! it lives! and the thought
                  crushes my soul; it makes me cower like a child with fear."
               "Fear!" repeated the countess, drawing the chair closer, and taking the queen's
                  trembling hand in hers. "I little thought the dauntless Elizabeth could thus
                  experience fear. What fearest thou, madam?"
               "Leicester; didst not hear him?"
               "Nay, my lord is an honest and right noble gentleman," affirmed the countess.
               "But it lives! it lives!" repeated Elizabeth, "and he will rule me as a slave.
                  Woman, woman, thou knowest not the man. How sayest thou he is honest? Hath he not
                  broken his promise? Did he not swear to me it should die. Ay, hath he not pledged
                  his faith, knelt at my feet?"
               "And what proof hast thou, madam, that he broke it?" said the countess.
               "Proof?" repeated the queen—"proof? Ah, but I had forgotten thou hast not studied his words,
                  his looks, as I have. Proof, alas! I've proof enough. I read it in his bearing—in
                  his eye—ere his lips avowed it. Did he not say his claim on our
                  forbearance should survive the gallows or the block."
               "Ay, truly, your majesty," said the countess; "but the noble lord referred,
                  doubtless, to his great devotion to your majesty's person and throne. Nay, I dare
                  be sworn my lord is right honest, and that fear under your grace's favor hath
                  crazed thy wit. Nerve thyself, my royal mistress, and shake off this dread, so
                  unbefitting a queen."
               "Verily I was once a queen," she replied, covering her face with her hands. "Ay,
                  but an hour gone, and I was a queen, and felt like a sovereign who had learnt to
                  rule and be obeyed; but now, my God, I've lost—lost my soul, my heart, my sceptre,
                  and my crown, by a single cast! He hath robbed me, like a thief, of all that I
                  valued most."
               "Hoot, tut! madam; and what boots it now to sorrow at the mischance?" interrupted
                  the countess. "Thou'rt not the first royal maiden who hath stumbled from momentary
                  weakness."
               "Weakness! pugh! thou'rt a fool," said Elizabeth impatiently, jerkring her head
                  away. "I mean not that—I mean the consciousness of possessing a supreme will. It
                  was that nerved my arm to fling princes and nobles at my feet. Now, I'm nothing,
                  nothing—conquered—lost, lost, lost," she cried, letting her head fall on the table
                  before her, in utter abandonment—"mastered—conquered—crushed— powerless as a
                  broken reed."
               The countess never remembered to have seen Elizabeth so completely prostrated as
                  she was now, under the threat which Leicester's words conveyed. She had been
                  admitted to her confidence more than any other lady of the court; was privy to
                  most of her intrigues since her coronation, and before; and often had cause to
                  wonder at her recklessness of those dangers which more than once perilled her
                  life, and to admire the undaunted energy with which she rose up to meet them. But
                  now she seemed to abandon herself to despair—to lose all her wonted
                  self-possession, and to relinquish every hope of extricating herself from the
                  toils in which Leicester had insnared her. The countess well knew, from long
                  experience of her royal mistress, it was no remorse for the past, nor dread of the
                  future, nor the loss of honor, nor the sense of self-debasement, that bowed her
                  head upon the table: it was the terrible consciousness that she was no longer
                  supreme—that there was one in the state who could bridle her tongue and tie her
                  hands. It was this harrowing thought that paralyzed every faculty of her being.
                  Elizabeth remained thus motionless for a time, her face buried in her hands, when
                  the countess, hardly knowing what she said, in her anxiety to console her,
                  muttered, in a tone between regret and reproach,—
               "By my good troth, this is more than I expected— the great Elizabeth crushed thus
                  by a misfortune so trifling."
               "Trifling!" ejaculated the queen, raising her head for an instant to look at the
                  countess, in surprise at her using such a term, and then burying it again in her hands—"trifling! Ha, ha! Thou
                  forgettest I'm the virgin queen." And she uttered an hysterical laugh, so low and
                  hollow that it seemed to come from the boards beneath her feet.
               "And art still, for aughtsthe world knows," replied the countess confidently.
               "Ay, but how long, should we venture to punish this audacious man?"
               "Nay, my gracious madam, I know not yet that his lordship deserveth punishment;
                  and even if he do, your majesty, methinks, hath safe prisons and prompt
                  headsmen."
               "But the proofs, woman, the proofs—would they die with him? The axe might silence
                  his tongue, but the train of evidence he hath prepared against such an event—the
                  suspicions already circulated abroad and at home—the claim on our
                  forbearance, which we cannot reach, and which he boldly avers shall survive him!
                  Ah! my poor Harrington, thou little dreamest to what lengths he hath gone, to
                  bring us into this dreadful strait. O my God," she continued, as the conviction
                  fell heavy upon her heart, that she must now choose between the loss of her
                  reputation and submission to the will and power of another—"my God, what have I
                  done? The head of the church, the reformer of morals, the scourge of adulterous
                  Rome, the denouncer of Rizzio. Ah! demon of hell, thou'st caught me at last—
                  caught me in the guise of the angelic Leicester."
               "Hush! softly, my gracious madam; there be long ears at court," said the countess,
                  looking about her, alarmed at the reckless tone to which her majesty was beginning
                  to elevate her voice, from the cautious whisper in which she had hitherto spoken;
                  and, tripping quickly across the apartment, to see if there was any one within ear
                  shot, beheld, to her astonishment, Sir Thomas Plimpton, looking out at a window in
                  an adjoining room, near the private stairway. The place where he stood was some
                  twenty paces from where the queen sat, and hidden by a fire screen completely from
                  her view, as she entered the privy chamber after dismissing the disputants.
                  Whether it was that taking it for granted Plimpton had left, she omitted the
                  necessary precautions against being overheard, or that her fears had entirely
                  obliterated the recollection of his interview,—certain it is, she started with a
                  sudden spring from her recumbent position to her feet, as the countess announced
                  the presence of a third party.
               "How now, sir?" demanded the queen, leaning on the arm of Lady Harrington, and
                  speaking with some difficulty of utterance, as Plimpton knelt before her. "Why art
                  thou still here?" And she glanced at the fire screen, and seemed to measure the
                  distance between it and the chair she had just quitted.
               Plimpton, who had heard enough of the conversation to satisfy himself of the truth
                  of his former suspicions, knowing well the keen eye of Elizabeth would search
                  every feature of his face the moment he raised his head, remained still on his
                  knee before her.
               "What, sir, have we not already dismissed thee?" she again demanded.
               "Your gracious majesty hath been pleased to do so; but——"
               
               "But! but me no buts, sir. How is it we find thee here, having spoken our royal
                  pleasure? Stand up, Sir Plimpton, and fear not to look us in the face, an thy
                  purpose hath been honest."
               Plimpton rose at the royal command, but with a countenance as calm as if he had
                  just risen from prayer, and expressive only of concern for her majesty's
                  displeasure. The latter scanned every line of his face, and every motion of his
                  eye, and seemed not a little relieved to find nothing there to alarm her.
               "May it please your majesty," said Plimpton, in his usual drawling tone, "I had a
                  poor boon to beg, and ventured to await your majesty's return from the
                  antechamber."
               "Ay, sir, but we have returned full ten minutes gone."
               "An it please your majesty," he responded, "I feared to submit my petition till
                  your grace's vexation with the noble earl of Leicester had passed."
               "And how knowest thou it hath passed, sir," demanded Elizabeth, "and that we send
                  him not to play the malapert in the Tower, where every presumptuous and intrusive
                  meddler should be sent, to learn respect for his sovereign?"
               Plimpton's bold answer to this searching question removed all doubts from her mind
                  as to his possession of the secret.
               "Nay, were he sent there, please your majesty, he doubtless had lost your
                  majesty's favor, the which he averreth to be impossible."
               "Impossible!"
               "Ay, truly, madam, and therefore he presumeth to play the braggart, where and when
                  it likes him best, little recking whether in the laced jerkin of the court, or the
                  long cloak and slouched hat of the night walker."
               The queen glanced a significant look at the countess, and then, turning her
                  indignant eye on the tall knight, (for she would have no lips but her own speak
                  slightingly of Leicester,) said to him in a somewhat scornful tone, "Take ye heed,
                  take ye heed, Master Plimpton, thou slanderest not the earl, for by our royal
                  faith, he might cut thy tongue out, ere thou hadst time to cry him mercy; but of
                  my lord's night walking, what doth it concern thee, man?" pursued Elizabeth, again
                  restored to her wonted self-possession; "or hath he carried his rapier 'neath his
                  long cloak to run it through thy lank body, that thou fearest him so much?"
               "Nay, please your grace's majesty, he maketh better use o't than to frighten
                  churls like me; ay, even for the escorting of willing queans and
                  puling babies from the royal palace."
               If a single doubt remained on the queen's mind as to Plimpton's possession of her
                  secret, this reply completely removed it; she felt, the instant he pronounced the
                  words, that he knew nothing beyond the bare fact of the infant's removal from the
                  court; otherwise, he was too prudent a man to allude to it.
               Plimpton himself felt he must play a bold game for his life, a life which he now
                  held on a precarious tenure. Did he betray but a suspicion of the infant's true
                  maternity, either by look or word, he knew well his head would fall ere the sun had gone down. And
                  therefore it was that, completely to deceive and blindfold Elizabeth, he trenched
                  so closely on the very subject of her apprehension. Indeed, so closely did he
                  shave the truth, (if one may venture to speaks so,) that the mispronunciation of a
                  single letter had cost him his life.
               "Well, well," she replied, resuming her seat, "we must not take cognizance of
                  those matters, since we cannot prevent them; and we'd have thee, Master Plimpton,
                  to guard thy slippery tongue from babbling on such delicate themes, lest thou dost
                  scandal, mayhap, to our royal palace. And now, sir, what of this boon thou'd beg
                  of us? Hast caught the flying damosel yet? and what hath become of the hero of the
                  tartan bonnet and the green doublet?" And the queen turned a smile upon the
                  countess as she spoke.
               "It's on this very matter I have made bold to await your majesty's leisure and
                  crave your royal commands. This Scot, it seems, hath more weighty business on hand
                  than the rescue of a silly wench from your majesty's pursuivants." And he drew
                  forth a packet from his pocket, and respectfully presented it to the queen.
               "Ah, what may this be?" she said, running her eye down to the signature: "from our
                  good cousin of Scotland; no less! and accrediting her faithful servant, Master
                  Rodger O'Brien, to sir Geoffrey Wentworth, of Brockton, counselling him to send
                  his daughter Alice to Holyrood, forthwith, under the bearer's honorable escort,
                  and himself to fly to France and escape the impending danger."
               "So this is thy lady love, our good sister would filch thee of. Ah, by our royal
                  honor, we shall take good care the silly wench cross not the borders in such
                  company; it would but ill become us, the sovereign and guardian of our subjects,
                  to suffer this errant lady to fly our protection under single escort of such a
                  springald; and an Irishman too, if we can judge by the name. Ah, but what is this,
                  man?" she ejaculated, as she opened a small packet carefully enclosed in the
                  other, and read a few lines—"To her right trusty friends, De Foys and the Marquis
                  of Quadra, French and Spanish ambassadors at our court; hah! she complaineth of
                  our plotting with her enemies in Scotland, and prays the interference of Charles
                  and Philip to save her from our machinations: excellent well, good sister and
                  cousin! and let's see; ay, and so thou hast sent a right trusty messenger, Master
                  Rodger O'Brien: ah, by the mass, this is too serious a joke. How camest thou by
                  these letters, Sir Thomas?" she demanded.
               "My sergeant of the troop, please your majesty, found them lying on the road
                  between an alehouse called the 'White Hart' and Brockton Hall, whither this
                  O'Brien was journeying, when we came up with him."
               "Thou'rt certified they're in the handwriting of the Scotch queen?" inquired
                  Elizabeth.
               "Nay, please your majesty, I would be slow to affirm that, seeing I'm but an
                  indifferent judge of chirography; but your majesty hath doubtless authentic
                  letters of the Queen of Scots, and can best judge by comparison."
               
               "The ink on this second one," said Elizabeth, looking furtively at Plimpton, "is
                  somewhat paler, and the letters of the signature larger and more scattered, than
                  in the first; but the difference is trifling, and might be caused by hurry or
                  agitation of mind. Nay, as to comparison, we are so well versed with her majesty's
                  handwriting, that we need it not."
               "So here cometh an emissary from Holyrood in the tracks of Master Hay," she
                  continued, "and ere the latter be well rested after his journey, to appoint spies
                  in our very palace: ah, sir, this must be seen to!" and ringing the bell, she
                  ordered the usher to direct Sir William Cecil to present himself without delay.
                  "And where is this O'Brien and the wench to be found?" she inquired.
               "Report saith, please your majesty, she is seen sometimes at the Peacock Tavern,
                  and oftener at a place called Whinstone Hollow, in the forest."
               "Dost mean the spaewife's cavern?"
               "The same, please your majesty."
               "They call her Nell Gower, if we mistake not."
               "Nell Gower, of Whinstone Hollow, the Scotch sorceress," replied Plimpton.
               "Know you aught of this woman, Sir Thomas?"
               "I saw her but three times, please your majesty— once in the company of this Alice
                  Wentworth, on her escape from Brockton; again on the night of the rescue, in an
                  old house near the alley way through which the Scotch or Irish fellow fled with
                  the captive; and lastly, conveying an infant under her cloak from your majesty's
                  royal palace of Hampton, through the woods at midnight. More of her I know
                  not."
               "Dost think thou couldst procure us speech of this woman?" said Elizabeth, with
                  her usual composure.
               "Bring her to court, madam?"
               "Ay, at a late hour, and in our private cabinet; we would make trial of her
                  fortune telling."
               "It might prove a difficult task, please your majesty: those creatures who hold
                  communions and interchanges with the nether world are oft intractable to human
                  hands. But if your majesty wills it, I shall make the trial without delay."
               When Sir William Cecil entered the privy chamber, the Countess of Harrington asked
                  permission to withdraw, and Plimpton, who stood directly before the table at which
                  her majesty sat, moved back and gave way to the secretary as he approached.
               Elizabeth handed him, without remark, the letters of the queen of Scots, and
                  turning to Plimpton, reminded him of her wishes regarding the conduct of the Earl
                  of Murray before the council, which would open in a very few minutes, and then
                  dismissed him with a promise of warrants, under the seal of the secretary for the
                  arrest of Rodger O'Brien and Alice Wentworth.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               THE hall of passage between the royal robing room and the council chamber was
                  lined for some time, on both sides, with the dignitaries and officers of the
                  court, and many country nobles and gentlemen of birth, to welcome the queen, on
                  her first public appearance after her miraculous recovery. The gentlemen of the
                  royal body guard were stationed at all the entrances, and the principal stairways,
                  and along the corridors, at different points. The royal archers mounted guard on
                  the outer gates, relieving on this occasion the ordinary sentinels, dressed in
                  their best and gayest uniforms. Various bands of music had taken their positions
                  in front of the royal edifice, under their respective masters, who, with their
                  long, gold-headed canes and large hats, looked, as they strutted up and down in
                  front of their companies, the most important personages in the goodly array. Then,
                  as the appointed hour approached, ladies and gentlemen, of all ranks, even the fat
                  wives and daughters of the bourgeoisie were to
                  be seen tripping up the steps leading to the hall, and panting with haste lest
                  they might arrive too late for the pageant. Dukes and earls, and knights of high
                  degree, wearing the trappings of their different orders, and accompanied by their
                  ladies, preserved a more stately pace as they passed up through the crowd of less
                  distinguished guished spectators and took their places near the door of the
                  council chamber. The palace gates had been thrown open to the public this morning
                  by the orders of her majesty; and the assemblage arranged, as on all days of
                  public reception, each taking precedence according to rank, beginning with the
                  citizen classes at the near end of the hall, and graduating up to the foreign
                  princes and ambassadors, at the opposite extremity, where the ushers, with their
                     batons of office, stood guarding the door of the council room.
               The appearance of her majesty had now been expected for a full half hour, and many
                  began to fear the delay was caused by sudden indisposition arising from the
                  excitement of the occasion. The least noise or bustle at the near end of the hall
                  was mistaken for the royal entrée, and many a
                  head peeped out from the ranks to see, and many a gentle crush was given to remove
                  an arm or shoulder from intercepting the view.
               In front of both lines, and kneeling on one knee, were placed, at regular
                  intervals, a number of little girls of tender age, dressed in white, and holding
                  in their hands bouquets of white roses, as an offering to the virgin queen.
               At length, after long and anxious expectation, a door was heard to open suddenly,
                  and then the usher stepped forth and shouted, at the top of his voice, "The queen!
                  the queen! All ye lieges, fall back, and make way for the majesty of England."
               The words of the usher were caught up along the passage hall, out in the court,
                  and away far beyond the royal precincts. And "Long live the queen! God save Queen
                  Elizabeth! God save our virgin monarch
                  arch!" was heard on every side; and then the various bands struck up a lively
                  welcomed and the petronels and carabines of the military rang out joyous peals of
                  gratulation.
               As Elizabeth, resplendent with jewels, and wearing her little diamond crown pushed
                  far back from her bold and ample forehead, paced the hall with a stately step,
                  attended by her train-bearers and ladies of honor, she looked the very
                  impersonation of majesty. A smile of conscious power and gratified pride, despite
                  the rencontre of the morning, played round her lips, as she graciously bowed to
                  her loving subjects on either side, acknowledging their profound obeisances, and
                  accepting a bouquet now and then from the hands of her youthful worshippers. When
                  she had reached the middle of the hall, a child, much smaller than the rest,
                  stepped from her place into the passage, and smiling innocently in the queen's
                  face, presented her with a single white rosebud. Elizabeth received the offering,
                  and seemed much pleased with the gift and the giver, patted the child
                  affectionately on the cheek, and then, kissing the flower, placed it in her bosom,
                  under a jewelled cross, which she wore suspended from a necklace of pearls.
               "This," said Elizabeth, turning to the spectators, "we receive as a happy omen,
                  and we place it here, near our heart, praying God that the virtue of which it is
                  the emblem may abide there forever."
               These words, referring directly as they did to her vow of virginity, elicited only
                  expressions of sorrow and regret from the bystanders. Low murmurs of
                  disapprobation were heard along the ranks, and two or three nobles, bolder than
                  the rest, even ventured to remonstate with her majesty on her thus crushing the
                  hopes of her faithful and loving subjects. But Elizabeth shook her head, and
                  smiled sadly.
               "Why murmur ye thus, good friends?" she said; "know ye not it is the will of
                  Heaven? Ah, pray for us, rather, that we may be able to fulfil so precious a
                  destiny."
               "But please your gracious majesty," persisted another—
               "Nay, nay, my good lord, we must not hear thee on this point;" and motioning him
                  gently back with both hands, she continued her slow pace up the hall, bowing on
                  each side with the most gracious condescension.
               As she approached the door of the council chamber, her busy eye caught the tall,
                  dark form of the Earl of Murray in a position evidently intended to attract her
                  attention, and the thin, black visage of Sir Thomas Plimpton resting almost on his
                  shoulder. It was not her intention, however, to notice either, and turning her
                  head to speak to one of her maids of honor, she proceeded in that attitude till
                  she passed the spot. As soon as she reached the door, it opened, and the usher of
                  the black rod announced, "Her most sacred majesty, the queen." The members of the
                  council received her, in their robes of office, at the threshold, and fell back to
                  give her passage to the chair of state. The doors then closed, the ladies of honor
                  and train-bearers retired by another way, and her majesty, having received the
                  congratulations of her ministers, opened the council.
               
               Having discussed various matters connected with the foreign policy of the
                  government, and received the sanction of her majesty for measures which the
                  council had thought proper to take during her illness in relation to the Huguenot
                  rebellion, and the increase of the navy, &c., Sir William Cecil begged to call
                  her majesty's attention to affairs at home, and, among other things, adverted to
                  the intercepted despatches of the Queen of Scots.
               "Our good sister hath been acting a sorry part towards us of late," said
                  Elizabeth. "I would she knew us better, my lords."
               "Please your majesty," replied Cecil, "the Queen of Scots hath hitherto known your
                  grace only as a loving sister and cousin; but since she hath not mended by the
                  relation, your majesty's council thinks it high time, for the well being of the
                  state and of religion, nay, of your gracious majesty's royal person, she would now
                  begin to know thee as a sovereign."
               "'Tis a sad alternative, my good lords," said Elizabeth.
               "Yea, but it's the last she hath left to your majesty."
               "True—and yet our heart revolteth at the bare thought of using hard measures with
                  one so near akin. What advise ye, my lords?"
               "First, please your majesty," said Cecil, rising and unfolding a paper, "the
                  council advises the immediate arrest and examination of the bearer of these
                  despatches, Master Rodger O'Brien, and accordingly begs to submit this warrant for
                  your majesty's sign manual;" and so saying, he laid the document before the
                  queen.
               "Nay, nay," said the latter, running her eye over the parchment, "the affair being
                  of some moment, and delicate withal, we would fain intrust it to our faithful
                  servant, Sir Thomas Plimpton." And erasing the name of the sergeant-at-arms, she
                  substituted that of her confidant. "And now we think," she said, drawing back
                  again the instrument she was handing to Cecil, "we must not separate this
                  hard-fisted gallant from his lady love;" and calmly smiling, she took the pen and
                  wrote the name of Alice Wentworth after that of Rodger O'Brien. "And now, Sir
                  William," she added, handing him the warrant, "since this needs must be done, see
                  that it be executed with all convenient despatch."
               Cecil bent his knee to receive the warrant, and then gave it to his under
                  secretary, with the necessary directions.
               "This double dealing, on the part of our good cousin, my lords," said Elizabeth,
                  "is most painful to us, and were we not blest with a great measure of forbearance,
                  might lead to right serious difficulties. But, poor child, she is young, and hath
                  doubtless acted in this matter under advice of evil counsellors. So we must
                  prevent her majesty bringing injury to herself, rather than resent what she hath
                  been willing to do unto us."
               "I fear me, please your majesty," said Sir Henry Norris, "thy great forbearance
                  and excessive charity may yet involve your grace in trouble."
               "Nay, how can that be, Sir Henry, since charity is the queen of Christian virtues,
                  and therefore most befitting a female sovereign?"
               
               "Under your grace's favor," replied Norris, "if your majesty pardon such
                  traitorous conduct so easily, the evil may soon come to such a head as to endanger
                  your majesty's throne."
               "Mercy, Sir Henry, is as much an attribute of sovereignty as justice, and more
                  pleasant in the exercise withal."
               "Right royally spoken, gracious madam; but your majesty must not forget that what
                  thou mayst pardon as a woman, thou canst not always as a queen."
               "O, fie! fie! Sir Henry; thou'rt too severe. Charity maketh not such nice
                  distinctions. We should ever be readier to pardon than to punish. And who knoweth
                  but this springald may give some satisfactory explanation touching these
                  despatches? Right gladly would we see our good cousin cleared of this foul
                  business."
               "There's but little hope, I fear, under your grace's pardon," pursued Norris, well
                  knowing how much his persistence pleased her, though she seemed to discountenance
                  it.
               "She is young, Sir Henry—not three years a queen."
               "Young in years, your grace, but old in the science of intrigue."
               "Truly, ay, she hath studied too long, poor silly girl, in the school of his
                  eminence of Lorraine; and it may not be denied, my lords, we've many times
                  overlooked our cousin's faults, that evil tongues might lack wherewith to speak
                  evil things, and hoping— alas! in vain—that our forbearance might one day soften
                  her heart."
               "And so your grace's charity hath degenerated into criminal weakness, if I dare be
                  so bold as thus to speak in your majesty's presence."
               "Criminal weakness, man?" said Elizabeth, affecting to frown at the
                  expression.
               "So your majesty's council hath thought fit to term it."
               "Nay, sir, wouldst turn catechist?"
               "Not I, madam—methinks I would make but a sorry catechist to Elizabeth of England.
                  'Tis my poor zeal that pleadeth your majesty's cause, even against thy royal will.
                  Beware, madam, beware lest your majesty foster an evil that may yet prove
                  incurable."
               "Verily," replied Elizabeth, after pausing a moment to reflect on Sir Henry's
                  words, and sighing heavily as she spoke—"verily, it doth grieve us much to hear of
                  so many of her plots and conspiracies against our person and throne, despite our
                  good will towards her. Truly we have taken much pains to be a good mother to the
                  Queen of Scots, and yet she hath behaved to us as to a cruel stepdame."*
                  
               
               
                  *Elizabeth's own words.
               "Then try an opposite course, madam, and provide in time for your majesty's safety
                  and that of the state."
               "Well, and what wouldst have us do, Sir Henry? Hast hit upon a remedy?"
               "Ay, marry have I, madam! Hang this O'Brien, and every messenger and envoy from
                  the Scotch court, and order passports for the Scotch ambassador, if Mary Stuart renounce not, without delay, her
                  pretensions to the succession."
               "What, man!" ejaculated Elizabeth, "and bring the armies of France and Spain upon
                  our bankrupt realm?"
               "Something of the like must soon be done," interposed Cecil, raising his tall,
                  commanding form, and speaking with the deep-toned voice of an oracle; "some means
                  must soon be taken for the safety of thy royal person and crown, or this foolish
                  woman and her wicked conspirators may run beyond your majesty's reach. Most
                  gracious madam, thou'rt a great instrument in the hands of God, and must one day
                  account to him for the manner in which thou shalt have done thy work—not as the
                  kinswoman and friend of Mary Stuart, but as sovereign of England, and spiritual
                  head of God's church." And bowing low, he again resumed his seat.
               "Heaven direct us!" muttered Elizabeth, resting her forehead on her open palm.
                  "Ours is a hard fate. The humblest of our subjects hath right to consult his own
                  inclinations, but alas! we have none. Ever—ever sacrificing our will to our duty;
                  our will inclining us to pardon, and our duty to punish. Ah, would we were born a
                  peasant's daughter, to carry a shepherd's crook instead of a royal sceptre; our
                  arms weary with wielding this heavy appendage of sovereignty, my lords; we would
                  fain lay it down a while."
               "Thy royal arms are wearied, please your majesty," again rejoined Norris—"wearied,
                  not from striking, but from threatening. Strike but one good blow, my noble queen,
                  and thou mayst lay down thy sceptre in peace."
               "Ah, one good blow! What meanest thou by that, man? Could one good blow bring
                  peace to our realms?"
               "One head is worth a thousand, madam."
               "A thousand!"
               "Ay, please your majesty."
               "I understand thee not, Sir Thomas. Thou speakest in riddles."
               "Nay, madam, my words are plain, and big with no secret meaning."
               "One head worth a thousand," she repeated, fixing her eyes keenly on her minister.
                  "What! Gad's death, sir! thou surely darest not—eh, man, thou dost not mean——" And
                  she hesitated in affected error at the thought of something she feared to
                  utter.
               "I crave your majesty's pardon," replied Norris.
               "'Sdeath, 'sir, thy words were ill chosen, or they aimed at a—a—at a crowned head.
                  Speak out, Sir Thomas; was't not so?"
               "Nay, I do beseech your majesty——"
               "And what meant thou, sir, by one head worth a thousand? Didst not mean the
                  queen's?"
               "The queen's—the Queen of Scots," repeated Norris, looking round the room,
                  surprised and hurt at the imputation; "may God forefend, your majesty, I thought
                  not of so huge a crime."
               "Well, then, Sir Blunderer, we would have thee choose thy words better, when thou
                  must needs inter-meddle with such delicate subjects. Truly, my good lords," she added, blushing slightly, and biting
                  her tongue with vexation at the disappointment—"truly, we have heard so many evil
                  reports of our royal neighbor, and so many urgings to take extreme measures with
                  her for the safety of religion and of the state, that,—ha, ha!—marry, we thought
                  our trusty councillor here had lost his wit, like some others we see around us,
                  and ventured to recommend the decapitation or imprisonment of our fair cousin. Ha,
                  ha! our womanish fears have strained thy speech over-much, Sir Thomas, and so we
                  must crave thy pardon for the mistake."
               The queen then intimatedd that the council had terminated, and was about to
                  command the admission of the foreign ambassadors, when Cecil again rose, and
                  submitted a paper to her majesty for her approval and signature, apologizing for
                  its omission till so late an hour, and observing at the same time that it was
                  merely an order of council under her majesty's sanction to Lord Scrope, touching
                  the examination of Dr. Heath, the nonjuring Archbishop of York.
               "Ah! and by the rood, we had almost forgotten the venerable doctor. Still a Tower
                  prisoner?"
               "Nay, please your majesty," responded Cecil, "he was confined in the Tower but a
                  few years, whence he was conveyed, by the royal orders, to his residence in
                  Yorkshire, where he hath since been enjoying the freedom of his demesne."
               "And ungratefully abusing the privilege, if we remember rightly, by communing with
                  Suspected traitors and open enemies of God's holy church. And doth he still deny
                  our spiritual supremacy?" she inquired, whilst a peculiar expression of
                  countenance, half smile, half sneer, told how little she regarded the prerogative,
                  except, indeed, as a matter of state policy.
               "Time, please your majesty," replied Cecil, "instead of moderating his opposition,
                  hath made him more obstinate. Albeit his head is white with the snows of eighty
                  years, and his hands palsied so that he can hardly use his walking stick, yet will
                  he shake it still in the face of his keeper, and stoutly deny your majesty's
                  supremacy over the church of God."
               "Poor old bishop," said Elizabeth compassionately, "he should rather think of the
                  grave into which he must needs soon drop, than thus foolhardily persevere in
                  maintaining his heterodoxy. But how readeth the order of council? Ah, let's
                  see—'That he must declare the full truth of why he wandereth abroad, and if he
                  will not be plain, to use some kind of torture to him, so as to be without great
                  bodily hurt.'"
               "Pincers?" said Elizabeth, looking inquiringly at Cecil, and returning the
                  paper.
               "Ay, please your grace, pincers, or some such light torture."
               "Ah, well," she assented; "for truly it would grieve us much to have our old
                  friend suffer bodily injury for sake of his past good services. So we shall look
                  to thee, Mr. Secretary, that the torture be not applied beyond his strength. And
                  now, my lords," she added, "we shall receive our friends without."
               
               The members of the privy council fell back on each side at a signal from her
                  majesty, and divided into groups, to talk over the business of the morning. The
                  usher threw open the doors, announcing the names of the foreign ambassadors; and
                  De Foys, Quadra, Mellville, and others, whose names are long since forgotten,
                  entered the chamber dressed in their robes of office, and made their humble
                  obeisance to her majesty of England.
               Elizabeth received them graciously, thanked them for their friendly attentions
                  during her illness, and expressed her gratification at the good news they brought
                  from their respective courts. "As for my Lord Mellville," she added, "we warrant
                  he hath but little to say from our good sister of Scotland, seeing her majesty
                  hath transferred her confidence to Monsieur De Foys, and our learned friend, here,
                  the Marquis of Quadra."
               The parties thus addressed looked at each other surprised and confounded at the
                  insinuation conveyed by her majesty's words.
               "May it please your gracious majesty," said De Foys at length, "I have the
                  misfortune not to comprehend your majesty's words."
               "Nay," responded Elizabeth, somewhat pleasantly, "say, rather, it doth not suit
                  thee to comprehend us."
               "I would then speak falsely, madam," replied De Foys.
               "And what saith the Marquis of Quadra? Doth he fail, also, to comprehend us?"
               "I, at least, most gracious madam, have not the special confidence of her majesty
                  of Scotland, nor have I heard aught of late touching Scottish affairs, save the
                  discomfiture of the rebel lords at Biggar, which news, my Lord Murray, the chief
                  rebel, hath this morning conveyed to your majesty."
               "What my lord, this bold, bad man at our court?"
               "He is without, please your majesty," replied Quadra, pointing to the door, "and
                  awaits your majesty's pleasure to enter and report himself."
               "Report himself," repeated Elizabeth; "ah, marry, my good lord, such words sound
                  strangely in our ears. We receive no reports from rebels, whether of our own
                  kingdom or of others. How comes this insult, Mr. Secretary—a conspirator against
                  the peace, nay, mayhap the life of our royal neighbor and cousin, waiting audience
                  in our council chamber?"
               "I know not, please your royal grace" responded Cecil.
               "Bouyer," said Elizabeth to the usher of the black rod, "how comes it my Lord
                  Murray of Scotland waits admittance without the royal permission?"
               "This order, please your majesty, hath been handed me by an officer of the court,"
                  replied Bouyer, "to admit his lordship under your majesty's pleasure."
               Elizabeth took the paper from the usher's hand, and glancing at it for an instant,
                  exclaimed, "Gads, man, thy wits have left thee: this paper is not of recent date;"
                  and then flinging it pettishly on the table before Cecil, reprimanded the usher
                     severely for his negligence.
                  "Nevertheless," she proceeded, "we shall admit him, my lord marquis, and see on
                  what intent he cometh hither. Verily, one would suppose our royal self privy to
                  his plottings, since he flieth thus to our court after his shameful behavior. Ha,
                  ha!" she added, laughing; "doubtless he cometh to beseech our intercession."
               "I right well believe he hath much dependence on your grace's good will," said
                  Quadra, smiling just enough to give meaning to his words.
               "I trust," added Mellville, addressing one of the council, and elevating his voice
                  so as to be heard by Elizabeth—"I trust the visit of this rebel lord, who hath
                  ever been the worst enemy of my royal mistress, will breed no ill between the
                  crowns."
               "Nor give countenance to the slanderous tales that have been circulated of her
                  majesty's jealousy of the young and handsome queen," subjoined De Foys.
               Elizabeth felt keenly these insinuations, but it was not her policy to notice
                  them. She had a delicate part to play in reference to Scotland, and sufficient
                  control, too, over her temper, to suffer no indirect allusions, at least, to
                  interfere with her plan of playing it out.
               "So, my good lords," she said, again resuming the subject of the intercepted
                  despatches, and addressing Quadra and De Foys, "ye are pleased to disclaim all
                  knowledge of Scottish affairs, save what hath reached ye through the ordinary
                  channels?"
               Both replied in the affirmative.
               "And know ye nothing whatever," she persisted, casting a suspicious look from the
                  corner of her eye, and smiling as she spoke, "of your appointments as secret
                  agents to her majesty, at our court?"
               "Secret agents, your majesty!"
               "Ay, secret agents; the word sounds better than spies, doth it not?"
               "We know not at what the charge aimeth, please your majesty," responded both
                  together.
               "Pugh! my lords, your wits wax dull this morning. Why, she would have ye watch us
                  well in the Netherlands, and keep her advised of our intentions respecting
                  herself. She would have ye report to Philip and Charles the troubles we have
                  created in the Low Countries for France and Spain; so that their aid might not be
                  wanting against so treacherous a power as ours, when the Italian and Scotch
                  conspirators had brought their measures to a head."
               "Please your majesty," said De Foys, irritated by the accusation, (which he
                  strongly suspected was fabricated by herself, to criminate the Queen of Scots,)
                  "this is somewhat of a grave charge against ambassadors from the two greatest
                  courts of Europe."
               "Nay, monsieur," said Elizabeth, "we do not accuse thee."
               "True, gracious madam, but it comporteth ill with our sacred office to have us
                  supposed capable of such meanness. And should your majesty be of opinion that we
                  could so far forget the honor of our sovereign, of whom we are the
                  representatives,— albeit unworthy,—as to become the spies of the Queen of
                  Scotland, I, for one, must take my leave of your majesty and your majesty's
                  court."
               
               "Marry, my good Monsieur De Foys," said the queen in a tone of surprise, "we but
                  alluded to certain intercepted despatches of our good cousin, addressed to the
                  French and Spanish ambassadors, and lo! thou'rt out of sorts in an instant."
               "Despatches addressed to us, madam?"
               "Ay."
               "And containing such infamous proposals?"
               "Ay, verily—call them what thou pleasest."
               "And from the Queen of Scotland?"
               "'Sdeath! sir, we will not be questioned in such fashion," replied Elizabeth,
                  contracting her brows, and moving uneasily in her chair. "Here they are, sirs;
                  read them, since thou seemest to doubt our royal word;" and she handed him the
                  letters. "Truly, my lords, it doth give us much pain thus to expose the duplicity
                  of one whom we could have loved as dearly as our life. Alack, alack a day! we had
                  hoped to find a better heart in Mary Stuart."
               When De Foys and the Marquis of Quadra had read over the two letters, one
                  addressed to Sir Geoffrey Wentworth, and the other to themselves, they handed them
                  to Mellville.
               Elizabeth turned to speak to one of her council on some unimportant matter,
                  apparently indifferent as to the result of Mellville's examination of the
                  paper.
               "This," said the latter, after a close inspection of the writing, "is by the
                  queen's own hand, to the knight of Brockton, and this other is a counterfeit."
               "Ha!" cried Elizabeth, turning suddenly on the speaker, "a counterfeit?"
               "This paper hath never been used by her majesty ty of Scotland, please your
                  grace," said Mellville firmly.
               "Thy reasons, my lord," demanded the queen.
               "Please your majesty, the paper is not that her majesty useth, albeit it
                  resembleth it greatly; and moreover, it lacketh the secret mark."
               "Ah! the secret mark; and that is——"
               "Nay, under favor, madam, I must not speak thus of state secrets."
               "Nay, then, by our princely honor, we shall be right glad to see our fair cousin
                  cleared of this unseemly blemish," said Elizabeth, whilst a gleam of joy seemed to
                  overspread her features, "and shall take speedy measures to see her innocence
                  forthcoming. How camest thou by those papers, Mr. Secretary?"
               "They were found by Sir Thomas Plimpton's troop sergeant, please your majesty,"
                  replied Cecil, consulting his notes, "in Worcestershire, after the arrest of the
                  bearer, Master Rodger O'Brien, for having attempted the rescue of one Mistress
                  Alice Wentworth, a Popish recusant. They were lying by a little brook near an old
                  farm house, and within a short mile of the hostelrie called the 'White Hart
                  Tavern,' kept by one William Waglippet." Cecil then resumed his seat.
               The queen now directed the usher to summon Sir Thomas Plimpton; but after some
                  search, it was ascertained that the gentleman had left the court, on horseback,
                  attended by a single servant, and gone no one knew whither.
               "Then," said the queen, "we must needs defer further inquiry into this ungracious affair till
                  Sir Thomas Plimpton's return. In the mean time, we shall give audience to this
                  great arch conspirator and rebel, and would have ye, my lords, the foreign
                  ambassadors, if it so please them, in especial, to witness the interview."
               "Announce the Lord James Stuart, Earl of Murray, and give him passage only to the
                  bar of the council board—no nearer. Hugh, hugh! my lords, we can ill bear the
                  breath of a traitor."
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               THE reader will remember that we left our old friend Sir Geoffrey Wentworth sound
                  asleep in the vaults of Glastonbury Abbey—the monk's black cloak thrown over him,
                  and the red handkerchief tied carefully on his head. The little wood fire still
                  crackled on the hearth, the little lamp still burnt brightly before the
                  tabernacle, brother Felix was busy at his beads; but Sir Geoffrey was sound asleep
                  on his pallet of straw.
               Many a long mile father Peter travelled that morning on the high road, before
                  sunrise, with his gray blouse wrapped about him, and his stout staff grasped
                  firmly in his hand; and right patiently and cheerily did Whitret Macbairn trot
                  after him with the little box of sacred vestments slung over his shoulder. And
                  when the blessed sun mounted up above the hill tops of Worcestershire, and the
                  houses on the wayside began to open their doors, and the chimney tops to send
                  forth their smoke curling up against the clear blue sky, then many a circuitous
                  route did the proscribed priest and his dumb clerk take through the fields and
                  woods to escape detection, or to avoid meeting the various travelling parties they
                  descried approaching in the far distance. And often would the priest relieve
                  Whitret of his little load, when crossing the rivers or ascending the steep hills,
                  and, sometimes times, sit down on the
                  bank of a stream under a shady sycamore, and recite the small hours of his
                  Breviary, whilst the poor hunchback, glad of the rest, stretched himself beside
                  him on the green grass.
               But Reddy Connor, where was he all this time, and where the precious books the old
                  man confided so strictly to his charge? Alas! what could Reddy do against a
                  sergeant's guard armed with deadly weapons, and ready to use them at the slightest
                  provocation. He had neither sword nor dagger, carabine nor pistol, to defend
                  himself, much less protect the sacred treasure of his master. And fortunate it was
                  so—fortunate both for himself and Sir Geoffrey, for the one in defending his
                  charge would probably have lost his life, and the other a sincere friend and right
                  trusty servant.
               Reddy Connor was now about the age of twenty-five or thirty, a stout, gay,
                  rollicking, good-looking Irishman as ever broke a skull in a tent, or danced at a
                  fair in the barony of Tyrconnel. He was but four or five years in the service of
                  Sir Geoffrey, and yet, short as was the time, he seemed to take more interest in
                  the affairs of the family, and make himself more at home, than those who had been
                  "to the manner born." In fact, Reddy had every thing his own way at
                  Fubbarnasiggart. In fair or market, wake or wedding, at football or hurling match,
                  in the scrimage or in the foray, Reddy was regarded as a sort of director or
                  lawgiver; and when obliged to fly from Tyrone to Dublin, and from Dublin to Clare,
                  the O'Brien country, and from Clare to England, and found himself at last
                  comfortably fixed at Brockton Hall, he could never help thinking he was still a
                  kind of privileged person, and entitled to have his own will in every thing. This
                  assumption on Reddy's part was a severe trial to the old domestics of the hall,
                  for the first year or two, after he came amongst them, and many a complaint did
                  they make to Sir Geoffrey and Mrs. Alice. The men servants complained of his
                  blows, and the women of his jokes, the brewer that he cursed the lightness of his
                  ale, and the groom that he killed his horses. But Reddy needed them not, having
                  always a reason to give that satisfied Sir Geoffrey, or set Alice laughing at his
                  Hibernian blunders. At length he became a sort of master at Brockton Hall, and
                  took upon himself not only the regulation of the domestic concerns of the
                  household, but even to lecture Sir Geoffrey occasionally on the imprudence of
                  confiding his property entirely to the management of his steward, and shutting
                  himself up day and night in his library, with bits of flies, and birds, and
                  beetles, and bumblebees, and outlandish instruments, and old moth-eaten books and
                  pictures, and so forth, and worse than all, keeping his young mistress forever
                  copying from old papers, and decayed parchments, till he wore the bloom from her
                  cheek, and the brigtness from her eye, and the lightness from her heart, and all
                  for no reason in the world. Sir Geoffrey, on such occasions, would sometimes start
                  up from his chair, and order the impudent fellow instantly from the room, or
                  listen to him, perhaps, patiently, for a time, and then begin some elaborate
                  argument to convince the stupid blockhead of the advantages the church and the
                  world would one day derive from his midnight studies. But the Irishman had no relish for such
                  arguments, and would generally start off muttering some malediction on himself for
                  staying with a man who was enough to break any body's heart to manage. "By all
                  that's bad," he would cry, after escaping from Sir Geoffrey in the full heat of a
                  learned disquisition, and popping his head into Alice's apartment—"by all that's
                  bad, I'll set fire to the library and burn all them divils iv instruments to
                  ashes; it's worse he's gettin', so it is, after all my trouble with him."
               But though Reddy was quick, rapid, and impulsive by nature, he had learnt, since
                  he came to reside in England, to control his waywardness, and accommodate himself
                  in a certain degree to the habits of the people with whom he had to deal. And then
                  his fund of humor was inexhaustible; not the broad jest that made you laugh for a
                  moment, but the quiet, droll, dry fun, that kept you tittering by the hour.
               When Sir Geoffrey had disappeared in the ruins of the abbey, Reddy sat himself
                  down on the steps, and leaning his head on his hand, allowed the horse to pick
                  through the nettles and long grass that grew luxuriantly around. He had not been
                  long, however, in that position, when his ear caught the sound of horses rapidly
                  approaching by the road he had just travelled, and starting to his feet, he beheld
                  some half dozen troopers dashing up towards him, their swords clashing against
                  their horses' sides, and their helmets glancing in the moonbeams.
               Reddy saw he was fairly caught. He could neither escape nor defend himself, and
                  therefore he resolved to draw on his wit, as he often did before, to help him out
                  of his difficulty.
               "Hoa, fellow," cried Houghton, the burly sergeant whom we saw at the White Hart,
                  and now leader of the party, mounted on a powerful black Flemish gelding, and
                  spurring him up within a few feet of where Reddy stood; "hoa, there! Who art thou,
                  fellow, and what wares are these?" he inquired, pointing to the box in the
                  wagon.
               "O, don't be in such a flusther, man," replied Reddy, throwing the reins over his
                  horse's neck, and then quietly thrusting both hands into the pockets of his Dutch
                  hose—"don't be in such a flusther, man, and take the world aisy."
               "Hilloa," vociferated another tall trooper, who had dismounted and sprung up the
                  steps, just as Sir Geoffrey and the priest disappeared in the deep shadow of the
                  old walls; "hoa! yonder fleeth the old Papist recusant;" and he fired a random
                  shot in the direction of the fugitive, which was followed instantly by two or
                  three others.
               "Hold," shouted Houghton, "hold ye there, I say; no more balls or bolts. We come
                  not to kill, but capture, my merry men. Search the abbey for the old fox; but I
                  charge ye see to it that no harm befall him. Soho, there, but who art thou?" he
                  again demanded, turning to Reddy.
               "Me?"
               "Ay, thou,—thyself."
               "Is't my name ye mane?" and he gave a jerk to his hose, and glanced stupidly at
                  the trooper.
               "Ay, marry is it, thy name! out with't."
               "Divil a much good that id do ye, honest man, if I tould ye."
               
               "Answer me, fellow! or I'll crop thy ears off for thy sauciness."
               "Aisy, man, aisy; yer in a mighty great hurry. Speak a body civil, and ye'll come
                  off jist as well. Is it my name by the father's, or the mother's side, yer
                  wantin'?"
               Houghton drew his sword, and demanded to know, without further preface, if he were
                  a follower of the knight of Brockton.
               "Av course I am," replied Reddy; "what else id I be?"
               "And where is he concealed in the ruins here?"
               "Faith, that's more than I can tell ye."
               "Answer me, fellow! art thou a fool, or wouldst fool me?"
               "No need av that," replied Reddy.
               "How so, churl?"
               "Why, shure, yer makin' a fool iv yerself. Arrah, then, who ir ye searchin' for at
                  all? if it's a fair question."
               "Thy master, dolt! where is he?"
               "And what d'ye want with him?" demanded Reddy, internally shuddering at every
                  noise he heard from the echoing walls above, lest it might be the pursuivants
                  returning with Sir Geoffrey under arrest.
               "Hark ye, man," said Houghton, satisfied at length, from the stupid look and
                  slobbering speech of the Irishman, that he was indeed a simpleton, and willing to
                  make use of him for his own purpose— "hark ye, man; dost know where Sir Geoffrey
                  hideth his gold at Brockton?"
               "Begorra, I won't tell ye," replied Reddy; "yer temptin' me like the divil; so
                  begone, Satan; I renounce ye."
               "What, man! I'm thy friend, and would do thee no evil."
               "Faith, I wouldn't trust ye! may be it's hang me ye'd do, if I tould ye the
                  sacret, and have all to yerself."
               "Nay, by my faith, I'll give thee what thou pleasest, if thou but bring me to the
                  place where this old knight hath been hoarding his wealth for so many years."
               "But shure they'd murdher me!"
               "Who?"
               "Tom Riddle, an' Jack Clinton, an' Ned Nicolson, them fellows at the hall above.
                  Begorra, they wouldn't lave a bone in me thegither."
               "Fear them not, good fellow," said Houghton, encouragingly; "I'll defend thee
                  against a score such cowardly boors!"
               "Why, man, that Tom Riddle id shiver me while ye'd wink. By the hokey! he'd knock
                  saucepans out iv iver a man in the barony. But shure, th' ould lad himself id send
                  ye to jail av he ketched ye."
               "Who? Sir Geoffrey?"
               "Ay, faith."
               "But he is up here," replied Houghton, smiling compassionately, and pointing to
                  the old walls. "We have little danger to dread in that quarter. So rouse thyself,
                  man, and look not so terrified."
               "Whisht! whisht! I tell ye," said Reddy, putting his hand to the side of his
                  mouth; "whisht, or he'll hear ye."
               
               "Hear me? repeated Houghton, looking round.
               "Ay, faith, he hears and knows ivery thing. Tom Riddle says he can hear the
                  thunder two hours afore it bracks, and see the sun an hour afore it rises. O, he's
                  the divil av an ould lad."
               "Ha, ha!" again laughed the trooper, amused at Reddy's innocence; "fear him not,
                  fear him not, in my company," and he slapped the Irishman on the shoulder to give
                  him confidence; "pluck up heart o'grace, man; thy master shall neither hear nor
                  see us, if we make good speed back to Brockton; and I promise thee, if thou but
                  bring me to sight of the old dotard's long-hoarded gold, I'll take thee with me to
                  London to see the sights, and bestow on thee all thy heart could desire."
               "O, murdher! to London! but then, shure it id be a sin to rob him, eh, wouldn't
                  it?"
               "Gramercy, man; the priest will assoil thee for an angel."
               "Wud he, in troth now—for an angel? Arrah, may be yer only jokin'."
               "Nay, I speak truly. I'll warrant thee absolution. So get thee on horseback, and
                  accompany me back to Brockton."
               "But the money's down in the cellar av the western tower, I tell ye, as I tould ye
                  afore, an Sewall, the steward, has the key."
               "Then Sewall is still at Brockton. Gadzooks! I thought he'd been dismissed long
                  since."
               "What for?" inquired Reddy, in a careless tone.
               "It matters not," replied Houghton. "But it pleases me much to hear he's still in
                  the knight's service. So ho! and it's there he hath been hiding it, the old miser,
                  for twenty years and more. People say he discovered the philosopher's stone,
                  Master Witless; is't so?"
               "What's that?" exclaimed Reddy, opening his eyes and looking at the pursuivant
                  with a vacant stare.
               "Why, that he found out the way of making as much gold as he pleaseth from sticks
                  and stones."
               "O, holy poker!" again exclaimed Reddy; "and did he make all the goold in them
                  bags that's down there av sticks and stones?"
               "Doubtless he hath," responded Houghton; "so get thee on horseback, I say again,
                  and let's visit this western tower, that we may examine his handiwork."
               "Is't on that ragin' baste ye'd put me?" said Reddy, looking askance at the large
                  troop horse still foaming at the mouth, and pawing the ground.
               "Ha, ha!" again chuckled Houghton, as he saw the Irishman fearfully glaring at the
                  impatient animal; "art afraid to ride?"
               "By the powers iv pewter, he'd smash me," cried Reddy, slinking off, and glancing
                  sidewise at the horse; "begorra, he wouldn't lave a dhrop in my carcass."
               "Nay, then, I'll carry thee behind me," said Houghton, vaulting on his horse, and
                  backing him up to the steps where Reddy stood timidly eying him; so up with thee!
                  jump!"
               "An what 'ill be done with the box there?"
               "What's in it?"
               
               "Books, ould books that wur written afore the flood; bad win to them for books;
                  many a sore heart they give me."
               "To Belzebub with the monkish superstitions," cried Houghton, impatiently; "up
                  with thee! leave it to the lazy churls above there to rifle, an they like it.
                  Haste thee, I say, or I'll be tempted to smarten thy fool's wit with my
                  hanger."
               "Murdher! but ye spake bould," ejaculated Reddy, stepping back and looking
                  doubtingly at the trooper; "begorra, I'm afeard iv ye."
               "Jump, ye scurvy idiot, jump, I say, or I'll slice thee on the sconce," he
                  vociferated, now completely deceived by Reddy's well-affected timidity, and
                  thinking he might succeed better by intimidation than allurement.
               When the Irishman had at length, after various efforts, succeeded in seating
                  himself safely behind his sturdy companion, the latter wound a blast on his horn,
                  and ordered the first man who appeared in answer to the summons to examine the
                  contents of the box, and then follow him back to Brockton, there to await his
                  orders.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               HOUGHTON, eager to possess himself of the knight's treasure,—who, as the story
                  went, had been living on herbs, and amassing gold, for more than a quarter of a
                  century,—spurred his horse as fast as the animal could speed under such a load,
                  intending to return as soon as he secured the plunder, and renew his search for
                  the old recusant among the ruins. He soon reached the hall, followed by his men,
                  with the exception of one or two who remained behind to rifle the box.
               The domestics of the ancient mansion, dressed in the antiquated livery of the past
                  century,—for Sir Geoffrey could as ill brook the new fashions as the new doctrines
                  of the period,—rushed in a crowd to the great door of the entrance hall, and were
                  not a little astonished to behold Reddy Connor, perched behind the very officer
                  who had left but an hour before.
               When the trooper reined in his horse in front of the door, and directed his
                  companion to dismount, the latter seemed to have some difficulty in complying with
                  the order, and in fact, made so much delay, and so many painful contortions of his
                  arms and legs, from one side to the other, that his fellow-servants, thinking he
                  was hurt, ran out to assist him. This was precisely what Reddy expected, and
                  taking advantage of the sergeant's
                  turning his back for a moment to loose his saddle girth, whispered certain
                  instructions to one or two of the domestics, winking at the same time most
                  comically, and jerking his thumb sideways at the tall, savage-looking officer.
               "I'm amost at death's door," he muttered, writhing as if with pain, and leering up
                  under his broad-brimmed hat at the bystanders; "begorra, I'm split in two with
                  that divil av a crupper."
               "Reddy hath some deviltry in his head," said one of the domestics in an under tone
                  to his next neighbor.
               "Ay, good faith," replied the other, "that fool's look betokeneth little good to
                  his captor."
               "Marry," added a third, "he's in his humor for an Irish frolic. By my certes, I
                  would hardly change places with that trooper fellow for a purse of crown
                  pieces."
               The sergeant, having loosed his saddle girths, ordered his men, who had now come
                  up, to hook their bridles to the trees in front of the house, and then retire with
                  the servants and consult the larder, whilst he transacted some business of moment
                  with his doughty companion. "Be cautious, however," he added, "that ye indulge not
                  over much in the wine cup or beer can, and be ye ready to answer my summons as
                  promptly as becometh the trusted servants of the queen's majesty. And thou, Master
                  Wiseacre," he continued, laying hold of Reddy by the arm, and dragging him towards
                  the house, notwithstanding his entreaties to "take him aisy, till he'd come to
                  himself again afther the joultin' and rackin' he got," entered the great hall,
                  followed by his men, still cursing the old Papist recusant and his arrant damsel
                  for the sharp chase they had given them, and loudly demanding to be served
                  instantly with the best in the cellar, to give them a relish for their morning
                  meal.
               "Away, now, and find the key of the cellar," commanded Houghton, as he entered a
                  small chamber in a remote part of the mansion, accompanied by Reddy.
               "Whist! whist!" said Reddy, "or they'll hear ye;" and carefully closing the door
                  of the apartment, he listened at the key-hole for an instant.
               "Now what'll ye give me?" he resumed. "Will ye give me three bags iv goold if I
                  get ye the key, and tell ye the place?"
               "Ay, willingly."
               "And bring me with ye to London?"
               "To court, if it so please thee."
               "On a pillion ahint ye?"
               "What, man! canst not ride on a saddle?"
               "O, begorra, no; I'd slither off, an may be be kilt into the bargain."
               "Ha, ha!" laughed Houghton, amused at Reddy's fears. "Well, well, be it as thou
                  wilt; I'll carry thee safely."
               "What'r ye laughing at me for?" demanded Reddy, letting his under lip fall
                  diagonally, and scratching his curly head, whilst he gazed at the sergeant with a
                  countenance full of wonder and profound stupidity. "By the hokey, may be ye think
                  am a fool."
               "Nay, nay," responded Houghton, endeavoring to repress his mirth, "I laughed but
                  at thy bad horsemanship."
               
               "An ye'll carry me on the pillion?"
               "Ay, truly, on a pillion stuffed with neiderdown an thou'lt so have it."
               "But will ye trot aisy?"
               "Nay, walk, if thou wilt."
               "Say upon yer conscience ye will."
               "My conscience? what mean'st thou by that?"
               "O, devil a much; it's an ould-fashioned thing we ust to swear by in Ireland,
                  beyont there. But am tould ye'r not throubled with it greatly in these parts.
                  Since the queen banished it from the court, they say it's grown mighty scarce, and
                  amost gone out iv fashion entirely."
               "Dost mean my honor?" said the Englishman.
               "That's the very thing," responded Reddy; "yer honor or yer conscience, it's all
                  the same. So ye'll promise me?"
               Houghton assented.
               "Well, then," said Reddy, "am satisfied. So ordher the pillion on yer horse this
                  minit, and I'll bring ye the key. I know where the ould janius hides it. Begorra,
                  I'll pay him off for all the scouldin' and batin' he used to give me. But ordher
                  one iv yer men to pillion the horse in a jiffy, for onct we get hoult iv the money
                  bags, we must be off, or Tom Riddle won't lave a bone in my body but he'll break
                  into smithereens."
               Having given the desired orders to one of his men, Houghton dismissed Reddy in
                  quest of the key, and then turned to examine the apartment in which he found
                  himself. It was situated in the western end of the mansion, and as well as he
                  could judge, not far distant from the tower, in the cellar of which the knight's
                  treasure was supposed to be concealed. The walls of this room were wainscoted with
                  native oak, which time and use had now turned almost black. Above the wainscoting,
                  and round the walls on either side, were various religious pictures and images,
                  carved in wood, and here and there a niche, with a saint in it, looking down
                  towards a table that stood in the middle of the apartment, as if their regards
                  were constantly fixed on the person who was accustomed to sit there. It was a
                  dark, sombre looking place, the windows being small, and partially obscured by the
                  ivy that trailed its long vines up the wall outside, and spread across the angles
                  of the stone frames. On the table, and about the floor, lay various articles of
                  female dress, thrown down carelessly, as if in the hurry of departure. One or two
                  little doors, that opened in the wainscoting, were left unlocked, and books and
                  papers appeared behind in the recesses. Houghton paced the room to and fro,
                  looking round him at the various objects which met his view, and kept striking the
                  images with the point of his sword as he passed, curious, perhaps, to ascertain of
                  what material they were composed. Having, apparently, satisfied his curiosity
                  respecting the statues, he began now to examine the closets underneath, and
                  pushing the doors open, drove his sword in several times among the books, probably
                  with the hope of finding something more valuable than old musty papers. He had
                  repeated this operation once or twice, when the point of his weapon struck
                     against a hard substance, which,
                  being dislodged from its place, rolled down upon the floor. Having picked up the
                  little article, he sat himself down at the table, and began to examine it. It was
                  an iron box, about three or four inches square, and half an inch thick, but
                  completely covered with rust, which had well nigh eaten it through. He turned it
                  two or three times up and down, in search of the lock or spring by which it
                  opened, but could find none. Impatient to discover the contents of a box so old
                  and so carefully fastened, he introduced the point of his dagger under the lid,
                  and burst it from the hinges. Alas for his disappointment! it contained neither
                  gold nor jewels.
               "Pshaw!" ejaculated the trooper; "I had hoped for something more valuable than
                  this to requite my pains. I oft heard of diamonds and precious stones found in the
                  recesses of old castles, where they had been carefully hid by the monks long ago;
                  but, my certie, there's little here to make a soldier's fortune. Natheless, let's
                  see, let's see." And taking a scroll of parchment from the box, he unrolled it,
                  and began to examine the writing it contained.
               "Ah, what be this?" he muttered; "Latin, or some such monkish chirography. Ay,
                  gramercy, some Popish prayers, I'll warrant; doubtless as old as the Evangelist;
                  or, mayhap, some of that ancient Scripture they're printing now in Dortrecht, and
                  making so much noise about. Ah, gadzooks! but here's something more readable, he
                  continued, unfolding an enclosure concealed in the parchment. "What says
                  this?"
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "To Sir Geoffrey Wentworth, our good friend and
                                 loving brother, greeting:
                           
                           "The above as thou'lt readily understand, it will behove thee to keep
                              safely, seeing it is the Baptisterium of a royal babe, which, albeit its birth be
                              but little known, may, in forthcoming times, become an object of
                              interest to the sovereign of these realms. I have duly entered the
                              name on the records of the parish of Evesham; but fearing lest harm
                              might come to the books in these troublous days, I send thee this (the
                              original) for safe keeping at Brockton, whereunto are appended the
                              names of the godfather and godmother, Eleanor Gower and Olivier
                              Goodniff. Thou wilt also find enclosed herein a letter from the father
                              of the babe to the mother, Jane or Jennie Southron, in which he doth
                              acknowledge the paternity of the same. All which, I charge thee, keep
                              safely, lest they fall into unscrupulous hands. For myself, mayhap I
                              shall see thee no more. The few ties that bound me to life and the
                              world are now almost broken, and the duties of my office, which have
                              been hitherto confined within the circle of our family, must in future
                              be extended to the suffering members of our persecuted church
                              throughout this unhappy kingdom. Fare thee well, my well-tried and
                              trusty friend, my companion in arms long ago, when the steel coat
                              covered the cassock, (for thee which I pray God assoil me,) and my
                              humble servitor at the altar, when all who once were friends had
                              deserted the poor shaveling, save thyself alone. Fare thee well,
                              Geoffrey—fare thee well. Pray for our unhappy country, that God may speedily
                              withdraw the arm of his vengeance. Teach thy child, the daughter of
                              Annie Howard, never to forget the faith that her mother loved so well,
                              and for the preserving of which in his native land her uncle now
                              resigns his fortunes and his name. May God preserve in thee the faith
                              and the religion of our sainted ancestors whose writings we have
                              whilom read together so oft in the groves of Brockton, and may thy
                              daughter Alice be the comfort of thy old age, and oft recall thy
                              thoughts, when years begin to shroud thy memory, to the deeds done in
                              the faith; may she ever prove to thee the chain, that, when all others
                              are severed, will link thee still to by-gone years. May she live to
                              read for thee, when thy eyes grow dim, the chronicles of olden times,
                              and thus carry thee away back, through the clouds that darken around
                              thee, to the sunshine and the glories of the past. May Heaven guard
                              thee forever.
                           
                              H. H."
                           
                        
                     
                  
               
               When Houghton had read over this curious document, and folded it up again in the
                  box, he began to reflect on the nature of the contents. "A royal babe!" he
                  muttered to himself—"a royal babe! That meaneth something. Ay, ay, it's a saying
                  big with consequences. Royal babes have been Dukes of Richmond, not long ago,
                  albeit they came not by the honorable gate of wedlock. Gramercy for wedlock, 'tis
                  but a device of the cozening monks and priests to grow rich by. Ay, marry,
                  wedlock, what hath wedlock now to do with the rights of sovereigns and princes? By
                  my good sooth, Sir Geoffrey, I see not why this parchment should lie here to
                  moulder in thy closets. Chance hath thrown it at my feet, and it would be but a
                  tempting o' Providence to cast it away. I'll even carry it to my good master Sir
                  Thomas Plimpton, and see if the secret it containeth may not help him up a step or
                  two higher on the ladder of fortune, and mayhap gain his humble henchman, William
                  Houghton, a footing on it also."
               Accordingly the trooper stooped to pick up the lid of the box, which had fallen on
                  the floor, intending to tie it in its former place by a piece of cord. As he bent,
                  however, his eye caught sight of his own name written on a paper that lay amongst
                  others scattered about, and of a gold shoe buckle beside it, of large size and
                  curious workmanship. It was the same buckle which Nell Gower had picked up in the
                  cavern, and dropped from her bosom on the previous night, in the hurry of her
                  departure with Alice Wentworth; and the paper was that which Whitret Macbairn had
                  found in the taproom of the Whitehorse of Wimbleton.
               "In the name of all the Furies, how came this here?" cried Houghton, unfolding and
                  looking it over. "Hah! I'll wager my life on a zechin it was that old she-devil,
                  or her imp whom I met at Goodniff's hostelrie, hath carried it hither, and thus
                  defeated our plans for the capture of this old stag and his fawn. May the foul
                  fiend fly away with her before her time 's up. Zounds! she hath overreached me,
                  the cozening witch. And faith, thou deservest it right justly, Master Houghton,
                  for having got drunk on Oliver's ale flagons, when thou shouldst have been in London awaiting thy orders,
                  like a sober, God-fearing, Papist-hating son of the true church, and loyal servant
                  of thy gracious queen. Ay, by my sooth, and here we have a trinket that might well
                  grace the shoe of a prince of the blood royal," he continued, examining the
                  buckle. "H. R. What doth that mean? Ah, and here's a small crown between the
                  letters. It's almost imperceptible." And he brought it nearer to the light. "True,
                  by my certie, it's the shoe buckle of his sovereign majesty, of blessed memory,
                  Henry VIII., an I be not much deceived. Gadzooks! how came this here? Soho! we
                  must search for its fellow; it may be among the papers and bawbles of this errant
                  damosel." And he commenced to throw the papers and articles of female dress from
                  side to side, in quest of the other buckle; but it was nowhere to be found. Then,
                  placing his own letter and the precious trinket in the box with the documents, and
                  tying on the lid carefully with a cord, he deposited the parcel in the breast
                  pocket of his wrapper under his jerkin, resolving to submit them to the inspection
                  of Sir Thomas Plimpton as soon as he reached London. But he was not destined to
                  see the metropolis as soon as he expected.
               Hardly had Houghton secreted the box, when he heard a hurried step at the door;
                  and immediately Reddy Connor entered the room, with terror and alarm pictured in
                  his countenance.
               "What's the matter now, fellow, and what detained thee so long?" demanded
                  Houghton.
               "O, begorra, am kilt," cried Reddy; "am gone— am as good as murthered;" and he
                  drew his breath thick and short, and looked affrighted, like one pursued by a
                  ghost.
               "Murdered!" repeated Houghton.
               "It's all as one," responded Reddy. "He broke my arm. Look! there's only two bones
                  houldin' it thegither. Listen—don't ye hear it jugglin'?" And he held it up before
                  the trooper, and moved it to and fro with the other hand in a most comical
                  manner.
               "Why, man, thy arm 's not broken," replied Houghton tenderly, manipulating the
                  member. "Ha, ha! Gad's mercy, dolt, thou'rt not half so valiant as I took thee
                  for. But who hath been so bold as to lay hands on thy sacred person?"
               "Tom Riddle, av course; who else cud it be?"
               "Ah, if I ever come within sword thrust of the villain, I'll repay him for this
                  outrage," replied Houghton. "But hark thee; hast found the key?"
               "The key? av course I have. But d'ye know how he tricked me?" cried Reddy.
               "Nay," replied the other, willing to humor the simpleton.
               "Well, look," said Reddy, suiting the action to the word; "he got a hoult of me
                  this way by the neckerchief, and twisted it tight at first, and then tighter and
                  tighter, and at last give me a wallop just that way on the heels behint, that took
                  the feet from undher me while ye'd say trapsticks."
               The tall trooper found himself measuring his full length on the floor ere he
                  thought of making the slightest resistance. Nay, before he could utter a single
                  exclamation, Reddy had twisted his neckcloth as tight as if a vice had wrung
                  it.
               
               "Hilloa there, Riddle and Davidson," he cried, throwing himself on the breast of
                  the trooper. "Hilloa there," he shouted, as the two domestics rushed into the room
                  from the passage where they had been awaiting the signal; "bind his feet together
                  with them bowstrings, till we relieve him of his doublet and jerkin. Aisy, man,"
                  he continued, addressing the struggling captive. "Arrah, be aisy, and don't taze
                  yourself that way. Aisy or ye'll spoil the flure with yer boots. Tie him tight,
                  Riddle; there, another double; there now, that's as dacent a tied pair iv heels as
                  iver lay over boord at a wake. Here you, Davidson, take a twist round his right
                  arm; and you, Burnet, draw over the sleeve. What a divil of a passion he's in!
                  Look how he flusthers, for all the world like a dying porpoise. Ha, ha! he give me
                  a smart wipe there on the ear; but I forgive him, the poor sowl, seein' the
                  amplush he's in. I know its a liberty I'm takin', Mr. Englishman, but sorra help
                  it I can do. O, av course, av course; ye needn't be at the throuble av spakin'; I
                  know it's an advantage I'm takin', to be sure; but then yer only a Sassenagh, ye
                  see. Now, if ye had the good fortune to be an Irishman, upon my conscience, I
                  could no more think av tratin' ye this way, than av strikin' a man behint his back
                  at a fair. There, now be raisinable, and don't sweat so much, or ye'd, may be, get
                  a ploricy afther it."
               When Reddy had stripped the unfortunate sergeant of his upper garments, and
                  secured his arms and feet, he untwisted his neckcloth and let him breathe more
                  freely. Then, amid volleys of oaths and curses, the long riding boots were, after
                  some difficulty, taken off, his feet tied again securely, and at length he was
                  suffered to roll and writhe on the floor in all the mad fury of despair.
               But no sooner was the trooper stripped of his garments than Reddy began to don
                  them himself, to the no small astonishment of the rightful owner.
               "What meanest thou by that, villain?" demanded Houghton, hardly able to
                  articulate.
               "Why, I'm only goin' to take your place, ye know, and rob the house in the livery
                  and under sanction of her majesty the queen. Ye see, master, in this dress a man's
                  eased of his conscience entirely, and becomes what ye call a royal pursuivant.
                  Still, in regard to them money bags under the western tower, that ye promised to
                  share with me so dacently, a while ago, (and in troth, I'm mighty behouldin' to ye
                  for that same,) seein' there's more in them than I can use convayniently, why, if
                  ye have a wife and weans, (bad luck to that jerkin—it's too tight,) if ye have a
                  wife and weans, or an ould father or mother, that ye'd send a last token to, and
                  jest tell me where to find the crathurs, I'll lave them a thrifle in your name,
                  and explain to them the comfortable situation I left ye in, and the bright
                  prospects that's afore ye, (by the tear o' war, these boots fit me as if I was
                  born in them.) An as for the honorable Sir Thomas Plimpton, he'll be mighty glad
                  to hear that yer in safe quarthers, taking yer rest afther the fatagues of the
                  chase. Buckle that strap, Burnet, and then bring me a pair of scissors."
               "What want ye with scissors?" inquired Burnet.
               
               "Out on thee for an impudent varlet," cried Reddy, drawing himself up in mock
                  dignity; "begone, and bring hither the scissors incontinently, and also a piece of
                  shoemaker's wax. How presumest thou to dispute the wishes of a troop sergeant in
                  her majesty's service?"
               Having now put on the boots, doublet, helmet, and sword of his captive, and slung
                  the baldrick, to which the bugle was suspended, over his shoulder, he looked the
                  very image of the burly sergeant, as he stood there in his uniform but a few
                  minutes before.
               "Well, Burnet, are the soldiers takin' kindly to their wine?" inquired Reddy, as
                  the messenger returned.
               "Ay, marry, are they; they be quarrelling lustily, this full half hour and
                  more."
               "Away, then, and give them the dock an dhonis— the stirrup-cup; fill
                  the door to the throat. I'll be ready for them in a twinkling; and now hand me the
                  scissors and the wax." And sitting down on a chair, opposite the prostrate
                  trooper, he began deliberately to spread a thin coat of the resinous compound on
                  his upper lip. The latter eyed him fearfully, as he performed this operation, and
                  moved his own lips convulsively, from time to time, as if in painful anticipation
                  of the loss he was about to suffer.
               When Reddy had made the necessary preparations, he rose up, and calmly informed
                  the trooper he was about to leave home for a few days, and would feel under an
                  everlasting obligation to him for the loan of the hair on his upper lip, promising
                  to return it thankfully in a few days. But Houghton shook his head and gnashed his
                  teeth in impotent rage.
               "Shure it's but the loan av it am axin'," pursued Reddy, trying the scissors on a
                  bit of paper, and then approaching Houghton; "just for a few days only; begorra,
                  I'll return ivery hair av it. Arrah, man, be more neighborly to yer acquaintances,
                  and don't lose a friend for the value iv a lock i' yer hair. It's proud ye ought
                  to be that I think so much of it. Ay, in troth ought ye; upon my conscience now
                  it's in earnest I am. Begorra, there's not another man in England I'd ax the favor
                  of but yerself." And Reddy, with a countenance as grave as a mustard pot, knelt
                  down beside the unfortunate sergeant, and laid hold of his nose with his finger
                  and thumb. The latter now made a desperate resistance, and roared loudly for help.
                  "Hoa there! ye drunken knaves. Alison, Dexter, Hinson, where are ye? Help! murder!
                  help!"
               "Stop," cried Reddy; "yer friends might be disagreeable company jist now; and
                  besides ye'll disthress yer lungs at that rate; so I'll throuble ye to hould this
                  kippin while am takin' the thriflin' liberty;" and he introduced a sharp-edged
                  dagger between his jaws, and still holding him by the nose whilst Davidson
                  steadied his head, fairly cut off his moustache, and soon transferred it to a
                  corresponding location on his own grave face.
               "Scoundrel! villain!" cried the unfortunate trooper as soon as the dagger was
                  removed, "thou'lt be damned for this outrage."
               "Arrah, then, is it vexed with me ye are?" said Reddy, in affected surprise. "Well, now, if that's
                  not mighty quare! Begorra, in ould Ireland beyont there, it's little they'd think
                  av lendin' ye a lock i' their hair to help ye in a pinch; faith, it's themselves
                  they'd lend ye, hair and hide, soul and body, an no great compliment they'd think
                  it either. Is the horse at the door?" he continued, turning to one of the
                  domestics who had just appeared on the threshold staring at the metamorphosed
                  Irishman.
               "Ay, all's ready," replied the man, laughing at Reddy's moustache, which seemed to
                  grow somewhat irregular, as if it had been raised at different periods.
               "Pillioned—eh?"
               "Ay, fit to carry a bride over the borders."
               "And the soldiers?"
               "Drunk as Dutch burgomasters."
               "Hurrah, then," cried Reddy, settling his helmet on his head, and supporting his
                  heavy long sword in his left hand, whilst he caught the bugle in his right. "Keep
                  this gentleman safe till I return. I'll take his place for this time, and lead his
                  troop on their way home in as soldierly a fashion as ever an Englishman in
                  Worcestershire."
               "Home," shouted the trooper, raising himself to a more erect attitude.
               "Why not?" said Reddy; "don't ye think they'll follow me in this trim, especially
                  when I wind a note on this horn, like that we heard from ye at the ould abbey
                  beyont? besides, by this time naither their hearin' or seein' is just so nice as
                  it was, may be."
               "I'm ruined, deceived, lost, disgraced," ejaculated the trooper, casting himself
                  back again in despair, and kicking like an infuriated bull in the toils.
               "Why, may I nivir do harm," cried Reddy, turning round to the bystanders, "but
                  he'd vex a saint. I'm puttin' myself to the throuble of takin' his place on a long
                  journey, and lavin' him here to have his rest, like a born lord in the most
                  hospitable house in England, where he has the best av aitin', and drinkin', an
                  sleepin', and sarvints to attend him, and bad luck to him, he's not satisfied
                  afther all. Divil a taste of gratitude in him at all at all."
               "Zounds!" cried Houghton, endeavoring to burst his bonds, "am I to be left here to
                  the vengeance of these cowardly murderers? Alison, Dexter, hoa there!" but Reddy
                  laid his foot gently on his mouth, and interrupted his exclamations.
               "Excuse me av ye plaze. Why, man, shure here's Tom Riddle, a countryman iv yer
                  own, who'll thrate ye kind and dacent—Tom Riddle, that broke my arm, ye know—him
                  that id knock saucepans out iv ever a man in the barony. Tom's mighty paceable
                  though, when ye spake him civil."
               "Death and furies!" growled the trooper, "how I've been outwitted by this
                  villain!"
               "D'ye think," inquired Reddy, "is there any danger of my slitherin' off the
                  horse?"
               "Perdition seize thee," muttered his victim, writhing on the floor, and hissing
                  the words through his clinched teeth.
               "Jist listen to him," said Reddy; "listen how he curses and swears at me, all as
                  one as if I'd been the greatest enemy
                  he had in the world. Well, well, it's not in my nature to be so hard hearted to
                  you; no, begorra, it id go clane again my conscience, afther the throuble ye tuk
                  in carrying me home this mornin'. So good by, master; a soft bed and fair dhrames
                  to ye, and if I dare be so bould as to axu another thriflin' favor, after so short
                  an acquaintance, why I'd beg of ye to remember sometimes, in yer prayers, Reddy
                  Connor, the poor simpleton of Brockton Hall." And, touching his helmet, he saluted
                  the trooper in soldierly fashion, and then, assuming his mock dignity, strode from
                  the room, leaving his captive under ward of his laughing comrades.
               When he reached the servants' hall, he stood listening, for some moments, at the
                  door, to ascertain if the roistering soldiers were yet sufficiently intoxicated,
                  and having soon satisfied himself of the fact, hurried on to the front entrance,
                  his spurs jingling on the stone pavements as he went, jumped on his horse, and
                  wound a blast on his bugle horn that rang through the spacious halls, echoing from
                  room to room, and bringing the half-drunken troopers rushing and tumbling out to
                  answer the summons.
               "Ah, ye drunken varlets," he cried, in a voice intended to imitate Houghton's,
                  "mount and follow me to Hoxley."
               "By the throat of Bacchus," muttered one of the soldiers, whilst endeavoring to
                  mount, "he hath tasted of the wine cup himself this morning. Gramercy, drunken
                  varlets! his own voice is none of the soberest, I trow."
               "To Hoxley," said another; "marry, a smart ride and an unchristian-like road; ay,
                  twenty miles, if I know aught of measurement."
               "Ha! and a pillion behind him, to carry this old mass-monger to London, an he
                  finds him at Hoxley," muttered a third. "Doubtless he hath prevailed on that
                  fool-fellow to betray him;" and scrambling up the horse's side, he essayed to
                  squeeze out snatches of an old ditty— 
                     "'The widow of Hoxley watered her wine,'—
                   Hoa there, halt!" he shouted to his prancing horse; "thou'rt no better yet
                  than a farmer's colt. Hoa— steady—I say—steady. 
                     
                        'The widow of Hoxley watered her wine,
                        And the captain could never get drank on't.'"
                     
                  
               
               "Hilloa there, ye drunken shots!" vociferated Reddy, "whip and spur ye on to
                  Hoxley, and await me there. Come on, ye varlets, come on!" and wheeling his horse,
                  he dashed down the avenue at full speed, followed by the drunken and uproarious
                  soldiers.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXV.
               WHEN Sir Geoffrey awoke next morning, in the, gloomy vault of Glastonbury Abbey,
                  it was some time before he could realize the situation in which he found himself.
                  His dreams had been all of home and Alice, of his books, his pictures, and his new
                  theories; and his mind, full of these soft and pleasant impressions, felt somewhat
                  reluctant, at first, to admit the distressing realities that began, one by one, to
                  crowd in upon it. He could distinguish no object in the apartment, when first he
                  opened his eyes and rubbed his hand across them, except, indeed, a dim light in
                  the distance, that threw its rays but a few feet around, and looked like a
                  phosphoric gleam, far away in the dark distance. He first stretched out his hands,
                  and felt the damp flags, on which his bed lay, then the rough covering, and,
                  finally, the hard-knotted handkerchief that pressed his temples. But after a
                  little, as his eyes became more accustomed to the distant light, he thought he
                  began to see the outline of a man's face, and then, after a long and steady gaze,
                  recognized it as that of brother Felix, the old monk who conducted him thither on
                  the preceding night. "Ay, ay," said he, "that's just it; for though I dreamt all
                  night of happy things, there was ever a strange, weight upon my heart that marred
                  the pleasure. Ay, ay, I see all now—I remember every thing—there's no longer a
                  doubt; I'm houseless, homeless, mayhap childless. God direct me, God direct me,
                  for I'm a doting, miserable old man. It may be that Heaven is punishing me for the
                  sins of my youth." His reflections were here interrupted by a short, hollow cough;
                  and looking up in the direction from whence it came, he saw it proceeded from the
                  little old monk seated at his desk, and busily copying from some old parchments
                  that lay before him. The knight could now distinctly see every thing within the
                  circle of the light, whilst the rest of the apartment lay in deep obscurity. And
                  he thought he never saw a face so thin and emaciated as the face before him, nor
                  heard a cough so hollow as that which broke upon his ear in the still and awsome
                  place. The monk's white locks lay thinly scattered over his forehead, his cheeks
                  appeared sunken till they almost met, his eyes protruding and glossy, and his
                  hands attenuated to the very extreme of leanness. As the light fell upon and
                  illuminated his pale and ghastly countenance, he looked more like a dead body just
                  raised up from the tomb than a living man. "And there he sits," thought Sir
                  Geoffrey—"there he sits, the poor old friend of humanity, the savior of history,
                  and preserver of science. There he sits at his little desk, wrapped in his habit,
                  deciphering the stained and moth-eaten records of far distant climes, written in
                  languages long since forgotten, or extinct, and buried, mayhap, for centuries in
                  the ruins left by the Goth and the Vandal. There he sits alone, there under
                  ground, where the blessed, sun never shines, and the cheering light of day never
                  enters. There he sits, toiling for humanity manity, to instruct, elevate, and ennoble it—to
                  make it better and happier. No one sees him, no one hears him, save the gray old
                  weasel, mayhap, that, accustomed at length to his presence, comes boldly forth
                  from his burrow in the grave, to look up in his gentle face, and beg the scanty
                  crums as they fall from his trembling hands. There he sits, night and day, never
                  tiring, never complaining, redeeming the past, and enlightening the future. There
                  he sits, with his crucifix on the desk before him; suffering and laboring after
                  the example of Him whose image it bears, for the enlightenment, the instruction,
                  and salvation of his race. And who will hallow his memory? Who will raise a
                  monument to perpetuate his name? Alas! alas! he has no name—he is but a poor monk
                  of the order of St. Dominic. He will die here some day, and be forgotten, like his
                  brethren. Some evening, the hunted priest, coming in peasant guise, and standing
                  amid the ruins of the old pile, will look up, and wonder that the smoke no longer
                  ascends from the mysterious chimney. He will go in, and find the door in the base
                  of the pillar fastened, and no one near to open it. Then, shaking his head in
                  doubt and fear, and coming round by the altar, will he see the moss and the weeds
                  beginning to grow over the consecrated steps of the sanctuary; then will he turn
                  the revolving stone, and descend through the secret aperture. Behold, there sits
                  the monk still—there he sits, as he used to see him sitting of old; but the pen
                  has fallen from his fingers, his forehead has sunk down on the image of the dead
                  Christ. There's no longer fire on the hearth stone, and the damps of the vault
                  have given a strange color to his hands, which lie spread before him, embracing
                  the crucifix. Listen! the priest speaks to him, but he replies not; the priest
                  raises his arm, but it falls again with a heavy sodden sound down upon the desk.
                  The priest will sing the black mass, and chant the solemn requiem in stealthy
                  tones, but the old man who answered the amen for so many years will never be his
                  clerk again. Then will he open one of those graves, and there will he deposit on a
                  pile of human bones the skeleton form of the dead monk, shrouded in his threadbare
                  cassock. O dear! O dear! But the labors of his life, where are they? Did he leave
                  nothing, after so many years of study and toil, but that little handful of
                  manuscript? Ay, truly, it seemeth little to look at, but take it up and examine
                  it. Ah! verily, every page hath cost him whole years of labor; every word, every
                  letter, hath he rescued from the ravages of time, and the mists of years, like an
                  antiquary deciphering the scabbed and time-worn monuments amid the ruins of
                  Persepolis. In vain shall men in after years search for his name, or his
                  birthplace. He had no name but the poor monk of St. Dominic, no country but
                  heaven, no friends but the saints, no mother but the holy spouse of Christ, no
                  father but God.
               "And a time, too, will come," pursued the knight, still gazing at the busy monk;
                  "ay, a time when learned men will denounce thee as a bigot, and revile thee as an
                  impostor, should they chance to hear of thee as one who practised those very
                  virtues without which they had themselves been deprived of thy literary labors.
                  Alas! thy abstinence, thy retirement,
                  thy self-denials, thy sufferings, and thy self-abasement, without which the world
                  had never been enriched by those precious parchments, will be the objects of the
                  world's taunt and scorn. Like eagles will men surround thy remains, and each,
                  carrying off his part of the spoil to augment his treasury of learned lore, will
                  yet deride and scoff at thy monastic virtues, and the ascetic habits which gave
                  them birth. O, poor old man; they will pilfer thy history, thy science, and thy
                  philosophy; but thy old faith and thy antiquated morality will they trample under
                  their feet. Ay, marry, they will laud thee for thy researches, but vilify thee for
                  thy faith; they will honor thee as an historian, venerate thee as an antiquarian,
                  extol thee as a philosopher, but damn thee as a Christian.
               "And for myself," said Sir Geoffrey, "here I am, driven from my ancestral home, to
                  house, like an outcast, with the dying and the dead. And for what?" he demanded,
                  carried instantly away, as usual, with the subject; "for having chosen to seclude
                  myself from the society of the world, in order to devote my time to the
                  advancement of human knowledge. I have collected more scraps of tradition,
                  corrected more translations of the fathers, gathered more inscriptions of ancient
                  rings, urns, and coins, classified more fishes in my treatise on ichthyology, from
                  the scleroidæ to the malacopterygiens subbrachiens, inclusive, than any other living man.
                  And as regards entomology, have I not proved beyond question, in my treatise on
                  insects, that the family of the aphides are
                  viviparous only in summer? and also that the oviparous have no nostrils, no lungs,
                  and therefore no voice, and consequently can neither sing, laugh, cry, sneeze, or
                  cough, like other animals? As for the beetle casting his shell, I never will admit
                  it—never could reconcile it with my conscience to deceive the world with such an
                  absurd theory. Hewson's but a fool, after all his experiments, as I shall prove by
                  my treatise on crustacea. Ah! that reminds me of
                  the death of that two-year-old, which Reddy was the cause of destroying. O dear!
                  I'll never again see such a butterfly. And all this comes of persecuting an old
                  man for his faith. Well, as I said, what reward have I to expect from the world
                  for all I've done for its enlightenment? Doubtless a halter, or a prison. And my
                  collections, how will the world compensate me for them? Every insect in them cost
                  me an angel. O, confound them, confound them for angels! they have ruined mankind
                  in general, and myself and my daughter in particular. That Plimpton villain loveth
                  my angels more than my Alice. I say again, confound the angels!" And Sir Geoffrey
                  started up indignantly in his bed, and repeated the words in such a voice as to
                  reach the ear of brother Felix.
               "That's blasphemy," said the monk, interrupting his writing, and peering over the
                  desk.
               "Blasphemy!" repeated Sir Geoffrey, rising up from his pallet, shoes and all, and
                  sliding the handkerchief over his head, as he turned to look at the monk.
               "Ay, thou'st been cursing the ministers of God."
               "Ha, ha! ministers of the devil, rather. There be more angels than good angels, I
                  trow. But—father Peter—where hath he and the dwarf gone?"
               
               "Both left us last night, and may not return for a time," replied the monk,
                  quitting his desk a moment to lay some breakfast before Sir Geoffrey.
               "Ah, methought I saw him leave with a very small and very disagreeable specimen of
                  human kind, after midnight. And whither wendeth he, brother Felix?"
               "It's somewhat of a journey, I ween," responded the monk; "for he hath taken the
                  next quarter's Breviary with him, and the sacred vestments."
               "O dear! O dear! and left he aught of counsel for me?" inquired the knight.
               "That thou remain here until the departure of Sir Thomas Plimpton from the
                  neighborhood of Brockton; nothing more."
               "What! here among the graves?"
               "Ay, if it so please thee."
               "Nay, I bar that, good brother; when night comes on, I'll steal home to Brockton.
                  My daughter Alice, thou must know, is there hiding in a lonely cell, and will
                  expect me. She's of tender heart, poor little thing, very fond of her old father,
                  and can ill bear their separation."
               "Two days' retirement will place thee beyond the danger of arrest," modestly
                  pursued the monk; "and then thou mayst return in safety. I pray thee be counselled
                  by thy father confessor, who loveth thee most truly, and would surely take it ill
                  of thee to traversie his directions, and thereby expose thyself to danger."
               "Ah! but Alice," replied the old man.
               "She's in safety," pleaded the monk.
               "Safe from violence, mayhap; but I know well her heart is sick and sorrowing for
                  her old father. Poor child; she thinks I'm so simple, and thriftless, and
                  careless, that I may wander about and neglect myself. O, she's a very tender
                  little girl. Hast never seen Alice?"
               "Nay; but I can judge of her fortitude from what father Peter saith. She can bear
                  thy absence better than thou thinkest for."
               Sir Geoffrey shook his head.
               "Two days make but a little time, methinks," persisted the monk.
               "Ay, marry, for those who measure time by the length of their manuscripts; but
                  little Alice hath never been from her father's side one hour, save when she went
                  to Paris to see Mary Stuart; and then— hem—and then—O, it would never do at all,"
                  he added, rising from the table and leaving his breakfast almost untasted. "I must
                  see her to-night."
               "And pray, good Sir Geoffrey, how long staid the maiden at Paris?"
               "How long? O, a long time; a very long time, indeed;" and he shuffled about,
                  endeavoring to evade the question.
               "Nay, thou seemest unwilling to answer me," said the monk with a faint smile on
                  his thin lips. "Pray, didst not follow her thyself after only a few days' absence,
                  and bring her back with thee, notwithstanding the earnest entreaties of the
                  princess to the contrary? Ah, Sir Geoffrey, it's thine own heart feeleth most the
                  pain of absence, I trow."
               "Marry come up with thee, man; and what knowest est thou of the matter?" responded the knight,
                  somewhat annoyed at seeing his anxiety to return thus accounted for. "Gramercy for
                  thy tale, brother, it little becometh thy office to know so much of the secrets
                  between father and child. So haste thee, and open the pillar above, that I may see
                  what hath become of the box. I will return without delay, and remain here
                  patiently till nightfall."
               "I may not contravene my orders, Sir Geoffrey," replied the monk, respectfully,
                  "and would supplicate thee to remain here, as thy good friend and father confessor
                  directed."
               "But my books, man, my books!" persisted the knight, plucking the breast of the
                  monk's cassock, to impress on him the importance of the matter; "my books are in
                  the box, and how know I but these troopers may have carried them off? And Reddy,
                  he may have fled and left them to the mercy of the elements."
               "Thy books are of small account, compared with thine own safety, Sir
                  Geoffrey."
               "What! man," ejaculated the latter, stepping back and looking with astonishment at
                  the monk. "I tell thee thou'rt crazed! Why, St. Augustine, St. Thomas, St.
                  Bernard, and St. Jerome are there in that very box! Paugh! man, they're worth a
                  thousand such lives as mine!"
               "There they are," said the monk, pointing to the lower shelf of a bookstand on the
                  opposite wall; "thou mayst have them, if thou remainest here as directed."
               "Where?" muttered Sir Geoffrey, stepping over and taking up one of the large
                  folios; "let's see the edition. Why, gads my life, man, this is the last Mentz
                  edition. Pooh, pooh! brother Felix, it's but a bawble, a mere affair of zechins;
                  marry, man, thou mayst buy this for money. Pshaw! these are as plenty as
                  Schoffer's Bibles. But dost not comprehend me when I tell thee I have the edition
                  containing the homilies, and smaller works from the wooden tables, with marginal
                  notes in manuscript, the real original xylographic copies; breath o' life, man,
                  every letter in them's worth all the typographies of Gastonburg and Schoffer, and
                  Faust, in the whole universe." And the knight threw back the volume contemptuously
                  on the shelf, and laughed heartily at the simplicity of the monk.
               "And what difference maketh it to the writings of the saint," demanded the monk,
                  "whether they reach us through wooden carvings or leaden types?"
               "Humph!" ejaculated Sir Geoffrey, smiling compassionately on his companion.
                  "Indeed, I pity thee if thou'rt serious in asking such a question. So haste thee,
                  haste thee, and let me away from thy company. I would rather sit in the ruins
                  above, and decipher the tombstones, than converse with one who hath such little
                  respect for the precious relics."
               "And yet," replied the monk, "we have even the manuscript copy there on that shelf
                  above, from which thine was printed. And so, as thou valuest antiquity so much,
                  verily thou mayst have it."
               "Ay, truly, brother; but hath not every monastery in France, Italy, and Germany,
                  copies of the same? Hoot, man, I would
                  not barter mine for a million such paltry things. So get thee up, and let's steal
                  among the old walls; haste thee and don thy black cloak, while I look after my
                  pictures."
               And the old man hurried away to find his treasure where he had left it.
