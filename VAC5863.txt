               CHAPTER I.
               
                  
                     
                        "Ay, so you serve us,
                        'Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,
                        You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,
                        And mock us with our bareness."
                     
                  
               
               Several years have elapsed since I formed a resolution to write out the most
                  important events, and give to the world some of the scenes in my life; but
                  circumstances have prevented me from carrying out that resolution until the
                  present time. And I would not now begin such a task if I were not fully convinced
                  that the execution of it would benefit my own sex and shed some light on the paths
                  in which they may travel while sojourning on this earth. The great poet of nature
                  hath said, 'The web of our life is of mingled yarn, good and ill together; our
                  virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not; and our crimes would
                  despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.' Be that as it may, I have
                  lived out a large proportion of the time allotted me in this world, and must pack
                  up and prepare to leave these earthly scenes ere many moons shall wax and
                  wane.
               "But of what use can the biography of a woman be to the world?" some one may ask,
                  who is not so wise as he thinks himself to be.
               Mothers have daughters whom they love as much as my own mother loved me; and
                  fathers have sons whom they love, and desire to see them walk in the paths of
                  virtue, honor and industry. And how can these fond parents properly advise and
                  instruct their children unless they know something of the dangers and temptations
                  that beset their path, especially in city life, where poor, erring humanity
                  assumes a thousand forms almost entirely unknown in the country?
               I write for the benefit and information of country fathers and mothers, who are
                  sometimes ambitious to send their sons and daughters to large cities, that their
                  manners may be polished and their tastes refined. Manners polished and tastes
                  refined! Oh, a faintness comes over my soul at the very thought! But I must not
                  begin my history in the middle.
               I was born in the city of Portland, county of Cumberland, and State of Maine, and
                  have always been called by the name of Ellen Holmes. Soon after I came into this
                  breathing world, my mother removed to a small wooden tenement on the banks of the
                  Androscoggin river, some fifty miles from the city of my birth.
               My mother did not marry until I was nearly three years old, and then she did not
                  wed my father.
               My birth was a circumstance over which I had no control, and for which no blame
                  can attach to me, either by Divine or human laws. And yet the latter laws regard me as the child of no one, and
                  forbid my inheriting any property from my father, even supposing he died intestate
                  and possessed of any.
               Great learning and sound philanthropy may have enacted such a law; but if so I
                  have never had intellectual acumen sufficient to see it. I have ever borne the
                  name of my mother, and have never changed it for a more euphoneous one through all
                  the vicissitudes of my eventful life.
               From earliest childhood I was a high spirited, if not a quick tempered person. My
                  courage, too, was always equal to any occasion; but whether I am indebted for this
                  quality of the mind or heart to my father or mother or to the peculiar times in
                  which I was born, I will not stop to inquire or discuss. At the time of my birth
                  and for more than a year previous, England and America were at war about sailor's
                  rights and some other matters. I have often heard my mother say British
                  seventy-fours could be seen proudly sailing back and forth on the ocean but a few
                  miles from Portland. These vessels could be distinctly seen without the aid of
                  glasses; and the people, of course, were alarmed lest their good city might be
                  burned to ashes. Regiments of country militia came to defend the city, and give
                  the British a drubbing in case they tried to land an army.
               My mother's father was a high toned federalist, and opposed the war. The embargo
                  came, then the war, and my grandfather's vessels 'rotted at the wharves,' to use a
                  common phrase of that day. Mother was his only child, and grown into womanhood ere
                  the war commenced. Grandfather lost all of his property, and died broken hearted,
                  cursing Jefferson and his policy.
               Some years previous his wife had died. And my mother was left alone in this cold
                  world without money or any near relatives or friends.
               But she was very beautiful and highly accomplished. Alas! her beauty could not
                  save her; and her accomplishments only hastened her fall by multiplying the
                  temptations that surrounded her.
               Hoping and believing she had found a friend in whom she could trust, she gave up
                  her heart to him, and expected to form an union with him through life.
               But, like many other men, he promised fair, and everything bore a pleasing and
                  flattering aspect. Even though her fond parents were dead, yet her prospects in
                  life seemed bright and encouraging.
               He who had won her affections and promised so fairly, was rich, handsome and
                  agreeable; but at heart he proved a villain, and at last forsook her.
               Before he left he gave her a sum of money, and a small house with some land
                  attached to the same, on the banks of the Androscoggin. To this spot she removed a
                  few months after my birth. Here she lived in retirement, if not in
                  contentment.
               I shall never forget my childhood's home. It was a beautiful and romantic spot.
                  The scenery about the place during the summer and autumn months was indeed
                  beautiful. In early life I acquired a love for beautiful scenery. A stream ran
                  through our land and near our house, and mingled its waters with those of the
                  Androscoggin.
               Our house stood but a short distance from the river, and on the opposite side
                  stood a grove of pine trees, which the owner preserved with great care, foreseeing
                  the day when such a grove would become valuable property.
               But the wise owner died, leaving it to a son much less wise than his father. Not
                  long after his death, the sounds of the lumberman's axe resounded in the grove,
                  and those majestic trees, one after another, fell, and their noble trunks rolled
                  on the banks upon the ice-bound river.
               Young as I was then I can never forget my feelings to see that splendid grove of
                  pines demolished, and floated off on the spring tides of the river forever from my
                  sight.
               Among these red shirted, robust and active lumbermen engaged in destroying this
                  majestic pinery, there was one Jonathan Birchwood. He was a good looking man, full
                  of fun, and very fond of the society of the fair sex. His age was about
                  forty-five, but being corpulent and his face without a wrinkle, he looked a
                  younger man. He was a widower, but had no children, his wife having been dead
                  several years.
               Of children he was very fond, and used to take me into the logging camps. I was
                  much petted by him and others of the men. My hair was dark, and naturally curled
                  into ringlets, that hung over my neck and shoulders, giving me a wild and romantic
                  look, greatly pleasing. Uncle Jonty,' as he was often called by his more intimate
                  friends and acquaintances.
               Well do I remember how hard and rough his hands were as he smoothed back the hair
                  from my forehead and patted my cheeks. His beard, too, was very stiff, for he
                  would sometimes kiss me in spite of resistance. Rough as his hands were and tanned
                  as his face was, I used to like him, and accompanied him whenever mother permitted
                  me. And she seldom refused me the liberty.
               Sabbath days lumbering operations ceased, and men and oxen had these days for
                  rest. Every Sunday, stormy or pleasant, Uncle Jonty was sure to come over the
                  river on the ice and visit us. The others would go hunting or fishing for the
                  speckled trout through the ice.
               Uncle Jonty sometimes went fishing, and on these occasions took me with him, if
                  not too cold and unpleasant. I admired the sport, and loved to see the bright
                  spotted trout flap about on the ice after they had been caught. He learned me the
                  art so that I could catch them.
               Mother was very fond of these delicate trout, and he never failed to bring her a
                  string of them when he went after them. He not only passed the Sabbaths with us,
                  but two or three evenings every week he would be our house, dandling me on his
                  knee, and talking and laughing with mother.
               He was a cheerful man, and made himself very agreeable to us, especially in the
                  long evenings. He usually staid until after I was in bed and asleep; for mother
                  put me to bed early, whether Uncle Jonty was there or not.
               Thus he continued his visits through the long winter; and the reader need not be
                  surprised when he is told that Uncle Jonty not only fondled me but fell in love
                  with my mother!
               That was all natural enough. True, she was beautiful and much accomplished; but
                  that is no reason why she could not reciprocate the love of such a man as Uncle
                  Jonty was.
               She saw in him a noble soul, an honest heart and a fast friend, who would not
                  practice deception, but not out his own nature.
               How different he was from my own father, whom I had not then seen, and whose name
                  I did not even know.
               True, Mr. Birchwood was not an accomplished gentleman, according to the general
                  acceptation of that term; but then he was a true hearted man, possessed of fun and
                  a fair share of good sense, judgment and honesty. In fact, he was one of nature's
                  noblemen, and walked the earth with a firm step and manly countenance, as if he
                  were not ashamed of his origin or employment.
               Spring came, and the buds of the trees began to swell, the streams to run down the
                  hill sides, our little brook to make its music, and the ice to float down the
                  river. The birds, also, came out and sung in the branches of the sugar maples that
                  stood back of our house. The grass, that had been covered all winter with deep
                  snows, looked green, and all nature began to put on its most lovely garb.
               Oh, how fresh are all these scenes! I can see them before me, and long for happy
                  childhood again!
               
               Having finished their winter's task, the lumbermen had departed, and all was still
                  upon the other side. I regretted to have them go, especially Uncle Jonty.
               I asked mother if he was not coming back. She smiled; and, if I had been a little
                  older, perhaps I should have seen a blush on her cheeks.
               She said he would be pack ere long and I was glad, for I longed to see him. His
                  conduct towards me had made me love him, and I longed to sit in his lap and look
                  up into his noble face. And no; doubt mother desired to see him, too, hear his
                  laugh and listen to his jokes.
               Uncle Jonty was a noble hearted man, and I loved to be in his company. And I
                  reckon mother did too. I judged so from what happened afterwards. But no matter. I
                  must not go before my story; but make a record of events in the order in which
                  they occurred.
               A true history I sat down to write, and my purpose shall be honestly executed. I
                  do not depend upon imagination for my facts, however much I may be 
                     indebtdd
                     indebted
                   to memory for my wit, if any should be found in these pages.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               The Loveliness of Spring—A Happy Marriage—The Heroine Grows,
                  &c.
               I was saying that spring had burst upon us in all its beauty and loveliness. And
                  if one wishes to see all this 
                     beauy
                     beauty
                   and loveliness which a change of the season produces, the sight cannot
                  be had in the city; but the country is the place for such scenes.
               True, the poor of the city rejoice in feeling once again the warmth of the sun,
                  and the rich feel as if the time is drawing near when they can go into the country
                  beneath its pure air, and roam over the green pastures and fruitful hills.
               The snow had departed before a hot sun and the volume of the Androscoggin was
                  greatly swollen.
               Some cakes of ice were yet floating on its bosom which came from the upper lakes,
                  and the trunks of the noble pines began to pass our house.
               River drivers were seen on the banks in their red shirts, bearing poles on their
                  shoulders, and wending their way up the stream.
               Two persons could be seen on the opposite side of the river, rolling the logs into
                  the river that still remained upon the bank.
               But neither of these persons were Uncle Jonty. That I knew, as I sat one day on
                  the bank noticing them as they rolled the big logs over the steep sides into the
                  river. His manly, stalwart form was not there; and I remember how sad I was
                  because I could not see him. And I noticed, too, that mother came where I was and
                  looked across.
               "Do you see Uncle Jonty?" I inquired, straining my eyes across the river.
               "No, dear, he is not there," she replied. "His assistance is not needed, for the
                  logs were principally placed upon the ice last winter, and floated off as the
                  river broke up."
               "But will he not come here again?" I asked, looking up.
               "Perhaps he may in a week or two," she replied, as a pleasant smile passed over
                  her beautiful countenance. "Do you want to see him?"
               "Oh, yes—indeed I do!" was my reply. "I love Uncle Jonty, and want to go with him
                  and catch the pretty trout. "Don't you love him, mother?"
               Now my question was a very innocent one; but had I been older I probably should
                  not have asked it.
               She made no direct reply; but said he appeared to be a very kind hearted man, and
                  that we ought to respect all such men.
               Soon after she went to the house, leaving me to gaze on the river drivers awhile
                     longer. It excited my feelings to witness the big logs start
                  and roll down into the river the current of which was quite rapid. But there was
                  one drawback upon my pleasure. The noble pine trees with their evergreen tops and
                  waving limbs were all cut down, leaving heaps of ugly brush in their plans. The
                  scenery upon that side was changed, and to my eyes not for the better. The
                  beautiful prospect had been destroyed, and the pine grove was no more! And the
                  young man who inherited it will not live long enough to see it grow up again.
                  Those trees were more than a hundred years old, and had braved the storms of a
                  century.
               After sitting awhile and seeing the logs pass down the river, I rose and went to
                  the house.
               The day was mild, and the sun's rays made our hens, the pig and cow look as if
                  they were glad the cold winter had been passed.
               Time passed, and our little farm was covered with a beautiful green carpet. The
                  grass grew rapidly, and mother was busily engaged in her garden. She was very fond
                  of flowers, and cultivated quite a variety of them.
               One pleasant morning I was in the garden with her, trying to do something, but
                  probably did more hurt than good. She had fixed a little bed in which I set out
                  roots, and began to cultivate flowers. We were all life and animation. While thus
                  busily engaged, I looked up, and perceived mother straining her eyes down the
                  river. I stood tiptoe, and gazed, too, but could see nothing. I asked her if she
                  saw any one coming.
               "I see a man coming," she replied, in a voice slightly trembling. "I believe it is
                  Uncle Jonty."
               "Oh, I will run to meet him!" I said, hurrying through the garden gate and running
                  to meet him.
               I had not gone far before I espied Uncle Jonty, sure enough.
               Soon I was in his arms, and felt his rough beard on my cheeks.
               He hurried along, bearing me in his arms, and soon reached the garden gate. Mother
                  came to meet him; and, if my recollection is not at fault, her cheeks, too felt
                  his rough beard.
               Be that as it may, Uncle Jonty went no farther up the river.
               Glad, indeed, was I to see him, and still happier when he said he was going to
                  help mother make the garden.
               He did help her, or rather made it quite alone. He put up the fences, planted corn
                  and potatoes, and made everything look nice.
               The reader need not be told that, ere summer was hardly begun, my mother changed
                  her relation in life, and became Mrs. Jonathan Birchwood. And a happier couple
                  lived not on the banks of the Androscoggin.
               In the autumn he purchased more land adjoining, and made preparations for farming
                  on a larger scale.
               Months rolled on and winter again visited us, but Uncle Jonty, or my father (for
                  so I must call him), did not shoulder his axe and go into the logging swamps, for
                  he had enough to do at home.
               We were, indeed, a happy family. Father was one of the best natured men in the
                  world, and conducted our 
                     fam
                     farm
                   well. In the spring new fences went up and the lands were cleared.
               How I did love to stroll over the fields. Ah, my girlhood was indeed happy.
               Mother had no more children, and I was the pet of both.
               It was a long time before I ceased to call my father in law Uncle Jonty. That name
                  pleased me best, and it appeared to please us all. But after a year or two I began
                  to learn how to address father properly.
               He treated me with as much kindness as if I had been his own daughter. He was near
                  and dear to me, and yet I well knew he was not my father.
               Season after season sped on, and I grew apace. My health was perfect, and my
                  spirit buoyant. I was a happy girl. And
                  if father's words are to be credited, time added much to my personal beauty. My
                  form was very symmetrical, my motions quick, but graceful, and my countenance
                  lively.
               Mother knew how to teach her child good manners, and most faithfully did she
                  instruct me.
               Years passed away, and I had seen twelve summers come and go. Our farm had much
                  increased in value. An addition to the house had been made, and two barns
                  erected.
               I was now twelve years old, and my form was well developed for a girl of that
                  age.
               That I was the most beautiful girl on the banks of the Androscoggin every one
                  would testify who had seen me. I heard many speak of my beauty; but I needed no
                  such testimony to convince me of its truth. Mother's largest mirror was all the
                  evidence. I needed—that never failed to convince me my personal beauty grew with
                  my years.
               Yes, kind reader, I discovered my great beauty quite as soon as others.
               My complexion was a sort of brunette, but not very dark; my eyes were a dark blue;
                  hair very dark, fine and glossy; my forehead very smooth, but not over high; my
                  nose delicately chisselled; my teeth regular, and of pearly whiteness; my mouth
                  expressive of good humor; my shoulders gently sloping; my feet and hands small,
                  and my form almost faultless. No wonder that the rough, whole hearted lumbermen
                  called me beautiful!*

               
                  *[SEE ENGRAVING.]
               
               Some how or other they gave me the name of the Androscoggin Rose.
               That pleased me well enough while I was under twelve years of age; but after that
                  the name began to grow less pleasing to me.
               My father in law was as proud of me as if I were his own daughter. Persons who
                  called at our house tried to find out who my father was; but mother's lips were
                  always sealed upon that subject. She had never told me, nor breathed it to her
                  husband. And he had too much delicacy and good sense to ask her.
               We were prosperous and happy, having enough of this world's goods to make us not
                  only comfortable but respectable. Father was very far from being a sordid, selfish
                  person, being willing to buy any article of dress that mother wanted or thought I
                  ought to have. A more generous husband never lived, and his noble deeds are still
                  fresh in my recollection, and will ever remain so.
               Often I dream of his manly form, noble countenance and generous heart. His image
                  is impressed upon my heart, and I can never forget him.
               I will not say that he is the only man I ever saw who did not practice deception
                  of one kind or another; but I can safely say, no man was more free from faults
                  than he was.
               But the good and the brave are some times suddenly cut down, while those who could
                  be better spared live on and seem to flourish!
               I shall not attempt to scrutinise such a Providence. No doubt it is all right; but
                  to our short sighted vision it may seem strange.
               Being twelve years old, I began to feel as if I was fast approaching womanhood;
                  and the flattering attention of the rough backwoodsmen did not please me so much
                  as it had in years past.
               True, I was not wholly insensible to their praises and good opinions, but began to
                  sigh for more refined companions and more cultivated society.
               I often dreamed of city life, of its excitements, its pleasures, its fashions and
                  its gaieties; and yet I did not lose my respect and love for my good father in
                  law.
               The more I saw of him the better I liked him. But there was something in me that
                  made me wish for higher life, for more excitement, for greater splendor than our
                  humble position afforded.
               One 
                     plersant
                     pleasant
                   morning in September I walked out on the banks of the river and gazed
                  upon the leaves of the trees whose colors had been changed by the frost of a few
                  nights previous. The varigated hues were delightful, and I enjoyed the scene; but
                  after all I sighed for other life and other scenes.
               I sat down upon a pine stump near the river, and was looking upon land and water
                  prospects, when father approached, and, patting me upon the shoulder,
                  exclaimed:—
               "Ellen, a penny for your thoughts."
               I looked up at his smiling face and said, "Perhaps my thoughts are not worth the
                  money you offer for them."
               "Now tell me what you are dreaming about this fine morning!" he added, smiling
                  upon me; "I suppose you were looking at the trees and noticing how Jack Frost has
                  changed their color."
               "I was looking at them," was my reply.
               "Look at that grove of sappling pines yonder," he added; "it is now eight years
                  since I bought the land, and the young pines have grown rapidly since that time.
                  Some of them pines are big enough to make house frames. I intend to let them grow
                  for your benefit. In twenty years they will be quite large trees, for the soil is
                  good in which they are rooted. And 
                     soe
                     so
                  , the frost does not change their color They are ever green through
                  winter's storms and summer heats, while our beautiful maples are always stripped
                  of their leaves in the autumn and pass the cold winter in nakedness."
               "Yes, but they put on their green dress in the spring, and look lovely," I
                  replied.
               "True, they do; but I do love these noble pines," he added. "I told the young man
                  when I was chopping down his pines a few years ago on the other bank of the river,
                  that he had better let them stand, as his father had done before him, for they
                  would be better than money at interest. But he must go to lumbering; and now he
                  wishes the trees back again. If he had not cut them down they now would be worth
                  twice what he got for them. But he could not wait, and so he wasted his property.
                  I speak of this to impress upon your mind the importance of being patient,
                  especially when nature is working for us. Your mother and I must die one of these
                  days, and after that event be not in a hurry to sell the pine grove we shall leave
                  for you."
               "Oh, I do not love to hear you talk of dying," I replied. "How could I live here
                  without you and mother?"
               "But where would you live?" he inquired, laughing. "Would you go down the river to
                  more thickly settled towns, or perhaps to some city, where you might be
                  ruined?"
               "Oh, I do not know," I replied, feeling quite sad at the thoughts of death, and
                  looking up into his pleasant face. "Are there more dangers in the city than here,
                  father?"
               "More deceit and wickedness" he replied. "Here people work hard for a living, and
                  that not only keeps them industrious, but also honest in a great degree. In cities
                  there are many idlers, and the brain of an idler is the devil's 
                     workship
                     workshop
                  , as my good mother used to tell me."
               "I have often heard mother speak of such things," I added.
               "Yes, she lived in a city in her younger days," he said
               He said no more, but went into a field, leaving me alone.
               Still I longed to see the city, and be made acquainted with all its mysteries and,
                  I may add, its miseries. But, would to heaven, I had never seen that great and
                  fascinating city—New York! But I must not get ahead of my life; but give 
                     them them
                     them
                   in the order in which they occurred. The reader will find my life full
                  of soul-exciting and thrilling events
            
            
               
               CHAPTER III.
               A New Character—A Touch of the Coquette—Stirring Scenes,
                  &c.
               
                  
                     Anether
                     Another
                   winter approaches, and the 
                     Andrescoggin
                     Androscoggin
                   is bridged with ice. No snow had yet fallen, and the ice was smooth as a
                  mirror.
               Years before my father in law had learned me to skate, a sport of which I was
                  extravagantly fond. He was an excellent skater himself, and many times we have had
                  trials of speed together. I generally beat him; but probably the victory might be
                  owing more to his indulgent kindness and good nature than to any superior strength
                  or skill.
               However, I could excell him in graceful motions and quick turns upon the ice, for
                  I had a ready command of my muscular powers, and made a very handsome figure as I
                  gracefully moved over the smooth surface.
               My cheeks, in the clear frosty air would show the red blood, and the curling
                  ringlets of my dark, glossy hair would stream out behind, and make me look like a
                  wild girl of the forests. On such occasions, no doubt, I looked very
                  beautiful.
               The sport of skating is an exceedingly health-giving exercise, and if young ladies
                  of the present day would practice it, they would derive much benefit from the
                  exercise.
               Swimming, too was a sport in which I indulged. I had always lived too near the
                  river not to learn that art. I could swim quite as well as I could skate.
               Father insisted that every person ought to 
                     lerrn
                     learn
                   how to swim, especially those who resided near rivers or lakes. So very
                  thoroughly had I learned the art of swimming that I had no fears of the water. An
                  old Indian made me a beautiful birch canoe, in which I used to have much wild
                  sport. When I first began to paddle it, it would slide out from under me and
                  plunge me into the river. But such a sudden bath did not discourage me, for I was
                  at home in the water almost as much as a wild duck.
               A little practice soon taught me how to trim my little bark, and I could skim over
                  the water with an Indian's skill.
               Well do I remember the sport I had in my canoe.
               One afternoon I came up to the house all dripping wet. The natural curls of my
                  long hair 
                     wrere
                     were
                   somewhat straightened out, and hung heavily over my neck and shoulders,
                  and my dress clung to my form a little closer than was agreeable. Hoops at that
                  time might have been of some service, and rendered my walking much more easy. But
                  it was all the same to me. I was full of life and animation, and came into the
                  house laughing and shaking my wet, tangled hair.
               "Another ducking," said father, as I entered the room.
               "Yes, I kill two birds with one stone," I replied, smiling; "I have had a good
                  ride in my canoe and a good swim. When the canoe shot out from under me, it went
                  half way across the river, and I had to swim out and push it back."
               "Oh, Ellen, I fear you will be drowned yet!" said mother; "I wish that old Indian
                  had never made you that canoe; it is a dangerous thing."
               "It might be, mother, if I could not swim."
               "I have known of good swimmers being drowned," she said; "and I appeal to your
                  father if he has not heard of such things."
               "I have," he replied; "but it was in a jam of logs, and the person was frightened
                  or injured by blows. I think an otter is about as likely to be drowned as Ellen.
                  She can swim like a fish. I have no fears of her so long as she can keep her head
                  above water."
               "Yes; but suppose she strikes her head against a rock when she pitches out of the
                  canoe, and is stunned?" asked mother.
               "I think no danger is to be feared from that," he said.
               At that moment a young man knocked at the door, and I hurried away to my chamber
                  to change my dress.
               The name of the young man was Henry Goff. He resided down river at Brunswick. He
                  was the young lumberman who, a few years previous, cut down the grove of noble
                  pines on the opposite bank of the river, they having been left him by his father.
                  Other property he had inherited from his father, but he had spent it about all.
                  The land where the pine grove stood still belonged to him, and he came up to sell
                  it to father.
               Henry was a handsome fellow, educated, and naturally smart and energetic; but his
                  mind was not well balanced when he came into possession of his father estate;
                  besides he was too much given to he habit of drinking intoxicating liquors. The
                  marks of that habit was telegraphed in his face.
               At this time I was fourteen years of age, and my personal appearance was quite
                  attractive. At least, I had the authority of several young men for believing
                  so.
               The young men had often told me that was the most beautiful rose on the banks
                     of the Androscoggin. No doubt Henry Goff
                  had heard of my increasing charms. He saw me several times when I was a
                     little girl, but then that was nearly ten
                     years ago.
               While changing my dress and putting my curls in shape, he was
                  bantering with mother to buy his land, offering it cheap,
                     he lacked funds.
               I came into the room as they were conversing, and the young man
                  fastened his eyes upon me in a fixed and intense gaze
                     of admiration.
               
               "Is it possible that this girl can be the  curly headed Ellen I used to
                  see!" he exclaimed.
               "The same; but she has grown like a  for the past four 
                     yeurs
                     years
                  ," said father. "She will soon be as tall as her
                  mother if she keeps on a year or two longer."
               "That is if I am not drowned and become food for the fishes," I
                  said.
               
                  My remark led to a description of my nature
                  that afternoon; and the young man was surprised at my temerity in venturing out in
                  a canoe on the river.
               "Why, you cannot swim, can you?" he inquired, looking upon me, and admiring my
                  beaming countenance.
               "Swim!" I repeated, smiling and returning his look; "I can scarcely remember the
                  time when I could not swim."
               "Young ladies seldom learn such arts," he added; "but I think well of it."
               "So do I," I quickly replied; "I prefer swimming to dancing, for the latter
                  accomplishment I know but little of I think I could learn though."
               "No doubt of that," he replied, smiling, still keeping his eyes upon me, being
                  charmed by my fresh looks and sparkling, dark eyes.
               As I before hinted, he was a splendid young person, and, for once in my life, I
                  began to think I possessed power to charm even him.
               It seemed to me it was a greater feat to charm him than to please the rough, red
                  shirted lumbermen.
               The truth is, I began to feel some personal beauty, and so conducted myself as
                  best to please him. Knowing he lived in the city and among more accomplished
                  society than I had been used to, I felt ambitious to appear as genteel as I could,
                  and make him believe I was the handsomest rose that flourished on the banks of the
                  Androscoggin.
               Such vanity, pride and ambition then possessed my heart, and laid the foundation
                  for some peculiar traits of character which developed themselves more fully in
                  after life.
               In my work of charming this young person I succeeded quite as well as I could
                  desire.
               True, I had no love for him, yet I felt a strong desire to please him, so that he
                  might publish the fame of my beauty in the city.
               Mother did not know the secret thoughts of my heart, and the young was equally
                  ignorant of my motives. He spent some
                  days with us, and seemed in no hurry to go.
               Father was not inclined to buy his land, for the river divided it from his farm;
                  besides he said he had land enough.
               Henry was exceedingly anxious to dispose of it, for he was quite short of funds,
                  and tried to induce father to buy it; but his efforts were not crowned with
                  success. After losing hopes of selling his land, he finally concluded that he
                  should remove upon it, clear it up and make a farm.
               Father smiled when he heard Henry make such a declaration.
               "You smile," said Henry, first looking at father and then at me.
               "Why should I not smile at the prospect of having such a good neighbor," was
                  father's reply.
               "But you think I should make a fair hand at farming," added Henry.
               "You will find some hard work in clearing up such land," said father.
               "The big pine stumps will outlive you unless you dig them. Many long years must
                  elapse before they rot in the ground."
               "I suppose so; but then I can work them out," added Henry.
               "You can if you have help enough," said father. "To clear such lands requires
                  strong arms and resolute hearts. Your heart may be resolute enough; but I fear
                  your arms are not enough accustomed to labor to engage in such laborer's
                  work."
               "Oh, I could soon learn," added Henry, feeling as if he would like to live near
                  me, and finally make a wife of me.
               I have authority for making such a remark, for his conduct afterwards showed it
                  too plainly to be questioned.
               The next morning after the above conversation took place, he started for home, but
                  not, however, before declaring his determination to come back again early in the
                  autumn, build him a log house and commence the work of clearing up a farm.
               After he took his leave, father had quite a laugh; for the idea of such a young
                  man's clearing up a farm among the pine stumps appeared to him quite absurd and
                  preposterous.
               I here confess that I was glad the handsome young fellow addressed a determination
                  to come back again, but I kept that a secret in my own heart.
               The reader must not suppose that I had fallen in love with him, for such was not
                  the fact; but some how I thought I had made a conquest of him.
               In looking back on those days I am induced to believe that even at the age
                     of fourteen I was somewhat of a coquette. Be that as it may,
                  I secretly rejoiced that he was coming back.
               What strange fancies often occupy beautiful girls!
               I believe mothers are not generally aware of what is passing in the hearts their
                  young daughters. They seem to have lost all remembrance of
                  their own girlhood, or they would be more careful
                     and cautious in the education of their
                     fair daughters.
               They do not begin soon enough to instruct them; at least, so it
                  seems to me.
               
               The summer months soon passed, and again the leaves of the
                  trees began to assume their autumnal tints.
               The season for crops had been a good one, and our farm produced
                  an abundant harvest.
               No girl was ever better pleased with roaming over the fields
                  and pastures than I was. Yet there was something with that made
                  me sigh for more fashionable life.
               Occasionally I spoke of the young man Henry; but my parents did
                  not recommend him very highly, for they knew
                     he was wanting in sound 
                     judment
                     judgment
                   if he did not lack in moral principles.
               My step-father was not a penurious man, no miser, no worshipper
                  of gold, yet he believed it was the duty of
                     every man to be industrious and obtain an
                  honest living in this world.
               And this young man did not show signs of industry, but rather a disposition to
                  waste the inheritance he derived from his father.
               For this reason my father did not speak in much praise of him. In truth he took
                  special pains to point out to me the serious defects of the young man's character.
                  But this he would not have done if he had not supposed that Henry was smitten with
                  my present beauty, and gave out some evidence that he intended to make love to
                  me.
               Perhaps the caution of my parents was of service to me, so far as this young man
                  was concerned; but my impression has always been that I would never have loved
                  him, however much I might have appeared to enjoy his society.
               Another summer passed away, and the autumn, with its ripe fruits and rich harvests
                  came, and with it came Henry Goff and his hired man, who were bound to make an
                  opening for the young would-be farmer.
               A camp was soon erected, and work commenced on the new farm.
               Henry was not very dilligent in his labors, for he was often at our house and made
                  quite long visits—longer than was consistent with his labors upon his land. He
                  had, however, a stalwart hired man, who was industrious and faithful, clearing up
                  the land and preparing it for the seed in the spring.
               My cautious, prudent, far-seeing parents were constantly upon their watch
                     towers, observing all the young man's movements, so far at
                  least as their daughter was concerned.
               All their watchings are still vivid in my memory, and I can now see plainly
                     enough why they kept their eyes so very
                     close on me and the young man.
               It was right and proper; and yet, perhaps, it was not essentially necessary in my
                  case, but that they could not know. I confess to the fact that
                  I was proud to believe that I had made quite a strong
                  impression on the fellow's heart. And no doubt he fondly imagined his feelings of
                  attachment were reciprocated by me; but he was somewhat mistaken.
               And my mother was quite as much at fault as he was. My father, too, was needlessly
                  alarmed, for he was fully persuaded that Henry Goff was not a proper match for
                  me
               But I must hurry on to other scenes in my eventful life, which the reader will
                  find recorded in the next chapters.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               Anxiety to Find Out a Secret—No Success—The Parting—No Tears
                  Shed—Parents Rejoice, &c.
               Gay and lively and full of animation as I was at this period of my girlhood, still
                  there were hours when I was thoughtful and sedate.
               These feelings would occasionally come over me when least expected; but the
                  exuberance of my spirits would very soon drive them from my sensitive heart, as
                  the bright rays disperses the sombre clouds and spreads his dazzling sheen over
                  the landscape.
               I was more animated and cheerful when rising out of this thoughtful mood, as the
                  rays of the sun seems to be warmer for having been obscured by clouds.
               I was old enough to know that I was born out of wedlock, and an illegitimate
                  daughter. And I also felt at times that there was some disgrace attached to such a
                  birth in the estimation of the world.
               And these reflections upon my birth were sometimes a source of sadness and sorrow
                  to me; and yet these periods of sadness were of short duration, but none the less
                  pungent and sharp for being short.
               It cannot surprise the reader that the older I grew the more anxious I was to
                  ascertain who my father was, to learn his name, and to find out where he lived, if
                  living he was.
               I often catechised my mother upon the subject; but could never obtain any definite
                  or satisfactory replies to my questions.
               
               The older I grew the less I questioned her. And after I learned there was some
                  shame connected with such a birth as mine, I ceased to ask her any more questions
                  upon the subject.
               This was a relief to her; and so far I was rejoiced; but my curiosity did not in
                  the least abate.
               The secret of my birth was locked up in my mother's bosom; and there, I suppose,
                  it must forever remain undivulged. Sometimes I thought I had a right to that
                  secret, and that my mother ought to reveal it to me.
               And yet I loved her so much that I believed she could do no wrong, and that it was
                  my duty to pretend and reflect upon the subject as little as possible.
               Such a course I adopted, and made every effort to forget the nature of my birth;
                  but after all I could not bury it in oblivion, and I never indulged the hope that
                  at some future day I might be enlightened upon the subject, and 
                     perpaps
                     perhaps
                   see my father, who might acknowledge me as his own child. Such were my
                  emotions; such my hopes and fears at that early age when human life is supposed to
                  be most innocent and happy. And innocent and happy I was; for the world looked
                  bright and beautiful to me. My spirits were such and flowed so freely that it
                  seemed to me that no earthly thing could press them down. I loved my mother and my
                  stepmother, and for the best of reasons, for they treated me with the utmost
                  kindness and affection.
               Young Goff and his hired man continued their labors in clearing up the land; but,
                  as I have before intimated, the former spent more time at our house than was
                  consistent with the progress of his farm labors. His visits increased in numbers,
                  and were often longer than was agreeable to my parents; for they readily saw the
                  cause of them. And I confess I was proud of the power I believed I exercised over
                  him. A young girl is easily flattered. Although I strove to conceal from my
                  parents that peculiar pride which then swelled my heart; yet
                  after all I did not succeed half so well as I imagined, for
                     they could see farther in my heart than I supposed they
                  could. And yet they did not fully comprehend me or understand
                     all the motives that pressed my heart.
               They imagined I was fast falling in love with the young man,
                  but they were much mistaken. The truth is, I did feel as if was
                  in much danger of being fast bound in the silken cords of love; but I was pleased
                  with the thought that he was very deeply interested in me, and in a fair was to
                  become strongly attached to me.
               One evening he remained at our house unusually late; so late that father retired
                  in the hope that he might take the hint and go home. But he
                  remained for some time after father had retired.
               Mother became quite impatient to retire, and did all she could to make him take a
                  hint without absolutely turning him out of doors.
               During the evening I was very cheerful and gay, making myself as agreeable
                     as possible, and even striving to make him believe that I
                  was all but in love with him.
               I was sorry for this after he took himself off, for I found such a demonstration
                     on my part was very far from being 
                     agreeble
                     agreeable
                   to mother, as I soon learned after his departure.
               "It appears to me, Ellen," said mother as soon as he had bid us good night,
                     "that Henry takes no note of time. And I fear he does not
                  labor very hard through the day, for if he did he would seek his rest
                     at an earlier hour than this. Laboring
                     men generally wish to retire early, for sleep
                     is sweet to them."
               "I think he did stay longer than usual," I replied, while mother took out of her
                  pocket a gold watch which had been given to her before I was born, and looking at
                  it.
               "It is nearly eleven o'clock," she continued; "and it is time for laboring
                     men to be in bed. Did you not, Ellen, discover that I was
                  impatient?"
               "I did not particularly notice it," was my reply, gazing into her face and 
                     observ-
                     observing
                   an unusual expression of anxiety in her countenance.
               "You must then have been looking more at the young man than you were at me," she
                  continued, 
                     fastenihg
                     fastening
                   her dark and penetrating eyes upon me in a manner that told how deeply
                  she felt. "You ought to be more thoughtful, Ellen, and watchful of my feelings.
                  Did you not observe that I often took out my watch and looked at the time?"
               "I saw it, but did not think what your motive was," I answered, now seeing very
                  clearly what her object was, and regretting my want of attention.
               "Ellen," she continued, in slow and measured words, "you are quite young—too young
                  to think of receiving the attentions of any young man. A dozen years hence will be
                  time enough for you to think of such things. The peace and happiness of many a
                  girl have been destroyed by their forming too early attachments. Seldom have I
                  spoken to you upon such subjects, because I have not deemed it necessary till the
                  present moment. And I hope even now that it may not be absolutely necessary; and
                  yet caution is a great virtue, and one which young girls ought to observe and
                  practice. You very well know your father's opinion of Henry Goff, and his opinion
                  is not to be slighted, for he is a close observer of character, and understands
                  human nature much better than many who have more book knowledge than he has. His
                  experience and observation have taught him lessons which cannot be learned from
                  books; and you may be assured that he feels a very deep interest in your present
                  and future welfare and happiness."
               "Oh, mother, I know all that, and I love him for it," I quickly replied.
               "I am, aware, Ellen, that you respect your stepfather, and therefore hope you will
                  always heed his advice and be properly influenced by his opinions," she continued.
                  "He will always advise you for the best."
               "Mother, I know very well what causes you trouble," I added, smiling, and looking
                  fondly into her face. "You think that I am almost in love with Henry. Now there is
                  not the least danger of that. He is much more likely to love me than I am to love
                  him."
               "And do you, Ellen, wish him to love you?" she anxiously inquired.
               The question I did not immediately answer, and for the reason I did not know what
                  answer to make.
               Mother saw my embarrassment, but could not exactly divine the cause.
               Now I did entertain a secret desire that he might love me; but not because I
                  really loved him, or even expected to love him at some future day, when I might be
                  old enough, in mother's opinion, to indulge such a feeling toward one of the
                  rougher sex. I suppose it was my pride that engendered such a desire.
               "You do not answer my question, Ellen," she continued, after a brief pause. "If
                  there is no danger of your loving him, as you say, why need you hesitate to answer
                  my question? Sure you cannot wish to win the affections of a young man which you
                  do not expect to reciprocate! That would be coquetry, and nothing else. And let me
                  here and now warn you against that folly."
               "Is it folly, dear mother?" I asked, laughing, and appearing quite cheerful.
               "Yes, worse than folly," she replied; "it is a sin and a shame; and the girl who
                  practices it will sooner or later suffer for it, and be caught in her own snares.
                  There is danger in such a course; depend upon it, Ellen." No young lady can be
                  respectable or even safe herself who practices such deceit through pride or any
                  other motive. I have known more than one coquette who has severely suffered for
                  her folly. Let me advise you never to travel in such a path, however pleasant and full of
                  flowers it may appear to be; for the end is full of pride and dangers."
               I promised to remember her words and to follow her advice.
               After I retired to my neat little bedroom and crept into bed, I seriously
                  reflected on all mother had told me. Her words sank deep into my heart, and yet my
                  foolish pride would occasionally predominate over what she had said, and make me
                  sigh for such conquests.
               During this period of my girlhood I had formed a sort of ideal man, such as I
                  thought I could really love, if ever he could be met with. And he differed
                  essentially from Henry Goff.
               Well do I remember of forming such an image; but could not well describe him. Such
                  dreams will often trouble young girls; but let me here warn them to discard all
                  such notions and drive all such follies from their hearts. No good ever did result
                  from such dreams; and sometimes they are attended with evil consequences,
                  spreading a blighting mildew over the heart, and producing a sort of sickly
                  sentimentality which renders it unfit for the enjoyment of true love and affection
                  in after years.
               What can we reason but from what we know, has been well said. All my experience in
                  life has taught me many valuable lessons; but these instructions always seemed to
                  come too late for my good; and all I can now do to atone for the past is to let
                  others have the benefits of my sad experience.
               I have now lived nearly three score years, and have a fair prospect of living ten
                  more years. I intend to devote the remainder of my days to doing all the good that
                  is within my power. And for several years past I have been engaged in helping my
                  sex out of their troubles; but not so publicly and openly as I might have
                  done.
               Until now I have been contented to work in a more unassuming way, and yet I trust
                  I have done some service in the cause of humanity.
               But I must not in this stage of my narrative deal too much in generalities to the
                  neglect of the more interesting and instructive incidents of my somewhat eventful
                  life.
               It was now late in autumn, and another winter was almost at our doors. The young
                  farmer and his hired man was still engaged in felling trees and preparing for the
                  work of the coming spring.
               No snow had yet fallen, but the ground was frozen hard, and the river was one
                  glare of ice, which shone like a mirror far up and down the stream.
               To me there was always something very beautiful in the changes of the seasons,
                  even when the change was from autumn to winter—a season that most people appear to
                  dread in high northern latitudes. But for me winter as well other seasons had its
                  charms, and my heart was full of joy at all times save when thoughtful moods would
                  come over me, and pride and ambition would somewhat distrust my mind. But after
                  all I was generally joyful and happy; for how could I be otherwise with such kind
                  parents and pleasant surroundings?
               The autumn was unusually pleasant, although the weather was cold. Father said we
                  should have our pay for all this bright autumnal sunshine and clear, pure air.
                  "Winter will come upon us like a lion," he said. And soon it did so come in the
                  shape of a terrible northeast storm, that raged for three days, blocking up the
                  roads with snow drifts, and rendering all communication with our neighbors almost
                  impossible. Nearly three feet of snow had fallen, and young Goff and his man had
                  hard work to reach our house after the storm. But they did so, and remained with
                  us several days.
               During these days I was not idle, improving every opportunity I had to wind the
                  silken cords of love around the heart of the young farmer, and at times making ing
                  him believe I was deeply in love with him. But when I made such demonstrations I
                  was careful that mother's eyes were not upon me.
               It was strange that I indulged such a propensity, when I knew it was not right,
                  and contrary to my mother's warning voice.
               She closely watched me, and my stepfather's eyes were sharper than they appeared
                  to be. He was very shrewd and cunning; and yet he would appear to be quite
                  indifferent while he was the most observant and watchful.
               I had good protectors and advisers, and the restraints they threw around me were
                  salutary and not without their influence. And yet sometimes I would break away
                  from them, and indulge my natural disposition of pride and ambition.
               It was evident to me that the young man's heart was growing very tender, and yet I
                  felt no love for him; at least, such was my impression. But such was not the
                  impression of my parents, for they seriously feared that I was really becoming
                     entangled in the net I was spreading over the young
                  farmer.
               A week had passed, and still Henry was with us; but his hired man had gone down
                  the river, for no more work was to done on the farm now that stern winter had
                  fairly set in.
               Father was anxious that the young man should depart, but he was
                  too polite and good natured to actually shew him the
                     poor.
               Mother contrived all sorts of plans to get rid of him. She was
                  more frank than father, and occasionally gave the young
                     lover some very broad hints.
               Finally he took his leave, much to the joy of my parents. And I
                  can assure the reader of these pages that I shed no tears
                     on the occasion; and for that mother was
                     thankful.
               After he was gone they found me quite as cheerful and happy as
                  usual. Such was my life at that time.
            
            
               CHAPTER V.
               The Effects of Intemperance—A Warning to Young Men—Ambition-Pride
                  &c.
               How rapid is the flight of time, especially to those who have numbered many
                  years!
               The more time we see the swifter it appears to leave us, and yet the end appears
                  at a great distance.
               Another spring came, and the joyous birds began to give us their sweet music.
               The young farmer and his man also came, determined to burn off the brush and put
                  in the seed.
               Henry must have had a hard winter, for he had changed somewhat. But the change
                  came upon him more from the use of alcoholic drinks than from an indulgence of
                  unrequited love—at least, such was his appearance.
               Father always knew he was given to strong drink, and the habit had evidently
                  increased upon him during the past winter. His face was rather bloated, and his
                  nervous system was apparently deranged. His deep potations, however, had not
                  drowned out his love for me, for he appeared to be more under the influence of the
                  tender passion than he was last fall. And I here confess that his presence was
                  less agreeable to me than it was a few months previous.
               Parental eyes discovered the fact; and I could see its happy effects on my natural
                  protectors. Father always feared the young man would find a drunkard's grave; but
                  did not imagine he was so near it as he was.
               Some constitutions can bear more alcoholic liquors than others, and yet they
                  poison, more or less, the sources of health and strength of all. A few young men,
                  it is true, have been intemperate and lived to a good old age; but that only
                  proves the power and strength of their constitutions, and furnishes no argument
                  for the use of intoxicating drinks. Thousands find a drunkard's grave in early
                  life, while but very few reach riper years who indulge dulge the habit of 
                     drihking
                     drinking
                  ; therefore the only safety is on the rock of total abstinence. The
                  moderate drinker may, and probably will, become a drunkard; but he whose feet are
                  firmly planted on the rock of total abstinence can never go down to such a
                  dishonorable grave as that of the inebriate.
               Let the young men bear this in mind, and govern themselves while yet they have the
                  power; for the use of the intoxicating cup bewilders, and leads its votaries in
                  the path whose end is 
                     distruction
                     destruction
                  .
               One afternoon the young farmer was at our house. When he came in father and mother
                  were in the garden making a flower bed, for she was very fond of the cultivation
                  of flowers. He had evidently been drinking quite freely, for he was unusually
                  silly and talkative, full of smiles, and boasting of the great labor he had
                  performed that day.
               I instinctively shrank from his presence but he was more bold than usual, and
                  approached me in an unpleasant and disagreeable manner. Seizing my hand he bent
                  forward in an attempt to kiss me.
               Instantly withdrawing my hand from his grasp, I gave him a push that sent him
                  prostrate upon the floor. He fell hard and bruised one of his cheeks so much that
                  the blood ran down upon his shirt collar. He did not rise at once, but remained
                  partially up, resting on one of his elbows.
               "Why, dear Ellen," he said, in a kind of broken voice, "how could you use me
                  so?"
               "Then keep away from me," I replied; "your breath is very offensive."
               At that instant mother entered the room, and saw the young inebriate in his
                  reclining position. She was much surprised, especially when she noticed his bloody
                  shirt collar and the strange expression of his face.
               On her entering the room he at once arose, and as he did so he happened to see his
                  face in the glass that hung near where he stood. The blood appeared to frighten
                  him, and he stood and trembled. For a short time mother was agitated; but when I
                  told her he fell down, she at once saw the cause of the bleeding which he had
                  inflicted on his face. He was silent, and not disposed to give utterance to his
                  feelings, for the blow upon his heart was quite as severe as that upon his
                  cheek.
               Mother stood gazing, first upon one and then upon the other, as if she would read
                  the hearts of both. At last she spoke:
               "How is this?" she inquired, appearing to address her question to both of us.
               "Nothing very startling," I replied. He attempted to be saucy. I pushed him, and
                  he fell down—that's all."
               "Henry, I am sorry to see you in such a plight," she said.
               "Perhaps, mother, bleeding will do him good," I added, smiling, while he stood
                  looking as solemn as a gravestone.
               It was a hard task for mother to conceal a smile she felt
                  rising from her heart to her lips. She was glad to know that
                     her daughter had the will as well as the
                     power to resent insults, come from what quarter they
                  might.
               After a short time had elapsed the young farmer left the house. He met
                     father coming in, but he looked so very
                     sorrowful and sad that father did not speak to him, and let
                  him pass in silence I informed him of all that had happened. A hearty laugh shook
                  his sides. He could laugh the best of any man I ever heard. His was a sympathetic
                  laugh—deep, loud, long and full of feeling. No one could hear him and not join
                  with him; it was absolutely catching.
               "After all," said father, having finished his laughing, "I pity the poor chap. He
                  will soon run out all the property his father left him; and, what is still worse,
                  liquor has pretty well used up his constitution and broken him down. If he lives,
                  he will be an old man before he sees even thirty winters."
               Father praised me for thus resenting his insults, and gave me on the occasion some
                  excellent advice. Would to heaven I had always given heed to it! If I had this
                  narrative would never have been written.
               Several days passed, and the young farmer did not visit us. But we heard of him
                  occasionally. He drank more freely than ever before, for he had a full supply of
                  liquor in his camp.
               One morning his hired man came to our house in a great hurry, informing father
                  that Henry was in a terrible state of mind, and desiring father to go and see the
                  young drunkard.
               While father was preparing to go I stood at the door, and saw Henry himself coming
                  with great speed, and looking as wild as a savage.
               Soon I gave the alarm, and ran into the house, for I was frightened.
               Delirium tremens!" said father, as the young man approached, his eyes glaring and
                  froth hanging about his lips.
               "Take him off!" exclaimed Henry, in wild and terrible accents. "Take him off, and
                  save me!"
               "Take what off?" asked father.
               "This great snake!" replied Henry, motioning his hands as if he were trying to
                  unwind a snake from his body. Don't you see him! There! His eyes are balls of
                  fire, and his sting is darting from his mouth! Oh, God! He presses so I can hardly
                  breathe. Cut him apart and relieve me from his deadly fangs! See! how he winds
                  about me! Take him off!"
               The poor inebriate was now nearly exhausted, and fell upon the ground, where he
                  turned and twisted his body into all sorts of forms. A horrid expression was upon
                  his face. His eyes were bloodshot, his lips swollen and livid. The froth was
                  running over his chin, and every muscle in his body trembled as if he would shake
                  into a thousand pieces.
               "I think he will die," said father.
               "I have seen him so before, but not quite so bad," added the hired man.
               At last he sprang from the ground, screamed, looked wildly about, and tried to
                  run, but nature was too much exhausted, and again he fell upon the earth, writhing
                  and turning in the greatest agony.
               "Ah, it is a terrible disease!" exclaimed father. "It seems to me no person would
                  dare to swallow such poison when he sees it produce such effects as we here
                  witness."
               I stood in the doorway and saw the death struggle of this young man, and never can
                  I forget the scene. It is yet vivid in my memory, although many years have passed
                  since it occurred.
               The young man never recovered, but died that day in the greatest agony mortal ever
                  suffered.
               I spread these facts upon the record, that young men may learn from them the
                  lesson of total abstinence from all intoxicating drinks.
               This young man was the first lover I ever had, if lover he could be called.
               After his death I had some misgivings in relation to my conduct towards him; but
                  these soon wore away, and I began to seek for other adventures.
               True, my sphere was very limited, but then there are no bounds to the imagination,
                  and mine was constantly on the wing.
               I was the pet of all the river drivers and the red shirted lumbermen. As they
                  passed up and down the river, they invariably called to see the Rose of the
                  Androscoggin, as they called me.
               They were rough in their manners, but their hearts were noble. Their weather
                  beaten faces and their stalwart forms I shall always remember; but their
                  attentions and flatteries never did me any good, however pleasing they might have
                  been to my ambitious girlhood. They taught me to think too much of myself and to
                  prize my beauty too high. Girls do not need such lessons, for such instruction is
                  too easily learned by them at all times and under any circumstances.
               Another summer passed, and another winter
                  came, but they made no material changes in our domestic relations. We lived
                  happily; and next summer would be my sixteenth. What an interesting age!
               That summer came; and sixteen years had passed over me since my birth. I began to
                  throw off my girlish actions, and to assume the manners of a lady.
               My beauty had thus far in life increased with my years. On my birthday I overheard
                  father say to mother that I was the handsomest girl he ever saw. Mother's reply
                  was that if I only behaved as well as looked she would be satisfied. I listened,
                  but heard no more about myself on that occasion. Mother's taste in matters of
                  dress was very fine, and she took great pride in preparing me an excellent
                  wardrobe. True, it was not an extravagant one, but quite as good as I deserved
                     or her pecuniary means warranted
               Soon after I had celebrated my sixteenth birthday, father was called to go down
                  river and see a man who had been suddenly taken ill with a fever. He was a
                  particular friend of our family. The fever ran high, and father remained with the
                  patient several days until the danger was over, when he came home. Soon we heard
                  of another man who was taken down with the same disease, and shortly afterwards
                  father began to complain of feeling unwell.
               Mother was alarmed, and not without cause, for fear had already began its work.
                  Father was a strong man, but the disease proved too powerful for his stalwart
                  frame. He died in less than a week, and sadness and sorrow were our companions. No
                  medical skill or good nursing could save him. It was a sad death for me, for I
                  loved him as much I could if he had been my own father. He was a noble hearted
                  man, and his sudden exit from this world has ever been fresh in my mind.
               His death was a sore affliction to mother. I now urged her to sell the farm. and
                  remove to some city where we could see more of the world; but she had no wish to
                  leave the spot which was so dear to her. I sighed for more fashionable life, and
                  began to be dissatisfied with a lonely life on the bank of a river however
                  romantic the location might be. Scenery, out door sports and romping over fields
                  and pastures had somewhat lost their charms for me. I wanted to mingle more in
                  society, where I could exhibit my great beauty to better advantage and wound the
                  hearts of men.
               I had such dreams occasionally in spite of all the good lessons my parents had
                  taught me upon the subject, and in spite, too, of my own good sense and
                  judgment.
               There were several young men scattered up and down the river who were honest,
                  industrious and well behaved. The fair reader will not be surprised to learn that
                  these young men occasionally called at our house. I treated them kindly, and once
                  in a while endeavored to make them believe they were quite pleasing to me; but my
                  ambitious thoughts were far away from them.
               I did wrong, and knew it; and yet it was so pleasant to me to flatter them
                  occasionally that I could not well resist the temptation.
               Mother often warned me against the use of my power over the hearts of young men,
                  unless my intentions were honest and sincere.
               She said there was no objection to my marrying a good hearted, industrious farmer.
                  In fact, she rather favored such a connection; but it was far away from me. My
                  notions of life were far above settling down on a farm, milking cows, making
                  butter 
                     aud
                     and
                   doing such work. No; my heart longed for a life in the city; and yet I
                  knew scarcely anything of such life. But I dreamed of it in my waking and sleeping
                  hours.
               Constantly did I importune mother to sell her farm and leave the banks of the
                  beautiful Androscoggin; but in vain. She had no such wish, and my efforts in that
                  direction proved abortive. She would not remove from the grave of her husband,
                  which was on the farm in a grove of maple trees in the branches of which I once
                  loved to hear the birds tune their songs.
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               An Indian Summer—A Visit to a Graveyard—A Stranger Appears.
               It was autumn—an Indian summer—and the weather was delightful. The trees were
                  painted with a skill that no human artist could reach. Never did the forest look
                  more beautiful and enchanting. A soft haze rested upon the hills, and the air was
                  still and pure. All nature seemed at rest.
               It was a bright and beautiful morning and I walked out and visited the grave of my
                  stepfather.
               Mother had set out some flowers on the small mound of earth that covered the
                  remains of an honest man and a kind husband. These flowers were covered at night
                  so that the frost could not wither them, and they were now fresh and beautiful as
                  in the summer months. The season had been dry, but their roots were watered by a
                  mother's hands, and many a tear had 
                     moistoned
                     moistened
                   the leaves. The birds were hopping about among the branches of the
                  maples that hung over the grave; but their time of singing had passed. In the
                  spring and summer months they had sung their songs, built their nests and brought
                  up their young, and now they were busy in feeding upon the good things a kind
                  Providence had furnished for them. Soon winter would come and drive them to a
                  warmer climate. And how industriously they improved their time.
               I sat upon a small stool which mother had placed near the grave, and there I
                  reflected upon many things, but especially did I call to memory the frequent
                  lessons the good man had taught me. It seemed to me that I could almost hear his
                  deep-toned voice, and see the smile which once played about his lips. I asked
                  myself the question what I should do if mother too should be called away to the
                  spirit land, and I be left alone in the world. O how I then longed to know who my
                  own father was, and whether he was living or not. That question I dared not ask of
                  my mother, and yet is seemed to me sometimes that she was anxious for me to know.
                  Not a word had passed between us on the subject for some years; but
                  notwithstanding that silence I yet hoped and believed that she would some day
                  reveal to me the secret.
               No doubt she was aware of my anxiety to know that secret, but was not inclined to
                  converse upon the subject. While I was thus communing with my own thoughts, I
                  heard the sound of footsteps. At first I thought mother was coming to the grave;
                  but on looking up I discovered a fine looking, portly gentleman, with a fishing
                  rod in his hand and a small basket at his side, fastened by straps over his
                  shoulders. He came directly towards me, and, with a smile and pleasant voice,
                  said,
               "Good morning my dear, and a pleasant one it is."
               "The weather, sir, is exceedingly fine," I replied, rising up, and gazing upon his
                  handsome florid face.
               "A grave here, I notice," he continued. Some one buried here, near and dear to
                  you, I presume."
               "Yes, sir; he who lies under that bed of flowers was my stepfather, and a kind,
                  good father to me he was," I answered.
               "It is a beautiful spot among these maples," he added, gravely. A fine prospect,
                  too, down the valley of the river. I think the Androscoggin is a very beautiful
                  river, and the scenery upon its banks quite romantic and picturesque."
               "The scenery is beautiful," was my brief reply.
               "Your mother is living, I hope," he continued.
               
               "She is, sir" I answered.
               "I must see the woman who has borne such a daughter," he added, smiling, and
                  gazing intently into my deep, dark eyes as if he would read my very thoughts.
               "She is in the house, sir, I replied, beginning to feel pleased with his fine
                  person and easy manners.
               And let me here say that I thought he was pleased with my personal appearance. At
                  any rate, he acted as if he was, and I laid that flattering unction to my soul. I
                  asked him to walk down to the house, and he very cheerfully accompanied me. Mother
                  was standing at the front door, and was quite surprised to see me thus
                  accompanied. He very politely introduced himself, and was quite easy and
                  agreeable.
               "I conclude you are fond of angling," said mother.
               "Extremely fond of it," he replied, or I should not have come all the way from New
                  York city to Maine.
               The name of New York city had a charm for me. I had heard of it, and also of
                  Boston; and I was very anxious to visit those cities.
               "Then you reside in New York," said mother.
               "That is my place of residence," he replied; "but I love to visit the country
                  occasionally, and enjoy the sports of hunting and fishing. I am now on my way to
                  the lakes whence your beautiful river here takes its rise."
               "Quite a journey from your city," she replied.
               "True, but then I am paid for all that in the enjoyment of the wild sports," he
                  added. "These excursions give me health as well as pleasure."
               "I presume so, she answered. "My daughter has killed many beautiful trout in our
                  river; but they are more scarce than they were a few years ago."
               The red blood came to my face; for it seemed to me that he would consider it
                  rather vulgar for a lady to fish for trout. But he soon relieved me from that
                  embarrassment.
               "Your daughter kill trout," he said quickly; "how delighted the ladies of New York
                  would be if they could enjoy such sport. Some of them do go into the country for
                  that purpose. If I had a wife I should be highly gratified to have her accompany
                  me on these excursions."
               "Then you have no family," said my mother, smiling and gazing upon his manly form
                  and pleasant countenance.
               "Not yet," he replied, laughing. "But I keep hoping for such relations in life. I
                  am not too old to indulge such a hope, am I, madam?"
               "O, no," she replied. "It is a privilege we all have without regard to age. All
                  hope, and it is that which keeps the heart whole."
               "True, very true, madame," he added, laughing very heartily, and gazing upon me.
                  "How old should you judge me to be?"
               "In the neighborhood of forty," mother replied.
               "I shouldn't think the gentleman was so old as that," I quickly added, smiling and
                  looking upon his round fair face.
               "Never mind," he answered. "Neither of you are far out of the way. I do not feel
                  the 
                     infermities
                     infirmities
                   of age. It seems to me that I as young as I was ten years ago. Good air,
                  exercise, enough to eat and a clear conscience will keep off old age a long while.
                  One seldom dies prematurely unless he violates some physical law; and most people
                  do violate such laws, and the penalty must always be paid sooner or later."
               "Very true," said mother;" and yet some die early who observe those laws you speak
                  of. My husband had a good constitution, and all his habits were good, but death
                  did not spare him. He was but forty years old when he died. A fever, which
                  prevailed here a few months ago, carried him from us."
               "I am aware that such cares do occur sometimes," he added. "But they are
                  exceptional cases, while the rule holds good."
               "No doubt of that," she said. "The best cannot live always. How long do you expect
                  to be in the woods?"
               "Some two or three weeks," he answered.
               "I hope you will call on your return, and let us know how many big trout you have
                  killed," I added.
               "I will do so with pleasure," he said, smiling. "As you are such a good angler I
                  should like to test your skill in the sport."
               "I should have no objections if there was a good opportunity," I answered.
               "Perhaps on my return, if it is not too late in the season, we may find some
                  stream not far off, where we can try our skill."
               I spoke of several brooks and some ponds in the neighborhood in which there were
                  trout. He was highly gratified with the information, and promised to try them on
                  his return. As he had promised to meet a man at a certain place up the river, he
                  could not tarry longer with us, and took his leave; but not, however, before he
                  made me a present of a beautiful gold ring which he placed upon my finger. His
                  hands were more smooth and delicate than those of our river drivers and farmers.
                  But let that pass. I was much pleased with him, and mother believed he was a very
                  wealthy as well as a polite and accomplished gentleman. The truth is, he made a
                  very favorable impression upon us, and I confess that I was glad he had promised
                  to call on his return. I marked the day of the month in the almanac when he left
                  us, so that I might the better know when the two or three weeks had elapsed. It
                  was about the first record I ever made in my life. And such a record! I can never
                  forget it; for from that date I seemed to have commenced a sort of new life. But
                  the reader must not infer from the above remark that I had fallen in love with
                  this New York gentleman at first sight, for such was not the fact.
               His manners were more easy, and his address more polite than those I had been
                  accustomed to witness in my intercourse with the rougher sex thus far in life.
                  Evidently he had mingled much with polished society, and knew how to depot himself
                  under any circumstances. That I was better pleased with him than any other man
                  that I ever seen there can be no doubt. Perhaps I ought to make one exception—my
                  stepfather for whose memory I had the utmost respect.
               "Well mother," I said after he had passed from my sight in a turn of the road that
                  led up the river, "who do you think of Colonel Beaufort?" That was the name he
                  gave us; and I thought it a musical one, of course.
               "He appears to be very much of a gentleman, she replied. "But Ellen, we must not
                  be carried away by outside appearances. Men born and bred in our cities and
                  accustomed to refined society, may appear well and please us by their manners and
                  address, but after all their hearts may be corrupt."
               "But are not men as virtuous in the city as in the country?" I asked.
               "There are, no doubt, many good men in the city," she answered; "but young men can
                  learn vice more early in the city than in the country, for there are more
                  temptations in the former place, and virtue is more severely tried. No doubt
                  Colonel Beaufort is rich, and it may be he did not acquire his wealth but
                  inherited. Therefore he may have led a life of ease and luxury. Such men are more
                  apt to yield to temptation than those who are obliged to get their own living by
                  industry and hard labor. Yes, Ellen, their is more danger in selecting a husband
                  from the city than from the country, and
                  for the many reasons that must have 
                     snggested
                     suggested
                   themselves to you."
               "I'm not, mother, disposed to question the truth of what you have said," I
                  answered. "But I should love to visit the city."
               "Well, Ellen, perhaps you may do so at some future day," she added. "It is
                  probable that I may visit Boston or New York next season, and of course I should
                  take you with me."
               I rejoiced to hear that; for she never said so much before. And the thought struck
                  me that she might go and see if she could not find my own father, if he was yet
                  living. How I longed to ask her if she knew where he was; but dared not do so at
                  that time. How often I asked myself the question why she did not give me some
                  information about him—his name, place of residence, or something in relation to
                  him. But for years she had not spoken one word upon the subject. And she must have
                  known that it would be natural for me to feel some anxiety about it. No doubt she
                  did know my anxiety, but did not like to think of it, much less talk of it, and to
                  me, her first born and only child, in particular. But I did not despair, believing
                  that some future day would reveal to me the secret, and hoping that day was not
                  very far distant. Mother had told me that her parents were dead, and that she was
                  the only one left of the family. I also learned from her that her parents were
                  once wealthy, but had lost all their property. They did not, however, lose with
                  their money their honor and respectability in the world. So much I knew of their
                  history.
               Mother owned a beautiful gold watch, of which she was exceedingly careful, seldom
                  permitting me to handle or to wear it at any time. Once, however, I had it in my
                  possession, and on opening it I discovered engraved upon the inside of the case
                  the following name: Charles Morton!
               A hundred times I have been on the very point of asking mother whom that name
                  represented; but I had not the moral courage to ask that question, especially
                  since I had grown up. Had I seen the name when I was a little girl, I should have
                  asked who it meant; but I did not have that privilege, for I was thirteen years
                  old before I saw it.
               The name I constantly kept in memory; for I suspected my father gave her that
                  watch with his name engraved upon it. But it was all mere suspicion.
               The more I thought of it the stronger were my suspicions. And mother's extreme 
                     crre
                     care
                   of the watch, and her keeping it from me at all times and on all
                  occasions; her indisposition to speak of it to me or to any one else; the
                  expression of her countenance many times when she looked at it to see the time;
                  all these things strengthened my suspicions, which now amounted to a belief that
                  my father's name was Charles Morton.
               How strangely the mind is operated upon by trifling circumstances, especially when
                  once suspicion is aroused.
               I found out that mother was a woman who could keep her own secrets, and no
                  ingenuity of mine could induce her to reveal them.

               Dangers of Beauty. The Watch. The Secret Revealed. Lessons for the
                  Unmarried, &c.
               Colonel Beaufort's name had become quite familiar in our house, for he was the
                  subject of frequent conversation in our little domestic circle.
               I took down the almanac which hung over the fireplace and 
                     fonnd
                     found
                  , on comparing dates, that he had been absent quite two weeks, and now we
                  expected him to arrive every day.
               I was strongly impressed with the belief that he would not fail to call upon us on
                  his return from his angling excursion to the lakes.
               Whenever I alluded to him in conversation with mother, she invariably read me a
                  lesson on the great dangers and the temptations of city life; how artful men were
                  who lived in large cities; how many girls were ruined by them; how many bad women
                  there were in such places whose sole business was to make money out of the
                  innocent and unsuspecting of their own sex; how they watched for opportunities to
                  lead girls astray from the paths of virtue and peace, and how many arts they
                  practiced to accomplish their hellish purposes.
               To these lessons I listened; but their full import I did not then comprehend as I
                  do now.
               The truth is, the more she talked to me of city life and its temptations, the more
                  anxious I was to see for myself; for I felt a strong confidence in my own powers
                  to avoid the bad and choose the good which were to be found in such a life.
               How short sighted are the young! And yet how wise in their own conceit! I can now
                  see and feel the full force of all the moral lectures my good mother gave me or
                  such occasions.
               She knew very well how many dangers my personal beauty might lead me to
                     encounter even in the country; and yet I did
                     not dream of these dangers.
               It seemed to me that I should have a pleasant sea to sail over; and what of
                     personal charms I possessed I intended to turn to
                     a good account and make the very most of it.
               I do not know that I had more vanity than
                     other girls whose personal beauty was as
                     great as mine; but I had enough of it, an if I had possessed
                  less of it no doubt it would have been much better for me.
               Such are some of the traits of my character at the age of
                  sixteen. But I must hasten to other events.
               One afternoon, about a fortnight after Colonel Beaufort left
                  our house, mother complained of a serious headache, a disease which seldom
                  afflicted her. The attack was sudden and severe, so much so that she was somewhat
                  alarmed lest she might be taken down with the same fever that had prevailed that
                  season in the neighborhood.
               Before this attack she had occasionally told me that she did not think she should
                  survive her husband very long. She appeared to be impressed with the belief that
                  her death was not far distant. She was not superstitious, and never indulged
                  gloomy thoughts; but recently she believed she was not long for this world. No
                  reason could she give for such a belief, and yet she felt as if her sands of life
                  had almost run out. But I did not participate in her fears; at least, not until
                  the attack of headache.
               "Ellen, you know that ever since Mr. Birchwood's death I have felt a presentiment
                  that I should follow him ere many months should elapse," she said, as I was
                  engaged in bathing her head and rubbing her throbbing temples.
               "True, dear mother, I have often heard you express such a feeling; but I do not
                  think you will die very soon," I replied. "It is only an idea you have indulged
                  and brooded over since father's death. 
                     Becausd
                     Because
                   he died it does not follow that you must. I am sure you never have
                  indulged such superstitions, and why should you now."
               "I can give you no reason," she added. "Such impressions have been upon my mind
                  ever since your father's death, and time has only deepened them. And now they are
                  stronger than ever. But, Ellen, I am not afraid to die; and yet I desire to live
                  for your sake. You have never needed a mother's care more than you now do. At your
                  age girls need not only counsel and advice, but also protection. If I should die
                  you would be left alone in the world with no one to care for you."
               "Oh, mother, I hope you will live many
                  years yet, and see me well settled in life ere you die."
               "I wish I might; but I fear, seriously fear that you will be compelled to fight
                  the battles of life without my counsel and protection. Bear always in mind the
                  lessons I have recently taught you. I fear you will soon be left alone to buffet
                  the world."
               "Is there no one living but you who would care for me?" I asked, in a trembling
                  voice, anxiously wishing she would speak of my father, but not daring to speak of
                  him myself.
               She intently gazed upon me for a moment, and then covered her eyes with her hand.
                  A severe struggle was in her heart. At least it seemed so to me; for her breathing
                  was shorter than usual, and her voice trembled.
               "Does your headache increase?" I inquired.
               "I hardly know; I think it is no better; the pain is quite severe; you may leave
                  me for a short time, and perhaps I may sleep a little."
               I did leave her for a short time; and oh, with what emotions! Never before had my
                  heart been so pressed with such feelings. It seemed to me that it would burst, so
                  violently did it beat. A few moments previous I indulged the hope that she was
                  about to speak to me of my father; but instead of that she requested me to leave
                  her alone! But I did not despair; for it was not in my nature to indulge such a
                  feeling under any circumstances. True, I was impatient; and yet I believed she
                  would one day reveal to me that secret, and perhaps ere many hours should pass
                  away.
               I went to the door and gazed upon the river which had recently been swollen by the
                  autumnal rains. There was some floating ice on the waters, and occasionally some
                  lumber would be borne along upon its current, reminding me of poor Henry Goff and
                  his terrible death; for he often boasted that he intended to become rich in
                  lumbering operations; but my stepfather always laughed at his wild notions.
               I stood some time looking upon the river as it flowed along past the house, and
                  reflecting upon past events. At last mother called me, and I hastened to her
                  bedside.
               "Do you feel worse?" I anxiously inquired, smoothing back her hair from her
                  forehead and rubbing her temples.
               "I feel no better, and fear that this pain in my head is but a premonitory symptom
                  of that fever which has proved so fatal this season on the banks of our
                  river."
               "I think you will feel better if you can only get some sleep," I said.
               "Perhaps I might if I could sleep; but I cannot now," she added in a tremulous
                  voice, that told how deep were the emotions of her soul.
               "I hope you will sleep to-night," I said.
               "I hope so too," she added, taking my hand and gazing upon me with such a look as
                  a mother only can give. "Ellen," she continued, after a brief pause, "you asked me
                  if you had no other friend but me who would care for you?"
               "I did, dear mother," I quickly replied "And is there no one but you? Shall,
                  indeed, be left alone in the world who you are taken from me?"
               "Dear Ellen, often have I though of revealing a secret to you; but it is a object
                  I dislike to speak of. I feel now as if it was duty to inform
                  you of something that will interest you and may be of
                     service to you hereafter."
               "I think I know in part what you would say," I added. "Speak,
                  dear mother, and tell me all."
               She now took her watch from under the pillow upon which her
                     head rested, and opened the outside case, on which a man's
                  name was engraved.
               "There, Ellen, that name is your father's," she said, pointing
                  her trembling finger at the name, Charles
                     Moreton. This watch he gave me, and now give it to you, for
                  I feel a strong presentiment that I shall not long need it. Take it and keep it
                  for my sake, and perhaps at some future period you may meet him who once owned
                  it."
               Giving me the watch, she turned her face from me, and appeared to be much
                  exhausted. Her breathing was hard, and her heart beat violently. I had no
                  disposition to disturb her with more questions at that moment. The watch was a
                  gift precious to me. I held it in my hand and gazed upon it with emotions I have
                  not the power to describe. How I longed her to say if my father was living, and if
                  she knew where he resided; but I dared not put such questions to her at that
                  moment when her heart appeared to be agitated by strange emotions.
               All was silent; and no sounds were heard in the room save mother's breathing and
                  the ticking of the watch as it lay in the palm of my hand.
               I sat down beside the bed and waited for her to speak. I sat some time before she
                  turned her face towards me. At last she did so turn her face, and her cheeks were
                  wet with tears.
               My heart began to beat violently, and tears stood in my eyes. Never before did
                  such emotions agitate my bosom. I could have died in my chair that moment if my
                  death could have lifted the burden that bore so heavily on her heart.
               At last she spoke, but with a voice low and full of trembling. Although my eyes
                  were filled with tears, yet my ears were open to catch every sound of her
                  voice.
               "Ellen, you know now your father's name, and would to Heaven he could see you and
                  give you a father's protection; but, alas! I fear that can never be!"
               "Then he is living?" I quickly added.
               "God only knows!" she replied. "I have not seen him since you were a year
                  old."
               "He saw me then, did he?" I anxiously inquired.
               "A few times," she replied. "He said you were a beautiful child. Well do I
                  remember that."
               "Why did he not live with you and take care of you?" I asked.
               She made no reply, but again turned her face from me. She was so much agitated
                  that I was sorry I asked such a question.
               Again there was silence. And how oppressive was that silence to me, and no doubt
                  it was to her.
               After a long pause she again gazed upon me and spoke.
               "Ellen, I will tell you all!" she said, in broken accents. "Yes, I will tell you
                  all, for it may learn you a lesson. Your father deceived me, promising to marry me
                  when he had a wife living!"
               "Oh, Heavens!" I exclaimed. "Could he be so heartless and wicked!" Have such men
                  souls!"
               "Ah, Ellen, you know but little of the world yet," she said. "Men have such souls,
                  and some women have none better. Our own sex is often in fault, and yet I would
                  not judge them too hard. I loved, sincerely loved your father, and I believe he
                  loved me. And perhaps he did; but he ought not to have loved me; and I ought to
                  have been more prudent and cautious ere I gave him my heart. Men sometimes have
                  wives whom they do not love, and such men are dangerous characters. I hope and
                  trust you will be more prudent and cautious than your mother was when she was a
                  girl."
               "I will take care," dear mother, that I am not deceived," I added, feeling much
                  confidence in my own powers, and flattering myself that I would resist all
                  temptations.
               "I hope you will, Ellen; but it requires not only power but shrewdness and skill
                  to avoid all the snares men may set for you."
               "Dear mother, I shall never forget the lessons you have taught me," I added; "and
                  especially shall I remember what you have just said It has sank deep into my
                  heart, and will never be forgotten while
                  I have a being here on earth. Ah, mother, I fear it would be dangerous for a man
                  to make love to me while he had a wife living."
               "I do not counsel violence," she quickly added. "Vengeance does not belong to us
                  but to Him who hath said, He will repay it."
               "Perhaps I was too hasty, but my feelings were such at the moment that I could not
                  well help it," I said.
               "I can well excuse you, Ellen. I loved your father so deeply that I ever tried to
                  find excuses for him. Yes, Ellen, I did find excuses for his conduct, and in so
                  doing I discovered that I was not wholly free from fault myself. He would have
                  gone far away from his wife and lived with me; but I could hear no suggestions of
                  that kind from him. No, no, Ellen, I could never consent to that. He had a wife, a
                  legal wife who loved him, and I would not be instrumental in doing her a great
                  wrong and of making her unhappy; and I told 
                     himso
                     him so
                  . Had I earlier

                   been saved. When I ascertained he was 
                     as
                     a
                   married man I did all

                     money and

                   was his duty thus to contribute to support. Ah, those days have passed;
                  and I thank Heaven I am not obliged to live them over again! I can clearly see how
                  much I was in fault. Yes, Ellen, I committed wrongs for which I trust I have
                  sincerely repented. May you take warning, and so conduct yourself in the future
                  that you will not have such sins to repent of. Such is my prayer, Ellen, for
                  you."
               "I have once promised to heed your lessons, and now promise again." I replied.
                  "You have taught me to-day more precious lessons than ever before, and surely I
                  cannot forget them. No, mother, never."
               "Remember, Ellen, it has been said that love is blind; and it seems to me it is
                  so; at least, it covers a multitude of faults. But we will talk no more now, for I
                  feel much exhausted; I feel quite thirsty."
               I gave her some water, which she drank with a good relish. I began to fear that
                  she might have a fever, for there were many symptoms of that disease which had
                  spread a gloom over our house and over the whole neighborhood.
               Towards night she grew worse, and I called in an elderly maiden who was an
                  excellent nurse and a good judge of various diseases, for she had attended upon
                  the sick for many years.
               This woman pronounced the case a serious one, and every effort was made to "break
                  up the fever," as she expressed it. But, alas! all these efforts proved
                  unavailing, and a violent fever set in.
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               Dark Clouds Gather Fast. A Mother's Warning. Arrival of the Augier.
                  The Effect, &c.
               Another bright November sun arose, and the waters of the river sparkled with his
                  morning beams; but sorrow and sadness were the companions of our little
                  household.
               Mother grew worse, and her symptoms were indeed alarming. She urged me to be calm
                  and collected, and to prepare for the worst.
               Mother's strong impression was that this was her last sickness, and such was her
                  impression from the beginning.
               The nurse began to think so too. But how could I bear such a thought! How could I
                  endure to be left alone in this cold world! I did not, I would not despair! I
                  closely watched every symptom and noted every change in the disease—now hoping
                  that the crisis would soon be over, and now feeling doubts and fearful
                  apprehensions.
               The good nurse did all in her power, and the doctor, whom we had called, exercised
                  his best skill; but they gave me but little encouragement to hope for her
                  recovery; and yet I did hope. What a medicine to the soul is hope under such
                  appalling circumstances!
               I rejoiced that, while the fever raged, she retained full possession of her mind.
                  The disease turned more upon the lungs than upon the brain, and began to assume
                  the congestive form. Her breathing became hard and short, but her mind remained
                  bright.
               Such fevers often do their fatal work in a short time. But she was calm and
                  composed, and conversed freely upon the subject of death.
               "Oh, Ellen, I'm not afraid to die!" she said, while she grasped my hand and
                  pressed it with all a mother's emotions. "I could wish to live for your sake, but
                  God will protect you. Yes; but you must so conduct yourself as to worthy of such
                  protection."
               The nurse advised her not to talk too much, and she remained silent. Inflamed as
                  were her lungs, it required a very great effort to converse; but she was anxious
                  to counsel and advise me.
               After a brief pause she again spoke in a tremulous voice.
               "Ellen, you spoke of Colonel Beaufort yesterday, did you not?" she asked. "I
                  cannot very well remember."
               "You were right, mother," I replied. "It was yesterday I said I thought he would
                  return soon. I hope he will, for he might be of service to us at this time of
                  trouble."
               "We have good neighbors, and Colonel Beaufort is a stranger, and we know but
                  little about him. He may be a good man, and he may be a wicked one. Men have two
                  characters—an external and an internal one. His external character is fair enough;
                  but God knows his heart; we do not."
               "But you do not think he is a wicked man, do you, mother?" I asked.
               "I must not judge him," she replied.
               "He appears like a gentleman," I said, wishing to hear her speak more of him.
               "Yes; but appearances are often deceitful. "You will remember what I told you
                  about those who reside in cities."
               "I remember it all," I replied; "and shall never forget it."
               "He said he had no wife and family," she said. "Remember your own father told me
                  the same, and I believed him. Alas, it was not true! I would not judge Colonel
                  Beaufort, but he may not have told the truth."
               "I see it all, dear mother; I shall remember all you say."
               "Now do not understand me as expressing the opinion that he is a deceitful, wicked
                  man," she said. "I know nothing of his character; "but I only wish to caution you.
                  Be not deceived. Prove all things, and hold fast that which is good."
               The nurse now entered the room, and our conversation ceased.
               Soon after a rapping was heard at the door, which I immediately answered. And
                  there stood the gentleman we were talking about. He had just returned from the
                  lakes, and greeted me most cordially. From my manner and appearance he at once
                  thought that some trouble had come upon us.
               "You look sad, my dear," he said, as he pressed my hand and gazed upon me. "What
                  has happened? I hope you are not indisposed."
               I told him all; and he expressed much sympathy, and was anxious to see mother. He
                  was the same pleasant gentleman. I bid him be seated, and then informed mother of
                  his arrival and his wish to see her."
               "Then he has come!" she said, in a feeble, trembling voice. "I do not wish to see
                  him at present. Perhaps I may feel better soon, and then will send for him."
               I returned and told him what mother had said.
               "Very well, my dear," he said, smiling and holding my hand. "I see you wear the
                  ring I gave you."
               
               "Oh, yes; it is a very beautiful ring, and much admired by all who see it," I
                  replied.
               "I hope your mother will not be sick long," he continued.
               "I fear she will not live many days."
               "So sick as that!" he exclaimed; "I am sorry to hear it; I still think she will
                  get well. But if she should not you will be left alone in the world."
               "Yes," I answered, in a trembling voice, while he still pressed my hand.
               "You will find a protector," he said; "I have constantly thought of you since I
                  have been in the woods. No, dearest, you shall not be left alone and without a
                  protector so long as I live. But I trust your mother will yet recover.
               The nurse now entered the room and said mother desired to see me. Hearing her
                  footsteps he immediately released my hand. That fact induced me to think that he
                  felt as if he was not doing exactly right in such a short acquaintance. But I did
                  not give much thought to the circumstance at that time, my mind was so much taken
                  up with mother's condition.
               Immediately I went to mother's room, leaving the nurse and the Colonel together,
                  for she had quite a curiosity to see a New York gentleman. Now the nurse was no
                  fool, neither was she diffident or cowardly.
               "I understand the lady of the house is quite unwell," he said.
               "She is a very sick woman, sir, and her chances for recovery are slim indeed,"
                  said the nurse, eyeing him very closely and watching all his movements.
               "I and exceedingly sorry to hear it," he added. "She is a very fine woman, and her
                  loss must be felt in the neighborhood quite seriously. And her daughter, it would
                  be a severe blow to her."
               "Yes; but then we must take things in this world just as they come along," she
                  replied. "We must all bow to higher powers. It is a severe loss for a daughter to
                  lose her mother at any time; but Ellen is now sixteen years old, and if she
                  behaves well her condition will be quite well enough. She has good friends in this
                  vicinity, and she will be left with quite a handsome dowry. If she had less beauty
                  she might do better."
               "Why so?" he asked smiling, and gazing upon her with much curiosity. He thought
                  she was a kind of original genius; and so she was in some respects.
               "Why so!" she repeated; "because so many men will be running after her. You can
                  now understand what I mean, do you not?"
               "Certainly, madam; your meaning is quite plain," he answered. "I think she is one
                  of the most beautiful girls I ever saw."
               "Good Lord!" she exclaimed; "I hope you will not be running after her, for you are
                  old enough to be her father if not her grandpa. But these old hawks love young
                  chickens."
               "That may be true, madam," he said. "I trust, however, you do not place me in that
                  category.
               "In that what?" she asked, looking at him very intently through her spectacles and
                  taking a pinch of the neat Scotch snuff.
               "I mean you do not reckon me an old hawk," he replied, smiling.
               "There is no telling what these city gentlemen are," she added. "I have never been
                  in Boston or New York, but I understand they are full of iniquity. A few years ago
                  a daughter of a widow woman living not three miles from this house, went to Boston
                  to get employment, and she did get it with a vengeance. Too many men are no better
                  than brutes. This girl was seduced by a brute as old as you are. He promised to
                  marry her. Yes, that is the way they work! She was a handsome girl when she left
                  her mother, and a virtuous one too; but the spoiler came; and where is she?"
               "That is indeed more than I can tell," he replied, smiling, and admiring her want
                  of mock modesty; for there was not a particle in her composition.
               "I did not exactly ask you the question," she added. "The question I did ask I can
                  answer better than you can, sir. The girl lost her virtue, believed everybody was
                  wicked, and became a bad character. Such is city life. If I were a mother and had
                  daughters, the city is the last place on God's footstool I would permit them to go
                  to or live in. The villains all live there. The country air is the purest. Here we
                  work for a living, and that keeps us honest. You must excuse my plain speech, sir.
                  I always speak out what I feel. I abominate a hypocrite."
               "You and I think very much alike," he added, wishing to try the power of flattery
                  upon her. "You talk well, and I admire your frankness. The truth, too, you speak.
                  I frankly acknowledge your ideas of city life are very good, but I trust you
                  believe there are some good men in our cities."
               "There may be a few just to save them," she replied; "but I reckon the streets are
                  not overrun with them."
               "You are quite severe on our sex," he said; "but after all we deserve some
                  leniency."
               "No doubt of that," she added; "but I must see to my patient."
               While the nurse and Colonel Beaufort were thus conversing, I sat by the bedside of
                  mother, who felt much anxiety in consequence of the Colonel's arrival. Her
                  feelings upon the subject may be understood by the following dialogue:
               "Ellen," she said, soon after I entered the room and the nurse went out, "I feel
                  strongly impressed with the belief that, before many days shall have elapsed, I
                  must leave you to engage in the battles of life alone. That I feel much anxiety
                  for your prosperity in the world you can have no doubt. If I could be assured that
                  you would marry some good, honest, industrious farmer and live on this spot which
                  is so dear to me, I could die contented. Now there is Joel Armstrong, who is an
                  excellent young man, and would make you a kind and indulgent husband. And you very
                  well know he feels a very deep interest in you."
               "Oh, mother, do not be alarmed about me," I said. "You have given me good advice,
                  and I intend to be governed by it. But you would not have me become the wife of a
                  man whom I cannot love? No doubt young Armstrong is good enough for me, but he is
                  so rough and unpleasant in his manners."
               "Yes, yes, I understand all that," she replied, manifesting some impatience; "but
                  if he is rough on the outside his heart is good, and his habits of industry and
                  economy will ensure you a very good living."
               "I know it, dear mother; "but I cannot love him."
               "Very well," she replied; "that is quite enough. I would not have you wed a man
                  you cannot love. No, no, Ellen. I would not advise you to do so, however rich and
                  worthy he might be. But my greatest fear is that you may choose one who possesses
                  a handsome person and is well mannered, but whose heart is corrupt and wicked. You
                  must beware of such characters, as I have often told you. Be careful how you
                  receive presents from such men."
               "But, mother, you do not think Colonel Beaufort is such a man, do you?" I
                  inquired. "He gave me a ring and I gladly accepted it. I hope I was not wrong in
                  doing so.
               "I judge no man until I know him," she replied. "Colonel Beaufort appears well
                  enough, but the expression of his eyes did not please me, especially when he was
                  looking at yon. I noted that, and it made me feel somewhat suspicious that all was
                  not right. I may be mistaken, and I only speak of it to guard you from all harm.
                  You must not give him the least encouragement nor listen to any tale of love, if
                  he should ever speak to you on such a subject. Ellen, he is too old for you; for
                  you would be quite a young woman when he
                  would be an old man. You must look to the future as well as at the present. I do
                  not know as he ever thought of making love to you, and perhaps he never has, but
                  my warning can do no harm in that case. I only wish you to be guarded under any
                  circumstances that may happen. If I live I can take care of you. At least I should
                  hope to do so. It seems he has taken pains to call here, and that may mean
                  something. Ellen, to be frank with you, I fear he has some designs upon you; and,
                  therefore, I feel anxious that your conduct towards him should be marked with the
                  strictest propriety. Remember, Ellen, he is a perfect stranger, and he must be
                  treated accordingly. But I feel exhausted, and must not talk more at present."
               I listened with a deep interest to all she said, but made no reply. I felt the
                  full force of her advice; and, had she known what he said to me and how he acted,
                  she would have been much more alarmed than she was.
               It is true I was pleased with him, but did not dream of love. And yet he was just
                  such a man; at least it seemed to me he was just such a man as I could love,
                  especially if he was not so much older than I was. My fancy had formed such a man,
                  saving and excepting his age. The nurse came in about the time mother ceased her
                  conversation with me, and she was, therefore, ignorant of what had been said.
               "How long, Ellen, is that New Yorker going to stay?" asked the nurse. "It is not
                  convenient to have him here, as we are so much engaged and your mother is so sick.
                  I believe he wishes to see your mother, and he can do so for a short time, if she
                  has no objection."
               "I will see him soon," said mother.
               "I think that will be best, and then, perhaps, he will leave," added the nurse.
                  "If he stays here he must go to work and help us, but I suppose he does not know
                  how to do a thing 
                     exeept
                     except
                   catch fish. Such men are dreadful useless about a house."
               "Perhaps he knows more and can do more than you think he can," I said.
               "I dare say you think so, Ellen," said the nurse, looking slyly at me.
               The truth is, she saw him when he released my hand from his, and that circumstance
                  she would be most likely to magnify. Mother seemed to be in a sort of lethargy,
                  and was quiet.
            
            
               CHAPTER IX.
               The Progress of Disease. Startling and Fearful Dreams. The
                  Interview, and Strange Impressions.
               "She sleeps!" whispered the nurse; "That is well; a somewhat favorable symptom,
                  and yet, Ellen, I have but little hope. I have been with the sick so many years
                  that I can judge pretty correctly; but after all I have often been mistaken, and
                  patients have recovered whom I thought would die. Your mother has naturally a good
                  constitution, and that may get the better of her disease."
               "I'm glad she sleeps," I added. "She was quite exhausted, and sleep will do her
                  good. When she awakes I suppose she will permit Colonel Beaufort to see her; for
                  he feels very anxious to have an interview."
               "And is that all he feels anxious about, Ellen?" asked the shrewd nurse, taking an
                  extra pinch, and looking slyly at me, as if some very peculiar thoughts were
                  running through her head.
               "That is more than I can tell," I replied, somewhat disgusted by her remarks 
                     asd
                     and
                   sly hints.
               "Ellen, is his hand very soft?" she provokingly continued.
               I made no reply, and appeared hardly to notice her question. She then looked at me
                  for a moment, and then turned her eyes upon mother, who appeared to be waking from
                  her slumber. At last she spoke.
               "I believe I have slept some. I wish my slumber had continued longer."
               
                  
                     ELLEN, THE PRIDE OF BROADWAY.
                  
               
               "You have slept a short time," I replied. "Do you feel
                  better?"
               "Oh, Ellen, I don't know," she said in a feeble voice. "I do
                  not feel so much pain as I did, and for that I am
                     thankful. Give me some water."
               The nurse gave her some water, and she drank with a good relish, and it seemed to
                  refresh her.
               "You may ask Colonel Beaufort in now," she said. "Perhaps I can
                  see him now as well as at any time."
               "Well, you must talk but very little little with him," said the
                  nurse.
               I went out, and the Colonel accompanied me to the sick room. He walked very softly
                  towards the bed, and seemed to be full of sympathy and feeling.
               Mother spoke, and said she was glad to see him looking so well.
               "I wish I could say as much of you," he answered. "My health is very good, and
                  would to heaven you were now enjoying the same blessing. I am sorry to see you on
                  a bed of sickness; but I trust you will soon be better."
               Mother shook her head, and made no reply. He gazed upon her, and manifested fested much apparent feeling and
                  interest. All were now silent for a short time. He stood gazing upon her, and then
                  turned his fascinating eyes upon me as if he would be my protector under any
                  circumstances. At least such an impression did the expression of his countenance
                  give me at that moment. All were silent, and mother seemed 
                     to to
                     to
                   fall away into a kind of stupor, closing her eyes and breathing very
                  hard. Soon she began to mutter incoherent sentences, to which we all listened with
                  a deep interest. The word Ellen we could hear distinctly. Evidently I was the
                  subject of her dreams. At last she muttered the name of Beaufort, and her
                  countenance assumed a peculiar expression. He turned his head to catch every word
                  she muttered.
               "She speaks my name as well as yours," he whispered to me. "I wish we could
                  understand what she says."
               "If you did," quickly added the nurse, in a low tone of voice, "you might not be
                  so well pleased as you imagine."
               The Colonel turned his keen eyes upon her, but made no reply. She gazed at him
                  through her glasses and, and then took a pinch of snuff, as if she cared no more
                  for him than she did for the snuff she was taking. Again mother began to utter
                  broken sentences, and we listened to them attentively, hoping to make out some
                  meaning in what she said.
               "Ellen! Oh God—alone—world, wicked—danger—men!" she muttered.
               We could hear the above words, and the inference was that I shall soon be left
                  alone in the world where there was danger and wicked men. Such was the
                  construction the nurse put upon the words, and she declared it to us in an earnest
                  but low voice.
               The Colonel did not at all fancy the construction of the language; but he made no
                  answer to the nurse, except casting upon her a severe look, which she did not
                  appear to notice.
               "He has come!" continued mother, after a short pause, rubbing her forehead with
                  her hand, as if she were trying to collect her scattered thoughts. "Has he? Yes;
                  didn't I see him yesterday; or when was it? Oh! my head burns! Water."
               The nurse gave her some water, which she drank, and seemed to be fully awake and
                  in possession of her senses.
               "Did I sleep," she asked, turning her eyes upon me, and 
                     entending
                     extending
                   her hand.
               "I believe you have slept a little," I replied, taking her hand and pressing
                  it.
               "I thought I was dreaming, but I can remember nothing," she added.
               "You did appear to be dreaming," I replied, still holding her hand and gazing upon
                  her flushed, expressive face.
               She now saw the Colonel, who stood a little behind me, and instantly closed her
                  eyes as if the sight of him was more than she could bear. He noticed the
                  circumstance, and know not what construction to place upon it. The nurse did not
                  happen to see it, or if she did she manifested no signs of it. Mother kept her
                  eyes thus closed for a considerable time, and then gradually opened them. I stood
                  in breathless silence, fearing she might utter something that
                  might wound the feelings of the Colonel; for somehow I did not wish to have him
                  thus troubled when he appeared to be so much interested in our household affairs.
                  He appeared well and very friendly, and we knew nothing against him. True, mother
                  did not know but he might be a very wicked man with a fair exterior, and the old
                  nurse didn't think much of stylish gentlemen any way. I did not feel disposed to
                  condemn him without some proof against him; and surely we had no such proof. At
                  last mother spoke in a trembling voice, and directing her remark to him."
               "I hope you are as a gentleman as you appear to be," said mother.
               "I hope so, too, madam," he replied. "I am not aware that I appear very good. At
                  any rate I have not tried to assume that appearance. My conduct and bearing are
                  always natural."
               "I hope so, too," she replied. "Do good to all, and especially to the poor, the
                  weak and depending; for robust as your frame is, you have but a short time to live
                  in this world."
               "Life is indeed short at the longest," he replied. "I trust I shall improve 
                     it it
                     it
                  , and do all the good I can. No doubt you feel much anxiety about your
                  only daughter; but remember that God will not forsake her, even if she be left
                  alone in a wicked world.
               "You talk well," she said; "I must not distrust a good Providence; but men are
                  full of deception, and a young girl may be led astray."
               "Oh, madam, you speak the words of truth. Men are wicked, but not all men," he
                  replied, placing his hand of his breast and 
                     emphasing
                     emphasizing
                   the word all."
               Mother looked at him for a moment, and then closed her eyes. The nurse also
                  fastened her eyes upon him.
               I watched the movings of his face, and surely honesty seemed to be in every
                  lineament.
               But the old nurse entertained a very different opinion. She was prejudiced against
                  him, and her prejudices were not easily shaken off.
               Mother had again fallen into a stupor, and her breathing was hard. Soon she began
                  to mutter words and broken sentences. Her mind was evidently wandering.
               "Father—Ellen—he once—me—oh, where is he?" she said. "There! No, no; I did not—New
                  York—great—wicked. Has he come? Yes. Did he go away. Oh, Ellen! Alone!"
               "She shall not be alone!" said the Colonel. "There—excuse me, Ellen. I spoke from
                  the impulse of the moment, as if your dear mother could hear and understand
                  me."
               "The sick, in her state of mind, do sometimes hear and even answer questions,"
                  said the nurse. "I have known many instances of the kind. But she may be too much
                  exhausted. Her sands of life are fast running out."
               "I yet hope she will recover," said he Colonel.
               The nurse shook her head, and made no other reply.
               Mother continued to sleep and mutter still more incoherent sentences. My name we
                  could often hear, and the words city, New York. But we could
                  not put the words together so as to make a sentence. In this lethargic state she
                  continued for some time. At last she turned her head upon her pillow and opened
                  her eyes full upon me. Her lips moved, and she pronounced my name once. It was the
                  last word she uttered, and that in a voice scarce above a whisper.
               Oh that last look of my mother I can never forget! It seems to me I can see
                     it more plainly now than I did years ago. There have been
                  periods in my life when I scarcely remembered it; but, thank Heaven, those periods
                  are passed, and better feelings prevail.
               "She has ceased to breathe!" whispered the nurse. "Her candle has gone out! Ellen,
                  your mother is dead!"
               I will not attempt to describe my feelings on that occasion. They were such as a
                  daughter ought to feel when a good mother dies.
               Colonel Beaufort seemed to be much affected, and even the tears ran down his manly
                  cheeks.
               The news of this sad death spread through the neighborhood, and many called to
                  offer their friendly services on the occasion.
               Colonel Beaufort was very active, and helped us very much. He seemed to know what to do on such an occasion and
                  how to do it. Even the nurse reluctantly acknowledged he was a "very handy man."
                  And yet she was determined to believe he was "a great rogue among the women," as
                  she expressed it. That was her opinion from the first, and nothing he could do
                  would change it. She did not believe such a handsome man could be a virtuous one.
                  The old nurse liked plain people better she did handsome ones.
               The Colonel remained with us and assisted at the funeral, which was a very large
                  one for a place so thinly inhabited, for dwelling houses were at considerable
                  distance from each other on the banks of the river.
               Mother was buried in the maple grove by the side of her husband, and that sacred
                  spot I visited two years ago from this present writing. And if I should describe
                  all my emotions on that occasion it would fill a volume.
               The next morning after the funeral the nurse took it upon herself to read a
                  lecture; and she did it, too, from the best of motives.
               I did not then place full confidence in all she said, or have implicit faith in
                  her judgment; I can look back now and see that she was a woman of strong mind and
                  sound judgment. What might appear as prejudice was the honest conviction of a well
                  disciplined mind and the deliberation of a sound judgment and common sense, of
                  which she possessed an unusual share.
               "Now, Ellen, your mother sleeps in the grave beside her husband, and you are left
                  without any near relative," she said. "What course in life do you intend to
                  pursue?"
               "Really I cannot now tell, for I have not had time to think upon the subject since
                  the funeral," I replied.
               "I know you will excuse me if I speak plainly," she added.
               I answered her that I should not expect anything from her but plain talk and good
                  advice. I had no doubt but she was my friend, and would advise me to pursue that
                  course she thought the best.
               "True, Ellen, I feel an interest in your welfare," she continued. "I have lived
                  many years, and ought to know something of the world and have some little
                  knowledge of human nature. And be not flattered or feel vain when I express my
                  fears that your great personal beauty will prove a snare to you. I have never seen
                  but one girl who I think was as handsome as you are, and she fell an easy victim
                  to a heartless but handsome man. What was the New York gentleman saying to you
                  last evening? I noticed you and he were together and talking very busily out near
                  the woodpile?"
               "Oh, he spoke of the great loss I had met with," I replied.
               "And was that all he said?" she inquired, peering into my face through her glasses
                  as if she would read my inmost thoughts.
               "He remarked that mother was an excellent woman, and that he could hardly realize
                  the fact that she was in the grave. He seemed to feel much sympathy, and expressed
                  much regret that she was no more."
               "Ellen," she continued, in a firmer voice and more earnest manner; "did he not
                  express great admiration for your beauty and intimate that he would be your
                  protector? He looked to me as if he was making just such remarks. You can answer
                  me or not, just as you please. I have no selfish motive in asking the questions.
                  It is for your good and not to gratify an idle curiosity that I thus cathechise
                  you. I hope you will believe me."
               "I do believe you," I quickly replied. "He did speak of my beauty, and remarked,
                  just as you have, that beautiful girls are too often led from the paths of virtue
                  and innocence by cunning, heartless men, whose only object is the gratification of
                  their baser passions. Such men, he said, never knew what true love is—that pure
                  sentiment which real beauty inspires in an honest, sensitive heart."
               "Those were his words, were they?" she asked.
               "I think they are the very same," I replied.
               "He has a silver tongue," she quickly added, and looking earnestly at me. "Yes, a
                  real silver tongue, and a very handsome face and a musical voice. Ah, Ellen,
                  beware of such sweet words. The serpent has a painted skin, and there are thorns
                  near the most beautiful and fragrant flowers. Ellen, let me warn you not to place
                  confidence in that man before you know more of his character. I fear he is here
                  for no good. He looks to me just like a rogue in ruffles; and they are more to be
                  feared than a rogue in rags. Why does he remain here now?"
               I told her I did not know; and assured her that I did not believe Colonel Beaufort
                  was such a man as she represented him to be; for I had seen no evidence to
                  convince me of such a fact.
               But she was firm and decided in her opinion, and I could not shake her belief. She
                  said much more, which it is not necessary to record on these pages. But she was
                  honest; and the sequel will show whether her opinion was as sound as 
                     her her
                     her
                   heart was sincere.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               The Advice of Friends. Interesting Conversation. Intrigue. New York
                  City, &c.
               Two days after the funeral, and still Colonel Beaufort remains with us, and the
                  old nurse wonders why he does not leave. She becomes more and more anxious about
                  him, and wishes he would depart and go to his home in the city—a much more
                  suitable place for him, in her opinion, than the valley of the Androscoggin. The
                  neighbors, far up and near, called upon me in my affliction, and many young
                  farmers were often at the house, sympathizing with me and offering their services.
                  But Colonel Beaufort was the object of all eyes and the subject of much
                  conversation.
               My friends, urged on by the nurse, became alarmed for my safety. Many volunteered
                  their advice, especially the female portion of them. Warning upon warning I
                  received from them, and great interest was manifested in my behalf. And no doubt
                  good motives were at the bottom of all these movements; but I could not so fully
                  appreciate them then as I can now.
               The third day after the funeral services were performed I was at the grave, and
                  there most vividly remembered all the advice my good mother had given me. It
                  seemed as if not a single word she ever uttered escaped my memory, and most deeply
                  did I reflect upon them.
               While thus engaged in meditation in that sacred spot, Colonel Beaufort made his
                  appearance.
               It was late in the afternoon, and the weather was very pleasant. He had been
                  absent nearly all day engaged in his favorite sport of angling. This was his first
                  attempt at catching trout in this vicinity. I had told him where to go, and his
                  luck was much better than he expected, for he had caught a string of beautiful
                  trout, of which he appeared to be quite proud.
               I 
                     rtood
                     stood
                   near mother's grave as he approached, smiling.
               "Dear Ellen, your directions have been followed, and here is the result," he said,
                  holding up the string of trout and gazing fondly upon me.
               "You have been very lucky indeed," I replied.
               "But I would not disturb your meditations in this sacred place," he continued,
                  after a short pause, approaching near mo and taking my hand; "I, too, have stood
                  over the grave of a mother, and know how to sympathize with you on this occasion.
                  The greatest loss we can meet in life is the loss of parents, especially if they
                  die when we are young. I was but a year or two older than you are when my mother died; she was a
                  good woman, and most dearly do I cherish her memory."
               "I have, indeed, met with a terrible loss, and God only knows what my fortunes are
                  to be in this world!" I replied, as the tears ran down my cheeks and my lips
                  trembled with emotion.
               "I trust and believe your fortunes in life will be favorable," he said; "I have
                  been thinking all day what sent me to your house at all. My first call was an
                  accident, and my second, after my return from the lakes, was urged upon me by a
                  mysterious power that I could not resist. I know I promised to call on my return,
                  but then I did not know as I should return this way. In fact I did not expect to;
                  but Providence guided and directed my footsteps. I can see it all now clearly as I
                  can see the beams of yonder sun as he goes down in the west."
               "You have been very kind in assisting me in my troubles," I said.
               "All I have done has given me pleasure," he continued. "I feel as if some
                  mysterious power directed my steps to the place. I could not have passed by
                  without doing violence to my own feelings. I felt on my journey that your mother
                  was sick, that I had some duty to perform; but what that was I did not clearly see
                  until my arrival here. Oh, dear Ellen, there is a special as well as a general
                  Providence that directs, whether we know it or not. Now I have lived nearly forty
                  years, and have never seen a girl I could love until I saw you. But this I have
                  told you before. I now repeat it, because I believe I was directed here by an
                  unseen power. Why should I have come here just before your natural guardian died?
                  Is there not evidently some design in this special Providence? You have lost your
                  natural guardian; but Heaven ordained that you should find another. And am I not
                  that one? It seems to me I am. Oh, dear Ellen, I have deeply pondered on this
                  through the day. And how can I leave you? Shall I leave you alone on the banks of
                  this river to struggle against for tune and engage, single handed, in the battles
                  of life? Would that be my duty No, no, dear Ellen, that is not my duty neither is
                  it my intention. I must no leave you! I cannot go away and leave you here. I have
                  money, power, will everything to make you happy."
               I listened with the deepest interest, but knew not what his plan was in relation
                  to my future. I believed he was honest and sincere. How could I believe
                  otherwise.
               There was a short pause ere he spoke again.
               I could make no reply, for I knew no what to say. I was bewildered, and trembled
                  in every nerve.
               "How would you like a life in the city? he asked, tenderly pressing my hand and
                  looking fondly into my face. "I think you said you would like to see a large
                  city."
               "Yes; I often thought I should like to see such a place. Had mother lived we
                  should have gone to Boston and perhaps New York in the course of the year, for she
                  had promised to do so."
               A special Providence over us seems more and more plain every hour," he quickly
                  replied. Ah, it is the will of Heaven that I should fill the place made vacant by
                  the death of your mother! You must visit the city and make it your home and I will
                  be your guide and protector dearest. Probably the old nurse and some of your
                  neighbors will advise your to remain on the banks of the river made desolate by
                  the death of your mother; but heed them not. They may be honest and sincere; but
                  they are ignorant, and do not know what is best for you so well I do. I know your
                  aspirations. They are higher and more elevated than those of your neighbors. They
                  are contented to remain in humble life and plod through the world; but you, dear
                  Ellen, have higher notions, more noble aspirations; and it is right they should be
                  gratified. Perhaps the old nurse thinks you had best wed some clodhopper here and
                  link your fortunes with him. Oh, Ellen, that is not the life for you. Oh, it would
                  be mere drudgery, and not real life. No, no; you were made to move in a higher and
                  nobler sphere, in more fashionable circles. Now every one for the place designed
                  for him or her. You were designed for high life; and I feel as if I were the
                  instrument in the hands of a good Providence of placing you in a proper position.
                  Let gossips talk; let the ignorant form and express their opinions; let old nurses
                  gabble, but after all, dearest, a city life is the life for you!"
               He saw the old nurse approaching, and ceased his conversation and released my hand
                  from his; for well he knew how she would look upon such demonstrations. Her
                  character he understood perfectly, and governed himself accordingly.
               "Why, Ellen, I did not know where you had strayed to, you have been gone so long,"
                  she said. "But you have agreeable company."
               "See!" said the Colonel, holding up to her view the trout; "I have had rare sport
                  to-day."
               "Yes," she replied, adjusting her spectacles and looking him full in the face.
                  "You are quite an angler—not only for fish but for young girls. Your hook is
                  always baited; you fish in all kinds of water, both city and country. Have you a
                  net, too, so that you can catch those fish that will not bite at a hook?"
               "No, madam, I never angle with a net," he replied, smiling, and returning her
                  gaze. "That is vulgar fishing, such as I do not practice. I never net or spear
                  fish, my good woman; and as for the young ladies you speak of, I have let them
                  alone for many years, for I am still a bachelor."
               "A bachelor!" she repeated; "what of that? You have loved so many that you could
                  not love any one long enough to marry her. I have seen such men in my day."
               "In your younger days, probably," he said.
               "Yes, and in my older ones, too," she quickly replied. "They could never make a
                  fool of me. My eyes were always open as they are now. I have not much opinion of
                  men who do not earn their own living by honest industry. Work will keep men
                  honest; but an idle brain is the devil's workshop. Full grown men ought to be more
                  usefully engaged than in hunting and fishing merely for sport. Let them engage in
                  some work that will benefit themselves and their race."
               "You are rather hard on the anglers," he said. "Angling is a pleasant recreation,
                  and I can see no harm in it."
               "Perhaps you can't," she replied. "None are so blind as those who will not see. If
                  I may be so bold, when do you expect to leave this section of the country? You
                  have made not only a visit, but quite a visitation, if I may so exhibit it."
               I was astonished at her asking such a bold, abrupt question, and wondered what
                  answer he could make to it. I noted the expression of his face, but did discover
                  that he was in the least disturbed. He smiled, and looked at the old nurse very
                  unpleasantly.
               Some time elapsed before he replied. At last holding up his string of trout and
                  shaking them, he said: "So long as such as there can be caught in this region I
                  shall remain. I hope my presence do not trouble your nerves, does it? It has
                  always been my wish to please the ladies rather than trouble them."
               "No doubt of that, sir," she quickly responded. "I think I have seen artificial
                  flies of very brilliant colors which you place on your hooks as a sort of
                  temptation. You first please and then destroy."
               The last sentence she uttered in a very emphatic manner, as if she really believed
                  what she said. And the more forcibly to give emphasis to her expression, she took
                  an extra large pinch of her snuff and threw her glasses back upon her head. Before
                  he had time to conjure up a reply, she
                  turned on her heel and left us. He smiled as his eyes followed her down to the
                  house.
               "The old lady is an original genius," he said, "and I like her for her outspoken
                  honesty. She would make a fine character for a novel, if it could be faithfully
                  drawn. Has she always lived in the valley of this river?"
               "She has; and in sickness her services are highly prized by everybody who knows
                  her,"
               "No doubt she is a good nurse," he said; "she would command high wages in New
                  York; but she will probably never leave this region. Perhaps it is as well, for
                  she is getting to be quite old, and her days are almost numbered. A great pity it
                  is that she has not more charity for city people; but then her prejudices are all
                  natural enough. There is always more or less prejudice in the country against the
                  city; but give me the city life, and an occasional excursion into the country, and
                  I am satisfied. How you would enjoy the city! You would see so much to interest
                  and amuse you!"
               Thus he held forth the charms of city life. And his remarks made a strong
                  impression upon my mind.
               As the kind reader has already learned, my mind was well prepared to receive such
                  impressions; for my heart's desire was to live in the city, where I could enjoy
                  those scenes which he so cunningly painted and held up to my fancy.
               I will not undertake to describe the terrible struggle I passed through before I
                  made up my mind to accompany him to New York; for I came to that determination,
                  against the advice and remonstrance of all my friends and acquaintances. But he
                  had far more power over me than all others.
               The last words I ever heard the honest old nurse speak were the same she uttered
                  to him with so much emphasis—"He pleases, and then destroys!"
               These words are still ringing in my ears. They can never be forgotten; and the
                  image of that honest old nurse is still before me. I can now see how she looked,
                  how earnest her manner was, and how full of warning was her voice at the moment
                  she uttered those words to him at the grave of my mother. But there was still
                  another and a more insidious power at work on my heart.
               In spite of all opposition from every quarter, from old men and women; from my
                  young friends and acquaintances of both sexes; from the parson who officiated at
                  my mother's funeral; and last, but not least, from the old nurse herself, I left
                  the banks of the Androscoggin and accompanied Colonel Beaufort to the city of New
                  York.
               And now the scene changes from a quiet, peaceful, innocent country life to the
                  noise, confusion and turmoil of the city. The change was a great one for me and 
                     produed
                     produced
                   great effects upon me.
               Amid the excitement of such a life I began to forget the past and its events. A
                  new life seemed to have been given to me.
               My lover—for so I must now call him—treated me with the utmost kindness and the
                  greatest liberality. I had a suit of rooms in a boarding house kept by a woman in
                  Bleecker street, whose name was Mrs. Totford. She called herself a widow lady, who
                  had seen better times, but, having lost husband and property, she was compelled to
                  keep a boarding house for a living.
               Her appearance was quite prepossessing, being a large, stately person, whose
                  manners were quite 
                     facinating
                     fascinating
                  , and her conversational powers much better than usual. Evidently she had
                  seen much of world, and was well versed in city life.
               She received me very politely and treated me kindly. I was pleased with her, and
                  she appeared to be pleased with me. She spoke in the highest praise of Colonel
                  Beaufort. Her curiosity was that of a woman, and she soon learned from my lips the
                  history of my life.
               My history appeared to deeply interest her; and she was particularly eloquent when
                  speaking of my good fortune in finding such a man as Colonel Beaufort. "How
                  extremely fortunate you are in making the acquaintance of the Colonel," she said,
                  the day of my arrival at her house. "He is a splendid man, and rich, too. There is
                  not a girl in the city but what would jump at the chance of wedding such a man as
                  he is. I know several daughters of millionaires who have been setting their caps
                  for him; but somehow he never saw a girl he fancied until he happened to meet you
                  down east. It is singular indeed; but such is human life. You spoke of your father
                  who died before your mother. I think he must have been a very handsome man."
               "He was my stepfather," I replied, wishing she would not press the inquiry
                  further.
               "Oh, then your mother was a widow," she said; "I know how to sympathize with
                  widows."
               I made no reply, but cast my eyes upon the carpet, and was troubled.
               She at once saw how it was, and came to my relief.
               "Your silence speaks louder than any words," she said; "I understand; be not
                  troubled; no one has control over her birth; I was an illegitimate daughter, and
                  never knew who my father was; but no blame attaches to me for that; neither does
                  any attach to you."
               Her remarks quieted my troubled spirit, and looked up and smiled. She also smiled;
                  and that interchange of smiles made me quite at home. Her knowledge of the human
                  heart taught her exactly how to pull the strings; she read me as she would a
                  book.
               "Did you ever see your own father?" she asked.
               "I never did; but I have his name engraved upon a watch which he gave my mother,"
                  I replied; "I hope I may find him at some future day."
               "Such fathers are not easily found," she said, smiling, and looking at her gold
                  watch to see what the hour was. "Let me see your watch."
               "I showed it to her, and she much admired it, for it was a costly one; opening it
                  she read the name.
               "Charles Moreton!" she exclaimed; "there are Moretons in this city, but I presume
                  your father is not one of them. Such fathers as yours and mine often change their
                  names, especially when they change their place of residence."
               Thus she continued to talk, and did all in her power to please me; and well did
                  she succeed in her efforts.
               I was pleased with her; and how could I be otherwise under the peculiar
                  circumstances that surrounded me? I had the prospect of possessing everything the
                  heart could wish; a rich, loving husband; money in abundance; fashionable life;
                  great excitement; sights and sounds of all descriptions—the very things I longed
                  for in my girlhood!
            
            
               CHAPTER XI.
               Marriage Prospects. A Broadway Promenade. A Representative
                  Character. A Dream, &c.
               After leaving me at Mrs. Tetford's boarding house, Colonel Beaufort said he had
                  some business to attend to, and would see me again in the evening.
               We arrived in the city about noon, after a long and tedious journey of several
                  days, for the facilities for travelling then were not so great as they now
                  are.
               During the journey he was exceedingly attentive, kind and affectionate, sometimes
                  making advances which I was compelled to resist; for I had not yet forgotten
                  maternal advice and admonition.
               Mother's voice still rang in my ears; but I confess the sounds grew fainter as
                  days passed away.
               When resisted he always apologised, and said I must pardon something to the great
                  love he had for me.
               How easy it is for a young, sensitive,
                  ambitious girl to accept an apology based upon such a declaration!
               I believed him; but still kept possession of that precious jewel which my sex
                  prize so highly, and so justly too.
               For all this I will not claim more credit than properly belongs to me. No; mother
                  was better qualified to advise and counsel a daughter on such subjects than mine;
                  and none did the work more faithfully. Having herself been led astray from the
                  paths of virtue by the arts of a shrewd and handsome man, she knew how to caution
                  and warn others to avoid the downward road to ruin and degradation.
               Hours, long hours, passed, before the Colonel came. I say long hours, for they
                  were so to me! He had not been absent from me so long for some days; and strange
                  as it may seem to a less sensitive person than I was, my heart clung to him, as
                  the ivy clings to the oak. I felt a kind of new life, and fairly entered that
                  fairy world of which I had so often dreamed in earlier years!
               Now that my mother was in her grave, he seemed to me to be the only near and dear
                  friend I had in the world! And it is not strange or marvellous that I should have
                  such impressions.
               At last evening came, and so did he. He immediately came to my room, and greeted
                  me with a kiss. I suffered him thus to greet me, for I was rejoiced to see
                  him.
               "Well, dear Ellen," he said, sitting down beside me, and gazing fondly into my
                  face; "how do you like your boarding house?"
               "Very much indeed," I replied. "The lady of the house appears to be a very kind
                  hearted woman, and anticipates all my wants!"
               "She is indeed a charming woman!" he said. "You will enjoy her society much; for
                  you will find she improves on acquaintance. I hope she gave you something good to
                  eat; she likes good living herself!"
               "I have been well provided for. She gave me some wine, which was very fine.
                  However I am not a judge of such things, not having been in the habit of indulging
                  in such luxuries."
               "We have all the luxuries in our city," he said. "You have scarcely begun to see
                  the city yet. Oh, dear Ellen, there is nothing to prevent our being the happiest
                  couple in New York!"
               "I hope we shall be," I replied, gently removing his head from my shoulder, and
                  thereby admonishing him not to be too familiar; for mother's lessons were still
                  fresh in my memory.
               He was evidently disappointed at my movement, and began to express his warm and
                  ardent affection for me. Most earnest was he in thus expressing his emotions. He
                  spoke of our marriage, and longed for that happy day to come which should make us
                  one. But he said he could not be ready for several weeks, at the same time
                  intimating that we were already married in our hearts, and that was a sufficient
                  warranty for our living together as man and wife!
               He argued the question with all the skill and ingenuity he possessed, and that was
                  no small share. But his arguments could not satisfy me, or destroy the effect of
                  the counsel and advice I had received from my mother. He remained with me until
                  near midnight, and then took his departure.
               The next morning Mrs. Tetford cunningly introduced the subject of our contemplated
                  marriage, and made use of the same arguments the Colonel had the evening
                  before.
               This somewhat astonished me; that she, being a woman and once married, should thus
                  reason and attempt to persuade me that he was actuated by the purest motives.
               I hoped and even believed his motives were not corrupt; for I was weak enough to
                  attribute all his reasoning upon the subject to the great love he bore me. But
                  mother's influence was still upon me, and the admonitions of the old nurse were
                  not forgotten.
               The ordeal I had to pass through was a terrible one; but, nevertheless, I had the
                  moral courage to go through it.
               And here let me put on record the fact that daughters cannot prize too highly nor
                  heed too closely the counsel and admonition of good mothers. My prayer to Heaven
                  is, that young girls may never cease to hear the warning voice of mothers and lay
                  it to heart.
               The next day I left my room and went down into the parlor. At that time no one was
                  present but Madam Tetford. She was exceedingly polite and very talkative. Her
                  conversational powers was far above mediocrity, and she understood well the
                  science of human nature. She could read human hearts as some would a book; for she
                  had made them a study for many years.
               I had not been long in the parlor before a young gentleman entered who was very
                  fashionably dressed, sported a small cane and a very beautiful mustache. He was
                  introduced to me by Madame Tetford as Augustus Fairchild. He was a handsome young
                  man, but somewhat aristocratic in his bearing. His eyes were occasionally fastened
                  upon me in such a peculiar, fixed gaze as made me a little nervous. He was
                  talkative, but very precise in his language, and somewhat stiff in his
                  manners.
               As conversation passed between us he appeared to be much interested in me. I
                  fancied, or rather flattered myself that he was smitten with my charms. I did not
                  mean to be vain, and did not think I was; but somehow I could not help believing
                  he was greatly pleased with my beauty. After remaining awhile he left, and Madame
                  Tetford told me he moved in the first circles, and had recently come into
                  possession of a large fortune by the death of his father, who was considered among
                  the most wealthy man of the city. I could not help comparing him with Colonel
                  Beaufort, and that comparison made me wish the Colonel was as young as he was.
                  This interview had that effect, and no more; for I thought I loved the Colonel,
                  old as I was. I seemed to have a double affection for him—that of a daughter and
                  that of a lover. So that he held me bound to him by two ties which I then imagined
                  could not be easily broken.
               I well remember that the keeper of this boarding house was careful not to leave me
                  alone with the fashionable young man. She had a motive for that; but I did not
                  then understand it quite so well as I do now
               I noticed that there were a great many visitors to this boarding house; but
                  whether they were regular boarders or not I did not know. I did not sit at the
                  table with others, but my meals were brought to my room. I thought I was highly
                  honored, and yet I felt as if I should like to sit at the public table and see who
                  the boarders were. I knew there were some of my sex in the house, for I could
                  occasionally hear them talk and laugh.
               The Colonel was attentive to me, and appeared to be much in love. He was eloquent
                  and earnest in his appeals and strong in his promises of marriage, to all of which
                  I listened with deep and earnest attention.
               But all his eloquent and fervent appeals; his solemn promises of marriage; his
                  declarations of love and his constant importunities could not drown the voice of
                  my lamented mother, which still echoed in the chambers of my soul.
               Several days passed, and occasionally I left my room and took a seat in the
                  parlor; but Madame Tetford was sure to be there.
               So far as I could learn, I think Augustus Fairchild was at the house every day and
                  evening. And again I saw him in the parlor; and I had no doubt that he felt some strange emotions when he gazed upon
                  me!
               Thus I passed the time.
               Once in the course of the first week of my residence in the boarding house I rode
                  out with the Colonel, and once we promenaded together in Broadway. It seemed to me
                  that all eyes were turned upon me in one fixed look!
               And such crowds—such tides of humanity I never expected to see or even dreamed of
                  before I came to the city! I was much excited, and gazed upon the throngs of
                  living humanity until my eyes ached.
               "This is the city in which we shall pass our lives, I hope and trust," he said, as
                  we promenaded Broadway, arm in arm, and mingled in the crowds.
               "It is a wonderful place," I replied; I did not dream that it was half as
                  large!"
               "I think it is a little larger than any place on the Androscoggin!" he added,
                  smiling, and pressing my arm against his side.
               After walking and talking some hour or two we returned to my boarding house, and,
                  for the first time, he took tea-with me. We sat opposite each other at the table.
                  He was very polite and full of smiles.
               "There, dear Ellen, it is of no use to think of putting off our marriage much
                  longer," he said; "our thus sitting at the table reminds me of the good time
                  coming!"
               I made no reply to his remarks, for the good reason I did not know what to say. I
                  was ready to become his wife at any time he might choose to appoint; and the truth
                  is, I cared not how soon the day came which would unite us in the bonds of
                  wedlock!
               "Yes, my dear Ellen," he continued; "I shall make all possible haste to become
                  your lawful, loving husband. Oh, how I long for the bridal day, when two mortals
                  will be made happy!"
               "It is for you to fix upon the time," I remarked, casting my eyes upon the floor
                  and thinking of the Androscoggin.
               "I wonder what the old nurse would say if she could see how comfortably you are
                  situated! Everything is nice here and convenient!"
               "The house is beautifully furnished," I added. "How many boarders has Mrs.
                  Tetford?"
               "Indeed I do not know," he replied; "I do not wish you to mingle in their society,
                  for I consider you quite above them, and hence you have your meals brought to your
                  room!"
               "I conclude there are some female boarders here!" I said.
               "Oh, yes, I presume so," he answered, rising up and taking his hat, as if he were
                  about to go. "Now, dear Ellen, I must bid you a good evening; but one kiss before
                  I go, that I may have something to dream about!"
               The kiss he took, and then departed; but not, however, before he once more spoke
                  of our marriage, saying that it might happen sooner than I was really aware
                  of!"
               Soon after he left Madame Tetford entered my room, full of smiles, and
                  congratulated me upon the prospect of my marriage.
               "The Colonel told me just now that he was determined to marry soon," she said; "I
                  do not wonder he is in a hurry; what a fortunate girl you are!"
               "I do not know but I am mistaken, but I thought I heard a female voice in an
                  adjoining room utter an oath a few evenings ago," I said, not seeming to notice
                  her remarks, and looking her full in the face; "I hope I am mistaken, for it
                  strikes me it is a terrible thing for a girl to swear; I never heard one before in
                  my life."
               "I think you must be mistaken," she quickly said; "at any rate, I have never heard
                  one of my female boarders utter an oath. There are two who have recently engaged
                  board here; I am not personally acquainted with them; but they appear respectable;
                  I will watch their ways, for I am determined to keep my place respectable. In a
                  large city like this we are sometimes taken in, however cautious and prudent we
                  may be."
               "I suppose there is much wickedness in this city," I added. "Mother always told me
                  that great cities were very wicked."
               "Among so many we must expect to find some wicked," she answered.
               She remained in my room some time, and was very social and agreeable. Well did she
                  know how to adapt herself to any kind of society. She was a fair representative of
                  a certain class of women who infest all our large cities, and whose influence is
                  evil, and that continually. I know them much better than I wish I did. So far as
                  moral qualities are concerned, they have not one single redeeming trait in their
                  characters, and furnish strong evidence of the doctrine of total depravity—a
                  question which somewhat divides the Christian world.
               This widow Tetford, as she called herself, was as smooth as oil, and her
                  intellectual powers were more than usually falls to the lot of women in this
                  world; but her heart was corrupt and a sink of iniquity; and yet she could appear
                  not only moral, but even religious, if occasion called for such a
                  demonstration.
               As this city has increased, these characters have greatly multiplied; and some of
                  them own houses in fashionable streets, which were purchased by money coined out
                  of the broken hearts of their own sex.
               But I will not dwell in generalities, but pursue my narrative; for I find the
                  limits I have assigned myself will not admit of too many episodes, however useful
                  and interesting they might be to the young reader.
               After Madam Tetford bid me good night, I retired, and sought for that rest which I
                  so much needed. I had been much excited through the day and evening, and my nerves
                  needed rest and quiet.
               To a young girl marriage is a very exciting subject, especially as the bridal day
                  draws near.
               From what Colonel Beaufort had told me, I had every reason to believe but a short
                  time would elapse ere we should be married, consequently my thoughts were busy and
                  my imagination was upon the stretch.
               Hours passed ere I could compose myself to sleep, and when I did so it was only to
                  dream upon the subject. I dreamed we were married in church in presence of a large
                  congregation, where there was the most enchanting music I ever heard. My bridal
                  dress was most splendid, and my beauty far outshone the beauty of the many ladies
                  who were present on the occasion. But my dream took a strange turn. In the midst
                  of the ceremony, and just as the priest was about to pronounce us man and wife, my
                  mother seemed to rise up through the floor, and stood before the priest, dressed
                  in pure white robes, her arm outstretched, and her eyes fastened on him.
               Addressing the priest in a deep-toned voice, she said: "Thy tongue must not
                  pronounce this couple man and wife! The bridegroom is not worthy of such a wife!
                  It is a base passion, and not pure love that brings him to this altar!"
               Saying this she vanished, and I awoke, trembling and agitated. Big drops of sweat
                  stood upon my forehead, and a long time elapsed ere I could convince myself it was
                  all a dream. That vision I can never forget.
            
            
               CHAPTER XII.
               City Life in all its Phases.
               The next day after her interview with Colonel Beaufort, Ellen was sitting at her
                  chamber window and saw a woman taken from a carriage and carefully led into a
                  house upon the opposite side of the street.
               Her sympathies were excited; for she believed the woman was very sick. A little
                  girl, also, alighted from the carriage
                  and assisted the woman. Ellen thought the little girl was extremely beautiful; and
                  it seemed to her that she had seen her before. And she gazed upon her with much
                  interest, and finally she was sure she was the same girl she had met before.
               Ellen was so much interested in the girl that she went down and called Madame
                  Tetford's attention to her. They stood and looked at the little girl as she came
                  out after some things in the carriage.
               "She is a beautiful girl," said Ellen. "What bright shining curls hang over her
                  neck and shoulders!"
               "She is handsome," replied Madame Tetford, thinking what a prize she would be some
                  five or six years hence, and wishing she could get her. "When she is sixteen she
                  will make sad havoc among the gentlemen's hearts, as you have on the good
                  Colonel's. I wonder who she can be? We must endeavor to find out. Her parents are
                  poor I should think, or they would not move into that house. I should like to have
                  the girl live with me," said Madame Tetford; "but she may not appear so beautiful
                  on a close examination as she does in the distance."
               "She does, you may depend upon that," replied Ellen.
               "Her form is graceful, and her motions quick and easy," said the woman.
               "See! a fine looking lady is just entering the house, accompanied by a younger
                  one," said Ellen. "I wonder who she can be? It is possible they may be
                  relatives."
               "It is possible, but not very probable," added the woman. "Those ladies move in
                  the highest circles, or I'm much mistaken."
               Soon after Mrs. Grace and Sarah entered the house, a carman drove up and carried a
                  new bed and some articles of furniture which the good woman had purchased that day
                  for her.
               "How do you feel after your ride?" she asked.
               "Oh, madame, even better than I did when I started," replied the sick woman. "You
                  have indeed hired us some good rooms. It is really refreshing to me to breathe
                  above ground once more. I feel as if I shall soon regain my health."
               "Yes, wife, we will renew our life and be happy yet," said the husband; "and I am
                  determined to find something to do. I am willing to work now, and atone for some
                  of my past errors. What a terrible life I have lived; but I did not see it a few
                  days ago so clearly as I do now. This good woman has been the means of saving me
                  from a drunkard's grave!"
               "And me from an untimely one," said the sick wife.
               "And me from begging pennies to buy rum with," said the little girl, while a
                  pleasant smile played over her animated face, and her young heart beat with joyful
                  emotions.
               "And you might have added, she has saved you from chastisement at the hands of a
                  drunken father!" continued the man. "That seems to me to be the greatest of all.
                  We shall never forget what this good lady has done for us."
               "No, indeed," said the little girl; "I shall forget to breathe first."
               "Ah, good people, you must not put your trust in the arm of flesh," said the kind
                  lady. "Give your thanks to God. I have done nothing but my duty. I hope this will
                  prove a good neighborhood, and think it will; but we hardly ever know our next
                  neighbors in this city."
               Mrs. Grace and her daughter remained awhile and assisted in arranging the
                  household affairs, and then took their leave.
               They had not been gone long before Madame Titford thought she would make a visit
                  to her new neighbors, and entered the house.
               "Pray excuse me for this intrusion," said Madame Titford. "When I saw you alight
                  from the carriage I concluded you must be sick."
               "I am so," replied the sick wife. "You need make no apology for thus visiting me,
                  for I am glad to see you; do you live near?"
               "Across the street, opposite," she said; "and if I can do anything for you my
                  services are at your command."
               "You are very kind," she said; I rejoice that I have removed among such kind
                  neighbors; I have been unwell for some weeks, but I hope I am getting better
                  now."
               "I am glad to hear it," said Madame Titford, turning her attention to the little
                  girl. "Is this girl your daughter?"
               "She is," replied the mother. "She is my only child; her name is Sarah."
               "A fine name and charming little girl," continued Madame Titford, gazing upon
                  Sarah, and wishing she was a few years older. "How old are you, my dear?"
               "Ten years old last September," replied Sarah; "and I suppose I am old enough to
                  be better."
               "I do not know about that," said this artful woman. "You look good enough. How
                  should you like to go and live with me?"
               "I couldn't think of leaving father and mother now; for we are just beginning to
                  be happy."
               Her visitor did not fully comprehend Sarah's meaning, and made no reply. The
                  mother noticed the fact, and explained.
               "Sarah thinks we have now a better house to live in than we have recently
                  occupied; and I think so too," added the mother, after a brief pause. Besides, my
                  health is better; and of course we shall be happier."
               "True," said this artful piece; "I now understand; I am glad you have made a
                  change for the better. What ladies were those who visited you a short time
                  since?"
               "A kind woman and her daughter; to the former I am indebted for this change. The
                  elderly lady is the wife of Colonel Somers, and the younger one is his daughter.
                  They have been extremely kind to me, and I am grateful for their kindness."
               Madame Titford was surprised on learning who the ladies were, the lady's husband
                  being a frequent visitor at her house; but she artfully concealed her
                  feelings.
               "They are strangers to me; but I rejoice you have found such very good friends,"
                  added this artless woman; "we all need friends in this world, and especially when
                  we are sick."
               "Indeed we do," replied the sick woman; "have you a husband?"
               "No, I have never been married," she answered; and I cannot regret it; I suppose I
                  might have been when I was some younger; but some how or other I have never seen
                  the gentleman of my choice; some call me particular, and perhaps I am."
               "By being so perhaps you have avoided a world of trouble," said the sick lady.
               This wily woman made a favorable impression upon the sick woman, who rejoiced that
                  she had fallen among such good neighbors.
               Madame Titford very affectionately took leave of the sick woman and returned to
                  her house.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               The Plot Thickens. More About City Life. Excitement. The
                  Arrest.
               The scenes which took place on this dark and stormy night were of the most
                  startling and exciting character; and as they have a bearing—an important one—upon
                  this true history, I must record it in this place.
               As I remarked, it was a dark and tempestuous night; a strong wind swept over the
                  city, and the rain descended in torrents. The city clocks had told the hour of
                  twelve, and two villains were closely scrutinising a rough drawing of the various
                  apartments in the house of Madame Titford, by the dim light of a lamp, in a
                  tenement situated in one of those streets leading out of Canal street, on the east
                  side. The room they occupied was very strongly bolted and barred, in the basement
                  of a large wooden building used as a kind of storehouse for lumber and some other
                  articles. No one resided in any part of it. This basement had been occupied as a
                  low groggery; heavy shutters enclosed closed the two front windows, and the door was
                  massive and strong. There was no furniture in the room except two chairs, a pine
                  table and an old settee."
               "You think this is a correct map of the premises, do you?" asked one of the
                  burglars, whose name was Wilson.
               "It is," replied Smith, the one appealed to, pointing to a small apartment on the
                  paper. "This is madame's sleeping apartment, and this side is a cupboard where she
                  keeps her plate. She was very polite in showing me the arrangement of her house;
                  it is well arranged."
               "She didn't show you her bedroom, did she?" asked Wilson, laughing.
               "Not exactly; but then she left the door of it open that I might look in as I
                  passed, if I pleased," replied Smith; "it is a fine room; but no matter, you will
                  not enter that of course."
               "No," replied Smith; "you'll find the door of the cupboard not hard to open, and
                  I'm quite sure the front door might be opened, but you had better enter the back
                  way; that will be the safest. You see how the rooms are situated there. You'll
                  pass through the kitchen into a hall which leads to the front door. Upon the left
                  hand side is the sitting room, and upon the other is the parlor; "you'll have no
                  occasion to enter the parlor; I think she deposits her watch on a stand on a
                  marble mantel piece over the grate."
               "I think I have a good idea of the place now," said Wilson; "it is a good night
                  for the operation, for the watchmen will be under some shelter to keep out of the
                  rain; but I hate to face this storm; we shall get wet to our skins."
               "No matter for that if we can make a good haul," replied Smith.
               It is now past one o'clock, and the two burglars started out into the storm, and
                  hurried on to the street in which the house was situated they were to operate
                  upon.
               "But this is a furious storm!" said Wilson; "I can feel the water now running down
                  my legs into my boots."
               "No matter, fire will dry us," replied Smith; "we have scarcely seen a single
                  watchmen since we started."
               "I am not disposed to find fault with them on that account," said Wilson; "I don't
                  blame them for keeping out of the way of this driving rain."
               They had now arrived in front of the house, and the storm did not abate in
                  violence, but rather increased. They stood a moment and looked up and down the
                  street.
               "Not a solitary soul to be seen," said Smith; "pass through that gate and you'll
                  find the back entrance; I'll supply the place of a watchman since there is no one
                  on this beat."
               "Look out and keep your revolver dry, for we may have an occasion to use it," said
                  Wilson, as he passed through a small gate and groped his way round.
               "Be quick as possible," said Smith, walking to and fro in front of the house and
                  looking up and down the street, while his accomplice was making his entrance into
                  the house.
               The burglar had a dark lantern in his pocket, and the necessary tools for his
                  work. He was an experienced hand in such rescally enterprizes, and bold in their
                  execution. Smith could pick a pocket better than his companion, but not so
                  skillful in burglarious operations.
               The burglar found no difficulty in making his entrance into the kitchen, where he
                  stood a few moments and listened. No sounds were heard except that occasioned by
                  the violence of the storm. He was fearful that the wind might awaken the sleepers,
                  and therefore stood and listened. The room was dark as a pocket, but he had a
                  remedy for that. He opened his lantern and a few feeble rays escaped and revealed
                  the situation of the room. He now cautiously proceeded and found his way into the
                  hall where he remained silent a short time, and again let out a few rays of light
                  that revealed the doors into the sitting room and parlor. Closing the lantern, he
                  entered the sitting
                     ELLEN AND_HER LOVER.
                  
                   room, and again stood and listened,
                  while the water dripped from his clothes fast upon the carpet. All was still, and
                  a few more rays of light showed him the cupboard. Softy he approached it, and
                  again listened. Now the ticking sounds of the watch fell on his ears. Following
                  the sounds, he soon secured the prize, and turned back, feeling after the keyhole
                  of the cupboard door, and thrusting in a lock-picker which did the job in a few
                  moments. He carefully opened his lantern, and there was the plate bright and
                  shining before his eyes and a small rosewood box highly finished. He now took a
                  portion of the silver were and carried it to the front door which he had no
                  trouble in opening upon the inside. Returning he again carried another parcel to
                  the door. Soon the shelves were cleared, and he looked round for some other
                  valuables, but found nothing which he thought best to take.
               Smith met him at the door, and securing their booty, they hurried on.
               The storm had abated, and the stars appeared in the west. Soon the rain ceased
                  altogether, and the wind calmed down to a gentle breeze.
               Now and then a watchmen might be seen coming from their places of shelter and
                  gazing on their beats. The plate was concealed under their overcoats.
               "I'm sorry the storm is over," remarked Smith, for the watchmen begin to creep out
                  from their hiding places.
               "Let us walk boldly along," said Wilson; "do not act shy, but proceed just as if
                  we were returning from a theatre or gambling saloon."
               "I understand," replied Wilson; "this stuff is heavy; if it is all silver, we
                  shall be well paid for getting wet."
               "I think it is solid silver," said Smith. "See! that watchmen seems to be eyeing
                  us sharply; "I wonder what the fellow wants!"
               The watchmen approached them as if he meant something. Smith's hand was upon his
                  revolver. They were passing at the moment by a lamp post, and the gas light
                  revealed a small portion of the plate that Smith was carrying.
               "Rather late to be out," said the watchman, looking sharply at them.
               "Suppose it is," replied Smith, noticing that some of the plate he was carrying
                  was exposed, and instantly covering it over.
               "Nothing in particular, but you will go with me, gentlemen," said the
                  watchman.
               "You go to the devil," said Smith, now drawing his revolver, and firing.
               The man fell upon the sidewalk, severely, but not mortally, wounded, and the
                  burglars hurried on.
               The sound of the pistol roused the other watchmen in the vicinity, who gathered
                  round the fallen man. They raised him up, and he pointed in the direction the
                  burglars fled, saying, in a low voice, "Two of them; they ran down that street;
                  follow them!"
               Two of the watchmen pursued, while the others took care of the wounded man.
               "Did you kill him?" asked Wilson, as they descended into the room from which they
                  started, and bolted the door.
               "That is more than I know," replied Smith; "I shouldn't wonder if the chap
                  received a mortal wound, for I took deliberate aim."
               "I was fearful that the sound of the revolver might rouse others, who would follow
                  us," said Wilson, depositing his load upon the old counter."
               Smith laid down his booty and struck a light.
               They opened the rosewood box and found several gold pieces and articles of
                  value.
               "I begin to feel cold in this damp cellar," said Smith.
               "So do I," said Wilson, drinking some brandy from a flask, and handing it to his
                  companion. "Let us secure our booty and go where we can find some fire."
               "Yes," said Smith. "We must leave the
                  city soon; I think we had better go to-morrow to Boston."
               They secured their booty, and came up into the street just before day dawned. The
                  storm had passed away, and the stars shone brightly. As they stepped upon the
                  sidewalk a watchman discovered them, but they did not notice him, as he stood with
                  his back leaning against a building. He did not follow them, but came and viewed
                  the place from which they issued; his suspicions were aroused, and he marked the
                  spot.
               In the morning the news of the burglary and of the wounded watchman increased his
                  suspicions, and he communicated them to one of the police.
               The place was constantly watched from early in the morning until nearly night, but
                  no persons appeared.
               The burglars had given up the idea of leaving the city that day, and did not
                  venture to visit this room, lest they should be discovered.
               There was much excitement in the city. One of the police thought it best to break
                  open the door and see what could be discovered; but his advice was overruled.
               Some time after dark the following evening, the watch discovered the burglars
                  unlock the door and descend, bearing a large trunk.
               The news soon spread, and a strong police force assembled on the sidewalk at the
                  entrance to this room.
               "Let us pack up as soon as possible and be off, for the city is an uproar,"
                  remarked Smith.
               "I suppose so. "What do you say to putting our gold money into the rosewood
                  box?"
               "It will be a good plan," replied Wilson; "it will be as safe there as in any
                  place; but we must put the box into the trunk."
               "Certainly; that mustn't be seen," replied Wilson; for the papers have given an
                  account of the articles stolen."
               "Hush!" whispered Smith; "I thought I heard footsteps at the door!"
               "There may be some boys there," said Wilson.
               A knocking was now heard on the door, which greatly alarmed them.
               "Be silent as death!" whispered Smith, listening with intense anxiety. "They are
                  not boys, I fear. See that your revolver is in order! We must not be taken alive
                  out of this place!"
               Their revolvers were looked to, and their hands ready for any emergency.
               The knocking continued louder and louder, and men's voices were heard.
               "They are upon us!" whispered Smith; "put the box under your arm; don't let us
                  lose that. The silver plate may go to the devil. We must fight our way out of this
                  place and escape."
               "Open the door!" said one upon the outside.
               No response was heard from within. The burglars stood silent, and prepared for the
                  worst. The blows upon the door now came heavier and faster.
               "They're determined to break into this place," whispered Smith; "and there seems
                  to be a score of them too; some of them must bite the dust before they can enter
                  here."
               "They will enter, and that shortly too," replied Wilson, clenching his revolver
                  with a nervous grasp.
               "I fear it!" exclaimed Smith; "be firm, and not fire at random!"
               Crash went a part of the door, and crack went one barrel of Smith's revolver. The
                  ball passed through the hole in the door, and the 
                     formest
                     foremost
                   man was slightly wounded.
               "Down with the door!" shouted several voices.
               A few more heavy blows and a free passage was made, and some dozen men rushed into
                  the room.
               There was a loud cracking of pistols, and two men fell, Smith received a blow upon
                  the head which levelled him, and three more fastened upon Wilson. After a severe
                  struggle, the death of one man and the wounding of four others, the burglars and
                  their booty were secured. Smith recovered from the blow he received upon his head,
                  and attempted to rise with his revolver in his hand; but he was pressed down by
                  superior force and bound.
               The burglars were conveyed to the Tombs and locked up, and the articles they had
                  stolen and a large amount of money were secured. It was a terrible struggle; but
                  the right triumphed.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIV.
               Man's Duplicity. A Mock Marriage. Strong Suspicions. The Rich Dandy.
                  A warning to Our Sex, &c.
               The night on which the Colonel had so vividly pictured our forthcoming marriage,
                  was a restless one; and when I arose to make my morning toilet my nerves were
                  greatly deranged, and I felt not much refreshed. Yet my spirits were buoyant and
                  my general health good; therefore the lack of sleep for one night could not much
                  weaken me or change my general appearance.
               Not long after I had eaten my breakfast Colonel Beaufort made his appearance. He
                  was unusually smiling, pleasant and affectionate. He greeted me with a kiss, and
                  said he had made arrangements for the celebration of our nuptials, and appointed
                  the time.
               "What time!" I anxiously inquired, feeling somewhat surprised at so early a visit
                  from him.
               "The coming evening at seven o'clock," he replied; "I cannot postpone the ceremony
                  any longer without doing violence to my own feelings."
               "So soon!" I said, gazing up into his smiling face and looking surprised.
               "Yes, dear Ellen; I have thought it is best to be married to-night, and have our
                  wedding garments made afterwards. You have a dress good enough for the occasion,
                  because I shall not attempt to make any display now; but we can dress up and have
                  a sort of second day wedding in the course of a week or two. Besides, dear Ellen,
                  it is a true saying that beauty unadorned is adorned the most. And I have a desire
                  that you may appear at our wedding very nearly as you did when I first saw you;
                  for that was the moment when my heart told me it had found its true mate. Yes,
                  Ellen, it was love at first sight!"
               Now all that appeared quite reasonable to me, and I readily assented to his
                  proposition. I was willing to be married in a common dress, provided I could have
                  a handsome wardrobe afterwards; and that he had promised.
               I do not deny that I was very fond of dress. Proud I was and desirous to make a
                  show in the world. Riches had their influence upon me, young as I was. And it is
                  possible that, if I had not thought Colonel Beaufort had an abundance of money, he
                  might not have had so much influence over me. From my first acquaintance with him
                  I imagined he was rolling in wealth, and would buy everything my heart desired!
                  Alas! how much the love of money has to do with marriage contracts! Girls are
                  bargained for, bought and sold like stocks at the brokers' boards. But matches
                  made on such a basis often destroy the happiness of both parties, and especially
                  when riches take wings and fly away. Then the foundation is gone, and the bottom
                  drops out.
               But I will pursue the thread of my narrative, and leave generalities to be
                  discussed hereafter.
               Evening came, and a carriage was driven up to the door of my boarding house. My
                  heart beat when I saw the Colonel step from the carriage and ring the door bell. I
                  was expecting him, and so was Madame Titford, for she was to accompany us to the
                  residence of the minister who was to officiate on the occasion.
               Soon we entered the carriage, and were
                  driven through several streets, the names of which I did not know. At length the
                  carriage stopped in front of a large brick house, and we alighted and entered, the
                  Colonel leading the way, and conducting me up the stone steps.
               We were ushered by a colored servant into a richly furnished
                  parlor. The room was well lighted, and the Colonel seated me upon a sofa. He took
                  a seat by my side, and Madame Titford sank into a large rocking chair.
               We did not wait long before a gentleman entered, assuming to be the priest who was
                  to officiate on the occasion. He was very polite.
               The Colonel and Madame Titford appeared to be acquainted with him. I was
                  introduced to him by the Colonel.
               "I suppose you know our business," said the Colonel, bowing and smiling.
               "I do, I conclude," replied the priest, looking me full in the face, and then
                  turning his eyes upon the Colonel. "I am happy, Colonel, to know that you have at
                  last found a lady whom you can love with your whole heart. In the course of your
                  pilgrimage through the world you have seen thousands of ladies of great beauty and
                  accomplishments, but never one who suited your fancy in every particular until you
                  providentially met this young lady in the eastern country. I wonder not at your
                  being smitten at last, and no doubt you and your bride will spend a happy life in
                  the holy bonds of wedlock. You will now please to rise up and join hands."
               We did so; and then the priest read a prayer from a book he held in his hand. He
                  read very well; and his voice was deep and musical. That my heart fluttered the
                  reader need not be told. It did beat violently against my sides so that I could
                  distinctly count its pulsations.
               The Colonel was calm and collected, and listened attentively to the prayers as the
                  priest read it. The words sank deer into my soul, and I wondered if mother's
                  spirit was allowed to witness the ceremony.
               From the same book the priest read over the form of words which made us man and
                  wife.
               The ceremony being over, wine was passed round by the colored servant whose ebony
                  face was full of smiles.
               All appeared to be very cheerful and full of talk but me. I felt sad, and yet I
                  was glad the nuptials had been celebrated, for I loved the Colonel and believed I
                  had a kind, pleasant, agreeable and rich husband. We did not remain long at this
                  house after the ceremony, but rode back my boarding house.
               Madame Titford congratulated me upon my good fortune as we rode along, and
                  appeared anxious to make me happy.
               Just as we were entering the house I notice Augustus Fairchild standing in the
                  hall conversing with a gaily dressed female who was full of talk and smiles. As
                  the Colonel and I passed the young man he advanced a step towards me, and placing
                  his mouth near my ear, whispered, "A false marriage. He has a wife, and daughters,
                  too, as old as you are."
               As this young fellow whispered in my ear I involuntarily halted, or rather
                  slackened my pace, while the Colonel seemed to hurry me along. It was a singular
                  demonstration on the part of the young man, and it made a deep impression on me at
                  that moment. The Colonel seemed somewhat 
                     agaited
                     agitated
                   although he made strong efforts to conceal his feelings, and I m sure I
                  endeavored to conceal mine. There was a kind of mystery about it that somewhat
                  troubled me. But it evidently troubled the Colonel more than it did me, for he
                  better knew what the young man might say than I did. He passed up the
                     stairs and entered our room, which to me then was a bridal
                  chamber.
               "What did that impudent dandy say to you?" he asked, after we were seated on a
                  sofa.
               I told him frankly what the young man did say. The announcement seemed for a
                  moment to disturb his nerves, and his countenance wore a peculiar expression.
                  Soon, however, he recovered his accustomed equilibrium, and said, "The young
                  scoundrel! I'll chastise him for such impudence. I think the fellow must be in
                  liquor. No doubt he is, or he would not venture to approach you and make such
                  false assertions."
               "It seemed very strange and mysterious to me," I replied.
               He questioned me very closely whether I had ever seen him before. I told him I had
                  been introduced to him in the parlor, but never had much conversation with him. We
                  had considerable talk upon the subject, and he seemed to be more deeply interested
                  in the matter than I thought he ought to be, although he made every effort to
                  conceal his emotions from me.
               Morning came, and my husband took breakfast with me. He was very cheerful, or
                  endeavored to appear so. He said many pleasant things at the table, promising to
                  remove to a more splendid mansion at some future day, where I should have servants
                  and be mistress of the household. His remarks were flattering, and I felt as if
                  there was a brilliant life before me. And yet it is true that the words of
                  Augustus Fairchild were vivid in my memory.
               Madame Titford exhibited her curiosity to know what the young man whispered in my
                  ear; for she, too, saw him advance and whisper something at the time we entered
                  the house on our return from the wedding.
               Soon after breakfast, the Colonel having left, she came into my room and appeared
                  to have something on her mind to communicate. I soon ascertained what it was.
               "I noticed last evening Augustus Fairchild had something to say to you," she said;
                  "he is a very clever fellow, but peculiar in his way; he has inherited a very
                  large property; I suppose he is one of the most wealthy young men in all the
                  city."
               "I think he must have been intoxicated," I said.
               "I suppose, like most of our young bloods, he drinks freely and spends his money
                  generously," she replied; "I do not think he was much intoxicated last evening
                  unless it was with your beauty. He is dead in love with you. I have never seen a
                  young man so completely intoxicated with beauty as he is. You might have had him
                  for a husband if Col. Beaufort had not been in the way. He is much younger than
                  the Colonel, and has much more money. And by the way, what did he whisper to you
                  last evening?"
               At first I hesitated to tell her; but finally I did communicate to her the very
                  words he uttered.
               She smiled, but did not appear to be surprised. And that circumstance somewhat
                  took me aback. There was evidently a mystery that I could not penetrate. And it is
                  not very marvellous that there should, young as I was and so little acquainted
                  with city life. An older and a more experienced person might, and probably would,
                  have drawn the curtain aside and seen what was concealed behind it; but that power
                  I did not possess at that time. If I had, my life would have been quite different
                  from what it has been, and these pages never would have been written.
               I had passed nearly a week of married life, but my husband did not spend but a
                  small portion of the time with me, either in the night or the day time; but he
                  always had some very plausible excuse for his absence. Important business
                  sometimes in the city and sometimes out generally furnished the basis for his
                  excuses.
               One afternoon I was sitting in the parlor alone, when Augustus Fairchild entered.
                  I thought it strange that he was allowed to be with me without the presence of the
                  mistress of the house; for she had previously been very watchful and careful to be
                  present herself when any gentleman was near.
               
               The young man appeared very well, and was far from being intoxicated. True, his
                  eyes were fastened upon me in a fixed gaze, and he appeared to be much interested
                  about something, but what I did not know.
               "Excuse me," he said, as he entered the room, bowing and smiling, "for asking
                  myself into your presence. Knowing you were here, I came purposely to see you. You
                  remember what I said to you a few evenings ago."
               "I do well remember it," I replied; "but I trust and believe you were much
                  mistaken in what you said. Surely it cannot be true. If it be I am forever
                  ruined."
               "Not forever ruined!" he quickly replied, stooping towards me and looking very
                  anxious. "Not forever ruined, I trust! I did whisper to you the words of truth.
                  The gentleman who pretends to be your husband is the husband of another woman!
                  Besides, he has two daughters nearly grown up!"
               "Is that possible?" I anxiously inquired, feeling some strange misgivings, and
                  gazing intently into his face.
               "True as the gospel!" he replied; "I know his wife and daughters; his name is not
                  Colonel Beaufort!"
               "And what is his name?" I quickly demanded.
               "James Turner," he replied. "He is the keeper of a saloon in Broadway, where
                  drinking and gambling are the principal business. He has made some money and is
                  quite fond of angling; but he is by no means what I call a rich man!"
               I made no reply, and my emotions were violent; for I partially believed him; and
                  yet I hoped he had uttered only falsehoods.
               "You seem agitated, and no wonder," continued Augustus Fairchild, after
                  promenading about the room for a few moments. "I can prove to you all I have said,
                  and show you the house in which he lives. The man who married you is not a priest
                  but an accomplished gambler, and therefore your marriage is not legal. He has
                  deceived you; and I can prove the truth of all I have said about him."
               "How can you prove it?" I anxiously inquired.
               "By the woman who keeps the house," he replied; "she knows him just as well as I
                  do; but perhaps she will not say as much. Go with me at any time and I will show
                  you his house and his family if you are disposed to see them. Discard him as a
                  false hearted man, and I will protect you. I have thousands where he has not
                  hundreds."
               I told him I could hear no more at that time, but might wish to see him again
                     at some future day.
               He left; and I hastened away to find Mrs. Tetford. I called her up into my room,
                  and then related to her all the young man had told me.
               She did not appear to be in the least surprised; and I wondered
                  at it. I asked her if all was true.
               Her answer was that she did not know but would make inquiries. She presumed young
                  Fairchild would not absolutely lie. "You must ask him who
                  pretends to be your husband," she said. "I have never had much acquaintance with
                  him; but the young man, I think, knows him. Perhaps the Colonel, as he calls
                  himself, will wish to take you to some other boarding house;
                  but I would not go until you find out more about him. And if he has thus
                     deceived you, young Fairchild will become your devoted friend as now
                  he is your most ardent admirer. Be sure, dear and not leave my
                  house, and I will try to assist you in your troubles."
               Troubles indeed! I began to feel the spirit of revenge; and was determined to
                  unravel the mystery if it were possible to be done.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               The Vile Procuress. Another Victim. How Such Things are Done.
               In a great city like New York it is no uncommon occurrence for
                  the daughters of drunken parents to be led astray by vile, heartless women. Such
                  dark deeds are often done in the city.
               Good, virtuous people lament that the drunkard's habitation is not unfrequently
                  the recruiting house of brothels. Even young girls, scarcely out of their teens,
                  are sometimes stolen away, and oftener, indeed, bargained for by vile women, and
                  early trained to a life of prostitution and vice.
               These poor girls are made unhappy at home by the intemperance and consequent
                  poverty and wretchedness of their parents; and these poor creatures are,
                  therefore, willing to make changes in their manner of life and leave their
                  parents.
               There are women, and men, too, in this wicked city who are continually upon the
                  lookout and searching for such victims. The handsomest ones are sought first; and
                  sometimes those are taken whose appearance and looks are not very prepossessing in
                  the hope that training, together with gay apparel, will fit them for the hellish
                  uses of which they are designed to be appropriated by their own sex.
               Clara Lawrence had been purchased—as I afterwards learned—by Madame Tetford for
                  this abominable business. She was very handsome. Her mother, too, had been very
                  beautiful; but, alas! that monster, drink, had long since erased all beauty from
                  her countenance.
               The form of Clara, at the time of her introduction to the reader, was voluptuous
                  and enticing in the extreme; her very movements graceful and easy; her features
                  finely chiselled; eyes very dark and brilliant; her hair, dark chestnut; her teeth
                  beautifully formed and of pearly whiteness; her hands and feet small, and her neck
                  and shoulders faultless.
               Such was the new victim!
               Madame Tetford, from the very first moment that she saw this lovely girl, was well
                  convinced that she would be a very valuable addition to her establishment, so well
                  was she versed in her unrighteous calling.
               Clara's hair naturally curled, and it 
                     fel
                     fell
                   adown her neck in rich clusters. These beautiful curls first attracted
                  the attention of this vile woman, and induced her to examine further the great
                  beauty and attractive charms of this poor young girl—another victim to man's
                  passion and woman's avarice!
               Clara had far more than an ordinary share of intellectual power and brightness,
                  and her spirits were naturally buoyant and cheerful.
               Poverty and the degrading and demoralizing habits of her parents—who were both
                  drunkards—had somewhat checked the flow of her animal spirits, and cast a dark
                  shadow over her otherwise happy and expressive countenance.
               In the estimation of many, however, this added to her beauty.
               Clara well knew the power intoxicating drinks exercised over her parents, and she
                  often wept in secret over their misfortune.
               Before her mother had become such an inebriate, she had always given Clara good
                  advice, and cautioned her against the many vices and temptations of city life.
               Clara's mother was naturally a good woman, and under more favorable circumstances
                  would have been highly esteemed and respected for her many virtues, her personal
                  charms and mental brightness; but the curse of intemperance had spread a mildew
                  over her soul and blunted her moral faculties.
               Like many a woman, she had been unfortunate in the choice of a husband; but she
                  was not to blame for that; for when he was a young man, and waited upon her in the
                  character of a lover, he promised fair to make a kind husband, a man of business
                  and a useful and influential member of society.
               They were both ambitious, and started in life with strong hopes of success in
                     the world; and their longings and
                  desires for wealth would have been gratified but for intoxicating drink.
               Some few years after their marriage, and when Clara was about seven years of age,
                  Mr. Lawrence met with a heavy loss of property, for which he had toiled and worked
                  hard for many years.
               This misfortune drove the unfortunate man to drink!
               The poor wife struggled with him for a long time, and endeavored to persuade him
                  to leave off the habit of drinking; but all her efforts proved unavailing and
                  useless.
               And now comes the most touching scene of all.
               The poor, heartbroken wife became discouraged, and commenced taking the
                  intoxicating draught herself.
               Previous to their misfortune they were respected and happy.
               Clara, their first born, was much beloved by her parents, until liquor had
                  destroyed parental affection.
               Clara was a lively girl until this heavy misfortune—intemperance—had blighted her
                  prospects and nearly ruined her parents.
               When Clara was thus bargained for and sold, she did not know what life it was
                  intended she should lead; if she had known, she would not have consented to leave
                  her parents, miserable and unhappy as she was at home.
               The principles which her mother in earlier life had instilled into her mind had
                  not been forgotten.
               Mrs. Lawrence was not fully aware of the whole truth in relation to the bargain
                  and sale of her daughter; yet she had suspicions that all was not right.
               Liquor had degraded her soul and very nearly destroyed her moral sensibilities;
                  still there were times when she seriously reflected upon the course she was
                  pursuing, and resolved on a reformation at some future day.
               But, alas! how feeble are human resolves when the night of despair has gathered
                  round and settled upon the soul! Dark clouds hung over her, and she could see no
                  bright star to lead her on. The future was dark and gloomy; and the present was
                  only tolerable when she was under the influence of artificial stimulants, and when
                  thought was completely and thoroughly silenced.
               Such was the condition of this unhappy mother when she consented to sell her
                  daughter to obtain the means by which she could procure the damning stuff to
                  plunge her deeper and deeper into the vortex of ruin, despair and eternal
                  infamy.
               The vile procuress who had obtained possession of Clara was a woman of great skill
                  and adroitness in her wicked calling as the reader has already discovered. She was
                  a fine looking woman, and her appearance was well calculated to deceive the
                  unwary.
               The house this woman occupied was her own, and richly furnished throughout—it was
                  purchased by the wages of sin and the blackest enormities.
               This vile woman looked upon all men as corrupt, and believed every woman had her
                  price.
               There was no wonder that she believed in the last mentioned doctrine when she
                  looked in upon her own corrupt soul; and no one can be surprised that she viewed
                  men through such a medium, when he reflects upon the character of those persons
                  with whom she associated, and who patronized and sustained her in her degrading
                  soul-ruining business.
               When she purchased Clara, she was rich, and able to ride in her own carriage and
                  keep her coachman. And those who were not acquainted with her supposed she
                  belonged to the aristocracy of the city; and that idea was not very far from the
                  truth, for she had the aristocratic and rich men for associates.
               She possessed more money even than some of her aristocratic customers. She did not
                  give parties and associate with the wives of her customers, but she very often had
                  the honor—if honor it could be called—of being in the company of their
                  husbands.
               As this mean specimen of womankind rode home to her abode of sin with poor Clara,
                  she was all attention, love and affection to the girl, and made many and minute
                  inquiries in relation to the history of her parents, and how many brothers and
                  sisters she had.
               All these questions Clara answered with readiness, and expressed much sorrow at
                  being compelled to leave her beloved parents.
               "I'm quite as sorry as you are, Clara, that your parents are so intemperate," said
                  this vile woman. "I think it will be the better way for you not to visit them for
                  sometime to come. To visit them would only add to your unhappiness and would do
                  them no good. In fact I think it might do them injury. I will occasionally inquire
                  after them, and perhaps see them, so that you must content yourself to stay with
                  me and not run about the city."
               "Oh, I shall not desire to run about the city," replied Clara. "I have done quite
                  as much of that as I wish to do. Oh, I have been a beggar girl for more than three
                  years!"
               This girl was silent for some minutes, and the procuress made no reply, for she
                  was at a loss what to say.
               "Oh, madame, I fear my sisters will suffer for food now I've left them," she said,
                  while the tears stood trembling in her dark eyes. "My father spends all he can get
                  for liquor."
               "I gave your father some money; and I will see your sisters shall not want for
                  something to eat; besides, I will try and provide places for them."
               "Father and mother will get intoxicated, and I shall not be there to take care of
                  them and my little sisters," said Clara. When father has money they always have
                  liquor, and then they drink until they are drunk. If you could provide places for
                  them I should feel more contented than I do now."
               "I will try to do so," said this vile and depraved creature.
               They soon reached the house which was to be Clara's future home.
               The rooms were lighted with gas, and several girls, dressed in showy fabrics, were
                  to be seen passing to and fro. They gazed upon Clara as she followed the mistress
                  through the hall to her private apartments.
               "By heavens!" exclaimed one of the girls, "Madame has picked up another poor girl
                  in the streets."
               "Yes; but she has a fine form and an expressive countenance," said another of the
                  group of females. "Madame will dress her up so that she will be ahead of any of
                  us!"
               "I wonder who she can be," said another girl; "it appears to me that I have seen
                  those curls of hair before."
               "Perhaps you may; for I dare say she belonged to the begging tribe and has been
                  often in the streets. "Did you not notice how she turned her black, piercing eyes
                  upon us!"
               "Yes; and if I'm not mistaken Madame has got a hard case this time."
               "I hope she has; but she is a handsome one."
               The door bell rang, and these vile creatures fled—some to a sitting room and
                  others to their chambers.
               The person who entered was well dressed, and seemed no stranger to the
                  establishment.
               Madame soon made her appearance, and greeted the gentleman with great
                  affability.
               After the usual compliments were gone through with, the mistress led the way to a
                  room adjoining that in which she had left Clara.
               "Any fresh arrivals?" inquired the new comer
               
               "Yes."
               "Oh, let me see her!"
               "Not so fast, sir!" said this vile woman.
               "Why not—why keep me in this torturing suspense?"
               "Keep cool, and I will tell you all about this new arrival," said this vile woman.
                  "She is the girl of whom I spoke to you about. She is a most beautiful creature as
                  I have seen for many a day."
               "Oh, then you have obtained her at last, and I suppose at a great cost of time and
                  money," he said, smiling.
               "I can't equal you," she said, laughing heartily.
               "Yes, you far excel me," he returned. "You have made more money in the last year
                  than I have. Your prices never change, except upwards. But enough of this. Let me
                  see the new comer, and judge of her wonderful beauty. Come, I am in a hurry!"
               "She's not in a state to be seen," said this vile woman; "she has not even shoes
                  upon her feet."
               "Indeed! Well, then, let me see the barefooted beauty before you rig her out and
                  paint her up; I must see her just as she is."
               "You can't; the girl would be frightened."
               "Nonsense!" said this man; "these girls are not so easily frightened; how old is
                  she?"
               "Fifteen!"
               Now this woman intended to show the girl on certain conditions.
               "A splendid age!" he said.
               "Yes, and she is a most lovely girl!" exclaimed this vile creature, smiling and
                  looking at him.
               "I must see her just as she is, and then I can judge for myself. Now where is
                  she?"
               "In an adjoining room."
               "Let me see her."
               "As you seem to be so anxious to see her and so afraid of being taken in, I will
                  introduce you to her on one express condition."
               "Name it."
               "That you make no advances towards her at this time. She must be trained before
                  you or any other man can see her She is a virtuous girl, and I'm not certain she
                  can be conquered."
               "I comply with your conditions," said this heartless man.
               She conducted him into the room, and was introduced to Clara.
               He was struck with her great personal beauty, and offered no insult to her that
                  evening.
               Clara behaved herself exceedingly well, and appeared modest and unassuming, as she
                  really was.
               He did not stay long, but took his departure, with the determination to effect the
                  ruin of this innocent and virtuous girl for the gratification of his own base
                  passions.
               But I must turn to other scenes connected with my eventful life; and trace, step
                  by step, my truthful narrative of my experience of city life—experience which may,
                  perhaps, tend to warn my own sex against the vices of city life.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVI.
               The Power of Love. New Scenes and Stirring Incidents.
               The Colonel did not visit me on the evening following the interview I had with
                  young Fairchild, and the night was almost a sleepless one.
               I began to think that he had already left me, and my chilled blood crept coldly
                  about my heart.
               Madame Tetford endeavored to keep my spirits up; but I would not be reconciled so
                  long as the Colonel was absent from me.
               Sometimes it appeared to me that young Fairchild had spoken the truth; and yet I
                  was reluctant to believe evil of him whom I still clung to.
               The following days were cloudy ones to me. Scarcely a ray of sunshine illumined ed
                  my path, and my prospects for the future were dark and dismal.
               The words the young man had uttered had fastened themselves upon my mind, and I
                  could not with all my determination shake them off.
               Time passed away slowly for me. Old recollections pressed upon my soul, and I
                  almost wished for my happy home on the Androscoggin.
               Darkness had fallen upon the city, and I sat gazing upon the crowds passing and
                  repassing, and listening to hear the ring of the door bell.
               My heart beat violently, and every moment I expected the Colonel would return.
               Occasionally tears would come unbidden into my eyes, and I would wipe them
                  away.
               A thousand conflicting thoughts rushed into my mind, and the night of despair
                  began to gather over my soul.
               What if he had abandoned me? Suppose he never visited me again, or if he did, it
                  was only to bid me a final adieu! These questions pressed upon my soul and
                  agitated my mind, and sorrow and sadness fell upon my heart.
               For some time I sat pondering on the past, and trying to penetrate the veil that
                  hung between me and the future.
               At length I heard footsteps upon the doorsteps, and the door bell rang. I ran down
                  stairs, opened the door, and was soon in the arms of the
                  Colonel.
               Oh, how many thoughts and emotions were crowded into that moment!
               "I feared you wouldn't come!" I faintly said.
               "And why, dear Ellen, do you indulge such fears?" he inquired,
                  as he pressed he to his heart.
               "I can hardly tell; but they crowd upon my mind and make me
                  feel unhappy," I replied.
               
               We now proceeded to my chamber and sat down side by side.
               My heart was pleased to be with him; but the words of young Fairchild were fresh
                  in my mind and made me sad and sorrowful. I hoped they were not true—nay, I
                  believed they were false, and uttered only to torment me; still I thought there
                  was a possibility of their being true, and that thought troubled me very much and
                  made me feel sad.
               "You have been well, I hope," he said, pressing me to his heart, and looking
                  fondly into my eyes.
               "Yes, I have been well; but what feelings have pressed my heart!" I said, in an
                  excited tone.
               "Dear Ellen, why do you make such an exclamation?" he asked. "It makes me feel
                  bad. Do be cheerful and happy, as I am when with you."
               "But how can I when such strange suspicions cross my mind?"
               "What suspicions?" he asked.
               "For heaven's sake, tell me, if your name is James Turner!"
               Suddenly he raised his head from my shoulder—his countenance changed, and for a
                  moment trembled; but he soon recovered himself, and smiling, said, quite
                  coolly,—
               "What in the world did you ask such a question for?"
               "I heard that was your real name," I replied.
               "James Turner my name!" he repeated. "Now that is the last thing I have
                  heard."
               "Is it not true, then?" I inquired, in a trembling voice.
               "Oh, no, dear Ellen. What could have put that into your head?" he asked, as he
                  pressed me to his bosom.
               But I gently disengaged myself from his loving embrace.
               He appeared surprised.
               "Ellen," he said, "what suspicions have you in regard to me?"
               I looked upon him and said:—
               "Have you not a wife and daughters?" I asked.
               Again he started. In spite of his self-control he seemed confounded.
               
               My suspicions were awakened, and I felt sick at heart.
               Never had I felt such a heavy burden upon my soul as at that moment.
               It seemed to me that all was lost, and that I must become a shame and a reproach
                  to my sex.
               Revenge seemed to take possession of my soul.
               He soon recovered from the embarrassment in which my inquiry had thrown him, and
                  he began to laugh most heartily, and to throw ridicule upon the whole affair.
               "Did ever any one hear such stuff?" he said. "My wife and daughters! Oh, what
                  nonsense!"
               Again he laughed most immoderately. "But who told you such a strange story, dear
                  Ellen?"
               Again he laughed heartily at the singular idea, as he called it.
               At length I told him young Fairchild was my author.
               "But where did you see him?" he inquired.
               "He came to this house a short time ago," I replied.
               "How did he know that you were here?"
               "I do not know," I replied.
               "Did he offer any insult to you, Ellen?" he asked.
               "None." But he said your name is James Turner; that you have a wife and daughter,
                  and that you are the greatest old libertine in the city."
               He seemed much agitated.
               At length, becoming somewhat composed, he said,—
               "If I had been here I should have choked the breath from his body; "if I should
                  meet him he shall smart for meddling in my affairs."
               "Oh, do not injure him; for then they will imprison you, and we should be
                  separated," I said.
               "That, dear Ellen, is the only reason why I should not kill him. But for you I
                  would now pursue him."
               And he imprinted a kiss upon my lips and pressed me fondly to his heart.
               And what conflicting thoughts and feelings pressed my heart at that moment—love,
                  hatred and revenge!
               "Then all that young Fairchild uttered were falsehoods?" I asked, beginning to
                  believe that he had uttered nothing but lies.
               "To be sure they were," he said, at the same time imprinting a warm kiss upon my
                  lips.
               I felt somewhat relieved.
               "Oh, he is a bad young man," said the Colonel.
               He tried to make me believe that what young Fairchild had uttered was false but
                  how far he succeeded in his endeavors the reader shall judge for himself.
               The Colonel now took his leave.
               I need not tell the fair reader the real state of my feelings on his departure.
                     I felt sad and oppressed in my feelings,
                     as of some impending 
                     misforturne
                     misfortune
                  .
               But I must hurry on with this history as I have much to unfold yet; and which my
                  sex, I trust, will profit by.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVII.
               Suspicions Multiply. Clouds Grow Darker. A Storm Approaches. The
                  Mock Marriage Proved.
               The reader will readily observe that I did not get much
                  satisfaction from the housekeeper. My suspicions began to
                     be more fully aroused that I had been sadly betrayed.
               Yet I was reluctant to believe that he who seemed to love me so
                  ardently and treat me so tenderly could be the heart less villain young Fairchild
                  represented him to be.
               Oh, how I needed a true friend of my own sex with whom I could advise under the
                  pressure of existing circumstances but I had none; and my battles I had to fight
                  alone.
               My husband ought to be my friend but if what the young man said about him be true,
                  he was the worst enemy I had in the world.
               Night again came, but my husband did not.
               I was greatly alarmed, fearing some accident had happened to him. Heavily passed
                  the hours while I was sitting up and waiting for him.
               About ten o'clock Madame Tetford came up to my room, for she knew the Colonel had
                  not come.
               She was very pleasant and unusually amiable. I was in tears, and for the first
                  time since I had become a resident of New York.
               "Why those tears?" she asked, apparently with much feeling and sympathy in her
                  manner.
               "He has not come!" was my reply.
               "Perhaps some important business has detained him," she said; "but never mind if
                  he does not come again at all. You will find in Augustus Fairchild a more devoted
                  friend and a more ardent lover, Ellen."
               "Never mind," I repeated, looking through my tears at her unmoved face. "Never
                  mind! What mean those words? They pierce my soul like iron! What clouds encompass
                  me! Speak and tell me, if you know aught that would harm me! I am young and alone
                  in the world! I have no mother to advise me! And surely you must have sympathy for
                  one of your own sex when she is in trouble and needs assistance!"
               "Indeed I have," she coolly replied. "If the Colonel proves a heartless man I will
                  assist you in obtaining a better one. As I have told you before, I have but a
                  small acquaintance with the Colonel; but I have supposed he was a rich and
                  honorable man. I may be mistaken; for New York is full of strange characters. But
                  I do know Augustus Fairchild; and a fine young man he is, too. I suppose his
                  father left him more than a half a million of dollars. You will see that I am
                  willing to befriend you."
               Such was the consolation I received from this woman. But I did not at that time
                  understand her character. She was a mystery to me.
               I passed a sleepless night, and during its silent watches I felt the rising of a
                  new power within me.
               I said that if Colonel Beaufort was a traitor and a villain I would be revenged in
                  some way.
               That spirit I had never felt before in its full force. No one could be farther
                  removed from such a fell spirit than I always had been. I scarcely knew that such
                  a passion ever troubled the human heart; but now I found it within me, and only
                  waiting for the occurrence of certain circumstances to develop it and give it full
                  play.
               Not long after breakfast my pretended husband came.
               He found me less cheerful than usual, and endeavored to cheer me up by kisses and
                  sweet words.
               He partially succeeded; and yet there was a heavy load upon my heart.
               "Still thinking of the stories you have heard about me!" said my pretended
                  husband.
               "Yes, they still worry and perplex my heart," I replied. "Do tell me if your real
                  name is James Turner!" I asked, in a tremulous voice.
               He started as if a sharp instrument had been thrust into him; but as suddenly he
                  recovered and smiled.
               "Still harping upon that string yet!" he said.
               "And you do not keep a drinking and gambling saloon on Broadway, do you?' I
                  repeated, before he had time to say any more.
               He now started worse than ever, and even his countenance changed
               Had I been older and more experienced I 
                     migt
                     might
                   have read him then like a book; but I was deficient in such knowledge,
                  and of course he had the advantage of me.
               
               Soon he assumed his wonted calmness, and said,—
               "So you have had an interview with that dandy, young Fairchild."
               "Why should you ask such a question?" I said, watching him narrowly.
               "Because I think he is just the fellow to tell such things to you," he replied.
                  "He is an enemy to me, and his father before him. Dear Ellen don't believe one
                  word he says, and never speak to him again, if you love me."
               I frankly acknowledged the young man had told me these things; but the Colonel
                  denied them all in the most earnest manner—so earnest that I was induced to
                  believe him. Yet I had doubts and misgivings.
               He informed me that he should soon remove me to a more splendid house, and warned
                  me not to leave my chamber, or see any man, young or old. He did not remain
                  long.
               Soon after he left the housekeeper came to my room, and seemed to be somewhat
                  excited, more so than I had ever seen her; for she is usually calm, collected,
                  pleasant and even amiable when she was disposed to be
               "It is as I feared!" she said, as she entered my room. "The Colonel, or James
                  Turner, or whatever his name is, has informed me that he will remove you to some
                  other boarding house to-morrow."
               "So soon!" I said, in much surprise.
               "Yes, to-morrow!" she replied. "But don't you stir one inch until you find out
                  what his real character is. I begin to believe Fairchild has told the truth about
                  him. He will be here to-day, and some plan must be devised by which we can find
                  out his true character."
               "I should be glad to," I responded, while tears started from my eyes and ran down
                  my cheeks.
               "I will do all in my power to assist you," she said. "Oh, the villain! If he is a
                  married man and has a family we will find out this very day!"
               She appeared much interested in my welfare, and my confidence in her increased;
                  while, in my pretended husband, it began to diminish.
               Her feelings towards the Colonel appeared to have very much changed; but as yet I
                  was ignorant of what caused that change.
               In the afternoon Augustus Fairchild visited the house, and devised some plan to
                  see me.
               The housekeeper advised me to have an interview with him, in spite of the command
                  of my pretended husband had given me in relation to the matter.
               She said the young man had something very important to communicate which might be
                  of much value to me.
               I consented; and the interview took place in the parlor. A portion of the time
                  Madame Tetford was present, and ready to give her advice.
               He reiterated all he had told me before, and was willing to take his oath that all
                  was true. And in addition he offered to procure a carriage and convey me to the
                  house in which my pretended husband lived.
               The housekeeper urged me to do so. I finally consented. It was an exciting time
                  for me, and my struggles were severe.
               During our drive to the house the young man was very attentive, and treated me in
                  a becoming manner, assuring me that my marriage was false and illegal, and
                  promising to protect me under any circumstances that might happen.
               He seemed to be much interested in me, and avowed his love in the strongest
                  terms.
               It was agreed that I should enter the house and see the family, if possible the
                  head of it, while he was to remain in the carriage.
               Oh, what emotions agitated my heart as I walked up to the door and rang the
                  bell!
               The summons was soon answered by a very well dressed and handsome girl, who was
                  very polite.
               "Does Mr. Turner reside here?" I inquired, feeling a power rising within me to
                  meet the occasion.
               "He does," she replied; "will you walk in?"
               "I thank you," I answered, walking in and taking a seat in a well furnished
                  parlor.
               "Father is not in now, but will be soon," she said, gazing upon me and wondering
                  what my business could be with him.
               "Then Mr. Turner is your father?" I said.
               "He is!" she replied, still keeping her eyes fastened upon me.
               At that moment I happened to turn my eyes upon two portraits that hung on the
                  wall. One of them was a perfect likeness of my pretended husband. I gazed upon it
                  for an instant and then cast down my eyes, and repressed my emotions with all the
                  power that was within me.
               I succeeded much better than I expected. An unseen power seemed to sustain me in
                  that trying moment.
               "You are not unwell, are you?" she inquired, noticing the effect the portrait had
                  upon me.
               "Oh, no," I replied. "Sometimes I have a slight palpitation of the heart; but it
                  is soon over. I suppose these portraits are taken for your parents?"
               "They were," she replied. "Have you ever seen my father?"
               "I have seen a man who very much resembles that portrait," I answered; "but he
                  calls himself Colonel Beaufort."
               At that moment the mother entered the room and gazed upon me most anxiously.
               She was a fine looking woman, but apparently in feeble health. A kind of gloom
                  overshadowed her face, and her nerves seemed to be weak and trembling.
               She did not speak when she first entered the room, but fastened her deep blue eyes
                  upon me in a fixed gaze.
               "Did you wish to see Mr. Turner?" asked the wife, in a voice that told that
                  something was gnawing at her heart.
               "I called to see a gentleman calling himself Colonel Beaufort," I replied.
               "Colonel Beaufort!" she repeated. "Colonel Beaufort! I know no such man. Does he
                  resemble that portrait?"
               "Most perfectly," I replied. "It appears to be very mysterious. Can it be that
                  your husband has introduced himself to me as Colonel Beaufort?"
               "Heaven only knows!" exclaimed the almost heartbroken wife. "When did you first
                  become acquainted with him?"
               "Down East," I replied, looking at her agitated countenance, and feeling pity for
                  her.
               "Down East!" she repeated, in broken accents. "Down East! Oh, my God!"
               Before she could say more, the outside door opened and the heartless husband
                  entered.
               His wife was sobbing aloud. He heard her, and quickly entered the parlor.
               I sat so far back that he did not at once discover me; but went to his wife and
                  inquired what the matter was.
               "See there!" she exclaimed, pointing her trembling finger towards me.
               He looked up and saw me. Such a sudden change as came over his face I never
                  witnessed before. And such an expression of countenance! I fixed my eyes upon him
                  in a burning gaze, while the mother and daughter trembled as if they would drop in
                  pieces, He endeavored to control his feelings; but for the moment that mastery
                  which he usually exercised over himself seemed to be gone, and he, too, trembled.
                  Soon, however, he recovered his power, and attempted to face the circumstances in
                  which my presence placed him, with a bold front. But the task was a more difficult
                  one than any he had ever been called upon
                  to perform. For a few moments there was silence in the room. That silence I broke
                  with a firm, clear, distinct voice ere he had time to speak and attempt an
                  explanation.
               "Heartless man!" I exclaimed, stepping forward and confronting him; for I felt
                  strong and determined. "Heartless man!" I repeated. "You have ruined me—destroyed
                  the peace of your own family and damned your own soul!"
               I know not how it was but I seemed nerved for the occasion. I never had such
                  feelings, and never uttered such words. It seemed that all at once a new power was
                  born in me. I no longer loved but hated him. I had a clear view of his depraved
                  heart, and the spirit of revenge took possession of my soul; and, therefore, I was
                  resolved that his family should know all. A moment's silence, and he attempted to
                  reply; but, before he could, I exclaimed, in a still louder voice, "Villain, speak
                  not! Keep silence, and hear me! Our marriage was a false one, and he who
                  officiated at the altar was a gambler!"
               "Marriage!" sobbed the weeping, trembling wife; "marriage! Are you married!"
               "Oh, heavens!" exclaimed the daughter, wringing her hands and hurrying out of the
                  room.
               "The mock ceremony was performed several days ago," I replied; "he perjured his
                  own soul. It was a false ceremony. And thus he obtained his object—my ruin!"
               The wife screamed and fell upon the floor, apparently dead. He was fearfully
                  alarmed, and knew not which way to turn. The younger daughter now entered the room
                  and shrieked, "Mother is dead!" The servant girl now came running into the room.
                  She was colored, and somewhat advanced in years. She bent over the fallen woman,
                  rubbing her temples and palms of her hands.
               "Bring de camfire bottle," said the servant; "missus no be dead yet, but only
                  faint; her nerves be weak; she hab a hard time ob it for a long time; de husband
                  gone too much ob nights for poor missus' good."
               That seemed to me to be very plain talk, coming as it did from a colored servant
                  in the master's own house. The husband seemed to be almost paralyzed, having lost,
                  for the time being, his self-control. I felt sorry for the wife and daughters, but
                  not for him. At last he spoke, just as his wife had come to.
               "I will clear all this up," he said; "there is some mistake here."
               "No mistake, sir," I added; "I have spoken only the words of truth; but take care,
                  sir, or you may yet suffer still more than you do now. I now know you. Would to
                  heaven I had known you before it was too late!"
               "Alas!" sobbed the wife, "that I should live to witness such a day as this!"
               "Nebber mind, missus," said the servant; "de men be bad in dis city, and de wives
                  don't all know it!"
               I now left the house; but before I did so I told him to beware of the spirit of
                  revenge that his conduct had awakened in my heart.
               Soon I was in the carriage and on my way to my boarding house. Young Fairchild was
                  impatient, having been so long boxed up in the carriage.
               When I related to him what had happened, he was greatly rejoiced, and promised to
                  take care of me and pay all expenses. In fact, he gave me a purse of gold, and
                  told me to purchase what I might fancy.
            
            
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               Further Developments. Intensely Exciting Scenes. Life in New 
                     Xork
                     York
                  .
               The reader of these pages may seem surprised that I had not yet learned the true
                  character of the place in which I resided. In fact, everything was conducted with
                  so much skill and cunning that I did not even suspect what the intelligent reader
                  is quite sure of—that Madame Tetford was a bad woman and kept a disreputable
                  house.
               Weeks passed away ere I was allowed to see anything that might awaken suspicions
                  in my breast. Persons, of both sexes, came and went; but I imagined that was the
                  way in all boarding houses. The reader will also perceive that I was quite
                  ignorant of many phases of life in a great city like New York. This is not to be
                  wondered at, coming, as I did, from the banks of the Androscoggin, where I had
                  been brought up in all the innocent enjoyments of country life.
               Madame Tetford was a woman of art and skill in her infamous calling; but her
                  passions were outrageous and terrible when aroused. Yet she always seemed pleasant
                  to me. Pleasant! Yes, as pleasant as such a being could be.
               But I must on with this history. One night I heard a great disturbance in my
                  boarding house. Loud voices and quarrelling in the dead hours of the night. I
                  arose from my bed and opened the door of my room so that I could hear what was
                  going on. Such awful swearing I never heard before; and from the lips of my own
                  sex! Loud above all the rest could be heard Madame Tetford's voice, uttering
                  terrible oaths, which made my blood curdle in my very veins, and made the blood
                  flow back from my heart—so appalled and horror-stricken was I at this new evidence
                  of city life. Oh, how very different this from my youthful experience! But I must
                  not allow myself to moralise; but hurry on with my experiences, sad and exciting
                  as they are.
               Thinking that I might be mistaken, I passed from my room to a
                  place where I could hear more distinctly. But I was not mistaken. It was Madame's
                  voice, angry and terrible above all the rest. I heard blows exchanged, as well as
                  terrible swearing. It made me very nervous, and I listened intently to learn if I
                  could hear my pretended husband's voice; but I heard it not. I thought he might be
                  in the house.
               But the reader cannot be told all that transpired on this eventful night, or be
                  made acquainted with all this vile woman said and done on this occasion.
               With a heart sick and faint, I retraced my steps, and locked myself in my room;
                  but sleep would not visit my eyes nor slumber my eyelids, my nerves were so
                  completely unstrung. Morning at length came, and I was glad to behold its light
                  once more.
               Young Fairchild soon came; but before he made his appearance, I saw Madame in the
                  hall with her face sadly bruised; I saw that she was a wounded woman.
               "There was a great disturbance last evening," I said; "there was a terrible noise
                  of fighting and swearing; did you not hear it, or was you not in the house?"
               "No, Ellen, I did not hear it, for I was not in the house last evening."
               "Do you know what the trouble was? I am greatly alarmed to remain in a place where
                  there is fighting and swearing."
               "You shall not stay here much longer, for I will remove you to a more splendid
                  boarding house. But the noise did not amount to much. Such things with occur in
                  city boarding houses. Madame Tetford learned that one of her female boarders was a
                  bad character, and had come home with her paramour, and she was determined to put
                  her out of the house; that was all."
               "Quite sufficient," I said; "but why was there so much swearing?"
               "Girls like them will swear terribly," he said.
               
               "But why did Madame Tetford swear so terribly?" I inquired, looking anxiously into
                  his face and watching the movement of every muscle; for my suspicions were aroused
                  that all was not right.
               "Ellen," he said, "I think you were mistaken; I never knew her to swear. As you
                  was aroused from sleep and frightened, you supposed you heard what you did not
                  hear; was it not so, Ellen?"
               "I am sure I was not mistaken; for I arose from my bed and passed out into the
                  entry, where I could hear distinctly, and they were quite near me; besides, I saw
                  Madame Tetford with her face bound up. There was a terrible fight last night; and
                  I do not feel safe here."
               "Ellen, you are 
                     needly
                     needlessly
                   alarmed," he said. "Madame is a good woman, and keeps a respectable
                  house. But she is coming, and will, no doubt, explain all to you."
               "I never had my poor 
                     neves
                     nerves
                   so shaken as they were last night," said this cunning woman. "One of my
                  boarders proves to be a bad girl, and came home with a man. You may imagine my
                  feelings. I never felt so in my life. I suspected her before; and last night was
                  determined to detect her if she was guilty. Sure enough I did find her out. I
                  discovered in her room a man! How excited I was. If anything in this world makes
                  me angry it is such an occurrence as took place last night. You must have heard
                  the noise. May Heaven forgive me for using such language. I never did before, and
                  it now seems like a dream. But I was so very excited. The girl struck me in the
                  eye, and hurt me very much. I was so excited I knew not what I said. It is
                  terrible this keeping a boarding house in the city where so many bad people apply.
                  It is next to impossible to keep clear of them. Oh, I blush for my sex. That girl
                  seemed as well as any young lady I ever boarded at first, and completely deceived
                  me; but such characters cannot deceive me long. I put her out of my house at
                  midnight, and she will never again enter it, I can assure you."
               Having ended her speech, this vile woman sank upon a sofa much affected, to all
                  appearances.
               "There, Ellen, you have the whole affair," said the young man. "You were not so
                  much mistaken after all as I supposed you were. I think I might have almost sworn
                  myself if I had been placed in the same position."
               I was somewhat quieted, and the affair passed off. Yet the scene, and the awful
                  language used I could not forget. I remained in the house; but was more observant,
                  and this woman was more cautious and cunning than ever.
               I remained in my room until the afternoon was far advanced, and saw no one. My
                  reflections were anything but pleasant. At length a carriage was driven up, and
                  Madame Tetford alighted and entered the house. She had been gone some hours
                  shopping. She immediately entered my room, carrying a small bundle.
               "There," she said, handing me the bundle; "open it and see how you like it."
               I opened the bundle, and found a handsome dress. I told her I liked it very
                  much.
               "I am glad to hear it," she said. "I did not know as I could suit you. I thought
                  some of asking you to accompany me; but you appeared so fatigued that I concluded
                  to make the purchase."
               I did not entirely comprehend what she meant; she noticed that I was taken by
                  surprise.
               "That dress is for you," she continued. "Young Fairchild gave me the money and
                  wished me to purchase it for you. This is barely a beginning of his generous and
                  noble gifts. Richer and more costly apparel than this you will wear. Oh, you are
                  indeed happy in having such a friend as young Fairchild."
               "This for me?" I 
                     inquirrd
                     inquired
                  , feeling much surprised.
               "Yes, for you," she said; "I shall have it made up for you immediately; the next
                  dresses will be more rich and costly I can assure you."
               "I am very sorry that he has ordered you to do this," I said.
               "And why so?" she asked, gazing upon me in astonishment. "It is nothing for him to
                  buy you fifty dresses; and you may consider yourself a very lucky girl; no one in
                  the city is more so. Young Fairchild is determined that your wardrobe shall equal
                  your great beauty."
               "You flatter me too much," I replied; "it is more than I can bear; I'm not used to
                  such things."
               "Oh, I do not flatter you at all," she returned. "I am only saying what he told me
                  this day. To-morrow the dress shall be made up. You are, indeed, a lucky
                  girl!"
               Young Fairchild is ambitious, and he means that you shall make a sensation when he
                  takes you to promenade Broadway or to some place of amusement. He says your beauty
                  will call for many inquiries concerning you. He understands human nature pretty
                  well. Rich men in large cities are always striving after the handsomest wives; but
                  it is different in the country. I once lived in the country myself. Beauty there
                  is not so much thought of as it is here. Ah, Ellen, you will learn all about it
                  one of these days. The wives of rich men have nothing to do but make a show in the
                  world. I do not see why men have not a right thus to spend their money and enjoy
                  themselves in so sensible a way."
               "I am not at all calculated for such things," I replied; "not being used to mingle
                  in such society I should appear very awkward."
               "Not a bit of it," she answered; "you have the beauty, and that is the main thing;
                  having that, you will soon learn to move in society. Your beautiful face will
                  carry you any where. You will find everything I tell you to be true. I say, again,
                  you are a very fortunate young lady."
               Madame Tetford left me after indulging in this long story; and I heard her voice
                  in another room; I could not distinguish what was said; but it appeared to me that
                  there was some trouble.
               "What is the trouble?" I inquired of one of the lady boarders.
               "Some trouble with one of the girls, I suppose; I wish I was under some other
                  roof," she said.
               "But what is it?" I asked, trembling in every limb.
               "I cannot tell you more now," she replied; "we must not be seen together; take
                  care of yourself!"
               She instantly left me, and stole up stairs as stealthily as a cat.
               I went to my room and threw myself into a chair. I felt that all was shrouded in
                  the deepest mystery; and I began to feel the same desire as the girl expressed:
                  that is, to be under some other roof. The girl's warning, "take care of yourself!"
                  again sounded more loudly in my ears than ever.
               What could that girl mean by such an admonition! That question I kept asking
                  myself.
               The new dress lay on the bed where I had placed it out in order to have a better
                  view of it; and although it was more beautiful than I had ever seen, yet I eyed it
                  with a certain undefinable suspicion and dread—why, I could not tell.
               Since the interview with the girl, I 
                     suspeced
                     suspected
                   almost everything. I tried to calm my mind, and drive these suspicions
                  from me; but they would haunt me like spirits in spite of all my efforts to keep
                  them down.
               Suspicions of what or whom? That I could not answer.
               Having seen but little of human life, and that little confined to country life, I
                  began to think that my suspicions were unfounded, and that the more I should see
                  of the different phases of human conduct, the less I would be surprised. I tried
                  to persuade myself into the belief that all would vet end well.
               
               Expecting that young Fairchild would visit me, I dressed myself up so as to look
                  as well as I could. I had made up my mind to receive him as a suitor in the place
                  of the heartless deceiver, the so-called Colonel Beaufort; and yet I was not
                  willing to do anything to make the young man love me less. No woman is willing to
                  be loved less; for that is a species of worship from the other sex it is not
                  desirous to see lessened. I believed my lover was very rich, and loved me far more
                  than he had any other girl.
               I was anxious to see him, and counted the minutes till he came. At length he came,
                  and I was rejoiced to see him. My female readers must not suppose from this that I
                  really loved him; yet I felt an interest in him that came very near that
                  passion.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               The Interview. Some Strange Scenes. The Reader will be
                  Interested.
               Hearing the door bell ring, I hurried to the private parlor to receive young
                  Fairchild. I found him and Madame Tetford engaged in a spirited conversation. He
                  received me very cordially; but I thought she looked as if she felt I had come too
                  soon. We conversed some time on various subjects; and the young man was very
                  pleasant and agreeable.
               After some little time Madame Tetford remarked that she expected company that
                  evening, and said that it would be as well for me and my lover to go to my own
                  chamber.
               The hot blood rushed to my cheeks, and I made no reply.
               She knew that I was embarrassed, and with her great tact endeavored to convince me
                  that there could be no harm in it.
               I accordingly conducted my lover to my chamber. He offered no objections. My new
                  dress was lying upon the bed, which he noticed.
               "Oh, madame has purchased you the dress I ordered," he said, smiling.
               I told him she had, and thanked him for the beautiful present.
               "It is very handsome," he continued; "how are you pleased with it? I think it will
                  become you."
               "Oh, yes; but I am sorry you should go to such an expense for me. I feel as if I
                  shall never be able to pay you for all your kindness to me."
               "You must not talk so," he replied, taking my hand and gently squeezing it. Oh,
                  what is a single dress? Why, dear Ellen, I shall esteem it a great happiness to
                  buy you many such."
               I could not find words to express my feelings.
               He still retained my hand in his, and was quite nervous. He said he had another
                  present for me, and took from his pocket a beautiful ring, which he placed upon my
                  finger.
               The ring sparkled in the light of the lamp, and excited strange feelings in my
                  heart. I thanked him. And yet I felt that I was not doing right in thus receiving
                  these presents.
               "Now, Ellen, your hand begins to look like a lady's," he said, kissing it, and
                  smiling.
               "Perhaps your ornaments will outshine everything else," I said, gently withdrawing
                  my hand
               "Oh, there is no fear of that, unless there is more ingenious artizans than I have
                  ever seen," he said. "As soon as all your arrangements are complete I will take
                  you to the theatre."
               "Oh, I should be pleased to go; I do not know what a theatre is!"
               "But I intend you shall know," he replied.
               He now placed his arm around my waist, and drew my face to his; but, ere he had
                  time to kiss me, I released myself from his grasp, and seated myself in another
                  chair.
               I thought he was taking too much liberty with me; and accordingly resisted him in
                  such a determined manner that he felt rebuked, and even apologised for his
                  rudeness.
               "Pardon me, dear Ellen," he said, appearing much disquieted, and gazing anxiously
                  upon me as I sat in a chair at some distance from him. "I meant no harm, and only
                  yielded from an honest impulse. You know how much I love you; and thus loving, it
                  is not strange that I should wish to embrace you; but if you think I have done any
                  wrong, I humbly ask your pardon."
               "I do not think you meant to insult me," I said.
               "I did not," he said, moving his chair near mine, and gazing fondly at me. "Dear
                  Ellen, you are the last person in this world whom I would insult. If you knew how
                  deeply and ardently I love you I know you would find excuses for my seeming
                  rudeness. Is it strange that I should wish to seal my love with a kiss? I don't
                  know much about country customs; but fashionable society would not restrain one
                  from doing what I attempted to do a moment ago. No, my dear Ellen, you have a
                  great many things yet to learn before you can know much about fashionable life and
                  city notions. You have beauty, and I have money enough to accomplish that, and we
                  will do it. We have a happy career before us; and will enjoy life in all its
                  various phases."
               I listened attentively while he was speaking, and felt strange emotions agitating
                  my heart.
               He again took my hand, which I permitted him to hold a few minutes, and then
                  withdrew it. He did not seem to be pleased with the act, although he made no
                  further complaint in words. I could see, however, that he was greatly
                  disappointed; for he supposed that his remarks had produced the effect upon me
                  which he desired.
               He remained some time, and at last took his departure, promising to call on the
                  morrow
               Madame Tetford assisted in making my dress. Before night my dress was completed,
                  and I put it on. It fitted me exactly, and became me very much. By madame's advice
                  I kept it on, as I expected young Fairchild in the evening. She said he would
                  expect me to wear it. He had given it to me, and I was disposed to please him by
                  wearing it.
               Madame Tetford volunteered to give me some advice as to my conduct while I was
                  with my lover.
               "He will be here this evening," she said; "and you must be careful not to
                  displease him; you must recollect that he ardently loves you, and, should he wish
                  to kiss you, do not resist him; the customs here are quite different from those in
                  the country; in fashionable life kissing is quite common, and city girls do not
                  mind it."
               I suggested that what was wrong in one place would be wrong in another.
               "Oh, no," she said; "custom regulates all these things; you must expect your lover
                  to exhibit evidences of affection—it would be strange if he did not; very modest
                  and bashful young men in the country you came from might behave quite differently,
                  but you must not expect such reserve here; I just tell you this for your good;
                  depend upon it young Fairchild will do nothing but what is right and proper."
               "Your advice and my late mother's do not agree very well," I said, recollecting
                  the lessons she gave me before she died—lessons that sank deep into my heart, and
                  even to this day are carefully treasured up in my mind.
               "Quite likely," she said; "but your mother and I speak from different
                  standpoints—she from a country view and I from a city view; that fact alone is
                  quite sufficient to account for the difference in our opinions. You know that I
                  would not knowingly advise you to do anything wrong than your respected mother
                  would; but I feel a deep interest in you, and desire to see you the wife of young
                  Fairchild. I am convinced he loves you, and he is an excellent young man. He has mixed in the society of beautiful ladies;
                  but you are the first one who has won his heart; I never saw a young man so very
                  deeply in love as he is—his is the wonderful instance of love at first sight; I
                  have often heard of that, but I never saw it so fully exemplified before. He has
                  often ridiculed the idea of love at first sight, but he tells a different story
                  now; he now confesses that I was right. The first time he gazed upon you he felt a
                  shock of electricity, as it were, run through his system, and the more he gazed
                  upon you stronger the feeling grew, until he was convinced that love had conquered
                  his heart. What I had often said on that subject occurred to him then. Have you
                  not heard that matches were made in heaven?"
               "Yes, I have heard mother say so very often," I replied.
               "There cannot be the least doubt of it," she said. "Love, in my opinion, is quite
                  a serious thing. What is it? And where does it come from? It emanates from heaven,
                  and it should be regarded as a very sacred thing."
               "But suppose I cannot love him?" I said.
               "Not love him!" she exclaimed; "depend upon it you will love him. That little
                  rogue, Cupid, would never have touched his heart unless it had been designed to
                  kindle a flame in yours too. No, Ellen, you will love him yet with all you soul's
                  best affections."
               And thus this vile woman conversed; for a time she fairly bewildered my poor
                  senses.
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               The Old Libertine and His Wiles.
               "What is that girl made of?" asked the old libertine, Turner—for we shall call him
                  by his right name—as he came out of a room where he had been trying his wicked
                  arts upon the poor unfortunate girl introduced to the reader in a previous chapter
                  under the name of Clara. "Was she born of a woman, or is she an angel, and dropped
                  down from the clouds?" said this wicked man; "I have never encountered such a
                  little witch before! I can make no impression upon her! Her heart appears to be
                  cased in steel."
               This was the second interview this old libertine had had with Clara; and thus far
                  he had met with nothing but ill success. He could not conquer her. His temper was
                  roused, and he began to be suspicious that Madame Tetford was playing a trick upon
                  him; but these suspicions were unfounded; for this abandoned woman had exercised
                  all her power to induce the poor girl to become the victim of this man's base
                  passions.
               "What is the trouble?" asked this vile woman.
               "Trouble!" he repeated, manifesting much indignation; "I think you have instructed
                  this girl to resist me; I cannot account for her resistance on any other ground; I
                  never had such bad success before with the fair sex; if you have been imposing
                  upon me I will make you sweat for it."
               "There has been no deception practised upon you; for I have tried all my powers of
                  persuasion to bring the girl to your desires," she said; "and I now intend to try
                  some other method besides soft words and persuasive arguments; I will see if she
                  will not yield obedience to my orders; I will give her a talking to."
               "Perhaps I have done you injustice in thus suspecting you," he said.
               "You have done me great injustice; for I procured this girl expressly for you, and
                  have been at much trouble and expense," she replied; "I feared she would prove a
                  stubborn creature; but she can be brought round yet. I never saw one yet I could
                  not conquer."
               "She threatened me that, if I persisted in attempting to kiss her, she would raise
                  the neighborhood. She is a very determined girl."
               "And wouldn't she permit you to take one kiss?"
               "Not one; and her eyes sparkled and emitted flames of fire. She said she would
                  never marry a man as old as I am if I was ever so rich. She threatens to leave
                  you; so keep a good look out, or she will be among the missing!"
               "Yes; I'll see to that," she said; "she shall not escape me, after spending so
                  much upon her."
               "No doubt of that; if she does, she will have but one more to escape," he said,
                  smiling.
               "I'm much flattered by you compliment," she replied.
               "You are welcome; but do not be angry."
               "I am not angry with you; but I am put out with that girl; she is in my power—I
                  have bought her and paid for her."
               "Is that so?"
               "Certainly; I'm not going to lose money by the impudent thing."
               "Oh, let you alone for that; I think I have paid you sufficient to cover all
                  expenses," he replied; "and all I have received for it is sharp looks and impudent
                  language."
               "Well, I am not to blame for your ill success," she said; "I did not think that a
                  poor unfortunate girl like her, picked up from the abode of wretchedness and
                  poverty, would prove so refractory as Clara has. I have never known such an
                  instance before, and yet I have had a score of girls from such places; but be not
                  discouraged, I'll train her yet."
               "I will call again; in the meantime, try your best."
               The Colonel departed; and Madame Tetford immediately sought Clara, who was seated
                  upon a sofa, showily and splendidly dressed, and adorned with jewelry; she was
                  looking steadily at a lamp which was burning in the room. The poor girl looked sad
                  and sorrowful, deeply reflecting upon her situation, and feeling anxious to see
                  her parents. She feared that her sisters might suffer for the want of food. True,
                  her vile keeper had told her that she had furnished her parents with money; but
                  that fact, even if she had believed all the woman said, did not relieve her
                  apprehensions.
               "Well, Clara, the Colonel did not stay very long this evening," said the woman,
                  looking cross.
               "He staid longer than I wished to have him," replied Clara.
               "How is that?"
               "Yes, it would have been better if he had gone an hour before he did, and better
                  still, if he had never come at all," said Clara, firmly.
               "Oh, you talk like a foolish girl," said the woman, sharply; "the Colonel is one
                  of the best men in the city, and no girl would reject him."
               "Then let him find such girls, for I'm not one of them," said Clara, turning her
                  dark eyes on the woman as if she would search her through.
               "You have grown very smart of late," said the woman; "you must curb your temper,
                  or there may be trouble."
               "I want to go home and see my parents," said Clara, while a tear stood trembling
                  in her eyes, and her heart throbbed with strange emotions.
               "But you cannot see them at present, I tell you," said this vile and unprincipled
                  woman.
               "I will not remain here if that person continues to come," said Clara; "I do not
                  like the looks of that man; I don't believe he is a good man."
               "Not a good man!' repeated the woman; "he is one of the best men in the city, and
                  loves you dearly. Clara, if you would marry him, you would have a splendid
                  home."
               "No, I never can marry-him," said the young girl; "I would rather die first!"
               "Rather die first! How silly you talk and act!"
               "I mean what I say," said the young girl," in a firm tone of voice.
               Clara's spirit began to rise within her,
                  and she could not restrain it. Very strong suspicions of the honesty of this woman
                  began to take possession of her soul; and she made up her mind to leave her house
                  on the very first opportunity that presented itself.
               "You cannot help it!" repeated this vile woman; "but you must help it; I will not
                  submit to it!"
               "Then give me back my old clothes, and I will go home. Let me go to-night; I know
                  the way!"
               "You won't go to-night, nor yet tomorrow," said the woman; "I purchased you of
                  your father, and paid him the money; he gave you to me, and I have full control
                  over you; but I wish to use you well, Clara; and if you behave yourself you shall
                  be treated well and kindly; but if you are impudent, I shall treat you
                  accordingly."
               Clara sat and silently gazed upon the floor, but she was not conquered; her proud
                  spirit was not yet crushed.
               This vile woman also sat silent, and gazed upon her victim; but no feelings of
                  compassion were stirred within her dark and corrupt soul. A long career of
                  wickedness had hardened her heart and spread a blighting mildew over her soul.
               At length she ordered Clara to her room, and then locked her in.
               Clara was now a prisoner; but her heart was not broken nor her spirit at all
                  crushed by this cruel treatment. She threw off her jewelry, and said within
                  herself that she would never again wear such ornaments. Had it been possible to
                  escape from her imprisonment, she would have done so that night; but the cunning
                  mistress had used every precaution to prevent such an occurrence.
               After undressing herself, Clara sat down and gave way to her feelings; she had
                  strong suspicions that she was imprisoned in a bad house; still she did not know
                  but she was mistaken; she hoped she was.
               What a night she spent! It was almost a sleepless one. Towards morning she fell
                  into an uneasy slumber, and slept until the mistress awoke her. But few words
                  passed between them, quite enough, however, to convince this vile creature that
                  the girl was not yet conquered.
               The day previous to the events just recorded, one of Madame Tetford's "lady
                  boarders" had a quarrel with the mistress; and the former threatened to leave the
                  house unless a greater proportion of her "wages of sin" was given her; but the
                  latter was firm, and the quarrel looked to be a permanent one. Fanny—for by that
                  name she went—was envious of Clara's beauty, and was bent upon having an interview
                  with her if it could be had without the mistress knowing it.
               An opportunity soon presented itself. It happened in the course of the next day
                  after Clara was locked in her room, that Fanny met her in one of the halls of the
                  chamber.
               "Are you good at keeping a secret?" asked Fanny, in an agitated voice, gazing
                  round to see that there were no listeners.
               "Yes," replied Clara; "explain yourself; I will not betray you!"
               There was something in Clara's manner and in her open countenance that convinced
                  this girl that she could be trusted.
               "I will trust you," said Fanny. "Do you know the character of this house and of
                  the woman who keeps it?"
               "No; but I have suspicions that all is not right," replied Clara. "Speak, and tell
                  me!"
               "It is a brothel, and the mistress is a procuress!" answered Fanny.
               "Is that so?" inquired Clara, gazing upon Fanny with an intensely-painful
                  look.
               "It is. But speak low, or we shall be overheard. That person who visits you is an
                  old libertine, and has not the least idea of marrying you. He has a wife and
                  family. He has a son, who is a chip of the old block. I know both father and son
                  well. As the cock crows the young one learns. The son is quite as bad as the
                  father. I would not stay in this place if I were you!"
               "Why do you stay in such a place?" asked Clara.
               "I am used to it; this is the best excuse I can give," said Fanny.
               "I will never become used to it!" exclaimed Clara.
               "Tell me where you lived before you came here, and where your parents are, if you
                  have any, and perhaps I may assist you," said Fanny.
               Clara now told her all she asked; and the girl marked the street and number on a
                  slip of paper and put it into her bosom.
               "There," said Fanny; "don't be at all alarmed; keep up a stout heart, and slap the
                  old libertine's face when he calls again. Madame Tetford is coming! I hear her
                  footsteps on the stairs! Go into your room!"
               Clara ran to her room, and Fanny walked through the hall, singing and dancing.
               By the time the mistress came up, Fanny was singing and whirling quite
                  merrily.
               "You appear in good spirits to-day," said the mistress.
               "Yes," said Fanny; "but I should be still more lively if you would give me more
                  money."
               "Oh, you needn't talk about that," said the mistress; "you fare like the rest of
                  the girls."
               "That don't help me," said the girl, saucily.
               "Well, it the best I can do," repeated this vile woman; "but I thought I heard
                  some person talking just now; where is Clara?"
               "Not knowing I couldn't say," said the lying Fanny. "I have not seen her Perhaps
                  you heard me repeating to myself a funny story a gentleman told me last
                  night."
               "You are well aware of my orders—I forbid any one of you girls from speaking to
                  her."
               "Certainly, we all understand that," replied Clara. "You need not trouble yourself
                  about that. None of us have any desire to speak to the proud thing; she's
                  altogether too proud to be our familiar acquaintance. Do her parents live in the
                  city?"
               "I know nothing about her parents," replied this lying woman. The girl was sent to
                  me from the country. Don't you think her handsome?"
               "Well enough for a country girl," returned Fanny.
               "Well, that is good, coming from such a source. Didn't you come from the
                  country?"
               "That was when I was quite small; but I have been long enough in the city to get
                  the rough edges off," replied the girl, laughing.
               "Ah, you are a strange girl," said the mistress, passing through the hall into
                  Clara's chamber.
               She found the poor girl sitting at a window and gazing upon the crowds passing the
                  streets.
               "Come, Clara, it is time for you to dress and put on the jewelry," said the
                  mistress.
               "The things ain't mine, and I shall not wear them again," replied Clara.
               "Not wear them again!" repeated the mistress. "But you shall wear the things!"
               "I will not!" replied Clara, looking full into the woman's face.
               "You shall suffer for such insolence!" exclaimed the agitated woman.
               "You have made me suffer," returned Clara, feeling too indignant to shed a tear.
                  "You can't make me a bad girl—I will die first!"
               
               "Quite resolute, I confess!" said the mistress. "I don't want to make you a bad
                  girl, but the wife of a rich, respectable husband."
               Clara deigned no answer to this; but she gazed upon the vile creature with an
                  expression of countenance that spoke more eloquently than words to the guilty soul
                  of this corrupt woman. The look stung her to her very inmost soul. Such is the
                  power of virtue over vice in all cases.
               The woman said no more, but left the chamber. That piercing look of this spirited
                  and virtuous girl haunted her for hours; but evil associations soon banished it
                  from her mind.
               
               The next morning after father and son had been exercising their art and skill to
                  ruin the poor girl Clara, a handsomely dressed woman was seen knocking at the door
                  of the house which Clara's parents had occupied before kind friends had procured
                  them a better place; but she found they had removed, but to what place, the
                  occupants could not inform her. She turned away, regretting that she could not be
                  revenged upon Madame Tetford. The reader need not be informed that the name of
                  this girl was Fanny, and whom the reader is somewhat acquainted with.
               As she left the house, Mrs. Smith saw her, and felt a wish to know who she was.
                  Her first thought was that it was the lost Clara, but her face looked too old.
               "Are you acquainted with the family who reside in that house?" she inquired,
                  looking at the girl.
               "I am not; I was merely inquiring for Mr. Lawrence's residence; I understood he
                  lived there; but it seems he has removed."
               "Were you acquainted with the family, then?"
               "No; but I should like to know where they live." said Fanny.
               "I can show you," said Mrs. Smith; "I am going to the house."
               The two started off together.
               "Do you reside in the city?" inquired Mrs. Smith, who began to be somewhat
                  interested in her companion.
               "Yes, madam, I have resided a few years in New York."
               "Do your parents reside here?"
               "No; they live in the country."
               "I suppose you know Mr. Lawrence's family," said this good woman.
               "I have no acquaintance with them," said Fanny.
               Mrs. Smith wondered why this girl desired to see this poor family with whom she
                  had no acquaintance. At length the thought struck her that she might know
                  something of the lost Clara.
               "No acquaintance with them!" repeated this kind woman; "have you never seen any of
                  the girls belonging to the family?"
               "
                     One
                     Only
                   one!" replied Fanny.
               "Only 
                     only
                     one
                  !" repeated the good lady, seizing Fanny by the arm, and detaining her.
                  "Only one! Speak! Where did you see her?"
               "Why, in prison," replied Fanny, smiling at the woman's great anxiety.
               "In prison! Where? Speak!"
               "I call it a prison; but some might call it a house of assignation!" said
                  Fanny.
               "Is she there now?"
               "Yes, she was yesterday; but you need not be alarmed, she can take care of
                  herself."
               "In what street is the house, and what the number?" asked Mrs. Smith.
               The girl gave the street and number to her on a card which she had already
                  prepared, that there might be no mistake and she lose her revenge.
               "You have done a good deed. We have been hunting for weeks for her," remarked this
                  kind woman.
               "The girl is treated very cruelly by the woman who keeps the house," said Fanny.
                  She is a very mean woman, and I hate her; so you must credit this good deed to my
                  hate of that woman, and not to any better motive. I would not deceive you; for I
                  have been an inmate of that house myself. The girl is very handsome; and I confess
                  I have envied her beauty. I stole a few moments' conversation with her and
                  ascertained where her family resided, on purpose to be revenged on this wicked
                  woman. Put the woman through; that is all I ask. Give it to her, and spare not;
                  for she has cheated me. There is no need now of my going to see the girl's mother,
                  as you can tell her all about it."
               "There is no need," replied Mrs. Smith. beginning to understand the true character
                  of the girl who had given her such information. I am sorry you hate any human
                  being."
               "And wouldn't you hate a person who would cheat you out of your earnings?" asked
                  the girl.
               "But we ought not to hate any one!" said the woman.
               "If you wouldn't hate such a creature you would not be a Christian," said this
                  corrupt girl.
               Mrs. Smith found the task a hard one to argue this question with the girl, and so
                  she gave it up as a hopeless case.
               "It is no use for us to talk," said the girl; "we don't think alike; but just put
                  that woman through, and I shall be satisfied."
               "Put that woman through!" repeated this good woman, hurrying along. "And what
                  language to come from a girl whose face is so handsome. The men have accused us of
                  being either devils or angels! It appears to me that girl might be arrested in her
                  career of vice and crime. Oh, how mixed with good and evil is human society! How
                  happy I should be if I could be instrumental in reforming that girl!"
               This good woman spoke the truth; she was always happy in doing good. But she did
                  not go to Mrs. Lawrence's house. but to a lawyer, and laid the case before him for
                  advice and direction.
               Papers were made out, and Mrs. Smith, an officer and several of the police hurried
                  to the establishment of Madame Tetford.
               While they were on their way the mistress and the almost broken-hearted Clara were
                  in a small room on the first floor—the same room in which this vile creature had
                  lectured the girl many times before. On this occasion she was more severe than
                  ever, proceeding to the extreme of bodily chastisement.
               The woman raised her hand to strike again, but the loud ringing of the door bell
                  arrested the blow, and she answered the summons.
               The officer stood at the door waiting for it to be opened, while the others were
                  in a carriage near by. The officer being dressed in citizen's clothes, she did not
                  recognize him, and invited him in. He stepped in, and stood with his back against
                  the door to prevent its being shut, if she attempted to do so.
               "Please walk in, sir, and I will close the door," she said.
               "Your name is Madame Tetford, is it not?" he asked.
               "No, sir, that is not my name," she replied, growing frightened; for the officer
                  began to take some papers from his pocket, and showing his true character; "the
                  lady you speak of resides a block or two above."
               The woman now began to look wild wished he stood in a different position, so that
                  she might push him out and bolt the door; but the officer knew too much for that.
                  He had seen too many like her to be taken in that way.
               "You must be mistaken in the house," she said, in a trembling voice; "no such
                  person resides here."
               "It may be so, madame; but I wish to search this house, and see if I cannot find a
                  girl who is lost," said the officer.
               
               At that moment Clara stood at the open door of the room where she was, and
                  overheard the last words of the officer. She came rushing through the hall towards
                  the officer, with tears in her eyes, and the marks of the blows she had received
                  upon her face.
               "I am the lost girl! Oh, save me!" exclaimed Clara.
               The others in the carriage had stepped out and came to the door.
               Mrs. Smith rushed into the house and embraced the girl, while Madame Tetford stood
                  trembling in the hands of the officer who had seized and made her a prisoner.
               "This is Clara Lawrence; I know her from the resemblance to her mother and
                  sisters," said Mrs. Smith, pressing the poor girl to her bosom.
               "Oh, yes, that is my name!" sobbed poor Clara.
               "I thought I could not be mistaken in the number," said the officer; "Madame
                  Tetford does not reside a few blocks above, after all."
               "She does! she does!" exclaimed the vile woman, attempting to get away from the
                  officer. You are altogether mistaken in my name. Release your hold!"
               "I will when I have placed you in the Tombs," said the officer. "Perhaps you have
                  heard of that stone palace, and often seen its outside. But now you shall have the
                  privilege of viewing interior construction and arrangements. It may not be so
                  handsomely furnished as this whited sepulchre, nevertheless you will find
                  comfortable quarters."
               "You have taken the wrong person," she said, much agitated; "that is not my
                  name."
               "I suppose Madame Tetford is not your true name, and I'll call you Sally Long,"
                  replied the officer.
               "She has treated me cruelly," said Clara, clinging to Miss Smith's dress, as if
                  she instinctively knew she had found a friend.
               "No doubt she has; but you are now released from her power," replied Mrs.
                  Smith.
               "The girl lies!" exclaimed this vile woman.
               "I speak the truth; and she wanted me to become as bad as she is herself; but I
                  would die first!" said Clara.
               "Heaven be praised for enabling you to make such a resolution," said Mrs.
                  Smith.
               "Come, Madame Tetford, Sally Long, or whatever may be your name, prepare yourself
                  for other quarters," said the officer.
               "You will repent of arresting an innocent woman!" said Madame. "That girl came
                  here voluntarily, and begged me to keep her."
               "It is false!" replied Clara. You've kept me here against my will, locked me up
                  during the night, and would not suffer me to go out in the day."
               The old hag turned her flashing eyes upon the girl, and wished she had murdered
                  her ere she had been found in her keeping.
               The woman was taken to the Tombs and locked up, and Clara was taken to her
                  mother's.
               We will not attempt to describe the joy of mother and sisters—it may be imagined,
                  but cannot be described.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               A Jealous Woman, and the Results. A Warning to Husbands.
               Another bright morning broke over New York. Masses of living humanity were
                  hurrying to and fro in Broadway, and all nature seemed to be alive.
               We will introduce the reader now to a gentleman and lady who are taking a morning
                  promenade on Broadway, Mr. and Mrs. Smith—a gay man and a jealous wife.
               Splendid carriages and fine horses were out. Coachmen and footmen attired in
                  livery; and their masters and mistresses leaned back in their turnouts outs with
                  great dignity and hauteur, as if the whole world was made expressly for their
                  use.
               Such silly exhibitions never fail to make a sensible man laugh; for well he knows
                  the origin of all those who thus figure in the upper circles of New York life.
                  Some of them are the sons of shoemakers and tailors; but trade and speculation
                  have given them riches; hence the purse-proud aristocracy of our country.
               Turn-out after turn-out stopped in front of Stuart's marble palace; and the
                  beautiful and fashionable ladies alighted to purchase some costly article of
                  dress.
               The ladies must have dress, if the heavens fall, dear soul! But the men are as
                  much to blame for this state of things as the women.
               "What elegant lady is that just stepped down from the carriage?" inquired Mrs.
                  Smith; "she is dressed splendidly and has a fine carriage and horses; her
                  coachman, too, is handsomely fitted out."
               "I do not know," he replied. "This city is fast filling up with the aristocracy so
                  that it is hard to keep the run of them."
               "Did not the lady recognize you with a smile?" she asked. "She looked at you as
                  she passed from the carriage, did she not?"
               "I think not—I was not aware of it—she must have been looking at the gentleman who
                  stood near me!" he stammered out.
               "Perhaps so; but I thought she directed her glances directly at you and smiled,"
                  said the jealous wife. Let us go and find out who she is; besides, I wish to look
                  at some of the goods."
               He could not refuse to yield to his wife's request, and yet he was sorry she made
                  the request, for the lady in question was a particular acquaintance of his, and
                  the keeper of an assignation house.
               The husband and wife now entered the store, and saw madame pricing an elegant
                  shawl.
               Mrs. Smith went into the same room, taking her husband with her, much against his
                  inclination; for he feared she might again recognize him with a smile.
               Mrs. Smith kept her eye on the woman as she and her husband approached the place
                  where she was standing, determined to see for herself if any sign of recognition
                  was manifested.
               Now this lady had become jealous of her husband, although she had never let him
                  know the extent of her feelings. Recently she had become more jealous, and shown
                  him more of its spirit. He was aware that the "green-eyed monster" had taken
                  possession of her heart, and he was somewhat prepared for it. Up to this time
                  there had been no serious rupture between them, although she had taken him to task
                  occasionally for being out so late of nights.
               When they had approached near madame, she slyly turned her eyes upon him, and a
                  half smile passed over her countenance. The wife saw that look and smile, and it
                  excited her terribly. She trembled, and a sickness came over her soul. She kept
                  her eyes fastened on the woman to see if she would smile again; but the shrewd
                  creature understood herself and busied herself with the goods; but this did not
                  satisfy the jealous wife. How very true it is that jealousy makes the meat it
                  feeds on.
               The wife now became satisfied that the woman did not look again at her husband
                  lest she might be suspected. Had she looked and smiled a second time the wife
                  would not have considered that stronger evidence of her husband's guilt than she
                  did the woman's abstaining from that look and smile.
               The jealous wife was now roused; and her husband knew the fact, and felt anything
                  but comfortable just about that time.
               
               This woman purchased a costly shawl with the money Smith had paid her but a few
                  nights since. And having made the purchase, she came past them and went into
                  another apartment of the store. As the vile woman passed near the wife and touched
                  her husband with the flowing skirts of her silk dress, she could not refrain from
                  slyly turning her eyes on him. Not a motion of her escaped the notice of the
                  jealous wife. She saw those dark eyes again turned upon her husband, and she
                  trembled.
               "Let us go," she said, in a low and tremulous voice.
               "Did you not wish to look at some of the goods," he replied.
               "No," she said, leading the way to the street, followed by her husband, who began
                  to fear a storm.
               "You may call a carriage," she said, as they stood upon the sidewalk.
               "I thought you preferred walking this morning," he replied.
               "But I want a carriage now," she replied.
               "Yes, my dear, you shall have one," he said, calling a hack.
               The carriage was soon driven up, and he offered to wait upon his wife in.
               "Wait," she said. Then turning to the driver, she continued, pointing to the
                  woman's carriage: "You see that carriage, do you not?"
               "Certainly, madame," replied the man, smiling, for he knew well enough whose it
                  was.
               "Follow that carriage when the woman comes out and the horses start," she said.
                  "Follow it wherever it goes."
               "Yes, madam," he said, bowing and smiling.
               The driver knew that there was something up. He thought from the expressions of
                  the woman's countenance, and her peculiar, excited manner, that she was jealous of
                  her husband. And the husband's looks and actions confirmed the driver's
                  suspicions.
               The poor husband was in trouble, and remained silent.
               "We will get into the carriage now, if you like," she said, putting her foot upon
                  the step, while her husband assisted her. "Mind, driver," she continued, while her
                  foot was on the carriage step and her husband was lifting her up by the arm;
                  "follow that carriage until the horses stop and the woman gets out."
               "Your orders shall be strictly obeyed, madam," said the driver.
               Mrs. Smith stepped into the carriage, and her husband followed. There they sat
                  some time waiting for the woman 
                     to to
                     to
                   come out and enter her carriage. Not a word passed between them for some
                  moments. The husband began to grow uneasy; for the silence was oppressive—it
                  seemed to him it was more so than anything she might say. At length he broke the
                  silence.
               "My dear, what does all this mean?" he asked.
               "I am determined to know where that woman lives who smiles on you so very 
                     gaciously
                     graciously
                  ; "I dare say you know well enough, already."
               "This is something very singular," he said, much agitated.
               "Very singular, indeed!" she replied, looking at him fixedly; "remarkably
                  singular! You must be greatly surprised! Oh, no, you never saw that woman before!
                  Do not know even where she resides! Oh, what a paragon of virtue! Strange!"
               "For heaven's sake, do stop!" he exclaimed.
               "Why should I stop!" she repeated. "Would to heaven you had stopped ere you formed
                  an acquaintance with that vile creature!"
               "What do you suppose I know about the woman? I know nothing about her, good or
                  bad!"
               "Women like her are not apt to smile on strange gentlemen in a public place,
                  especially when their wives are along with them," she replied; "but I do not wish
                  to hear any more; do not deny again that you have no acquaintance with her."
               At that moment the person they sought came out and entered her carriage, amid the
                  gaze of quite a crowd of all sorts of people, some of whom smiled, and others
                  looked sour.
               The woman's carriage started off, and the other followed.
               Not a word was uttered by husband or wife.
               The woman's carriage was driven up to the door of her establishment, and she got
                  out. The other carriage stopped also, and the woman stood on the front steps and
                  gazed upon it. The husband sat back so as not to be seen; but his wife looked out
                  of the carriage window. The procuress recognized her, turned round and entered the
                  house.
               "Now you can drive on," said Mrs. Smith, giving the driver the street and the
                  number where she wished to be left.
               Poor Mr. Smith remained silent, and allowed his wife to manage in her own way.
                  When the carriage stopped at their house she paid the driver, and, as she did so,
                  she asked him if he knew that woman.
               "She calls herself Madame Tetford," replied the driver, laughing; "you would not
                  wish to make her acquaintance!"
               "Just as I expected!" she exclaimed.
               The driver drove off laughing, and saying to himself. "I think there'll be some
                  trouble in that house before morning. She is jealous of her husband. Her husband
                  has ruined more than one poor girl!"
               Mrs. Smith entered the house, followed by her husband. They had not long been in
                  the house before the bell rang and a woman with a child entered. She came directly
                  into the room where Smith and his wife sat in moody silence.
               When this woman and child entered, his heart sunk within him, and he thought all
                  his troubles were coming upon him at once.
               "What do you wish for?" asked Mrs. Smith, addressing the young woman.
               "I called to see if you wouldn't like to have a child!" said the young woman,
                  first turning to the wife and then to the husband.
               "I cannot have the trouble of children," said the wife.
               "Perhaps you would like to have one," said the mother, addressing Smith.
               "Not unless my wife is willing," he replied, nerving himself for the occasion.
               "Oh, do, sir; it's a very pretty baby," remarked the mother; "it looks very much
                  like you—don't you think it does?" And she carried the child to him and sat it
                  down in his lap.
               Mrs. Smith at first thought the woman was crazy. He gently motioned her off, but
                  she succeeded in placing the child in his lap.
               While he held the child his cheeks became pale and his heart beat as if it would
                  burst its narrow bounds.
               Mrs. Smith saw his agitation, and could not make out the cause. The thought had
                  not occurred to her that it was his child; but when she saw his agitation, a
                  suspicion was at once excited, and it gave her much trouble.
               "What means all this?" she asked.
               "The child is now held by its own father!" said the woman. "He seduced me under a
                  promise of marriage!"
               Mrs. Smith sank upon the sofa, completely overcome.
               "The woman is out of her mind!" said Smith, running after her with the child in
                  his arms.
               "Here, take the child," he said, holding out the infant; take the child, and
                  here's money."
               She took the child and money, and was soon out of his sight.
               Smith returned to the house, and found' his wife in great agony of mind. He
                  endeavored to convince her that the woman was crazy; but he had a difficult task
                  of it, more difficult than he imagined.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               Further Excitement. City Scenes and City Life.
               Three days passed and I appeared in my new dress—yes, dressed for the theatre!
               Now commenced my life of dissipation, when I should mingle in all the little vices
                  which go to make up a life in a city like New York!
               Madame Tetford complimented me on my looks. And my dress did most admirably become
                  me.
               My beauty and charms began now to bewilder my brain. That keen moral sense which
                  once passed a righteous judgment upon all my actions begun to be blunted, and my
                  conscience to lose some of its stings.
               The carriage was driven up, and young Fairchild received me kindly.
               Very soon we were seated in the theatre. The house was full, and the curtain rose;
                  everything was new and exciting to me; I was in ecstasies.
               The drama commenced, and I listened with breathless attention.
               All the feelings of my heart were now wrought up to the highest state of
                  excitement. Ere I was aware of it my eyes were filled with tears, and my heart
                  beat as if it disdained to be confined within such narrow bounds.
               The performances so riveted my attention that I scarcely noticed anything but the
                  actors.
               A gentleman sat behind us who seemed to know my lover; and I overheard him
                  whisper: "a very fine girl—who is she, Fairchild?"
               "A cousin of mine!"
               "Oh, nonsense!" returned the man; "you can't fool me!"
               Just then I perceived several opera glasses pointed at me.
               I inquired of my companion why it was done.
               "To see your charming face more distinctly!" he replied, pressing my hand
                  warmly.
               I remarked to him that I did not fancy that.
               "Well," said he, "you must hide your beautiful curls and veil your face if you do
                  not wish to be seen!"
               This flattered my vanity.
               The curtain now rose, and the drama went on.
               My soul was absorbed in the deep interest I felt for the characters in the piece.
                  My tears flowed. Another act passed, and I had a breathing spell.
               "What a thrilling drama!" I said, as the curtain went down.
               "It is indeed!" he said.
               Just then I happened to look up, and saw one of the girls who had boarded at the
                  same house with me. I had taken a deep interest in this girl; and the many
                  interviews we had had together had left strange impressions upon my mind.
               This girl was bending over and gazing upon me.
               "Oh, dear!" I said to my lover; "I see a girl above who boarded at the same house
                  with me!"
               He made no reply.
               "Tell me why the girls sit up there!" I asked.
               "It is a particular choice they have, I suppose," he replied.
               Before I had time to ask another question, the curtain rose, and my attention was
                  drawn to the performances.
               Notwithstanding the thrilling nature of the performances, I could not refrain from
                  occasionally looking up at that girl in the gallery, whose eyes seemed to be
                  fixed, with a burning gaze, upon me. What with the play, and this girl looking
                  upon me, I was much agitated.
               "I should like to speak to that girl," I said.
               "What can you have to say to her?" he asked.
               "I have become much interested in her; she gave me a sketch of her life, and it
                  was a most eventful one."
               "The old story, I suppose," he said, very coolly.
               "What is that?" I asked, looking into his face.
               "Oh, promises broken; but you must not believe all such girls
                  say; besides, I advise you not to cultivate the
                     acquaintance of such persons."
               "That girl seemed to be in great distress," I replied.
               "Yes; but such girls are always in distress, or pretend to be,"
                  he said.
               But with all his indifference he could not change my feelings
                  towards that girl; there seemed to be a congeniality of souls,
                     so to speak, between us; for she had
                     manifested a deep interest in my welfare.
                     But heaven only knows but her admonitions
                  might have saved me from one fate to meet another and a more
                  terrible one!
               "Just as soon as the drama is through, we will go," he
                  said.
               
                  I consented of course; but I was very
                     anxious to have a talk with that girl.
               
                  Deeply were my feelings excited by the
                  drama; yet I could not help looking up where
                  that girl was, so much was I interested in her.
               My companion noticed that she entered my attention, and
                  whispered to me to look up where the girl sat, saying it was
                  not respectable.
               
                  I knew not what he meant; but refrained from
                  looking in that direction so often; I had before.
               
                  There was a mystery about this which I could
                  not solve, and which I dared not him to explain.
               "The play is over now and we will go, if you please," he
                  said.
               
                  I arose and followed him out.
               
                  Soon we entered a carriage, and were taken
                  away.
               
                  My lover was fond and attentive to me on our
                  way home.
               "You could hardly keep your eyes from the girl," he said,
                  putting his arm round my waist and pressing his lips to
                  mine.
               "She does very much interest me!" I said; "I wish I knew more
                  of her eventful life!"
               "You did not know that all the girls in that place in the theatre were bad!" he
                  said.
               "No, I did not; and if that girl is bad, I believe she is a broken-hearted girl,
                  and driven to such a life by the baseness of some wicked man."
               "Perhaps so; but then some girls run to such a life as ducks take to the water,"
                  he replied.
               "How can you speak of such things so lightly," I said; "I pity that girl from the
                  bottom of my heart! She was innocent once; and I think now she has some good
                  qualities; and no doubt she might yet be restored to a virtuous life if the right
                  means were used! Did I possess the power and the means how happy it would make me
                  to use them for her good!"
               "I think it is too late now," he replied; "I trust you will not give yourself any
                  trouble about such persons!"
               I looked at him with 
                     snrprise
                     surprise
                  . "And why not?" I asked.
               "Because your sympathy will be all thrown away; the city is, and always will be,
                  full of such creatures; they are everywhere—in city and country! I've never
                  visited any city where they were not! And is it not strange that I should have
                  travelled so much and have never seen a girl I loved before I saw you?" he said,
                  imprinting a warm kiss upon my lips.
               "It does, indeed, seem strange, and perhaps you will tire of me," I said, feeling
                  sad forebodings.
               "Never, Ellen, let me hear you repeat such doubts again!" he said, apparently
                  grieved to the heart. "You make me feel very bad, and wound my feelings."
               "I do not wish to do that," I said, regretting that I had doubted him.
               "I do not think you have any wish to do so, and I forgive you freely," he said,
                  again imprinting a warm kiss upon my lips.
               Oh, how happy I felt just at this moment! My lover, too, felt happy, judging from
                  his affectionate manner.
               
               By this time we had reached my boarding house, when we alighted, and walked
                  in.
               Soon as we entered the house, Madam Tetford approached us, being up and ready to
                  hear my account of my evening's entertainment.
               "You have come home in very good season," she said; "I did not expect you this
                  hour. I suppose you feel more happy together than you do in such a crowd."
               "I do," said the young man, smiling; "I cannot be so happy elsewhere as I am
                  here."
               "Well, it is love in a cottage now, but soon it will be love in a fine place," she
                  replied; "it is said that variety is the spice of life, but I don't see much of
                  it."
               "But you are about as happy as any one after all," he said.
               "You know better than that," she said; "I might have been as happy as you are, if
                  a man who once pretended to love me had not proved treacherous; if I ever meet him
                  I will have vengeance on him and rid the world of a villain!"
               Upon this she drew forth from her bosom a dagger!
               I was terribly alarmed at this unlooked demonstration, and instinctively seized my
                  lover's arm for protection.
               "Be not alarmed, Ellen," she continued; "this dagger will never injure any one but
                  him; "when he injured me and abandoned me, I placed this weapon in my bosom, where
                  I have worn it ever since, and swore to be revenged, if he ever crossed my
                  path!"
               The woman now grew more calm, and, speaking in a lower tone, continued: "But that
                  was many years ago! Did I possess the means I would have followed him to the ends
                  of the earth and got my revenge. It is said that hell has no fury like a woman's
                  hate; and that bad man would have found it so if I could have found him; but no
                  matter!"
               She replaced the dagger in her bosom, and appeared much better for expression
                  herself.
               I was glad to see her cool down;  she had made feel nervous by her
                     furious gestures and wild speaking. I needed
                     repose; for the play I had witnessed and
                  the mysterious actions of the girl at the theatre had affected
                  my nerves.
               The woman now left the room.
               "She is a strange woman!" I said.
               "Yes; but she possesses a good heart," he said, leaning his
                  head upon my shoulder.
               Soon he took his leave, and I retired my bed; but not to sleep.
                     Thoughts would press themselves upon me, and
                     I could not shake them off. At length I fell
                  asleep, and dreamed of my youthful, happy days, when I
                  strolled, an innocent girl, upon the banks of the
                     Androscoggin, listening to my good mother's kind
                     admonitions.
               But I must on with my life-history. Several days had passed,
                  but nothing moment had happened; at least, nothing worth
                  relating.
               Wishing to see and hear further from the girl I had seen in the
                  theatre, I had written to her, telling her where she
                     could find me, and desiring her to call; but
                     she did not make her appearance.
               This struck me as being very strange, and I began to think that
                  she had not received my letter.
               The woman knew when I wrote, and offered to put my letter into
                  the post office, as she was going by it. As I
                     did not know where the office was, I gave
                     her the letter; and whether she had put
                     the letter into the post office or not,
                     became quite a question in my own mind.
               I was somewhat suspicious that the letter never reached the
                  girl; and concluded that the woman had never sent
                     it.
               
               So one morning I spoke to her about the missing letter. This
                  was some days after I had given her the letter to put the post
                  office.
               "You are sure you put the letter into the post office, are you?" I asked.
               "Certainly I am," she replied, looking sharply at me.
               I plainly saw guilt in her countenance; yet I feared I might be doing her
                  injustice.
               "I suppose you did; but it is strange I have received no answer to it."
               "Then you expected an answer, did you?" she asked.
               "I did; and it is strange I have not received one."
               "It will come before long, no doubt; did the letter contain anything very
                  important?"
               "No; but I wished to hear from her. It is very strange that I have not heard."
               And this was all the satisfaction I got from her about the letter.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               More Developments. The Power of Love. Time Passes, &c.
               I know not what occurred in Turner's household after I left; that there was
                  trouble is not to be questioned. There is no doubt the wife of this wicked man had
                  seen much trouble of this kind before I visited the house, for she bore the marks
                  of it upon her countenance.
               Such husbands kill their wives by degrees, by inches; but the probability is
                  Turner never was so completely cornered as on that occasion. His evil deeds were
                  exposed to his injured family in such a clear light that there was no room left
                  for doubt.
               Shrewd as he was and self possessed, he could not find any excuse for his
                  outrageous conduct towards me; and during my presence he did not attempt it. For
                  the time being he seemed to be bewildered, and knew not what to say or what to do.
                  His conscience, if he had any, must have smote him severely. Such an exposure
                  before his wife and daughters was a terrible blow to his pride, if any was
                  left.
               When I returned to my boarding house after the interview with Turner, Madame
                  Tetford manifested great curiosity to learn the result; but instead of inquiring
                  of me she learned all the facts from Augustus Fairchild, with whom she was on very
                  intimate terms, the basis of which I knew not at that time; for I was ignorant of
                  her real character.
               Augustus remained until quite late in the evening; but I will give him the credit
                  for not offering me a single insult. He was young, not over twenty-two years of
                  age, and was much less reckless than an old libertine-like James Turner. Besides,
                  he was really smitten with my personal beauty, which produced upon him an effect
                  somewhat more elevated and refined than mere passion, such as controlled the
                  conduct of him who enticed me away to this city. I had him completely in my power;
                  but I did not then know it. True, Madame Tetford often told me so; but yet I did
                  not fully comprehend my real power.
               Augustus Fairchild was unremitting in his exertions to please me. He lavished
                  money upon me, and furnished me a splendid wardrobe. I had many rich and costly
                  dresses, and my appearance in that great thoroughfare, Broadway, of which New
                  Yorkers are so proud, never failed to attract an unusual share of attraction, not
                  only from the men, but also from the women.
               Such attentions flattered my vanity, and I began to feel as if I were creating
                  quite a sensation in the city.
               All this display was made at the expense of Augustus Fairchild. I knew nothing
                  about the value of money, and spent it freely. He seemed to give it as freely as I
                  expended it. Never having known what it was to earn money, he, too, was ignorant
                  of its value. So between us both, we made it fly right and left; but he had an
                  abundance of it, and never knew what it was to want, and never expected to.
               The very name of marriage had no pleasant
                  sounds for my ears. And no wonder there was no music in the word since it had
                  proved so disastrous to me.
               Some few weeks after I had created such a sensation at Turner's house, I met him
                  in Broadway; I was accompanied by my devoted lover, Augustus Fairchild. As I
                  passed him I carried my head very high, and said, "Villain!"
               He started at the word, but did not recognize me until I spoke, when he looked me
                  in the face, his eyes dropped, and we passed on.
               Turner's wife had left him, and his eldest daughter. I rejoiced at that; she ought
                  to have left him years before, as many wives ought to leave their husbands, and
                  probably would if they knew their true characters.
               I did not remain at Madame Tetford's but a few weeks. My devoted Augustus provided
                  another and much more splendid house, where I had every luxury money could
                  purchase. Alas! that I should have so forgotten my mother and the lessons she so
                  earnestly taught me! I did in a great degree forget them amidst the splendors and
                  luxuries of my new life; and yet occasionally they would rush into my mind with
                  much force, but did not long remain; for my mind was too much occupied with other
                  things to give them a lodgment.
               Augustus revealed to me the true character of Madame Tetford, but not until some
                  time after I had left her house. Mercenary motives altogether controlled her
                  movements. It was money that turned her from Turner and induced her to take sides
                  with Fairchild; for he gave her a large sum to get me away from the heartless
                  Turner. She was at the bottom of the enterprise, if such it can be called, and
                  laid all the plans. And yet Turner knew it not. She was an artful, shrewd woman,
                  and managed most adroitly.
               It is well for girls from the country to be on their guard against such a class of
                  women as this pretended widow represents. They are more numerous in the city than
                  many dream of, and multiply as the city increases in wealth and
                  population.
               In less than six months after I exposed Turner at his own house, his poor wife
                  troubles were ended, and life's fitful fever was over—she had become a tenant
                     of that "narrow house appointed for all
                     the living."
               After her death he became more desperate, drank freely, gambled, and
                     lost his property. Finally he became a street drunkard, and
                  died of delirium tremens. No tears were shed over his grave. His daughter had left
                  the city, and did not attend his funeral.
               All this happened in less than two years from my first acquaintance with him on
                  the banks of the Androscoggin. Even my revenge, which had rankled in my bosom for
                  a long time, could not have brought upon him a worse death than his indulgence of
                  a bad habit inflicted upon him. A most terrible death did he die; and my revenge
                  was satisfied. He had ruined my character, soured me against the world, made me
                  hate the sound of marriage, and driven me into a life of shame—and why should I
                  not feel the spirit of revenge? Why not be pleased with his wretched, untimely
                  end? Such is human nature. Oh, how severe have been my reflections upon the past!
                  How often have I wept tears of the bitterest grief! But let them pass now.
               I have stated that I had almost forgotten my good mother, and driven her warnings
                  and admonitions from my memory; but the desire to see and know my father did not
                  forsake me—it seemed to increase in intensity as years rolled away. Every week I
                  thought of home. Even the splendors of the life which I was living did not abate
                  my desires to see him; but I had no reason to expect such a consummation; for I
                  only knew his name. The watch upon which it was engraved I kept most sacredly, and
                  nothing could have induced me to part with it. I had purchased a costly chain,
                  which I attached to it, and wear them constantly about my person. I prized the
                  relic more than I did the diamonds that hung in my ears or glittered on my bosom,
                  and of those I felt proud.
               My personal beauty attracted great attention from all, especially from both young
                  and old. I was conscious of my power, and my vanity was much puffed up.
               Young Fairchild did not possess a strong intellect, and its cultivation had been
                  much neglected. He was vain as well as myself; but I had complete control over
                  him. No man was ever more proud of a woman than he was of me. It seemed to be the
                  height of his ambition to show me to the fashionable world; and I became so vain
                  that I was willing thus to be shown, and thereby excite the envy of my sex. I was
                  more proud of my wardrobe and my beauty than of anything else. Our life was
                  peaceable, because he cheerfully let me have my own way. If devotion to a woman, a
                  liberal and even extravagant expenditure of money to adorn her person and furnish
                  her with every luxury, and a ministering to her every want be enough to induce her
                  to love a man, I had sufficient cause to love Augustus Fairchild; but I did not
                  love him. The truth is, my first pretended lover made such havoc of the affections
                  of my heart, that I could love no one. The name of love as well as that of
                  marriage had no charms for me.
               My heart had become a garden, whose rank and useless weeds grew luxuriantly and
                  choked out all flowers. It was a place and a desert, in which nothing green and
                  beautiful would take root.
               To wear costly dresses, to be at the height of fashion, to drink wine, to feed on
                  the richest viands, to attend places of amusement, to promenade Broadway and be
                  the observed of all observers was all I desired.
               Such were my aspirations—such my ambition—such my life! It was one continued round
                  of pleasure, in which the higher nature had no part or lot. The intellect was not
                  improved. Reading I cared nothing about. Even novels would not interest me, much
                  less good books. All I read was books of fashion, and all the fine arts that had
                  any interest for me were plates of bonnets and dresses. Such books and pictures
                  constituted my library, and I desired no more intellectual works.
               The large fortune Augustus Fairchild's father worked hard for and left him, was
                  wasting away like dew in the morning sun. Our daily expenses were great, but no
                  account of them was kept. We never dreamed of seeing the end of his fortune. Such
                  a thing never troubled our heads. Although his dividends were large, yet they fall
                  far short of our expenses. Occasionally good dividend paying stocks would be sold
                  to meet our ever increasing wants.
               Thus we continued for months, and soon three years of such life slipped away, and
                  my beauty began to wane, but slowly, however, for my constitution was naturally
                  good and my health excellent. That my personal charms attracted the attention of
                  many men, the reader will have no doubt. Even married gentlemen who move in the
                  upper circles sought after me. It was a pleasure to me to tantalise such, and yet
                  the memory of Turner and his family would occasionally come up and cause me to
                  feel some misgivings. But the most fatal rock on which I made shipwreck was the
                  belief that all men were wicked, and that almost every woman had her price. Such a
                  belief is fraught with great injustice to the race, and one which the abandoned
                  always embrace, and thereby lay the flattering unction to their own souls that
                  they are no worse than others. Hence every man and woman readily find excuses for
                  their follies and their crimes. This is a most fatal mistake—a great error—a
                     monstrous blunder. Let me warn both
                  old and young to avoid such an error. Let them carefully look into their own
                  hearts, and not spend all their time in searching for faults in others. Had I
                  followed such advice as this I should have found more corruption in my own heart
                  than in others. It is true I had been most shamefully used by both sexes, the best
                  affections scattered or corrupted, and my young heart wounded to the core; and yet
                  there was virtue in both sexes and justice in the world. But I would not open my
                  eyes to see it. Clearly do I see now and look upon the world as it is.
               Augustus Fairchild was more faithful to me than I was to him. His heart was never
                  so corrupt as Colonel Beaufort's. Had he been placed in other circumstances and
                  been compelled to work and earn his living by honest industry, he might have been
                  respectable and useful in the world; but being placed in possession of a large
                  fortune at an age the most critical in a young man's life, he had nothing to do
                  but spend money in a round of senseless pleasures.
               His appetite for strong drink increased upon him, and occasionally I warned him of
                  the dangers of indulging too freely. I believe that is the only advice of a moral
                  nature I ever gave him; and that was not prompted by any very good motives on my
                  part. For a long time I could control and keep him within reasonable bounds; but
                  the task grew more and more severe as months passed on.
               The power of alcohol proved stronger than his love for me. Its effects upon his
                  constitution grew more apparent every month. His nervous system became so much
                  damaged that, in the morning before he took his liquor, he trembled in every limb,
                  and exhibited all those marks which distinguish the drunkard from the sober
                  man.
               It was now some six years since I became acquainted with him, and a terrible
                  change had passed over him.
               I began to fear that he might suddenly drop into the grave. We had spent and
                  wasted much the larger portion of his fortune. The jewelry I had possession of
                  amounted to a large sum; for among it were some very valuable diamonds which he
                  had purchased for me at different times; but the larger portion of them were
                  purchased during the first two years of our acquaintance.
               Having money enough at my command all the time, I did not appreciate its real
                  value or think of the future. I could not be accused of possessing a miserly
                  disposition, for I had no love of money. The only value I set upon it was the
                  power to procure me rich dresses and costly jewelry. To hoard it up and keep it as
                  the miser does never occurred to me, or to lay it by for a rainy day formed no
                  part of my economical plans. In fact I had no such plans. It did not occur to me
                  that I should ever be in want of it, and therefore had not plans for the future.
                  At least such was my indifference until a friend suggested to me the propriety of
                  inducing my lover to make his will and give the remaining portion of his property
                  to me.
               The suggestion struck me forcibly, especially as he was fast going down to a
                  drunkard's grave. The subject I pondered upon for several days; and the more I
                  thought of it the more anxious I felt to have the spending of what might remain
                  after his death.
               All at once I seemed to have grown quite miserly, or at any rate my friend made me
                  understand that money was an excellent thing to have on hand in case of
                  emergency.
               How much of his fortune was left I knew not; for I had never given the subject any
                  consideration; and I was entirely ignorant of the amount we expended every month,
                  for no accounts were kept, and 
                     everthing
                     everything
                   went along swimmingly. Thus had we lived.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               A Warning to Young Men.
               Augustus Fairchild's love for the wine cup was, as I said in the preceding
                  chapter, increasing, and the thirst for strong drink had grown upon him. With this
                  vice another one was attached—viz: that of gambling.
               Several gamblers had marked him as their victim.
               One notorious blackleg named Greene had already won from him several hundred
                  dollars.
               I had more than once cautioned him about these fellows; but it seemed to have
                  little effect upon him.
               Greene had studied well the character of young Fairchild, and noticed all the
                  assailable points in him.
               This gambler had become much reduced before he came to the city; but since his
                  arrival in New York he had accumulated some two or three thousand dollars, and was
                  on his way to add very materially to it.
               Young Fairchild had not lost much on the evening we now introduce him to the
                  reader; for Greene had cautioned him not to play for high stakes, for there were
                  many professional blacklegs in the room who would most assuredly cheat him out of
                  his money if he put it up.
               Greene had an accomplice named Wilson, and was in a great degree governed by his
                  advice.
               These two men did not happen to sit at the same table on this occasion, for Wilson
                  did not wish to win much from him directly. He had an accomplice who had arrived
                  in the early part of the evening; the name of this accomplice was Gaylor; this
                  fellow understood his business fully, and was an adept in his profession.
               He and Greene were apparently strangers to each other; and so cunningly and
                  adroitly did they manage that no one suspected them of being associated together,
                  not even a single gambler, who is always upon the lookout for such an association,
                  suspected them, and surely young Fairchild could not, green as he was.
               While Wilson and Greene were drinking together, Gaylor arrived and entered the
                  same saloon and drank a glass of whiskey alone, without even exchanging a nod with
                  his accomplice.
               The young man had not been introduced to him, yet he had seen him several times
                  and noted the peculiarity of his dress; for he wore an unfashionable dress; the
                  truth is, Gaylor did seem like a greenhorn, and made some strange remarks.
               "Who is that fellow with the long-tailed coat, who just took a glass of brandy?"
                  asked Fairchild.
               "That's what I was thinking of," replied Greene; "he was here last night, and he
                  looks to me like a real live Yankee, don't he?"
               "So he does to me," said Fairchild; "I wonder if he has money and knows how to
                  play?"
               "He may have some money, but I very much doubt his skill to play much of a game,"
                  said Greene. "Suppose you ask him to play. I will sit at the same table, and
                  perhaps we can shave him out of a few dollars."
               "Yes, I will," said Fairchild, going into the gambling saloon, followed by
                  Greene.
               Gaylor was standing near a table and looking at several gamblers who were hard at
                  the game and much excited; for there were piles of money before them on the
                  table.
               Young Fairchild approached and touched him on the shoulder.
               Gaylor then turned round and grinned saying:
               "What would you be up to?"
               "What would you say to having a game?" inquired the young man, while Greene stood
                  near him.
               "Well, I don't know, they have sich tarnal great heaps o' money on the table,"
                  said Gaylor, looking at the money piled up before the gamblers, and thrusting his
                  hands into his pantaloon pockets almost
                  up to his elbows; "I'll play a little while, but I haven't got oceans of dollars
                  as these ere fellows have."
               "Never mind; we'll play according to the length of our purses," said
                  Fairchild.
               "Length of purses, eh?" said Gaylor, hauling out a long purse with a few dollars
                  in silver and one gold piece in it; here's a long one, but there ain't much in it;
                  but then I've got a few bills on down east banks that I guess are good."
               "Oh, the bills are good enough," said Fairchild, laughing at the greenhorn, as he
                  supposed Gaylor was. "Come, there's an unoccupied table."
               "I don't care if I take a few games; but don't cheat me," said Gaylor.
               The three sat down and commenced playing, each on his own hook, as Fairchild
                  supposed.
               The young man won a few of the first games, and felt very much encouraged at his
                  success.
               Gaylor appeared to grieve and lament his bad luck. He was afraid he should not
                  have money enough left to get out of the city; but still he kept playing and
                  increasing the stakes.
               After Fairchild won a few games he was in high glee, and urged Gaylor to drink
                  freely. He did appear to drink several glasses, but he contrived to spill it.
               Fairchild became quite high, and began to feel very courageous. They went back to
                  the gaming table, and the luck turned on Gaylor's side, and he won nearly a
                  thousand dollars.
               Wilson appeared quite cool, and told Gaylor he should be happy to meet him the
                  next evening, when he trusted fortune would change.
               Fairchild also challenged him to play another evening. Gaylor consented; because,
                  he said, he had the shinplasters.
               So things went on; and poor Fairchild was rapidly taking the downward track. With
                  all his love for me he would indulge in intoxicating drinks, and would associate
                  with gamblers—a class which fearfully abound in this great metropolis. But I must
                  hurry on; for exciting events are yet to be laid before the reader.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXV.
               A Sad Death. A Change of Feeling. A New Character Introduced.
               "How swiftly, dear Augustus, have six years passed away since we became
                  acquainted!" I said one afternoon while we were riding about the city and calling
                  at some of the shops.
               "Six years!" he repeated; "has it been so long?"
               "Yes; and they have been six happy years," I added; "we have lived high and
                  enjoyed life in good style."
               "But I don't feel so well as I did a year ago," he said, in a trembling voice and
                  with quivering lip.
               "I know you don't, dear Augustus, and I feel exceedingly sorry for it," I replied,
                  taking his hand and gazing into his blood shot eyes and on his bloated face.
               There was a pause in our conversation for a short time, and I felt more pity for
                  him than I ever had before. I did not usually have time for the exercise of such
                  feelings; for life had been one constant whirl with me, and I did not stop to have
                  compassion on any one.
               "It seems to me I grow worse every day," he said, after a pause, during which he
                  seemed to be deeply meditating. "Do you think, Ellen, there is danger of my dying
                  soon?"
               "Oh, I hope not," I replied; "I trust you will live a good while yet. True, life
                  is uncertain; and if you should die who would have your property?"
               That question I asked in a mild and careless a manner as possible; for I did not
                  wish him to know my anxiety in relation to his money affairs.
               He turned his eyes upon me and looked strangely, as if his heart was pressed with
                  peculiar emotions. I began to feel sorry that I asked him the question. At last he
                  spoke with much feeling.
               'Ellen, my money and stocks are very nearly gone; I have some real estate, which
                  is worth twenty thousand dollars, perhaps, and I mortgaged a part of that a few
                  weeks ago. Strange how fast money will go away!"
               "Well, dear Augustus, we have had the good of it," I said, smiling.
               "So we have," he continued, while a faint smile appeared about his purple lips,
                  and he pressed my hands. He loved me still in some degree; but the fires of
                  alcohol had nearly burnt out of his heart all affection, of which there were left
                  some ashes and cinders.
               "You asked me where my property would go if I die," he continued; "I have never
                  thought of that before; but, Ellen, you aught to have it, for you have taken good
                  care of me for a long time."
               "I have tried to do so," I replied; "but I could not possess your property without
                  you made a will."
               "That is true," he said; "I will have one made very soon."
               "You can act your own pleasure about that," I said. "I suppose it would do me as
                  much good as it would any one. But, dear Augustus, if you do make a will I hope
                  you will live many years after making it."
               The above is a part of the conversation we had upon the subject of the will, which
                  was made that very day, or before twelve o'clock that night. Before signing it I
                  gave him some brandy, that his hand might not tremble so as to prevent him from
                  writing his name in his usual style. In less than three months from that time
                  Augustus Fairchild's spirit fled to another world, and the cold earth covered his
                  body.
               I had several offers of marriage after my lover's decease; but I treated them all
                  with sovereign contempt, assuring those who made them that marriage had no charms
                  for me, and that such bonds could never bind me.
               Some gentlemen were very eloquent in pressing their suits, and others made
                  exceedingly fair promises of kindness and strong declarations of love; but I told
                  them I had once gone through the interesting ceremony with a man who had found an
                  ignominious grave, and that I should not subject myself again to such an
                  ordeal.
               Thus I lived for several months after the death of poor Fairchild, and carried a
                  high head.
               Some six months after Fairchild's decease I was walking in Broadway one pleasant
                  afternoon in the month of May. The western sidewalk was thronged with the
                  fashionable and gay of both sexes, but no one in that tide of humanity made a more
                  splendid appearance than the writer of these pages. Possessing a very symmetrical
                  form I was an easy and graceful walker. My form and motions were very similar to
                  my mother's—at least she told me so, and, no doubt, truly. She often said that my
                  face would probably resemble hers when I had seen more years; and my large mirror
                  confirms my mother's opinion every time I looked into it; for well did I remember
                  the features and expression of her face. She was an exceedingly handsome woman,
                  and good as she was beautiful.
               As I was passing up Broadway I met a well dressed, handsome gentleman, who
                  appeared to be about fifty years old. He gave me such a look, so earnest, so
                  intent as made my heart beat; but why I could not tell. It seemed to me at the
                  moment that I never saw such an expression on any man's face before; it really
                  affected my nerves; and my nerves were not easily shaken at that period of my
                  life. I had seen too much of city life to be much frightened at any demonstration
                  that scores of them could make.
               This gentleman passed me a few paces, stopped, turned round, and again gazed upon
                  me. As if by some magic or mesmeric influence I also turned, and our eyes met
                  again. Thus we stood some few paces
                  apart, gazing at each other as if we were spellbound for the moment. I cannot tell
                  why I so intently gazed upon him, for I had never seen him before or any one who
                  resembled him.
               Passing up the steps, trembling and agitated, I placed my hand upon the knob for
                  the purpose of ringing the door bell, when he came across the street in a hurried
                  manner.
               I said to myself at that moment: "He, too, is smitten!"
               No event in my city career thus far affected me so strangely and mysteriously as
                  this.
               My hand was still on the knob, but I did not ring the bell. In fact, I was not
                  even conscious that my hand was thus placed.
               There I stood gazing upon him as he came up, feeling quite sure he meant to
                  approach me. In that I was not mistaken; he came up and said:—
               "Excuse me, madam, for thus accosting you in the street. I have an impression that
                  I have either seen you before or some one whom you, in form and motion, very much
                  resemble."
               "You need make no apology, sir," I replied, in a voice somewhat tremulous.
               "Your voice, too, seems familiar," he said, gazing intently upon me.
               "I have no recollection, sir, of ever having seen you before," I replied. "Will
                  you walk in?"
               "I will, if it is not too bold in me," he answered.
               He came in, and took a seat in my parlor. I took off my bonnet and shawl in
                  another room and soon returned to the parlor.
               He seemed to be a gentleman whose character greatly differed from those I had
                  associated with. There was a gravity in the expression of his handsome face, and a
                  kind of serious tone in his manners, that made me feel as if I was in the presence
                  of a man whose moral power was greater than I had been accustomed to come into
                  contact was. I was dressed in the most fashionable style; but his gravity toned me
                  down; and I appeared far more modest and unassuming than usual.
               "I feel, madam, that I have intruded myself upon you," he said; "but your form and
                  motions were such as not only to excite my curiosity, but also to remind me of the
                  past.
               "No intrusion, sir, I can assure you," I returned. "I am very happy to see you,
                  stranger though you are to me. I feel quite sure you have no intention of doing me
                  harm."
               "I trust and believe you do me no more than justice in your remark," he replied,
                  closely examining my person and watching my movements. "Are your parents
                  living?"
               "My mother is dead, sir."
               "Then your father is living?" he inquired.
               "Heaven only knows!" I said, with feeling.
               There was a pause in the conversation; for we were both occupied by strange
                  thoughts, and hardly knew what to say. His eyes were fastened upon me, and I felt
                  their moral power; for in them there was nothing lascivious—the whole expression
                  of his countenance was serious, and in every line of his face there was a moral
                  force that spoke louder than words.
               "You may be surprised at my answer to your question," I continued, after a few
                  moments' silence; "but, sir, to be frank, and willing to explain myself, I may say
                  I am the daughter of no one; for such the laws of our country consider and treat
                  me."
               He made no reply; but seemed to be wrapped in thought. At length he said: "I think
                  I understand you; and, let me the law is wrong, in my judgment; for birth is a
                  circumstance over which we have no control, and to which no blame can attach."
               "That is true, sir," I said; "and yet the world has a different opinion."
               "May I ask if you were born in this city, madam?"
               "I was born far east of this city!" I replied.
               "In what town or city?" he anxiously inquired.
               "Portland!" I answered, looking him full in the face.
               At the announcement of that word he was silent and thoughtful.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               Interesting Denouement. Happiness. The End.
               While this strange gentleman paused and cast down his eyes, as if he were in deep
                  meditation, I gazed upon him with such emotions as I never felt before. I wondered
                  within myself if these emotions that agitated my heart were the premonitory
                  symptoms of love; but I had no power to solve the problem.
               He appeared to be a much more serious and thoughtful man than any I had been
                  acquainted with; and if I was about to love him, a great change must come over the
                  spirit of my dreams, and my views of life become very different from those which
                  had generally governed me.
               At last, turning his deep blue eyes upon me and looking at me as if he would read
                  my inmost thoughts, he repeated: "Port land!"
               "Have you ever been in Portland?" I anxiously inquired.
               "Not for many years," he replied; "have you ever visited that place?"
               "I was born there," I answered, watching the workings of his face, and wondering
                  who he could be, and why he sought my company in such a strange, mysterious
                  manner.
               He made no reply, but sat with his eyes fastened upon me in a fixed gaze. There
                  was a magnetic power in his eyes which struck me forcibly; and was it love I felt,
                  or the beginning of that tender passion? I could scarcely believe it was; and yet
                  I did not know. I was really bewildered for a short time, and felt uneasy under
                  his gaze.
               "Do you keep this house alone?" he asked.
               "I do now," I replied, emphasising the last word.
               "Then you have been married, I conclude, and your husband is either dead or gone
                  away," he said, still watching me.
               There was a moral power in the tones of his voice and in the expression of his
                  countenance, that brought the red blood to my cheeks, which he at once noticed,
                  and thought, no doubt, it was a hopeful sign.
               I did not immediately answer him, for the reason that I hardly knew what to
                  say.
               "I do not intend to be impertinent or disrespectful," he continued; "but I wish to
                  ask you another question, if you have no objection."
               "Not the least in the world," I said, feeling some more courage, and looking up
                  into his honest, manly face; "and I will answer it frankly if I know what reply to
                  make, for I believe you have no wish to injure me."
               "Far be it from me to even wound your feelings, and much less to injure you. I am
                  aware that, in great cities like this, there is much iniquity of all kinds."
               "You may well say that," I said.
               "My question is this," he continued: "You say you now keep this house alone; which
                  means that you once had a partner, either male or female; and now do you keep a
                  respectable house?'
               "I frankly answer not as the world counts respectability," I replied.
               "I had that impression," he remarked. "Beauty is sometimes a very dangerous
                  possession—have you not found it so?"
               "Indeed I have, sir," I replied, feeling no offence at his remarks, and really
                  admiring his frankness; "but, sir, permit me to add that beauty would not
                  thus be dangerous if it were not for the bad passions of men
                  and their corrupt hearts."
               "A very proper and just addition to my remark," he said. "I suppose you have
                  suffered from such passions and such hearts."
               "I have, sir," I answered, in a voice that told him how deeply I felt in view of
                  my past life. "And I suffered, too, in spite of a mother's warnings. I received
                  lessons enough from her, if I had heeded them, to guard me against the advances of
                  the worst and vilest men. But, sir, I did not; and here I am as you behold
                  me!"
               "There is hope!" he said. "I notice with great pleasure, from the tones of your
                  voice and the tenor of your remarks, that the best affections of your heart are
                  not all turned into cinders and ashes—there is yet some sparks of goodness left
                  which may be blown into a holy fire upon the altar of your heart. I do not believe
                  all hearts are totally depraved that may seem to be so to the puritanical eye. I
                  have a charity that hopeth much. You must excuse me for thus moralising. The
                  interest I felt when I first saw you in the street must be my apology."
               "That interest seems some what mysterious to me," I added. "What interest did you
                  feel beyond what my beauty inspired. No man has ever felt an interest for me
                  beyond that; and if you do I heartily thank you for it."
               "Will you rise and walk in your own natural way across the room two or three
                  times?" he asked.
               I immediately did as he requested; and he watched my motions narrowly.
               "You say you were born in Portland," he continued, apparently much interested, and
                  intently staring at me. And where did you pass your girlhood?"
               "On the banks of the Androscoggin until I was sixteen years old," I said.
               "Your mother's name?" he quickly demanded.
               "The same I bear—Ellen Holmes," I replied.
               "Oh, God! I thank Thee for this interview!" he exclaimed.
               "Why such an exclamation?" I inquired.
               "I think I was not mistaken, he continued, seeming not to heed my question, but
                  being absorbed in his own peculiar thoughts. "That form, that face, those motions,
                  and that name! It must be so!"
               "What must be so!" I quickly and anxiously inquired, feeling strange emotions, and
                  wondering what he could mean.
               He fastened his eyes upon me, but made no reply.
               I sat uneasy, and my curiosity was excited to the highest pitch. His silence was
                  really oppressive, and I could not bear it longer.
               "Do speak!" I said, hardly knowing what I said.
               "Did you ever see a gold watch your mother owned?" he asked.
               The truth flashed upon me, and immediately I pulled the watch from my bosom and
                  handed it to him.
               He seized it and examined it closely with an expression of countenance I will not
                  undertake to describe.
               "See that name!" he exclaimed, at once opening the watch and pointing to the name
                  engraved upon the case.
               "I have seen it a thousand times," I said. "Yes, I have looked at it this very
                  day. Mother told me but a short time before she died it was my father's name, and
                  most sacredly have I kept the watch containing it."
               He now rose and took me by the hand, saying:
               "Ellen Holmes, that name is mine!"
               "Father!" I exclaimed, throwing my arms around his neck and kissing his manly
                  brow.
               "My own daughter!" he said, pressing me to his beating heart, and thanking God
                  that he had found his child.
               "My own daughter!" Oh, what music in those words! A long cherished desire was now
                  gratified, and I was in the arms of him who was not ashamed to own me as his
                  daughter! That was the happiest moment of my life, and the commencement of a new
                  era in it. Oh, how I hung upon his words as he related to me the story of his
                  life, which had thus far been an eventful one. He was a sea captain, and had
                  visited all parts of the civilized world. The contract of marriage he had never
                  made, and was still a bachelor, and the best looking one I ever saw. At least such
                  was my impression. He was not only an intelligent and honorable man, but what was
                  better still, he was a religious man, and lived in strict accordance with his
                  profession. He had not been in the city six hours before he saw me promenading in
                  Broadway, having just arrived from Europe, and expecting to sail again in a few
                  weeks.
               The emotions which this singular and unexpected interview excited in our hearts I
                  shall not attempt to describe. He was as much gratified with our meeting as I was.
                  There was but one drawback upon his pleasure, and that was the life I had
                  lived.
               He remained with me during his stay in the city, and exerted that moral influence
                  over me which I so much required.
               A new world seemed to open to my view; and such sermons as he preached to me I had
                  never heard before. Their power I could not resist; for they came from him whom I
                  had long desired to see. He entirely changed my course of life, and showed me
                  beauties in the moral world which had never been exhibited to me before.
               The time came when he was to make a voyage to Europe and cross the ocean again. I
                  wished to accompany him, but dared not mention that desire, for I was very careful
                  not to ask him for anything which I was not sure he was willing to grant. It was
                  hard to bear the thought that he was about to leave me, and perhaps forever. I was
                  much troubled; he noticed my uneasiness, and asked me the cause. I frankly told
                  him. Judge of my surprise when he informed me that he did not intend to leave me
                  alone, but to take me with him to foreign countries. He was captain of a noble
                  ship, and we sailed in the month of June. I was then twenty-two years old.
               I was absent from the city of New York six years, and during that time I visited
                  most of the large cities of the old world, and acquired a fund of knowledge I
                  could never have gained from books.
               We returned to New York, and my father said he had made his last voyage, and
                  should pass the remainder of his life in this city.
               He did so pass it; but he did not live many years. The time seemed short to me,
                  although we lived together on sea and land nearly twelve years. He died as the
                  true Christian dies, leaving me much wealth, and, what was still more valuable
                  than gold, a moral influence which never forsook me.
               Again I was left alone in the world, at the age of thirty-four years; but I was
                  then prepared for either life or death. The world of fashion I had entirely
                  forsaken, and had no 
                     desre
                     desire
                   to move in its circles. Other thoughts occupied my mind, and other acts
                  employed my time.
               Being left with an ample fortune, I had the means and the power of doing a world
                  of good in this great city. And I trust I shall be pardoned when I say I had not
                  only the power but also the will to assist those of my own sex who had fallen, and
                  to guard and warn those who were exposed to temptations. In this work I have been
                  engaged ever since my father's death. I have not boasted of my work of benevolence, nor desired that
                  it should be proclaimed through the public press or from the house top to the
                  world. I have been content to work where my labor was most needed, and where I
                  believed the most good could be accomplished without regard to the praise of an
                  admiring world.
               I have restored many who had fallen, and prevented more from falling. Since I
                  first came to this city under the protection of one calling himself Colonel
                  Beaufort, there has been a great increase of population, a great increase of
                  crime, and temptations have been greatly multiplied. Places of amusement have more
                  than quadrupled, and their character by no means improved. Once Broadway was
                  comparatively free from low groggeries, and saloons where well dressed beautiful
                  females 
                     unblushngly
                     unblushingly
                   become waiters, and, with meretricious smiles upon their painted faces,
                  serve strong drinks to thousands of men who ought to be at home with their wives
                  and families. And here, too, many a young man receives his first lesson and takes
                  his first step in crime Let these young men beware of the meretricious smiles and
                  looks of such servant girls, and avoid all such places of amusement which are
                  scattered through the city in frightful numbers. But I must draw these memoirs to
                  a close. I have thus given the outlines of my life and some of its principal
                  incidents in the hope that they may open the eyes of my own sex to the dangers
                  that encompass those who reside in cities.
               Perhaps I was no more wicked by nature than thousands who have been kept from
                  falling by their parents and friends. True, I was in early life, 
                     even even
                     even
                   while in my girlhood, exceedingly ambitious, and it may be quite vain.
                  The first step in crime costs more than the second, and is harder to be taken. I
                  hope my readers will keep a sharp lookout for city anglers who are constantly
                  baiting their hooks with the most tempt-flies in order to catch the beautiful, the
                  innocent and unsuspecting. And truth compels me to say that my own sex are often
                  engaged in the same unholy work, and are quite if not more dangerous than the male
                  anglers; for they better know the weak points, which are first to be attacked.
               If these pages are instrumental in saving one of my own sex from falling, I shall
                  be rewarded for writing them. And surely good mothers may derive some lessons from
                  them which may be of service to them in the care and education of their
                  daughters.
               Libertines may attempt to scorn them; for they expose the arts by which they
                  minister to their own base passions, and bring ruin and disgrace upon the other
                  sex.
               Kind reader, you have the benefit of my sad experience thus far in life; and I
                  trust and believe you will be made thereby more cautious, prudent and
                  sharp-sighted in your intercourse with the world. Let those who have the
                  responsibility of bringing up and educating sons and daughters read these pages,
                  and survey the shoals and quicksands upon which so many have been wrecked.
               I hope to live many years yet, and to work for the good of humanity. For some
                  years this city has been the field of my labors, and I trust it will continue to
                  be many years to come.
               Once I was the pride of Broadway, and excited the admiration of those whom I now
                  have no desire to please. Now I have higher aspirations, and more elevated desires
                  to improve the condition of humanity instead of attracting the gaze of admiring
                  and heartless crowds.
               THE END.
            
         
      
      
         
            
               
                  fellow with a more lenient light, for his victim is not tortured for long, long
                     years before death brings relief, and then he suffers only one death. If I
                     could, I would raise a monument whose pinnacle should overtop the lofty alps,
                     as it pierced the sleeping storm clouds of the sky, above the lowly and
                     uncared-for resting place of the trusting one, who gave all that she held dear
                     on earth, and in return, received shame, poverty, and death. Such a monument
                     would tell of the highest, the noblest, the most God-like feeling in the human
                     breast—honest confidence which was perverted by the base libertine under an
                     assumed guise to his unholy purposes.
                  Aye, more! I would tell of sighs, of tears, of love, of struggles, of resolves,
                     of broken hearts, all of which 
                        preceeded
                        preceded
                      the mighty world-wide sacrifice.
                  The morning dews that trickled the tall, white shaft, would wash away the
                     outcasts guilt, and brand it on the deceiver's brow.
                  Sun beams would linger on the spot, and cast a hale of glorious effulgence
                     around the moulded capitol.
                  The rough edged stars would send their struggling sprays of light, and the old,
                     round moon would bathe the obelisk with heavenly mantle of its own soft
                     radiance.
                  There never was a seducer in this wide world, who did not in time suffer in
                     some manner terribly for the 
                        henious
                        heinous
                      sin; and there never will be one yet, who will not receive his full
                     award.
                  Brand him on the brow—crush him to the earth—lash him sore; but raise his
                     victim up—let the life-drops oozing from her broken heart be stayed—stretch
                     over her an arm of power, and let the dark stain curse her not.
                  But I pause. I conclude my interruption.
                  Nat Sharpcut gazed with a crazy eye upon the corse, and then with a loud cry,
                     he bounded from the bed, and fled from the house.
               
               
                  CHAPTER XXXVIII.
                  THE CHARACTERS DISPOSED OF.—THE CLIFTON FAMILY.—THE APPROACHING END—THE TWO
                     MADMEN.—THE SUDDEN APPARITION IN THE SHAPE OF OLD SOLOMON FLINT.—NAT SHARPCUT
                     TEARS OLD FLINT LIMB FROM LIMB.—THE MADMEN'S LAST FEARFUL
                     STRUGGLE.—CONCLUSION.
                  THE long way has been traveled over, the weary toil is well nigh past; for the
                     shadows are lifting, and the veil is rent through which the interminable end ap
                     pears.
                  We have seen the fate of nearly all of our characters, viz:—Annie and Ellen
                     Flint Warren Flint, Buckskin, Dr. Newton, Alice Wade, Madame Boydon, alias Mrs. Flint, and now only a few more remain of
                     whom we will write. Stella Clifton, Nat Sharpcut, Skid Wade, and Old Solomon
                     Flint.
                  In a lowly, bent figure, with a pale face, languishing blue eyes, and yellow
                     curls we recognize Stella Clifton, seated in the midst of a solemn family, who,
                     however bow calmly to the decrees of fate.
                  It is a cold, bleak November day. For many hours the dun clouds have been
                     wearily driven along, by the infantile exertions of the coming tornado. The
                     trees have shed their green glories to the wintry air, and a sombre gloom
                     overspreads every glad thing. At times the low winds moan fearfully upon the
                     earth, and then anon they expire mournfully through the leafless limbs. Even
                     the very animals stand mute without once chewing their cud; but with a sort of
                     philosophical look seem to be wondering what all this preludes.
                  We are on the highest peak of those stupendous ridges, the Highlands of the
                     Hudson; amid the gray rocks, the towering heights, the yawning chasms, and the
                     lightning rifted oaks. The nameless repose of a death-like silence has settled
                     down upon the almost inaccessible fastnesses.
                  But ha! What is this!
                  
                  On the very summit of the high rock bound peak are two men. They utter no
                     exclamation, but glare at each other with wildly rolling eyes, and as they
                     glare, they advance nearer together.
                  You can discover that they are mad; for their looks, and gestures are not of
                     earth. It is Nat Sharpcut, and Skid Wade. In another moment they will meet, and
                     then a fearful struggle must ensue.
                  But hold! A crackling sound breaks on their ears. They turn and behold an old
                     man. Oh! how old, with long white hair, and tattered clothes, who comes toiling
                     up the craggy steep.
                  They pause. Now he nears them. He stands before them, leaning upon his rude
                     staff, while his body and head quivers tremulously with the pendulous motions
                     of a great old age.
                  "Do you know who I am?" says he, turning to Nat Sharpcut. "I am Solomon Flint.
                     I have come to offer 
                        myslf
                        myself
                      up as the last sacrifice in your fearful revenge. But hold! I will
                     give you my history since the murder of my son. I fled. I sought this very
                     peak, and here I have lived for years, in a deep cave within the earth, whose
                     shelter was 
                        shuned
                        shunned
                      by the wild animals, as being too cold, too damp, too dark; but was a
                     still wilder animal, and that was a God-forsaken, heart-broken, fallen man, who
                     chose it as his abode. And as that man I have lived. My food has been the wild
                     grass, the crawling reptiles, and the dark plumed crow. My drink the stagnant
                     pool—my bed the sharp rocks, and my companions a gnawing conscience, and an
                     everlasting remorse. Peace. I have lost the meaning of the word joy. I might
                     ask if you have it; but ye will answer, No. Happiness. Oh! that I never had.
                     But again hark ye? See you not the storm that is gathering in yon mountain
                     chasms?—soon it will burst. I always stand here on this spot when the tempest
                     is at its height. I talk to the lightnings. I listen to the thunders, and call
                     them my friends. When the night settles down, then I see the pale faces of
                     those whom I have wronged, and again I murder my boy. Oh! they are wild storms,
                     but they are calm when contrasted with the life storms. One wreaks its violence
                     upon the body—the other upon the soul. But have you seen anything of my poor,
                     lost wife? My children are gone—but my wife?"
                  "Dead!" yells Nat 
                        Sharcut
                        Sharpcut
                     .
                  "Dead!" echoes the old man, and his head falls lower down upon his breast.
                  "Yes! she's dead and you must follow!" roars the infuriated lunatic, "I am mad
                     now! Ha! ha! The devil brought me here! The fiends name was Wade There he
                     stands, see his big eyes. But I am mad! mad! Ha! ha!"
                  Now he springs upon the old man, he stifles his faint cries, he twists his head
                     around, and around, he raises the body up in the air, and dashes it again, and
                     again upon the jagged rocks, until there is nothing left, but a disshapen,
                     mangled mass, with stray white hairs dabbled in blood, torn limbs, fragments of
                     flesh, and thick coagulations of gore,
                  Even the stones, and ground around, is bespattered with the crimson tide.
                  He continues to wreak his rage upon the body, and he tears it apart piece-meal,
                     by piece-meal.
                  Now he raises his crimson hands upward, and turns toward his mad foe, who, with
                     folded arms is calmly awaiting his approach, after the termination of the scene
                     just enacted.
                  Nat Sharpcut exclaims, "I have blood upon my hands—red, rich, old blood; and I
                     am mad; a thousand times madder than you are, if you are the devil. You have
                     always triumphed over me before this, but now, I will triumph over you, for I
                     am strong—strong. Ha! ha! ha! mad! Ha! ha!"
                  As the words break the silence around, they come together with a spasmodic
                     crash. Their limbs were immediately tied together in a gordian knot; their hot
                     breaths commingle; their livid eyes shoot forth strange glares; deep, guttural
                     sounds come from their throats, and their forms quiver in every joint, with the
                     "mightiness" of the rencontre.
                  They near the edge of the yawning precipice, which is so high, that the tall
                     pines below, seem like pigmy dots, so high that the great river below looks
                     like a little brook; so high that the dark birds, venture not up, and the air
                     grows thin, and cold.
                  But they heed it not, and now as they tremble on the very verge of the chasm,
                     the tornado of the storm breaks around them, and a quick, panting voice, breaks
                     forth.
                  "Emma Lee! you are here! you are hovering in the mid air! By Heavens he is too
                     strong for me! Emma—"
                  "Ha! ha!" answered another laugh, and they disappear.
                  Then far down below is mingled the wild cries of the combatants. Now comes a
                     soft, gushing sound, as if some substance has lodged in the branches of
                     projecting trees. All is still, for even the storm is hushed for a time.
                  But now again the whirlwinds of the mighty tempest sweep shriekingly over the
                     blood stained ridge, while the red, electrical flash buries itself deep into
                     the bowels of the earth below; if equalling, not excelling the mad, stormy
                     passions of fallen man.
               
            
            
               
               Saul Sabberday; or the Idiot Spy. A tale of the men and deeds of '76. By Ned
                  Buntline. Illustrated with several full-page engravings by Darley. The attention
                  of the reader is led to the days of the American Revolution, when deeds of great
                  valor and heroism were enacted. Saul pretends to be an idiot, and by that means
                  gains access to the enemy's camps and reports their doing to American commanders.
                  Saul renders much service in those trying times, and was selected to carry
                  intelligence to Gen. Washington; mounting the horse of the lamented Ethan Allen,
                  he galloped to White Plains to the camp where Washington was giving orders to his
                  Aids. Saul rushed into the presence, and seeing the Commander-in-chief, shouted,
                  "you are a man like other folks!" The chief hastily opened the dispatch and a glad
                  smile illumined his countenance. Saul is then employed on perilous services which
                  he faithfully executes to the perfect satisfaction of Washington, who rewards him.
                  Saul finally marries Luly the untutored child of Emathla, the dread Chief of the
                  Seminoles, but now the fully developed and educated woman of civilized life.
                  Washington is present at the wedding and thanks Saul in the name of a Free
                  Country. Price $025
               The White Wizard; Or the Prophet of the Seminoles. A tale of strange Mystery in
                  the South and North. By Ned Buntline. Six full page engravings from designs by
                  Darley. The reader's attention is called back a period of nearly forty years ago
                  when Spanish pirates and American slavers infested our Southern coasts; when New
                  York Merchants, some of whom now wallow in their gilded mansions in our
                  fashionable streets, were engaged in fitting out vessels to catch "black-birds,"
                  as well as "green ones." The White Wizard is a Caucasian, who is leaving civilized
                  society with his young wife and darling child of two years. They are overtaken by
                  a pirate vessel, which pour shot and canaster at the small yacht upon which is the
                  White Wizard. A shell falls upon the wife and she is killed. Through the aid of
                  some kind fishermen he manages to escape with his little yacht up one of the small
                  rivers on the coast of Florida, where he falls in with a band of Seminoles. After
                  consultation he is accepted by them as their "medicine man" and is named Arpiaka
                  the "White Medicine." They dig a grave for his murdered wife beneath a tall
                  magnolia. He carved upon the tree, as he sighed "Lost, lost, forever!" one
                  word—"IONE." In the morning, his hair, which was a glossy brown, the night before,
                  had been changed to a snowy white!
               "The murderers of my wife, seek my blood, they would rob me of my child!" said
                  Arpiaka.
               "They had better put their hand in the nest of the hooded Cobra than seek my white
                  brother among the Seminoles!" cried Chikika. "We will go half way to meet them!"
                  The child Ona is stolen by one of the fishermen who turns traitor, and taken to
                  Havana to Senor Ribera, who is authorized to pay ten thousand dollars for it.
                  Ribera employs an assassin to kill the fisherman after he departs from Ribera's
                  house, and take half the gold for his trouble and return the balance to Ribera.
                  "He waited for the return of the assassin. He had not long to
                  wait. In a very few minutes that individual came in and emptied
                   the gold upon the table which Pedro, the fisherman,
                  had carried away, as well as other valuables found upon the
                  murdered scamp, who had decidedly met death just when he has
                  consummated  villainy and received his reward." There
                     are hundreds of very beautiful scenes and
                     historical incidents in this book that only such a
                     writer as Buntline could so elegantly portray. Price

               Sea Waif; or the Terror of the Coast. By Ned Buntline.
                  Embellished with ten full pages of illustrations by Darley.
                  This interesting story opens at the commencement of our
                     American Revolution with Sea Waif being engaged, by
                   Phineas Cringle, as the Captain of the Tyrannicide, a privateer. In his
                  first adventure he si a British Sloop of War, which is
                  escorting some half a dozen transports, and captures them all
                     and brings them into port, by which Cringle gets
                     over a hundred thousand dollars prize money.
                     Sea Waif makes the Tyrannicide the terror of 
                  Britishers and after many adventures is taken prisoner. Sea
                  Waif has been picked up while quite a child, by some fishermen
                  off Nantucket Shoals and is adopted by a hermit who names
                     him Edward Sea Waif, because he is a waif of
                     the sea. At the time he is found he floated ashore
                  on an old sea chest, wherein were a number of articles with
                  crests upon them, which finally lead to his identification as
                  Lord Francis Egerton. After being released and exchanged he
                     assumed his position as a peer of the realm, comes back
                     to the land of freedom where he marries Kate,
                     a daughter of old Cringle and returns to
                     England with her. All the characters in this
                     beautiful story have happy lives and it finally winds
                     up with everybody being pleased and satisfied.

               Grossbeak Mansion: A Mystery of New York, by Ned Buntline. Illustrated with eight
                  full page engravings by Darley. The author and the designer of the illustrations
                  have here produced a most interesting and readable book of ninety closely printed
                  pages. This Grossbeak is a retired captain and ship owner, residing in Bleecker
                  street, some twenty years ago—Grossbeak is one of the old-fashioned, jolly sort of
                  Seadogs, who is now enjoying life in a pleasant, rational and charitable manner.
                  Old Levi Martin is a skin-flint merchant and Ship-owner in South
                  street. Young Martin, his son is introduced in the second chapter. He is
                  delineated as one of those free and open hearted sailors, who is full of affection
                  for his profession, as well as the weaker but fairer sex. Old Martin gets married
                  for the second time, during the absence of his son on a voyage to the East Indies.
                  This Mrs. Martin, as the sequel proves is a perfect she-rascal, who
                  with her mother, has inveigled old Martin, in the hopes of either killing him
                  themselves or driving him to suicide, that they may enjoy his property afterwards.
                  Young Martin upon his return from his long voyage, during which, at Calcutta, he
                  was made the Master by the American Consul, asks his father where his sister is;
                  to which the father cannot reply, inasmuch as the machinations of the wife and the
                  mother-in-law, have driven her from her parental home. The daughter, however, has
                  married the object of her choice, her husband dies and leaves her the mother of
                  twins, which she causes to be sent to Mr. Grossbeak, without telling him whose
                  they are, except that the twins are born in honest wedlock. Grossbeak receives
                  them, and with his daughter, a very interesting and beautiful young lady rears
                  them. Grossbeak has two ships left, one of which he places under the command of
                  young Edgar Martin, who makes a great deal of money with her, and he finally
                  marries Lizzie Grossbeak. The sister of Edgar becomes a companion to a lady who
                  purposes making a tour through Europe. On the European travels they meet with many
                  thrilling adventures; are taken captives by Italian Banditti. The leader of the
                  brigands became acquainted with the lady at a large soiree in Paris, and he falls
                  desperately in love with her. He treats her well as a captive, she is attended by
                  the Chief's sisters, and receives the treatment due a lady. The brigand is
                  afterwards surrounded by troops and he is slain and she thereby escapes from him.
                  Finally the whole family meet in New York, and everybody is made happy by the
                  denouement. This is one of Buntlines' happiest tales, and will well repay a
                  perusal. The publisher takes much pleasure in recommending this series of books to
                  the general reader, under the full conviction that they will give general

                  Hathaway; or the Mountain Outlaw. A tale of the Northern
                  Trapping Grounds; by Dr. J. H. Robinson. Beautifully illustrated with eight
                  full-page engravings. The reader is in this highly interesting story given an
                  excellent idea of our American Trappers. Some of them are white men and others of
                  the Indian stamp. The thrilling and exciting adventures of our heroes of the
                  forests of our almost boundless country is so elegantly delineated in this story,
                  that to give even a faint outline of these tales would appear to be a work of
                  supererogation, yet we cannot refrain from telling just a little to
                  give the general reader an idea that he is paying the trifling amount of
                  twenty-five cents for something intrinsically worth ten times the amount in
                  pleasure to himself and to others when he is sated The first scene opens by a
                  trapper discovering that some rascal has been pilfering from his stock of furs,
                  which he supposes are safely stowed in a cul-de-sac in the wilderness. He sets to watch in the night but is
                  unable to discover the thief. While he is on the watch for the pilferers, he
                  discovers five men approach a stream with a burden from which afterwards is seen
                  to arise the form of a lovely young girl. These men tie her up in the covering,
                  and with rocks fastened to the bundle cast it into a river. The trapper springs
                  into the stream, and being a hardy swimmer succeeds in bringing up the body, to
                  which he applies friction and stimulants and restores her to life again. She
                  stretches out her arms, imploring mercy, which the trapper answers in the
                  following strain:
               "You're safe, little woman—you're safe. The wretches have gone, and you are with a
                  man ready to die for you! No more need of asking for mercy, gal; no more clasping
                  of them white hands in despair, no more turnin' of that pale face to heaven!"
               "The girl was assured—she felt, she knew, that she was indeed safe, and seizing
                  the sun-browned hand, kissed it and dropped tears upon it.
               There are very many touching incidents in this work, of trapper habits and
                  adventure. Graphic scenes and beautiful turns, all of which must interest every

                  Darley. This beautiful story opens by the introduction of a Lieutenant of Our
                  Navy, having intimate relations with a highly respectable family in Boston, named
                  Winchester. Ashton is the accepted intended husband of Fluta Winchester, who is
                  entirely loyal to the American Union, while Ashton is a rebel. Ashton resigns his
                  commission in the Navy and succeeds in obtaining the command of a clipper brig
                  from Ichabod Snaggs, another sesesh Scamp. This Snaggs managed to get
                  from Jeff Davis a Letter of Marque, and with that authority, Ashton
                  sails the brig from Boston; endeavoring first to abduct Fluta Winchester on board.
                  The United States Marshal pursues the brig but fails to catch her. She proceeds to
                  sea and meets many adventures. The character of Doctor Umbillicus, the surgeon, is
                  most graphically described in Ned's versatile manner. The reader will

                  Illustrated with six engravings by Darley The reader is taken to a New England
                  village and finds Mr. Drummond on the lookout for the 'Scud' a
                  vessel commanded by Frank Hewlet, a most unmitigated rascal. Hewlett has a wife in
                  New York circumvents the ruin of Betsey Hunt, the daughter of the tavern keeper of
                  the village, and also endeavors to marry Rosalie Drummond. Poor Betsey is induced
                  to come to New York, where the ceremony of a mock marriage is performed. She is
                  then left to her own resources and after being locked up in a brothel in Mercer
                  street, makes her escape and through collusion with Miss Drummond she baffles and
                  exposes Hewlet to his shame. Old Drummond has been an English smuggler, and the
                  facts being known to Hewlet he tries to take advantage of the facts to the
                     disparagement of Drummond, and is finally
                     foiled in all his attempts. Hewlet's conduct exposed he is convicted
                  of Bigamy and serves the state in the capacity of a convict. Rosalie Drummond is
                  proven to be the legitimate heiress to an earldom in England and only the adopted
                  daughter of Drummond. The secret of Drummond the smuggler, is that he is supposed
                  to have murdered the Earl Delorme, (the father of Rosalie) when he had in fact
                  only wounded him. Delorme comes to America and the real son of Drummond marries
                  Rosalie and becomes thereby the heir to the earl's estate and title. The publisher

               Morgan; or the Knight of the Black Flag A strange story, of by-gone times. By Ned
                  Buntline. Illustrated by Darley with ten full size engravings. The author carries
                  the reader to the days of the "Merry Monarch," Charles II, and faithfully pictures
                  some of the persecutions of the Hebrews at that time. Morgan the hero of the plot
                  is a young Welsh nobleman deeply in love with Miriam, a young and beautiful
                  Jewess, the daughter of Solomon, surnamed "Solomon the Jew." The attention of the
                  reader is called to the following extract to show the style of the author in the
                  exciting tale:—
               "Thou art of those who believe that the glories of the Holy City will be yet
                  revived?"
               "It is a part of our creed, Were it not for that hope the doom of the Hebrew were
                  dark, indeed! Persecuted by all men—reviled and hated—they know little of joy on
                  earth!"
               "All men do not hate thy race! Some pity more than they hate."
               "Pity!"
               The jet-black eyes of the Jewess flashed like fire as she echoed this word.
               "Pity!" she cried. "Give us hate and scorn, but not so base a
                  thing as pity! Pity the hound which howls when you scourge him—pity
                  the slave which kisses the hand that smites him; but pity us not, for we yet are
                  proud amid all suffering and all persecution."

               Death Mystery: a Crimson Tale of life in New York. By Ned Buntline. Eight elegant
                  engravings by Darley. This is perhaps one of the most interesting tales ever
                  penned by Buntline. A woman is the leader of a band of murderers and cut-purses;
                  whom she visits in various disguises, so that her own band fail to recognize her.
                  She visits the gambling hells of New York; breaks a number of the Faro Banks,
                  inveigles her betrayer and causes his ruin. She exhibits the most relentless hate,
                  and proves that a neglected woman is the most to be dreaded of all characters. She
                  saves many of her sex from destruction; and finally winds up by causing those who
                  had persecuted her formerly, to meet at her house, which is an elaborate
                  establishment in one of our best localities, and poisoning them with some
                  refreshments, at a ball which she gives for their amusement. Previous to their
                  deaths she informs them who she is, how they spurned her with their persecutions,
                  and she now condemns them to condign punishment. Price $0 25

                  Scotto the Scout; or the Union Rangers. A tale of the Great
                  Rebellion. By Dr. J. H. Robinson. Handsomely illustrated with eight beautiful
                  engravings from designs by Darley. This neat and chaste story
                  gives a number of vivid scenes in the civil war of the United States, under the
                  administration of President Abraham Lincoln. This Scotto is a kind of Spy for the
                  federal forces under that brave man Geo. B. McClellan; and gives much valuable
                  information in reference to the position of the troops in opposition. He passes
                  several times through the confederate army, and while making observations for
                  "home use," meets with many pleasant and some very unpleasant adventures. Scotto
                  is taken prisoner by some of the Black Horse Cavalry and when asked by Beauregard
                  to take the oath of allegiance to the Confederacy, replies in following
                  language:
               "If all the trees in yonder run was men, and all the branches and leaves on 'em
                  was bagonets, and all the grass growin' round 'em was dead-shot rifles, and if all
                  the sun-beams let down from heaven was rebel halters, I swear to ye that I
                  would'nt swear allegiance to your one-horse consarn! You wince, do ye? Prehaps you
                  ain't in the natur' 'o things, dead to condemnation and remorse. Think of what
                  you've lost! You've lost the Revolution; you've lost your history; you've lost the
                  Cowpens; and the memory of the Swamp Fox, and the Santee!"
               There are very many such beautiful and home-thrust in this work, which the author
                  presents to the readers. Price $0 25
               Nightshade; or the Masked Robber of Hounslow Heath. A Romance of the Road. By Dr.
                  J. H. Robinson. This book introduces the reader to many scenes in the life of an
                  English Highwayman in the times when the country was not gridironed over with
                  railroads and traveling after Steam-horses prevalent. As the weary wayfarer
                  travels homeward he is halted on the road by "your money or your life!" But that
                  is in the past. The interest of this story consists in describing so beautifully
                  very many incidents of daring as exercised by the bold and bad men of former times
                  This story is illustrated by nine beautiful engravings from designs by Darley and

               Blanche; or the Lost Diamond. A Tale of the Lights and Shades of London. By
                  Septimus R Urban. Beautifully illustrated with elegant designs by Darley. The
                  opening scene is in the Weaver's Home.
               "Husband—Giles—dear Giles. Oh, say a word to me—to the little ones. God sees as
                  yet, dear Giles, and will send us help. I am not hungry—oh, no, no! and I don't
                  think Mary and Luke are very hungry, dear Giles. They will soon
                  sleep. I will go out and see if—"if I can borrow—"
               "Hush, Emma, hush—no! no! It is not borrow. It is beg—beg. You mean beg."
               Here apparently is a weaver and his poor family in a state of starvation. This is
                  one of the shade pictures. Now for the light one.
               This Giles Hilton becomes possessed of a very valuable diamond which he has given
                  to Mr. Meas the dealer in precious stones, to sell for him, and
                  takes an advance of ten thousand pounds upon it While the diamond is in the
                  possession of the jeweler it is stolen and a false stone put in its 
                     plece
                     place
                  , which is only discovered when Giles calls for more money. He is
                  arrested for changing the stone and trying to defraud the jeweler. He is finally
                  acquitted of the charge by the confession of the actual thief and he is restored
                  to favor. This book abounds in interesting scenes and is recommended with much
                  pleasure to the reader. Price $0 25
               Patriot Cruiser; A Story of the American Revolution. By Sylvanus Cobb, Jr.
                  Illustrated with designs by Darley. This story is printed from good large type and
                  is therefore easily to be read. The opening scenes are during the dark days of the
                  American Revolution, and commence in the year 1775. While a British Naval force
                  was in the harbor of Massachusetts an army was quartered in the good city of
                  Boston. The trouble 
                     aganst
                     against
                   English tyranny was then brewing, and little could be said by either
                  Whig or Tory to each other that was not termed menacing and
                     inflammable.
               "Either the English King must withdraw his troops and concede to the reasonable
                  demands of the colonies, or else—"
               "What?" asked the stranger, as Vincent Gray hesitated.
               "Else the colonies will make their own bargain, even at the point of the bayonet!"
                  This was said in a low, firm tone, which told what the speaker meant; and that it
                  was the sentiment of others besides himself.
               Captain Vincent Gray with a small sloop-rigged fisherman's boat captures an
                  English brigantine, and with that vessel becomes the "Patriot Cruiser." There is
                  much interesting adventure in the cruising of that brigantine under Gray that will
                  pay the reader for its perusal. Price $0 25
               The Sword Maker of the Santee; or Hir, the Hunchback. By Dr. J. H. Robinson. Eight
                  full-page engravings from designs by Darley. This tale opens in South Carolina in
                  the days of the American Revolution. The early scenes open with arrest of an
                  American who for British gold became a tory spy. He is in prison, condemned to die
                  the death of a spy, when he is visited by a loyal young lady to whom he had been
                  engaged to be married, but who, while she pities his unfortunate position,
                  despises him for the part he has taken—that of a Spy on his own countrymen.
                  General Marien is here presented to the reader. This Hirl is a loyal man and makes
                  swords of a superior quality for the Americans. He is humpbacked and deaf, and is
                  almost shot for failing to give the countersign to the sentinel when demanded.
                  There are very many scenes of deep and absorbing interest in
                  this work that will repay the reader for the outlay of money and time required in
                  their perusal. Price $0 25
