            Preface.
            ON looking out upon the ever-changing surface of our beautiful lake, with its
               constant variations of light and shade, it is more easy and natural than original,
               perhaps, to think of it as a type of the thick-coming changes in life's history. Now
               comes a day when it is all calm and serene, without a cloud to reflect itself in its
               clear, blue waters,â€”the next will find it alternately streaked with bright sunshine
               and dark shadows. 
                  "Some days must be dark and rainy,"
                and then all wears a leaden and sombre hue, though even on such there
                  is a beam which at times shoots athwart the gloom and tells of
               brighter days to come, and hints that the sun is yet behind the cloud.
            But, sometimes, when everything seems brightest and fairest, a sudden cloud is wafted
               over the scene, and all is changed in a moment. One of these unexpected shadows
               has darkened the pathway of Cousin Cicely for a time; and besides disconcerting other
               plans, has delayed the publication of the present volume for several months. What is
               in the book the author scarcely knows, as it is a long time since she has looked at
               the MSS.; but remembers that a few months since she was willing to submit it to the
               friends who have looked so kindly upon her former efforts, and is now willing to
               depend upon the judgment of her publishers and other friends.
            The stories are many of them founded on fact; some of them may seem rather trivial.
               The author hopes, however, that they will have the pleasing effect to wile away a few
               unoccupied moments, as they did for herself in their cool position.

               Miss Tod, M.D.;
               OR, A DISEASE OF THE HEART.
               FROM THE PORTFOLIO OF A YOUNG LAWYER.
               THE days of my clerkship were ended; my examination was over; I was admitted;
                  wrote myself "Nehemiah Hubbs, Attorney;" put up my new bright little sign, and in
                  my native village began my professional career. No, I didn't either; I am
                  mistaken; I intended to pursue the honorable practice of the noble
                  profession to which I had dedicated my talents and learning in the place of my
                  birth, but never was truer word penned than the time-honored proverb, "A prophet
                  hath no honor in his own country." I believe if I had remained in the village of
                  Green Briar till my head was white, they would have thought of me as nothing but a
                  boy, and would have feared to trust me. Even after my sign was put up, nobody
                  called me Mr. Hubbs; I was still "Ne" with old and
                  young, and "Ne" I would have remained to this day, had I remained in Green Briar.
               Only one case claimed my attention during the three months of my patient
                  continuance in Green Briar, after being admitted to the bar, and that was the case
                  of an unjustly-impounded pig; "feloniously abstracted, your honor, from the small
                  but secure spot in which my client had trustingly deposited him, and maliciously
                  driven to the public enclosure called a pound, for the vile purpose, doubtless, of
                  compelling my client, in his poverty and destitution, to pay the enormous fee
                  which has been demanded of him, in order to extricate the animal from his
                  unpleasant position, and restore him to the bosom of his family!"
               By this I meant the client's family, the pig having none of his own;
                  it was a figure of speech undoubtedly, the family not inhabiting an
                  Irish cabin; but still it rounded off the period, and sounded well to me, as I
                  repeated over and over again my maiden speech, pacing up and down the floor of my
                  little office. In this, my first case, I was successful so far as to rescue the
                  impounded animal, and save my client from the payment of an unjust demand; but it
                  brought no silver to my pocket, neither, to my surprise, did it seem to bring
                  honor to my name. The eloquence of my speech did not form the theme, as I had
                  fondly hoped it would, of paragraphs in the village paper, or of discussion at the
                  corners of the streets, neither did it bring to my office the rush of clients for
                  which each day I vainly made ready. It was plain that I should never rise to
                  distinction in Green Briar, and so I came to the sudden determination to remove
                  from that pleasant spot and settle in some great city, where nobody knew or had
                  ever heard of me; where, above all, there was not a soul to call me "Ne."
               Here I was more successful, and soon had the opportunity of forming a very
                  advantageous partner ship; business increased; money began to come in slowly at
                  first, but, after a time, more plentifully, and all things seemed prosperous in my
                  outward circumstances. But, alas! as we are so often told poetically, there is no
                  sweet without its bitter, no rose without its thorn; and trouble came to me in the
                  shape of disease, insidious and slow in its approaches at first, long feared and
                  suspected, but at length betraying itself so plainly, that I could blind myself no
                  longer to the truth.
               Yes! I was without doubt a victim of disease of the heart; not metaphorically,
                  dear reader, for never had that organ beat with a quicker pulsation at the approach of mortal woman. So far as the
                  gentler sex was concerned I was a perfect stoic; but that there was
                     organic disease about my heart I could not doubt, and if ever the
                  symptoms disclosed themselves unmistakeably, they did so in my case. There was
                  fluttering, palpitation, irregular action, and at length pain. I could not work;
                  life had lost its zest; the fear of sudden death was ever with me; I could enjoy
                  nothing. If I had anything to leave, or anybody to leave it to, I should have made
                  my will, for I was quite sure now that I should either drop some day lifeless in
                  the street, or that the morning would soon come when the power to rise from my bed
                  would have left me.
               I remained at my boarding-house, and found no comfort in anything but my cigar,
                  and my dread disease grew worse and worse. As yet I had consulted no physician,
                  partly, I think, from the apprehension of having my fears confirmed; but as I sat
                  by my window one day, smoking as vigorously as ever, and gazing abstractedly
                  across the street, my attention was arrested by a modest little sign upon an
                  opposite blind, "C. L. Tod, M. D." While thinking whether or not it would be best
                  to make trial of a physician's skill, a sudden twinge and flutter decided me; yes,
                  I would send for Dr. Tod, and know the worst at once!
               Summoning the only male servant belonging to the establishment, I told him to step
                  across and ask Dr. Tod to come and see me as soon as possible.
               The boy grinned.
               "What are you laughing at?" I asked, "is n't Dr. Tod a good physician?"
               "Oh yes, Sir," he answered. "I believe she is a very good physician, but she
                  hain't never 'tended nobody here."
               "She!" said I to myself, "the boy surely has Welsh blood in his
                  veins, they always she everything."
               The boy soon returned, saying, "The Dr. was n't to home, but I left your name on
                  the slate."
               In the course of the afternoon, as I lay upon the sofa, with my hand pressed upon
                  my head to still its irregular pulsations, there was a soft tap at my door. "Come
                  in," I called out; and to my surprise in came the neatest, brightest, most
                  cheerful looking little woman it had ever been my lot to meet.
               "You sent for me, I believe, Sir?" she said in a quick, brisk, pleasant way.
               "I! no, madam; you are laboring under a mistake."
               "Ah! I beg pardon," said the little woman; "I found on my slate the name of 'Mr.
                  Hubbs, number fourteen, Mrs. Grey's
                  boarding house,' with a request that I would call to see him."
               "Your slate, madam?" I exclaimed, my astonishment increasing every moment. "You
                  surely are not aâ€”"
               "Physician! yes, Sir;" she interrupted, quickly, "I'm a physician; Dr. Tod."
               "Ex-traordinary!" was all I could say; for though I had heard at a distance of the
                  existence of such beings, this was my first introduction to a female practitioner
                  of the Esculapian art. It was rather awkward, but since she had come, I determined
                  to make the best of it, and acquaint the lady-doctor with my case.
               She felt my pulse, asked numerous questions as to my symptoms, and then in her
                  quick, bright way, exclaimed,
               "Nervous! nervous! that's all, depend upon it! excuse me, Sir, but by the air of
                  your room I presume you are much given to smoking."
               I plead guilty.
               "And how many cigars do you usually smoke in a day?"
               "I could not tell; I never counted; as soon as I threw away one I took another,
                  usually."
               "Hum! cigar in your mouth pretty much all the time, eh! Chew, too?"
               Again a reluctant confession was wrung from me.
               "I presume you sit up late, smoking all the time?"
               "Yes, ma'am, smoking and reading."
               "That's it! no disease of the heart at all, Sir; nothing but tobacco; depend upon
                  it, nothing but tobacco; it'll make you fancy anything; it'll drive you crazy if
                  you don't take care. Now will you promise to follow my advice closely, or not? if
                  not, I will take my leave immediately."
               I promised, submissive as a lamb.
               "In the first place, then, throw away all your cigars and tobacco, and promise to
                  buy no more."
               With a sigh given to my sole consolations, I said I would do as she directed.
               Many more directions she gave me, as to diet, exercise, early hours, &c.;
                  perhaps she saw, too, that cheerful companionship was one thing I needed, and so
                  she remained awhile, talking with great glee and spirit, about matters and things
                  in general; and, promising to call and see me the next morning, she left.
               I had not felt so well in a great while, indeed I had not given my heart a
                  thought, since the little woman entered my room.
               The next morning I found myself watching impatiently for the arrival of my little
                  Doctor. She came, bright and cheerful as the day before; what a perfect little sunbeam she was! I could not help
                  growing better under her care, and the influence of her cheering presence, and yet
                  I managed to contrive some ache or pain every day, as an excuse for the
                  continuance of her visits.
               At length I found that my heart, which had long been quiet and apparently free
                  from disease, began to flutter and palpitate again; but I observed it was only
                  when I heard the little woman's tap at my door, or felt her soft fingers on my
                  wrist. In short, as she had driven the disease out of my heart, that little woman
                  herself had walked into it. I could no longer blind myself to the fact; and when
                  she one day told me that I was now off the sick list, and out of her hands, I
                  determined that she should not so easily get out of mine.
               So I told her that as she had now given ease to my heart in one respect, she must
                  not leave me till she had done so in another, or I should be worse off than I was
                  before. The little woman looked perplexed.
               Then I stated my case, and explained my symptoms a second time, showing her the
                  distressed state of my heart, and that she alone could cure it. The former disease
                  she had removed by an occasional visit; the latter could only be cured by her
                  promising ing to come and take up her abode with me, as resident
                     physician. She understood me now, and by the way she pressed her hand on
                  her own little fluttering heart, one would have thought the disease was
                  contagious; and I verily think it was. So now we determined to cure each other,
                  and next week we are both to apply to a clergyman, who is to form between us a
                  life-partnership, as lawyer and physician.
               But one thing troubles me, of which I had not thought till now; that it is
                  necessary to have our card engraved. Married people are usually "Mr. and Mrs.
                  So-and-So," or "Mr. Such-an-one and lady;" but will any one please to
                  be so kind as to tell me, how I and my little wife are to be designated. Will it
                  be "Mr. and Dr. Hubbs," or "Mr. and Mrs. Hubbs, M. D.;" or, as the ladies are
                  going ahead so fast in these days of woman's rights, will I sink into still lesser
                  insignificance, and shall we be "Dr. Tod and gentleman;" or must I
                  drop the name of Hubbs altogether, and become a Tod too? Somebody,
                  please tell me how to have those cards engraved! It is a point that ought to be
                  settled. The ladies are rushing to the pulpit, and even to the bar, very many of
                  them are already in the medical profession, and till a man has made up his mind what position he is to take when he has a
                  minister, or a lawyer, or a Doctor for his wife, let him guard well his heart, and
                  above all, if that organ or any other is diseased, let him beware how he employs a
                  "lady for his leech."

               IT was more than twenty years ago, when railroad travelling was yet quite a
                  novelty in our country, and a very different thing indeed from what it is now,
                  that a respectable looking old man took his seat in the cars, in the lower part of
                  the city of Albany, with a pale, sickly looking little girl of about four or five
                  years of age in his arms. His garb and rustic simplicity of manner, showed him to
                  be a plain farmer; but there was that in his air and appearance which would
                  entitle him to respect anywhere; and everything about him, even the
                  wrinkles in his high, bald forehead, and the rather whining tremor of his voice,
                  told of benevolence and kindness of heart.
               The child seemed a cross, fretful, little thing, and before they had passed over
                  many miles the passengers seated near them were thoroughly tired and out of
                  patience with the perpetual whine and cry of the peevish little creature. Not so
                  the kind old man who held her in his arms. His patience never seemed ed to show the faintest symptom of discouragement,
                  but he was ever trying to soothe and amuse his peevish little charge, though, it
                  must be confessed, with very small success.
               "Now I know what Sissy wants," he said in the kindest tone
                  imaginable; "Sissy wants to sit by the window and see the trees, and the pretty
                  water, and the pretty posies growing up there on the bank."
               "Noâ€”Iâ€”don'tâ€”neither!" whined the child in a fine little voice like
                  the mew of a kitten.
               "Wellâ€”I guess little Sissy wants a nice drink of water, don't she? the whistle's a
                  screechin' now, and we shall stop at a tavern to-rights*
                     and then Sissy shall have a drink."
               
                  
                  *Or, immediately.
               
               "I don't want no drink," said the child impatiently, kicking with her
                  little foot, through whose worn shoe the little bare toes were peeping.
               "Maybe little Sissy feels cold; 'tis a kind of a chill air to-day; will we go and
                  sit by the stove?"
               "Noâ€”I aint cold neither;" was the impatient reply, as if the child
                  was determined not to agree to any of the old gentleman's propositions.
               The cars now stopped at a half-way station between Albany and Schenectady, and
                  here the old man exclaimed,
               "Oh now, see them there little boys with such beautiful ginger-bread;
                     now, I guess we'll find something for Sissy that'll go to the
                  right place."
               With wonderful condescension Sissy consented to take a piece of ginger-bread,
                  though not with a very good grace, and was pretty quiet for a little while; but
                  the lull was of short duration, for the cars were hardly under way again when the
                  discontented little thing began to whine and fret for a drink of water.
               "Well now, I don't know what we can do for Sissy," said the kind old
                  man, "because you see the cars won't stop when we want 'em to. What a mistake
                  little Sissy made that she did n't take a drink of water along back where we
                  stopped. Little Sissy will have to try and be patient till we get to
                     Snactady, and then she shall have a nice
                  drink of water."
               But the exhortation to patience was all lost upon Sissy, who did nothing but whine
                  and cry for water, while the kind old man endeavored in vain to amuse her by
                  telling her stories and pointing out objects along the road.
               "What a wonderful thing parental instinct is!" said one lady to another in the
                  seat next the old man and the child; "who but the father or grandfather of that
                  disagreeable little thing would have borne with her cross humors as he has done
                  ever since we got into the cars; I declare if that was my child, it
                  would do me good to give her a real sound
                  whipping; that's all she wants, depend upon it."
               It was not long before, to the relief of all near her the little girl's head began
                  to nod, and her eye-lids to droop, and, gently laying her little curly head
                  against his rough over-coat, the old man began to hum, in a voice rendered still
                  more tremulous by the shaking of the cars, the good old tune of St. Martin's, and
                  Sissy was soon in a sound slumber.
               At the half-way stopping place a young woman had got into the cars and taken her
                  seat near the old man; soon after the little girl dropped asleep, the young woman
                  looked behind her, and meeting the old man's eye, she immediately changed her seat
                  for one near him, while a mutual and cordial recognition took place between
                  them.
               "Why Betsey Price! is that you to be sure; how do you
                     do!" exclaimed the old man, giving her a most hearty shake of the
                  hand.
               "Well, Deacon Denning! ef it aint good for sore eyes to see you once
                  more," said Betsey; "who'd have thought of lightin' on you down in this part of
                  the world! and how's all the folks to hum?"
               "Pretty smart, thank'ee, Betsey; and how's all your folks gittin' along; and how
                  do ye like keepin' tavern down here?"
               "Oh well, we've never felt rightly to hum, as you may say, since we
                  left the Corners. That was such a real pleasant stand, so nigh the church and the
                  blacksmith's shop, we could see all that was going on. But we've got a lonesome,
                  out-of-the-way kind of place now. How's Aunt Hepsey?"
               "Wellâ€”the old woman's tolerable comfortable; she runs considerable to flesh the
                  last few years, so that she's gittin' a little kind of onwieldy, but
                  I tell her she's a mighty sight spryer'n any of her darters now. The gals don't
                  none of 'em seem to be very healthy."
               "Dew tell! what's the matter of 'em?"
               "Well; Mandy's most always enjoyed poor health; she's got somethin' or nother the
                  matter with her, the doctors thought likely would end in a hip-ail; and Kitiline's
                  had a spell of the tonsils along back; but she seems to be gittin'
                  rather better of that now. The two oldest gals you know is married, and so is
                  Caleb and Silas. Jonas and Hizkiah's the farmers now: they've got so they take the
                  biggest part of the care off my hands."
               "And I suppose all the younger ones is quite growed up by this time."
               "Yes; Samwel, and Carline, and Jeems, has been to school all winter; I always
                  contrived to give all the children a
                  little school larnin' as they was a growin' up."
               "And how's little Hepsey?"
               "Oh! she's a poor miserable little cretur as ever you saw; she haint rightly got
                  the St. Vitus' dance, but we think she's likely for it. She gets a dreadful kind
                  of a yerkin' once't in awhile."
               "Well I'm a puzzlin' my brain to find out who that little thing is you've got in
                  your lap she don't look like none of yourn, anyhow."
               "No, she aint, Betsey. She's a poor little cretur I picked up in the city; her
                  mother lived in a wretched place, that faced right on to the lane of the tavern
                  where I put up. She was a widow woman, and she had three more puny looking little
                  things, and she had to leave them every day to go out for work. It made my heart
                  ache, I tell you, Betsey, to see them poor little creturs, and I could n't satisfy
                  it to my conscience not to offer to the mother to take one of 'em off her hands.
                  She was very willin'; poor soul, and she offered me one of the bigger ones, that
                  she said would soon be a little help; but I thought I'd best leave them to help
                  her, and take the one that looked as if it needed fresh air and
                     hulsome food the most. And she's been a good little
                  cretur; a very good little cretur indeed; she aint a spark of
                  trouble;" and in so saying, Deacon Denning, or "Uncle Caleb," as he was called all
                  the country round, was perfectly sincere and honest, for to do a kind action was
                  never a trouble to him, and the more a fellow-being required his services the
                  greater was his pleasure in aiding him.
               "Well, that beats me!" exclaimed Betsey; "I dew say, there aint many
                  men that's got as big a family as you, that would bother themselves with a strange
                  brat that way. But I might have knowed it, for you always was a doin' jest such
                  kind of things."
               "Well, Betsey, the biggest part of the trouble will fall on Mrs. Denning and the
                  gals, after all; but I'm much mistaken in my old woman after forty-five years
                  pretty close't acquaintance, ef she don't make room in her heart, and at her
                  board, and with a good will too, for the little stranger child that was dying for
                  want of fresh air and good food, in that close place."
               "Don't she seem to fret none?"
               "Wellâ€”she does kind o' pine a leetle, and its nothin' but nateral that she should
                  be a leetle kind o' hum-sick. You know there aint no place, Betsey, like a
                     certin' place, no matter where it is;" said the old man, as if
                  afraid to mention even the word home in the hearing of the little
                  sleeper on his breast.
               "Yes," said Betsey, rolling up her eyes in a sentimental manner, "be it
                     ever so 'umble."
               
               At length there came a prolonged whistle, and Betsey exclaimed,
               "Well, if here aint the inclined plane, and down there's Snactady.
                  What a little time it does take, to be sure. I've hearn tell, Deacon Denning, that
                  they do expect to run some day or another, at the rate of twenty miles an hour;
                  now do you expect that's likely?"
               "Well I can't say, Betsey; stranger things than that's happened, and they do say
                  wonders will never cease. Ef any man had told me, fifty years ago, that I'd live
                  to see the day when I'd ride between Albany and Snactady in little more'n three
                  hours, and without a sign of a livin' horse to draw me, why what do you suppose
                  I'd have said to him, Betsey. Why I believe I'd have told him to go and shut
                  himself up in a lunatic asylum, if there'd a been one round in them days. But the
                  invention of man is a wonderful thing, Betsey."
               "Well, good-bye, Deacon 
                     Deming
                     Denning
                  ," said Betsey, when they parted. "I wish you joy of your bargain there,
                  but I am afraid its the poorest one you ever made yet. Good-bye; give my love to
                  all the folks."
               "As to my bargain, Betsey, never fear," said the old man, hugging the forlorn
                  little creature closely to his breast. "I never made such a bargain as this but I
                  found a blessing in it first or last, though I hope reward aint what I'm a lookin'
                  to. Even if one's own feelin's did n't put 'em up to doin' nothin' of this kind,
                  there's the command, 'Deal thy bread to the hungry, and when thou seest the naked,
                  cover him.'"
               "Yes, Deacon Denning," said Betsey seriously, "and if ever the words, 'Inasmuch as
                  ye did it unto one of the least of these ye have done it unto me,' is said to
                  mortal bein's, I calk'late they'll be said to you and Aunt Hepsey;" and Betsey,
                  after another shake of the hand, turned to go.
               "Look here, Betsey," said the old man calling her back with a mischievous twinkle
                  in his fine gray eyes. "Haint ye got no kind message for me to take to Jonas?"
               "No I thank'ee, Sir," said Betsey drawing up; "I don't send no messages to them
                  that don't expect 'em, nor don't want 'em neither."
               "Jonas would be mighty glad, Betsey."
               "Let him say so then, Deacon Denning. Any way, I aint goin' to be the first to
                  send a message to no man." And Betsey turned and was gone.
               The old man and the little girl next found themselves in the cabin of a canal
                  boat, which, after a delay of some two or three hours, started slowly on its
                  western journey. The child was now more restless than when in the cars, and her whining and fretting were
                  renewed more perseveringly than ever. Many an impatient, vexed glance was cast
                  toward her from eyes raised from a checker-board or an interesting book, and many
                  wondered at the "unaccountable partiality of that foolish old man for his little
                  plague of a grandchild." In vain the old gentleman told little Sissy that "in two
                  or three hours they would be to a village where they would get out of the old
                     canawl boat, and there Hizkiah or Samwel, or some of the boys,
                  would be down with a wagon, or a horse for uncle, and then Sissy should have a
                  nice ride out to the farm."
               And then followed, as Sissy would condescend to listen, numerous and interesting
                  stories of "the lammys and the chickens and the calves," and how "little Sissy
                  should have a lammy and some little chickens of her own," and very minute were the
                  descriptions of the farm and dairy operations in which Sissy should take an active
                  part; but the little girl was tired now and more fretful than ever, and none of
                  these things had charms for her even in the prospect.
               The horn at the stern of the canal boat now set up a doleful attempt at a tune,
                  which was the signal of their approach to a village, and there was "Samwel"
                  waiting, seated on one horse and holding another by the bridle, which was intended
                  for his father, the light wagon having been borrowed as usual by "Squire Harris's
                  folks." Of course "Samwel's" curiosity had to be satisfied as to the little
                  stranger by whom the old man was accompanied, but it was done in very few words in
                  the child's presence; his father telling him that he must wait till evening and
                  little Sissy was asleep, when he would tell the story to the whole family
                  together.
               "I suppose you've been expectin' of me for some days, Samwel," said the old man as
                  they rode slowly along side by side, for Sissy, who was seated before Uncle Caleb
                  on the horse, was frightened and cried if they went faster than a walk.
               "Yes, father, one of us has been down to the village every night for the last
                  three nights with the wagon or the horses. Mother begun to be quite on-easy."
               "Well; I was detained, my son; the man I wanted to see was n't in town after all,
                  and he never got home till yesterday; and you know it did n't seem worth while to
                  take that long journey over twice, so I jest staid and waited for him."
               
               "Do ye see any thing of 'em, Mandy?" asked Aunt Hepsey, who had grown too
                  'unwieldy' to keep going back and forth
                  between her chair and the door; "it's high time," she added, "that they should be
                  here. I really shall begin to feel curis about your father if he aint hum to
                  night."
               "No, mother, I don't see nothin'; why yes I do too! just risin' the
                  hill; two horses, comin' on very slowly down; now they're crossin' the bridge;
                  why, what under the sun! father's certainly got somethin' on before him."
               By this time Aunt Hepsey had reached the kitchen door, and she had "run to flesh
                  so considerable" as entirely to fill up the door-way. Shading her eyes with her
                  hands from the brightness of the setting sun, she watched the horsemen as they
                  came slowly along the road.
               "Well! what has my old man been a deuin' of now I wonder," she exclaimed; "it's a
                  child as sure as I'm alive; a little gal; settin' on the horse before him. This
                  much I'll say, its somethin' right and kind, any way; for if ever any body's heart
                  was in the right place its that same old man's. I should like to know how many's
                  the folks, first and last, that he's taken in, and befriended, and gin a lift to;
                  't would make a long catalogue, any how, ef they was all put together."
               "Now just hear mother talk," says Mandy to Kitiline; "and ef you was to hear
                  father, then the stocking would all be on t' other foot, and you'd think it was
                  all her; he's always a tellin' how many good things
                     mother's done, and how she's always ready to obleege every
                  body."
               "Well, well, girls, I've never had reason to regret a single kind action I've done
                  to a human bein'. But here they come at last; blessin's on the dear old man, and
                  what a poor lookin' little cretur that is he's got on before him. She looks as if
                  she was hungered to death."
               "Well, mother, how d'ye do," called out Uncle Caleb as he rode up to the door;
                  "you see I've brought you a present don't ye. Take care, gals, don't come up to
                  her rough; she's kind of scary. There, there, Sissy, don't cry; uncle
                  will take her down, and Samwel shall take away both the horses, and Sissy shall go
                  into the house with uncle."
               After the joyful greetings were over, and numerous questions had been asked and
                  answered on both sides, the sons and daughters came gathering in, and they all sat
                  down around the bountiful and well-laden tea table. Sissy still clung to uncle,
                  and it seemed to please him well that she did so; and all supper time he sat with
                  her on his knee feeding her from the bowl of bread and milk which stood by the
                  side of his plate.
               
               When the substantial meal was over, all gathered round the large fire of logs in
                  the great kitchen, and a very large half circle they made; poor little Hepsey sat
                  on a low seat in the corner by her father, giving every few moments unmistakable
                  signs of the malady of which the old man had spoken. One by one the different
                  members of the family tried to scrape acquaintance with the little stranger, but
                  she resisted all their advances with the same kind of petulance she had shown all
                  day.
               "Mandy" and "Kitiline" both tried to coax her to their lap, but without success.
                  Then came the next daughter, a bright, rosy-cheeked girl of about twelve years
                  old.
               "She'll come with Carline, I know," said she. "Carline's got such a
                  pretty bed up stairs; Sissy shall sleep there if she likes." But Sissy turned her
                  little sharp face round and hid it under the old man's arm.
               "Let her be, gals, let her be, she shall go to sleep in uncle's arms to-night, and
                  afore long she'll begin to feel to hum with all on ye;" and rocking back and forth
                  on two legs of his chair he again hummed his favorite St. Martin's, and before
                  many minutes the little stranger was oblivious of all around her.
               "She's sound enough now," said the old man; "now, gals, if you will make a little
                  kind of a bed on the settee for her, right on my side of the bed, so she'll see me
                  the first thing when she wakes up in the morning. I shall be right glad to lay her
                  down, for I haint had the little cretur out of my arms since six o'clock this
                  morning."
               "Bring one of Hepsey's night-gowns, Carline," said her mother, "and we'll undress
                  the poor little soul."
               Very gently they slipped off her clothes, the old man assisting with his wrinkled
                  brown hand.
               "La, sakes! how poor she is!" said Mandy; "you can a most see her bones come
                  through her skin; jest stand aside Kitiline and let mother see them shoulder
                  blades; well ef that aint a sight!"
               "Yes," said Uncle Caleb, "and there was three more such poor little creturs; and I
                  tell you as I sot there on the porch of the tavern, and saw them pinched little
                  faces looking out every few minutes to see ef the mother was a comin', it made my
                  heart ache I tell ye. And then when the poor tired cretur came at last the first
                  thing was, 'Mother, have you brought us any bread?' I say, children, when I
                  thought of the abundance there was to hum, thinks I, I calklate ef we take one of
                  them poor little things off the mother's hands, we shan't none of us miss what'll
                  feed and clothe her, and if we do we shan't begrudge it."
               
               "And ye thought right Caleb," said Aunt Hepsey; "I'm certin we'll all do the best
                  we can by the little cretur, and I'm sure I hope she'll soon feel contented and to
                  hum here."
               Little Sissy was laid down without awaking, in a softer and more comfortable bed
                  than her poor little bones had ever rested in before, and as Uncle Caleb was very
                  tired with his long journey, the large family were soon assembled for evening
                  prayer.
               A portion of Scripture was selected by the old man with "judicious care," and then
                  arose the notes of the evening hymn, for Uncle Caleb's family were all good
                  singers; and then all knelt reverently down, and in simple language, untaught save
                  by the inditing spirit, the old man poured forth his thankfulness for favors
                  passed, and his prayer for future blessings. And in the prayer the little stranger
                  was not forgotten, but long and fervent was the supplication that they might each
                  and all acquit themselves well of the new responsibility resting upon them in the
                  care of the little helpless one, and that "this new little inmate in the family
                  might bring a blessing to every one of the household, and be blessed abundantly in
                  return."
               And from that time "little Sissy," or Annie Gay, (it is time the reader should
                  learn our heroine's true name,) was a member of Uncle Caleb's family.
               We have not given a very favorable specimen of little Annie's conduct in our first
                  day's acquaintance with her; but we think all our readers, even if not so
                  benevolently disposed as Uncle Caleb, (and where will you find many such as he?)
                  will be willing to make some allowance for a poor, little, weak, half-starved
                  creature, taken from the only home she had ever known, and going among strangers
                  she knew not where. Annie was not naturally fretful, or of an unpleasant temper;
                  and though shy for a few days, and not willing that "Uncle," as she now called
                  him, should go out of her sight, she soon became interested in the many objects so
                  pleasant to a city child about a large farm, and was willing to go out on some
                  expedition with other members of the family. They were all very kind to her; even
                  the boys were all gentle with "little Sissy," and her heart soon opened to the
                  genial tones of kindness; and, as children will do, she ere long ceased to mourn
                  for the mother and sisters she had left behind in the city, and forgot that she
                  had ever known any other friends but the good farmer's family. And she would
                  probably never have recalled them to mind but for the kindness of "Uncle Caleb,"
                  who sometimes spoke to her of those poverty-tried ones; and when he had an
                  opportunity, sent in Annie's name a present of eggs, or butter, or poultry, to gladden the hearts of those who only
                  by these acts of kindness enjoyed so rich a feast.
               So that Annie, after all, had the pleasant associations connected with her mother
                  and sisters which we always have in connection with those to whom we are enabled
                  to do kindnesses; and the poor hard-working mother and little sisters in the city
                  had only kind and pleasant thoughts of little Annie, who left them so long
                  ago.
               And the roses began to bloom in Annie's cheeks, and the little sharp bones all
                  disappeared, and she was soon as plump and merry a little busybody as you would
                  wish to see coursing over a farm. Everywhere, where people were the busiest, you
                  would see little Annie in the midst of them, and hear her merry laugh. Now in the
                  yard watching the milking of the twenty cows, and occasionally trying to milk a
                  very gentle one herself, though her little hand could only succeed in bringing a
                  few drops; then in the dairy, and nothing would do but she must take hold of the
                  dasher and churn awhile; and no matter how busy the girls were, they would always
                  stand good-naturedly aside and "let her try," knowing that she would very soon get
                  tired out. Sometimes you might see Annie riding on the "stone boat" behind the
                  oxen; sometimes on top of a load of hay, as busy as any body, and fancying she was
                  just as useful in the hayfield.
               In harvest-time she would work all day gathering apples, and then what merry times
                  she had riding round on the beam, when the horse was circling about to crush the
                  apples into cider. She had her own hens and chickens too, and already Uncle Caleb
                  would sometimes let her go to the village with him, and sell her own eggs; and he
                  taught her to save up her money thus earned, and buy sometimes a calico frock for
                  her mother and sisters in the city. Thus early he taught little Annie, as he had
                  always endeavored to teach his own children, by precept, example, and opportunity,
                  the blessedness of giving.
               "Blessin's on the little cretur, how she does flesh up," said Aunt Hepsey; "I only
                  wish our little Hepsey was as hearty and tough as she is. Ef one had
                  made any sacrifice now for that little thing, would n't they be more'n repaid to
                  see how much good the change has done her. But she's never been no trouble at all,
                  no more'n the sunshine's a trouble streamin' in, since the day she first
                  come."
               As Annie grew older, Uncle Caleb determined that she, too, should have some
                  "school larnin'" in the winters; and as all the rest had now got all the
                  "edication" of that kind they were going to have except cept "Jeemes," he and Annie continued to go to
                  school together for three or four winters. Annie said "they were all kind to her
                  at uncle's, but nobody was quite so good to her, except uncle himself, as 'Cousin
                  Jemmy;'" as she always called him. He always drew her all the way to school on his
                  sled, and back again, and the school-house was full a mile and a half from Uncle
                  Caleb's. Indeed "Jeemes" seemed to think Cousin Annie his especial care; and from
                  her childhood up, he was ever ready to obey her slightest wish.
               Annie had a very quick, bright mind, and she made such wonderful proficiency in
                  the simple branches taught in the little red school house, that the master said it
                  was nothing but a pleasure to teach her. It was not long before she was far before
                  "Cousin Jemmy," who had been at school so much longer, and could make herself very
                  useful to him in aiding him in the winter evenings with his sums, which were sore
                  puzzlers to his duller brain.
               "Oh Cousin Annie!" he would exclaim, "how quick you do see through things; now I
                  might have bothered a year over that 'ere sum and I never should have got it
                  alone, and in five minutes you make it all as clear as daylight."
               When Annie was about sixteen years old, a great event happened in her life. Uncle
                  Caleb was going away off to the city of Albany again, on some important business,
                  and he proposed that Annie should accompany him, to renew her acquaintance with
                  her mother and her sisters. Annie had a great deal to do at first; she had a whole
                  churning of her own butter to sell, and some eggs also, and she wanted to buy four
                  nice calico dresses for presents for her mother and sisters; then she had some
                  yarn of her own spinning for them, and with some additions made by different
                  members of the family, Annie was well stocked with presents with which to gladden
                  the hearts of those from whom she had been separated so long.
               Annie's mother did not live in the same place in which Uncle Caleb had first found
                  her. The two older girls were out at service, and one of them, who had learned to
                  write, had written occasionally in answer to Annie's letters to her mother. By one
                  of these letters Annie learned her mother's direction, and found her and the
                  youngest sister, now a girl of about twelve years of age, the tenants of a neat
                  room in a house occupied by other families.
               "Well! and is this our little Annie!" exclaimed the mother; "why how the child has
                  growed to be sure;" as if it was a remarkable circumstance that the height should be altered from the age of five to
                  that of sixteen.
               Very pleasant and gratifying was Annie's short visit, to all parties; the sisters
                  out at service had leave to come home for one afternoon, and a happy party sat
                  round the table well laden by Uncle Caleb and Annie's kindness. "The girls were
                  all very kind," the mother said, "and she did n't have to work near so hard, and
                  she had a much more comfortable time than she used to have; and she laid it all to
                  Deacon Denning's taking Annie."
               "I don't see just how that is, mother," said Annie.
               "Well, dear, though I missed you sadly, it did take one weight off my hands, I
                  can't deny that. There was one less to feed and clothe, and I knew you was better
                  off than with me, and I kind o' took heart agin. Then when the presents began to
                  come down from the country, the girls could be clothed up kind o' decent, and I
                  had the face to take 'em out and try to get places for 'em, for I knew no decent
                  person would take 'em lookin' so poor as they always had done. And then when they
                  began to get a little wages they began to help me a little, and when you remember
                  all the help you and Deacon Denning's give me, Annie, I'm sure you can't deny
                  neither, that all the comfort I have is along of your going there."
               The pleasant visit was over, and Annie accompanied Uncle Caleb back to the
                  farm.
               The next great event was the marriage of "Mandy" and "Kitiline," who were married
                  on the same evening, to two young farmers who had been "makin' up" to them for
                  some time; and Annie saw the great parlor opened for the first time, except for
                  the purpose of sweeping and dusting. There was a great gathering of neighbors and
                  friends far and near, and a pleasant merry-making and abundant feast, and the next
                  day Mandy and Kitiline went off to preside over their own houses and dairies.
               The burden of the work now came upon Caroline and Annie; and Annie began indeed
                  now to repay the care of her kind friends. Aunt Hepsey, who had
                     continued to "run to flesh," was now so "onwieldy" that she seldom
                  left her chair though her hands were never idle, and she knew all that was going
                  on, and gave her directions as minutely as when she was "spryer."
               But "in the midst of life we are in death;" and what was the horror and distress
                  of the family of Uncle Caleb, when the good, kind mother was found one day seated
                  as usual in the great arm-chair, with her knitting in her lap, and her great Bible
                  open on the stand before her; but the eyes, which were still fixed upon the open page, saw the word of promise no
                  longer; those blessed promises were verified to her, before one of her family knew
                  the loss they had sustained.
               Great and bitter was the grief in the farmer's household; the scattered sons and
                  daughters gathered in the old homestead, long the seat of kind and loving
                  intercourse, of innocent merriment and happy fireside gatherings, but never
                  before, in all the many years Deacon Denning had dwelt there, a house of mourning.
                  And neighbors and friends assembled from far and near, to pay respect to the
                  memory of one so long known, and so endeared to all by many acts of kindness and
                  friendship.
               And the great parlor was open again, and parlor, and halls, and kitchen, and
                  piazzas, were filled, and far down on the lawn stood the sympathizing neighbors.
                  The services were opened with the touching words of the fifteenth chapter of the
                  first epistle to the Corinthians, and then the hymn was read: 
                     "Why should we mourn departed friends,"
                  
               
               And the singing-master began the well-known old tune of "China." A few male voices
                  and a very few faltering female voices, joined in; when Annie, remembering that
                  Uncle Caleb had expressed a hope that the music would be full and sweet, calmed
                  herself with a great effort, and at the second verse came in with a full rich
                  tenor. This gave courage to others, and the melody soon filled the house. Then
                  followed a most beautiful and affecting prayer from the beloved minister, and then
                  the mortal remains of Aunt Hepsey were borne from the house, where, for so many
                  years, she had been the kind and hospitable mistress.
               And as is the custom in country places, all followed the body to the
                  grave, the nearest friends standing immediately about the place of sepulture, and
                  the large attending concourse of neighbors as near as convenient. Then all heads
                  were uncovered, while a few words were said by the minister as the body was
                  lowered to its last resting-place; and then the bereaved old man standing at the
                  head of the grave, with his few gray hairs streaming in the breeze, in a feeble
                  and faltering voice expressed his gratitude for the kindness and sympathy of those
                  present, and asked the prayers of the people of God for himself and his afflicted
                  family. And all was over.
               I have only spoken incidentally of Annie's singing. She had a voice of remarkable
                  sweetness and power, and had long been the leader on the female side, in the choir
                  of the church at "the Corners." The new
                  singing-master, Hiram Wilkins, had, from his first coming, showed a marked
                  admiration of Annie, though his attentions were sometimes divided between her and
                  Caroline. Caroline was much pleased with the singing-master, and received his
                  admiration whenever he condescended to bestow it upon her, very graciously; but
                  Annie had taken an unconquerable dislike to him from the very first.
               And this was not to be wondered at. Hiram was a tall, awkward Yankee, with stiff
                  white hair, and a disagreeably familiar manner, which was particularly unpleasant
                  to Annie; for, though only a plain country girl, there was a natural refinement of
                  feeling about her, which kept her mindful of the proprieties of life, especially
                  with the other sex.
               The long and tedious visits of the singing-master were therefore very annoying to
                  Annie, and, when on singing-school nights he came, as he generally did, to tea,
                  she always contrived, if possible, to jump into "Cousin Jemmy's" cutter before the
                  slow singing-master had got out the invitation, which she perceived he was about
                  to give her, to ride to the school-house with him, and then he would look up in
                  astonishment, and exclaim, "Why, how spry ye be, aint ye Annie?" and turning to
                  Caroline, would gladden her heart by an invitation to ride with him.
               This preference for himself made Cousin Jemmy's heart beat with pleasure, but yet
                  he never spoke. The words he so often meant to say, somehow would not come out,
                  and so opportunities passed away, and Annie never thought of James but as the same
                  kind "Cousin Jemmy" who had always been her good, true friend from the time he
                  used to drag her to school on his sled.
               But about a year after Aunt Hepsey's death another visitor began to come pretty
                  frequently to the house in the winter evenings. This was a rich young farmer,
                  named Walter Stewart, who lived three or four miles from Deacon Denning's. He was
                  quite superior to the young men of the neighborhood in manners and appearance, and
                  withal was as full of kindness of heart, almost, as Deacon Denning himself. Walter
                  Stewart was ever ready to do a kind act for any one, and was an universal favorite
                  all the country round. His father had given to Walter a part of his fine farm, and
                  Walter was already putting up a beautiful cottage upon it. His neighbors laughed
                  at him, and asked him where he was going to find a bird for so fine a cage, and
                  Walter laughed back again, and said he thought it wisest to have the cage ready
                  first, and then he would look out for the bird.
               
               Walter had his eye on the bird already; for though he talked and joked with
                  Caroline, his looks were constantly directed towards Annie; and poor James saw all
                  this, as he sat so silent in the chimney-corner; but he did not despond yet, for
                  he saw no signs of Annie's reciprocating the feelings which he did not doubt the
                  young farmer entertained for her.
               One singing-school evening, the singing-master had been there as usual to tea, and
                  the moment tea was over determined to be in time for once. He asked Annie to ride
                  up to the school-house with him. Too kind and gentle to hurt his feelings, Annie
                  consented, though with great repugnance; and when James came up afterwards and
                  said, "Cousin Annie, will you ride with me?" she said so heartily, "Oh Cousin
                  Jemmy, why did n't you ask me before, I've got to ride with the
                  singing-master," that poor James' cheek flushed with pleasure.
               But presently the door opened and Walter Stewart entered, looking so handsome and
                  bright, and when he asked Annie if she would take a seat in his cutter, she merely
                  replied that she was engaged; but when Walter Stewart led Caroline out to his
                  cutter, Annie turned round and gave an impatient stamp with her little foot, and
                  said to herself.
               "That tiresome old singing master! I wish he was down in some of those 'isles of
                  the South' he's forever singing about."
               The singing-master had no intention of taking Annie home, as his boarding-place
                  lay in another direction, and he knew there was room in James Denning's cutter for
                  her. So when Walter Stewart came behind Annie's seat in the school-house, and
                  leaning over asked her if she would ride home with him, Annie could not conceal
                  the sparkle in her eye, though she accepted quietly and with the utmost propriety
                  of manner.
               Poor James had made up his mind he would speak to Annie that night,
                  and when he found that she was going to ride home with Walter Stewart, he was
                  bitterly disappointed. He and Caroline rode home very quickly, and in perfect
                  silence; but Annie was so long in coming, that Uncle Caleb began to think some
                  accident had surely happened to her.
               When at length she came in alone, she looked so bright and happy, that no one
                  could doubt something very pleasant to Annie had happened on the ride home. That
                  evening, before Annie went to bed, she took the opportunity to speak to Uncle
                  Caleb alone, and told him, with many blushes, that "if he had no objections, she
                  had promised to marry Walter Stewart."
               
               The old man put his arm round her and kissing her forehead gave her his fervent
                  blessing, and wished her all the happiness she deserved.
               Early the next morning the news of Annie's engagement spread through the
                  household. Caroline was a little disappointed, and determined that she would
                  encourage the singing-master after all. James went out before breakfast, and did
                  not return. His father and brothers found him at work threshing, and he continued
                  to work as the other boys said, "as if he was on a stent," all the
                  morning.
               When the horn blew for dinner, and the old man said, "Come, boys!" James
                  answered,
               "Thank'ee, father, I believe I don't want no dinner; I'd rather stay out and
                  work."
               The boys said "he must love work better than he used to, if he loved it better
                  than his dinner, for he used to have the credit of playing the best knife and fork
                  of any of 'em."
               "Why, Jeemes?" said his father, waiting a moment behind the rest and looking
                  inquiringly at him; but James had turned his back. The old man thought he heard a
                  sound like a choking sob, and turned and looked at his son again, and now he saw
                  it all, and heaving a deep sigh, and leaving James alone in the barn, he went in
                  to dinner.
               To the astonishment of all except the old man, James did not appear at the
                  tea-table either, but in the evening, after candles were lighted, he came in and
                  seated himself in the darkest corner of the kitchen.
               Walter Stewart came for Annie and she went out with him in his cutter. As she
                  passed James on her way out, she stopped a moment and said:
               "Why, Cousin Jemmy, seems to me I have n't seen you before to day; you must have
                  been uncommonly busy not to come in to meals."
               "Yes, Cousin Annie," said he, mildly and kindly, "I have been very busy."
               The other boys went out, and Caroline was busy about the house, and Hepsey, as
                  usual in the evening, fell asleep in her corner, and her poor, tired body was at
                  rest; when the old man rose and going over to James he laid his hand on his
                  shoulder and said kindly.
               "Jeemes, my son, this has been a disappintment to ye."
               "Oh! don't, father, don't," said James, twisting about in his chair, and covering
                  his face with his hands, while his feelings, pent up all day, burst forth
                  uncontrolled.
               "My son," said the old man, "I wish we'd a know'd this afore; I wish Annie'd a
                  know'd it; she'd a done anything in the
                  world for one of us; though that would a been hard too, if she liked Walter, to
                  wish her to make a sacrifice."
               "Iâ€”don'tâ€”wantâ€”herâ€”toâ€”makeâ€”noâ€”sacrifice, father," sobbed James, "I want her to be
                  happy, but I've been a hopin' for so many years that Annieâ€”" and here James
                  stopped, completely overcome.
               At length, rising and wiping his face, and taking up a light, he said, "Father, I
                  wish I could go away for a spell."
               "Well, my son, there's them rock-apples, and them lady-apples, and them
                  hickory-nuts all barrelled up and ready to go up to town. Jonas was going to take
                  'em, but he'll be mighty glad to git off, because he's had a hankerin' after
                  Betsey Price this long time, and he wants to go down to see her. Now, jest as
                  early in the morning as you choose to git up the team, you may start, and I'll
                  make it all right with Jonas and the rest."
               And so poor James went away for awhile, and when he came back he had acquired such
                  command over his feelings, that Annie never knew the sorrow she had caused
                  him.
               Caroline and the singing-master being both of them a little disappointed at the
                  turn matters had taken, determined to "make it up together;" and as Caroline had
                  no idea of being the last to be married, she hurried her preparations, and in two
                  months from the time of Annie's engagement, Caroline left the homestead as the
                  bride of Hiram Wilkins, and went "to board," and was quite a lady of leisure.
               Annie was now left alone to superintend and assist in all the household work at
                  Uncle Caleb's, and the prospect now seemed that her engagement would be a long
                  one; for of course she could not think of leaving the old man, who had been a
                  father to her, just as her services were most needed by him.
               But one day, when they were alone together, Uncle Caleb introduced the subject by
                  asking Annie "If she wa'n't a thinkin' of gettin' ready to be married? I see
                  Walter's got his cottage all done," said he, "and I suppose he's a waitin' for ye,
                  Annie."
               "Well, he must wait then, uncle," said Annie, "for I cannot think of leaving you
                  now."
               "Oh, yes you can, very soon, Annie," said Uncle Caleb, "for Jonas has jist been a
                  tellin' me, that he expects to bring Betsey Price hum in a week or two as his
                  wife, and a smarter or a more thrifty gal is n't to be found the country through,
                  nor a kinder nuther; and though it'll be a hard thing to part with you, Annie,
                  it's nuther more nor less than is to be expected, and it's all right, my child,
                  it's all right," and the old man turned
                  away quickly, lest Annie should catch sight of the tear-drop that glistened in his
                  eye.
               And so Jonas brought home Betsey to be the old man's house-keeper, and Annie was
                  married to Walter Stewart, and went to live in his pretty cottage. Annie thought
                  it a little strange that her kind Cousin Jemmy could not arrange his business
                  matters so as to be at home at her wedding, but she was too happy to have unkind
                  thoughts of any one just then.
               And now the neighbors began to observe that Uncle Caleb seemed to be depressed and
                  out of spirits, and they said "the changes in his family had made him kind o' dull
                  and down-hearted, and they did n't think he had ever been rightly
                     himself, as you might say, since Aunt Hepsey's death." And as the
                  weeks and months passed on, Uncle Caleb grew more silent and sad, and now Annie
                  noticed that it seemed a hard thing for him even to call up a smile of welcome
                  when she came. Annie was sure there was something more than the neighbors
                  suspected in all this, and so one day, when she went over to the farm, finding
                  poor Hepsey alone in her chimney corner, she sat down by her and said,
               "Hepsey, what is the matter with uncle, do you know?"
               "Well, I don't rightly know," said Hepsey, "be cause father don't say
                  nothin' about it to me nor the boys, but I suspect it's money matters
                  troubles him. Squire Harris has been hanging round here considerable, along back a
                  spell, and from the little I've heard going on when they did n't think nothin'
                  about me, sittin' here, I think he's got father to lend him considerable money.
                  And then the crops has all failed, you know, this year, and I heard father say
                  something to Squire Harris about the mortgage on the farm; and then I think that,
                  some how or nuther, some one's got claims against him growin' out of this
                  business, and I guess they talk of turnin' him out, for I heerd father tell Squire
                  Harris that it was kind o' hard to turn an old man out o' the place where he'd
                  lived so many years; and I heard him say that a thousand dollars was a good deal
                  of money for him to pay all to one't such a bad year as this, and he could n't do
                  it."
               Poor Hepsey, as she sat shaking in her chimney corner, unnoticed, and to all
                  appearances unnoticing, had got a pretty right understanding of the state of
                  matters and things between her father and Squire Harris. The old man's farm had
                  been purchased when land in that part of the country was cheap, and it had
                  originally consisted of several hundred acres. But as the numerous sons and
                  daughters had married, he had given to
                  each of them a certain portion of land, and some stock, and now but about a
                  hundred acres remained around the homestead, which was farmed by Jonas and James,
                  who, with Hepsey, were all that remained now in the homestead of the old
                  gentleman's numerous family. The homestead itself was to descend to the one who
                  remained with the old man till the day of his death.
               It was very hard for one so guileless as Uncle Caleb, to believe evil of any one;
                  and so when his wily neighbor, Squire Harris, came round him with stories of
                  losses, and pressing demands upon him, the old man was easily persuaded to lend
                  him small sums of money at a time, for which Squire Harris readily gave his note,
                  understanding his kind-hearted old creditor well enough to feel assured that he
                  might easily make such representations to him as to cause the time of payment to
                  be indefinitely postponed. But when he came with a story of a great and unexpected
                  pressure upon him which might be relieved only by Uncle Caleb's becoming his
                  security for the sum of a thousand dollars, it took some little time to bring the
                  old man to accede to his wishes. He did not think it right to take such a step
                  without consulting his sons, and yet, knowing their opinion of Squire Harris,
                  which, in his all-embracing charity, he thought rather unjust, he
                  felt reluctant to submit the case to them; and so Squire Harris worked round and
                  round his kind old heart till at length he went away exulting, with the wished-for
                  signature in his pocket.
               As might be expected, and as would have been expected by Uncle Caleb's sons,
                  Squire Harris failed to pay, and the demand came upon Uncle Caleb. Ready money
                  there was none just then, and there was nothing for it but to mortgage the
                  homestead; and, unfortunately, it was mortgaged to a man who had long had an eye
                  upon that cool, shady spot, without any reference to the prohibitions contained in
                  the tenth commandment. The mortgage became due, but crops were poorer and times
                  harder than ever, and it was just after Squire Harris and his friend (the man who
                  had the mortgage) had left, after the latter had given Uncle Caleb warning that he
                  must quit the premises within three days, that Annie rode over and had the
                  conversation with Hepsey, of which we have given the substance.
               The old man, disappointed and on the verge of ruin, finding that his circumstances
                  could no longer be concealed, sent out to the different portions of his once large
                  farm, and collected his sons together to lay before them the state of his
                  circumstances, and to ask their advice as to what was to be done.
               
               In the meantime Annie had mounted her little gray mare, and galloped back to her
                  own cottage; and when Walter came in, he was surprised to find Annie's usually
                  bright face beclouded and bedewed with tears. To his anxious interrogatories,
                  Annie at length answered, by telling him what she had heard about the troubles of
                  the kind old man, who had taken compassion upon her helpless childhood, and had
                  been a father to her so long.
               "If that is all, dry your tears, dear Annie," said Walter. "Some lands left me by
                  my uncle, have sold most advantageously and unexpectedly to me, and I have just
                  received the money. I do not need it much, that is, I can very well put off the
                  improvements I intended to make till next year; and here, Annie," said he, going
                  to his desk and taking out a roll of bills, these are your own, to do what you
                  choose with."
               "Oh Walter!" said Annie, fairly jumping with delight, and bright smiles beaming
                  through the tears with which her cheeks were still wet, "oh, dear Walter, how
                  kind! how very kind! but I fear I shall not be able to persuade uncle to accept so
                  much."
               "Then tell him, Annie, that it gives me the greatest pleasure to do this, to show
                  in some slight degree my gratitude to him for bringing up such a dear little
                  thrifty wife for me."
               Annie soon mounted her little gray mare again, and galloped back to Uncle Caleb's.
                  The sons were all collected there trying to see what, with their united means,
                  could be done towards paying off the mortgage; but the year had been a bad one for
                  all; ready money was hard to get, and the man who held the mortgage was
                  inexorable. He would take no promises, he would not be contented with part
                  payment, he would have the whole now or none.
               Almost breathless with excitement and eagerness, Annie burst into the kitchen, and
                  finding no one there but Hepsey in the corner, and Betsey bustling about, and
                  hearing how all were engaged in the next room, she said,
               "Betsey, will you tell Jonas to say to his father that Annie wishes to speak to
                  him one moment, on business of importance?"
               The old man came immediately out, looking very sad and much broken: Annie
                  whispered in his ear, and placed the roll of money in his hand. When Uncle Caleb
                  really understood that this money was a gift to him, his gratitude for the
                  kindness was altogether too great for expression, but with the tears running down
                  his withered cheeks, he put the money back in Annie's hand, saying,
               "No, no, Annie, my child, my dear child, it is too much! I cannot take all that money from your
                  husband."
               "But you must take it, uncle," said Annie, "for Walter says he has
                  sent it to pay for me."
               "Well, Annie, I always said you was worth your weight in gold, but I'm sure I
                  never expected to be paid for you in bank notes. Thanks be to the Lord for all his
                  mercies, the old man can die under his own roof now. But I did n't care so much
                  for myself after all, Annie; I'm eighty-four years old, child, and I can't expect
                  to see many more suns rise and set, and some of my children would give me a place
                  at their fireside for my few remaining days, and Jonas and Jeemes could shift for
                  themselves. But the one I thought most about was poor Hepsey there; she's got so
                  wonted to that one spot in the chimney-corner, that it would just be taking her to
                  her grave to take her away from it. And when I think who she was named after, and
                  how tender she always was of her, I have a different feelin' for the
                  poor helpless cretur from what I have for any of the rest. Well, Annie, ye have
                  taken a great load from the old man's heart, and I can't never say all the thanks
                  I feel. The Lord make me truly grateful."
               "You don't owe me any thanks, uncle," said Annie, "have n't you all
                  shared with me just like an own daughter and sister in the best you had, and may I
                  not have a daughter's privilege of doing something in return? I'm sure this is the
                  happiest day of my life;" and giving the old man a kiss, Annie
                  mounted her gray mare again, and was off for her home.
               A few more happy years the old man saw in his pleasant home, surrounded by kind
                  and loving children and grand-children, and then in his ninetieth year he came
                  down like a shock of corn fully ripe, and was gathered to his fathers. Poor Hepsey
                  survived him but a week; and then, the first of that large family of sons and
                  daughters, she was laid beside her father and mother in the quiet grave-yard on
                  the hill-side.
               James still continues a bachelor, and lives in the homestead with Jonas and
                  Betsey. And our own dear Annie is just as happy as she deserves to be, in her own
                  beautiful cottage, with a lovely little family growing up around her. She and
                  Walter are beloved and respected by all who know them; their lives are filled up
                  with acts of usefulness and benevolence, and they bid fair to leave behind them a
                  memory as fragrant of all kind and pleasant things, as even Aunt Hepsey and Uncle
                  Caleb themselves.
            
            
               
               The Vermont Cousin.
               "IT is too provoking, is n't it, that father will insist upon
                  inviting that Yankee cousin to come and stay at our house and go to school! I
                  don't see, for my part, how he came to have such countryfied relations but since
                  he has, I should think he might let them stay up among their own green mountains,
                  instead of bringing them down to mortify us in the city with their awkward ways
                  and nasal twang?"
               Thus spoke out Miss Julia Acton to her younger sister Helen, after they had
                  retired to their room one evening, during which the expected arrival of the
                  Vermont Cousin had been one theme of conversation.
               "I am sure I shall have more reason to be mortified than you, Julia," answered
                  Helen, "for I shall have to walk with her to and from school, and of course I
                  cannot conceal from the girls that she is my cousin, and I know they will all
                  ridicule her and make all manner of fun of her. Brother Ned stopped there last
                  year, when he was travelling through New England land, and he says they all say
                  'neow,' and 'abaout,' and 'dew tell,' and I am sure I shall sink if she talks so
                  before the girls."
               "Well I think no one has as much reason to dread her coming as I
                  have," answered Julia, "for what do you think Herbert Ferguson will say when he
                  finds we have such a Yankeefied set of relations; he has such a horror of
                  everything unrefined, I should not wonder if he should desert me altogether, after
                  she comes to the house, rather than be brought into contact with anything so
                  vulgar. He has been more than usually attentive too, lately, and mamma says he is
                  the greatest catch in town."
               "Well, now, I have heard that Herbert Ferguson cares only for intellect; that he
                  thinks nothing of looks in comparison."
               "I can tell you, you are much mistaken, Miss Helen, if you think he has no regard
                  for looks, as you say; if you had only heard some of the things he
                  has said to me lately; but no matter, I won't tell you, I only wish
                  father was n't so obstinate, and mamma is quite as much vexed about it as we are;
                  why! even the servants will laugh at her, I know; Thomas is so excessively
                  genteel."
               "Well, well, it can't be helped. Father feels under great obligations you know to
                  Lucy's father; the brothers all agreed
                  that father should be sent to college, and the others remained at home and worked
                  on the farm and provided the means for his education, and now he thinks he ought
                  to assist them in return. But one thing I would suggest, Miss Jule, and that is,
                  that you have your party over before she comes; of course she will not go out as
                  she is only a school girl, but I know father will insist upon having her in the
                  room, if we have company at home."
               "Well thought of, Helen; let's see, I am engaged every night for a week to come; I
                  certainly cannot get an evening till the latter part of next week; oh! I am so
                  afraid she will come before that time; it will just spoil all my pleasure, and I
                  expected so much."
               The invitations for Miss Julia's party were all sent out, and the extensive
                  preparations were proceeding most swimmingly, when, the very day before that on
                  which the party was to be given, a stage laden with trunks drew up before the door
                  of Mr. Acton's elegant mansion. From this, in the first place, alighted a stout,
                  sun-burnt young farmer, who was immediately followed by a slender girl of about
                  sixteen years of age; this latter being none other than the much dreaded Vermont
                  Cousin.
               "Well, if this is n't a little too much!" exclaimed Miss Julia, who
                  had been drawn to the window by the bustle; "here is a clod-hopper of a
                     man-cousin come too; this is rather more than we bargained for; I
                  declare," she continued, half-crying with vexation, "if that man stays I will
                  pretend I am sick, and countermand the invitations to my party."
               Cousin Arthur Holmes proved to be a very diffident youth, and one dinner among
                  such fine folks as the Actons was all he could stand. He was on his way to Yale
                  College, his uncle having, from his own observation, and from what he had heard of
                  the young man, been convinced that, to keep him laboring upon a farm, without the
                  advantages of education, would be to hide under a bushel a light, which, if
                  trimmed and fed, and suffered to shed its beams, might shine forth for the
                  illumination of its own and future generations. And with this expectation, he
                  sought and gained a willing consent from his elder brother, to his proposed plan
                  of taking the education of Arthur under his care.
               As I said before, Arthur was not at all at ease among his fine relations, who,
                  with the exception of his uncle, took no pains to make him feel so, and therefore,
                  to Miss Julia's great relief, he took his departure, that same evening, for New
                  Haven.
               Cousin Lucyâ€”but I am afraid you will set her down as ugly, if I simply describe
                  her features, and she is such a favorite
                  of mine that I could wish her to make a favorable impression upon my readers from
                  the first. Now I cannot deny that Lucy had bright auburn hair; Julia called it
                     red, but then Julia was, not always good-natured, and did not
                     always adhere as closely to the truth as she might. Lucy's nose
                  was slightly inclined to turn up at the point, and her complexion was one of those
                  exceedingly fair ones which easily freckle; but she had a pair of the loveliest
                  laughing, deep blue eyes, and the sweetest smile, and the most brilliant teeth,
                  and when she spoke or smiled (and she seldom did one without the other), there was
                  a charm about her whole face, which made you forget hair, and nose, and freckles,
                  and you only looked upon it as a face to love.
               True, she had what Julia called a "Yankee twang," and she was not dressed in the
                  height of the latest fashion, but in spite of these draw-backs, you loved her
                  still; at least, some people did. There was a great deal more about Cousin Lucy,
                  too, to call for respect and admiration; but this will all come out in time.
               As she was, she had come, and now she must appear at the party, and
                  be introduced as the cousin of the Miss Actons. It was mortifyingâ€”it was
                  distressingâ€”but there was no help for it now.
               The evening of the party proved clear and bright, and as it was well known that
                  the entertainment at the Actons would be one of the most brilliant of the season,
                  none of the invited, who could possibly get there, remained absent. By ten o'clock
                  the brilliantly-lighted rooms were well filled. Cousin Lucy, simply attired in
                  white cambric, (for she had rejected the ornaments and other embellishments with
                  which her cousins, for their own sakes, would have adorned her,) sat alone in one
                  corner of the sofa. She was introduced to very few; she did not look in the least
                     neglected, however, but sat in unaffected enjoyment of the new and
                  brilliant scene.
               An hour after the other guests were all assembled, sauntered in leisurely as if
                  for a call, with his hat under his arm, and his slight little cane in his hand, an
                  exquisite of the first water, rejoicing in the euphonious name of Mr. Meredith
                  Fitz-Henry. This is one of those brilliant youths, whose whole time during
                     his day, which begins perhaps at twelve o'clock, is spent in
                  lounging in saloons, studying the fashions, sauntering up and down Broadway, and
                  staring at the ladies, or driving on the fashionable thoroughfares; and in the
                  evening dressing for public entertainments, and attending them. He aims at being 
                     "The glass of fashion, and the mould of form,"
                  
                   and has no higher ambition in life, than
                  to be studied and copied as the perfection of dress. He fancies himself a Beau
                  Brummel as to manners, a Count D'Orsay in point of beauty and grace. He may be
                  handsome,â€”we cannot tell,â€”for the immense amount of hair about his face renders it
                  impossible to distinguish any feature, except a pair of great round light eyes,
                  and a sharp and very effeminate nose. Occasionally he condescends to smile, and
                  then his white teeth gleam through the mass of hair surrounding the lower part of
                  his face, like lightning from a dark cloud.
               Mr. Meredith Fitz-Henry, unfortunately, sets up for a wit, and his silly speeches
                  are laughed at, and repeated by sillier young ladies, till he is really deluded
                  into the belief that they are worth repetition.
               On entering Mr. Acton's parlor, Mr. Meredith Fitz-Henry, with his glass fixed in
                  his eye stared about him with great nonchalance and impudence, till at length his
                  attention was attracted by the Vermont cousin, sitting so quietly in her corner,
                  utterly unconscious of his observation.
               "Ah! what vision of loveliness and grace is that I see before me!" he exclaimed to
                  Miss Laura Wilton, a very young lady, enjoying her first winter out.
               This brilliant speech was greeted with the usual titter by the young lady, who was
                  exceedingly flattered by even this mark of attention from the perfumed and
                  bewhiskered exquisite.
               "Oh, that is a country cousin of the Actons, from Vermont; a farmer's daughter,
                  excessively verdant, I assure you," answered the young lady.
               "From Varmount, is she? ah, well! I suppose I must pay Varmount a
                  little attention; I wonder who will lay me under everlasting obligations by giving
                  me an introduction to so fair a creature."
               "Oh, I will introduce you," answered Miss Laura in great glee, and
                  then by signs she telegraphed those near her to draw up to the sofa, as great fun
                  might be expected. Gradually the crowd thickened in that part of the room, all
                  pretending to be engaged about something else, but all eager to hear the witty
                  Meredith Fitz-Henry quiz the Vermont Cousin.
               Herbert Ferguson sat quietly looking over a book of plates at a table near the
                  sofa, on which, the introduction having now taken place in due form, the perfumed
                  exquisite threw himself with his head thrown back, and his delicate little shining
                  boots thrust out, determined to show himself off to his admirers, and have some
                  fun out of the unsuspicious country girl.
               "Ahem! lately arrived, I believe," said Mr. Fitz-Henry.
               
               "Yes, sir, I came yesterday," answered Lucy, very simply.
               A few more questions were asked, to which Lucy replied in a perfectly gentle and
                  lady-like manner, thinking all the time that she was conversing with a very
                  soft-pated coxcomb, but being too good-natured to let him see how great a fool she
                  thought him. At length the exquisite remarked:
               "Everything's very green up there in Varmount, aint it?"
               This witticism was followed by such a simultaneous giggle, that Lucy, casting her
                  eyes quickly round on the group before her, and seeing the look of eager
                  expectation on almost every face, understood at once that the silly fop at her
                  side was intending to make a butt of her, for the amusement of the
                  by-standers; brightening up at once, she began to take an interest in the
                  conversation, and replied:
               "Oh yes, we have green things there, but if I am not mistaken I have seen greener
                  ones already since I came to the city."
               "No! dew tell!" said the unsuspicious dandy, imitating Lucy's tone of voice;
                  "how's wheat now?"
               "Well, wheat's poor," said Lucy, apparently with much interest.
               "La! is it now, what a pity! what's the matter of it?"
               "Why they say it all runs to beard this year, and when that is the
                  case there is little or no head, and if there is, it has n't anything
                  in it."
               A few laughed heartily now, who had not laughed before, and Herbert Ferguson,
                  laying down his book, fixed his eyes on the Vermont Cousin, as if he expected some
                  real amusement.
               The young fop fidgeted, and turned red, and tapped his little boot with his cane,
                  and laughed a silly laugh, as if he did not know just what to make of the girl,
                  and then said,
               "Now I suppose you mean to grace the theatre and the opera with your presence,
                  don't you?"
               No, Lucy said, she thought not.
               "La! now why not; but perhaps your ma does n't approve of your going to such
                  wicked places."
               "My parents did say they thought I had better not have my mind distracted by such
                  amusements, especially while I was at school."
               "Well, it is bad for the mind; I found it so, and my pa had to prohibit my going
                  to such places at all."
               Here came a perfect shriek of delight from Mr. Fitz-Henry's admirers.
               "Ah!" answered Lucy, "I should have thought that you were perfectly safe from any
                  danger of that kind; did you ever attend a menagerie?"
               
               "No, my pa won't let me go there, either; he keeps me very close."
               Excessive delight on the part of Mr. Fitz-Henry's friends.
               "Oh now," said Lucy, in a patronizing tone, "I should n't think that
                  would hurt you. We had a very fine one through our place this fall, and I was
                  perfectly delighted with it."
               "No, dew tell! now what did you see?" asked the dandy.
               "Why I saw a baboon dressed up like a man, a regular fop
                  you know, and really," said she, screwing up her eyes, and looking at Mr. Meredith
                  Fitz-Henry from head to foot, "really, the likeness was so perfect that I should
                  hardly have been able to tell which was which; it was really perfect,
                  dress, cane, eye-glass and all; but I never imagined that one of the first
                  exhibitions I should see on my arrival in New York would be that of
                     man endeavoring to see how much he could look and act like a
                  baboon."
               The room now fairly rang with shouts and screams of laughter, and as soon as he
                  could be heard, Herbert Ferguson, who had enjoyed the whole thing mightily, called
                  out,
               "Now, Fitz-Henry, you had better beat a retreat as soon as possible, for you are
                  only getting deeper and deeper into trouble." And the discomfited young coxcomb,
                  who had just begun to perceive that he was caught in his own trap, muttered
                  something about "another engagement" and sneaked off, all that could be seen of
                  his face being of the deepest crimson. From that time the Vermont Cousin was quite
                  safe from his attacks; indeed he seemed so thoroughly uneasy in her presence, that
                  if she ever came on the same side of the room, which she sometimes did on purpose
                  to tease him, he always found some excuse for changing his seat.
               "Why, Lucy! you were rather hard on that poor young man to-night," said Mr. Acton
                  to his niece, after the company had retired; "and it must have come the harder,
                  because he is accustomed to nothing but adulation from our wise young ladies."
               "Well, uncle, all I can say is he brought it upon himself; it is very unpleasant
                  in me to hurt the feelings of any one, and I was perfectly civil to that young
                  man, though it was something of a piece of self-denial to talk to such a poor
                  creature, till I found that it was his aim to hold me up to ridicule as an
                  unsophisticated country girl. I thought it only fair to turn his own weapons
                  against him."
               "I think so too, Lucy, and I rather think it is the last time any one here will
                  attempt to quiz you."
               
               Helen Acton and Lucy Holmes began school together the next term, at one of the
                  first schools in the city, and it was not long before those who had Lucy's
                  education under their care, became convinced that in the Vermont young lady they
                  had no ordinary mind to deal with. She came really to acquire
                     knowledge, while most of the girls in the classes with her, looked
                  upon their school life as a sort of ordeal through which it was necessary to pass,
                  before they could come out as young ladies; and spent their time in novel-reading,
                  trusting to chance, or cheating, for the manner in which
                  they should acquit themselves in the class.
               Lucy applied herself intensely, and soon outstripped all in her classes, and was
                  obliged to go on with her studies by herself. At every examination she was the
                  observed of all observersâ€”excelling in every branch of study, and taking the first
                  prizes in every department; her compositions, in particular, were regarded as
                  master-pieces, and in short Lucy was the pride of the school.
               During the two years of her life in New York, her manners too had acquired a
                  polish only given by association with people of refinement, and even Julia now was
                  proud to introduce "her cousin, Miss Holmes." Lucy's example and assistance were
                  of great use to Helen, who proved under her influence a very different character
                  from what she would have been if left only to the guidance of her gay and
                  fashionable sister Julia. Though inferior in intellect to Lucy, she was still far
                  superior to the superficial young ladies with whom she associated; she really
                  learned to love knowledge for its own sake, and was prepared on leaving school, to
                  relish a style of reading more improving than the light trashy works of the day,
                  which form the only reading of many of our gay young ladies. Helen
                  was really a very fine girl, and uncommonly attractive and interesting.
               During the two years in which Lucy made her home at her uncle's, Herbert Ferguson
                  continued to be a constant visitor there, and Julia often wondered that he made no
                  declaration. When thinking on the subject, she exclaimed, "Strange!
                  unaccountable!" many times and often, during those two years. She wondered, too,
                  that Herbert seemed to love so much to talk to Lucy; but still her
                  self-complacency was never in the least disturbed by the thought of Lucy as a
                     rival.
               And, throughout those two years, Arthur Holmes, who had entered in the junior
                  class at Yale, ranked as high in his class as his sister did in hers. Being a
                  young man of fine principles, as well as splendid intellect, he was determined to
                  show his uncle that he intended to make
                  the most of the advantages he had so kindly furnished him. At the end of two years
                  he graduated with the highest honors, and was immediately offered a distinguished
                  professorship in another college. Who would now recognize in the easy and elegant
                  Arthur Holmes, the diffident young "clod-hopper" who alighted from the stage two
                  years before, at his uncle's door.
               Helen and Lucy had graduated too, the latter taking all the highest prizes, and
                  Helen coming only second to her; and the next day Lucy was to leave for her
                  Vermont home, when, quite early in the morning, at least early for visitors, as it
                  was not yet twelve o'clock, in looking from the window, Julia saw Herbert Ferguson
                  ascending the steps.
               "Strange!" said she, "he never calls so early, and oh dear! I am not dressed; he
                  must have come for something special." And in a flutter of excitement Julia began
                  to arrange her hair. But her hair was arranged, and her toilet completed, and no
                  messenger had come to summon her to the parlor.
               Pulling the bell, she called to Thomas and asked him if Mr. Ferguson had not
                  called.
               "Yes, Miss," Thomas answered.
               "And why did you not call me Thomas? how can you be so stupid?"
               "Because, Miss, he asked for Miss Lucy."
               "Strange! unaccountable!" exclaimed Julia, as she walked up and down
                  the room, her cheeks flushed with agitation; "what can he want with Lucy! perhaps
                  he wishes her to make interest for him with me, or to ascertain my sentiments
                  towards him."
               But the minutes went by, and Julia had exclaimed "Strange! unaccountable!" a dozen
                  times, and yet no one came to call her. Presently her young brother Harry came
                  rushing up stairs, having just come in from school.
               "Just like me!" he exclaimed, "always blundering in where I aint wanted! What must
                  I do just now but burst into the library, and there sat Mr. Ferguson on the sofa
                  with his arm round Cousin Lucy. They tried to jump away from each other, and look
                  as if nothing was going on, but it was no go; I saw through it all."
               Julia had now more reason to exclaim "Strange! unaccountable!" than ever. Arthur
                  came for his sister, and Herbert Ferguson, too, accompanied her home as her
                  affianced lover; and thus ended all Miss Julia's hopes and expectations.
               "Isn't it odd, Julia?" said Helen one day, a few months later. "You were so afraid
                  to have Lucy come here lest it should drive Herbert Ferguson from the house. She has been the cause of his deserting
                  you, to be sure, but not from any dislike to her, or mortification at being
                  connected with her."
               "Well, I am sure it is no less strange," answered Julia, "that you are engaged to
                  that same awkward, shy "man-cousin," of whom we were both so ashamed
                  two years ago."
               "It only teaches us," said Helen, "not to judge too hastily from first
                  appearances. Who would have thought we should ever have so much reason to be proud
                  of them both?"
               Herbert Ferguson and his wife now have one of the most elegant establishments in
                  the city. Arthur and Helen went to Europe directly after their marriage, Arthur
                  having been sent there on business for the college with which he is connected; and
                  Julia lives still in single blessedness.
               Mr. Meredith Fitz-Henry may still be seen any fine day lounging up or down
                  Broadway, at the hour when ladies "most do congregate" there, and one of the
                  highest objects of his ambition now, is to be able at least to say that he is an
                  invited guest at the elegant and much-talked-of entertainments of the once
                  ridiculed Vermont Cousin.
            
            
               Ups and Downs.
               IT is one of the most amusing things in life to sit and listen to the conversation
                  of two old ladies, as with knitting in hand they talk over old times, contrasting
                  them with the present, and wondering at the changes which one or two generations
                  will produce.
               "Just look at that splendid carriage, now," says one to the other, "it is by far
                  the most magnificent one in town; it belongs to the Corlieus, and
                  their whole establishment is on an equally grand scale. And who do you think the
                     Corlieus are?"
               "I'm sure I could never guess."
               "Do you remember the sign of a large wooden doll, with flaxen ringlets, which we
                  used to admire so on our way to school, and wish we could have it to play
                  with?"
               "Now you don't mean to say these are the descendants of old Peter Curly, the
                  barber?"
               "Those elegant young ladies that just rode by are his grand-daughters; and I can
                  tell you, that none are more courted and
                  flattered in this wealth-worshipping city than that same familyâ€”I mean among the
                  fashionables, of course. And just look at that elegant mansion, with the broad
                  marble steps. A servant in livery opens the door, and a coachman and footman in
                  livery attend upon the carriage, which must needs have its crest upon the panel.
                  That establishment belongs to the De Veres; and would you like to know who the De
                  Veres are?"
               "Yesâ€”but I am sure I never knew any one of that name."
               "Noâ€”but you knew old Jacob Diver, who kept the little shop in Maiden Lane?"
               "Certainly I did! Many and many's the yard of tape, and paper of pins, I've bought
                  of old Jacob himself, honest old soul, as he stood behind his counter. And the
                  Curlys, and Divers, have got to be Corlieus, and De Veres, have they?"
               "Yes; and old Hiram Higgs' grand-daughters are dashing in Europe, and making the
                  money fly that the old man labored so hard to collect, and hoarded with so much
                  care."
               "Well, the changes in this world are surprising! And what has become of the Râ€”'s,
                  and the Dâ€”'s, and the Tâ€”'s, who were the leaders of fashion when we were
                  young?"
               "Gone! all gone! nobody knows or inquires where. The sons depending on their
                  wealth, which they seemed to think inexhaustible, scorned study, or employment of
                  any kind; and having nothing more important to take up their thoughts, plunged
                  into dissipation, and of course rushed to ruin. The daughters were courted by
                  fortune-hunters, and they have shared the same fate; they and their descendants
                  have disappeared from the stage of fashionable life long ago. This is the history
                  of many a family who dashed through this same great thoroughfare when we were
                  young."
               Such are some of the ups and downs of life! In the great seething cauldron of
                  so-called fashionable society, bubbles are continually rising to the surface, to
                  sparkle a moment and disappear, giving place to other rising bubbles, as brittle
                  and evanescent as they. So goes the world.
               The old men toiled slowly up the dusty and rugged path of life, laying aside
                  carefully for their children the treasures they gathered in their upward progress.
                  The young men seize upon this hoarded wealth, whose value they do not realize,
                  because it cost them no pains, and at the present lightning speed of
                  movement, they rush, as if on an inclined plane, to destruction, and pause not
                  till they have reached a spot lower than
                  that from which their ancestors started. Were these old men now living, and
                  plodding, as they used to do, on foot up the side-walk, we doubt not these dashing
                  grand-children of theirs would be too short-sighted to recognize them.
               Now, our humble opinion is, that the only thing the present race of Corlieus and
                  De Veres have to be ashamed of is, that they are ashamed of the
                  source from which the stream that enriches them flows; and we affirm that old
                  Peter Curly, and Jacob Diver, were really more entitled to respect, as they stood
                  behind their counters, attending to their lawful and honest calling, than are
                  their butterfly descendants, who are so rapidly squandering the wealth these old
                  men labored so hard to lay up for them.
               The only aristocracy we believe in, is that of worth, and this is the
                  only aristocracy which should be aimed at in this country of boasted
                  republicanism; where, God be thanked, every man who is honest, industrious, and
                  temperate, and to whom He has given a mind, may attain to
                  respectability and competence. So much by way of preface to our story.
               It was on a close and sultry summer afternoon, when not a breath stirred the
                  lightest leaf, that a carriage might have been seen driving along the dusty road,
                  which wound around the foot of a certain clear and lovely lake. There was only a
                  lady and a little girl in the carriage, and they had taken this drive in the hope
                  of catching a breath of cooling air from the water.
               But not the slightest breeze rippled the calm waters of the lake, as it lay
                  sleeping in beauty, every fleecy cloud above it being reflected with the most
                  perfect distinctness in its bosom. A beautiful little sail-boat, which had started
                  out in the morning, when a slight breeze passed over the water, now lay becalmed,
                  just like 
                     
                        "A painted ship
                        Upon a painted ocean,"
                     
                   its hull and rigging so clearly mirrored in the deep, blue water, that the
                  boat might as well have been below, as above the surface, for any apparent
                  difference there was between the reality and the reflection.
               The lady leaned back in one corner of the carriage, slowly fanning herself, and
                  sighing occasionally at the intensity of the heat. But the little girl was busy
                  here and there, now on this side of the carriage looking at the lake, now on the
                  other watching objects along the road; sometimes on the front seat, talking
                  through the window with old black 
                     Ceasar
                     CÃ¦sar
                  , the driver, sometimes kneeling on the back seat, and looking out behind, her little tongue running busily
                  every moment. At length she exclaimed:
               "Oh, mamma! do look at this awful old man! His face is as red as fire, and he is
                  flourishing a great horse-whip, and he is swearing as if he was very angry at
                  somebody. He is travelling on towards the village as fast as he can go."
               The only answer to the child was,
               "Oh, Bessie! do keep still, and stop talking, one minute! You make me so hot
                  jumping about so! what do I want to look at every awful old man for?"
               They had not driven very far towards the village, when Bessie, who had been silent
                  for a few moments, exclaimed:
               "Oh, mamma! do please look at this poor little hot, tired boy! see how tight his
                  hair curls this warm day! and how hard he is running! I do believe he is running
                  away from that awful old man we passed a little while ago!"
               Just then the little boy caught hold of a strap at the back of the carriage, and
                  looking up timidly as if asking permission to use it thus far, to assist him on
                  his way, he trotted along behind. A boy who was fishing on the shore called out,
                  "Cut behind!" and CÃ¦sar was just going to take the hint, and had raised his whip
                  for the purpose, when little Bessie, springing to the window, and hastily putting
                  out her head, called out eagerly,
               "No, no, CÃ¦sar, don't! mamma please tell him not to! Now, CÃ¦sar, if you do I will
                  never teach you to make another letter!"
               This threat was not necessary, for little Miss Bessie was such a favorite with
                  CÃ¦sar, that her slightest wish was as a law to him, and as soon as he heard her
                  remonstrate, the whip-handle dropped into its case. The next moment the busy
                  little Bessie was up on the back seat again, with her head out of the window,
                  motioning to the little boy to jump up on the rack. The little fellow was not slow
                  in obeying her, for he seemed quite tired out, and almost worn down with the heat.
                  So he seated himself on the rack, with his back to the carriage, and his little
                  bare feet hanging down behind, occasionally lifting up a handsome and grateful
                  face to the beautiful and smiling little face which looked down upon him from the
                  back of the carriage.
               Soon after they entered the outskirts of the village, the little boy sprang off,
                  and only waiting to give a graceful bow of thanks to the little lady, he rushed
                  into a cottage by the road-side.
               "Aunty!" said he quickly as he entered the door, "Aunty! can you hide me anywhere? Father's after me
                  again! he's terrible to-day!"
               "Hide you, my boy? be sure I can," answered a stout, red-faced woman, coming from
                  a wash-tub, and wiping her hands and arms on her checked apron. "If I can't hide
                  and protect my dead sister's son from old Hiram Fairleigh, I must have lost my
                  cunning and my strength too. Poor child! how roasted he is! No! stop! don't take a
                  drop of water yet, Neddy, you're too hot; you'd surely drop down dead, child.
                  Here, take this fan and go up to the loft, and sit by the window and try and get
                  cool, and pretty soon you shall have a drink. Don't be a bit frightened; let me
                  alone to deal with old Hiram Fairleigh."
               In about half an hour the same old man little Bessie had noticed, as they passed
                  him on the road, came puffing, and scolding, and swearing, along the road, still
                  flourishing the great horse-whip, until he reached the cottage where the little
                  boy had taken refuge. He was turning to enter, when he was encountered at the door
                  by the stout woman of the house, who, putting her brawny red arms a-kimbo,
                  completely filled up the door-way.
               "Now what do you want here, Hiram Fairleigh?" she asked in no very gentle
                  tones.
               "I want my boy!" answered the old man with a
                     "AUNTY, CAN YOU HIDE ME ANYWHERE?" Page 84.
                  
                   horrible oath; "I suppose you've got him
                  stowed away here as usual."
               "Well, suppose I have! I'll hide my sister's son as often as he comes to me for
                  protection from his brute of a father. Aint you ashamed of yourself, Hiram
                  Fairleigh! Such a good boy as he is to you too, when he might easily desert you as
                  the rest have done, and leave you to live and die alone."
               "I tell you I'll have him," swore the man; "and when I do catch him, I'll break
                  every bone in his body. Come, make way there."
               "Not so fast, Hiram Fairleigh," said the woman, seizing a shovel which stood near
                  the door; "they say every man's house is his castle, and every woman's too for
                  that matter, if it is nothing but a poor hovel; and I reckon you
                  don't come in here if I don't choose to let you. That's the law, I
                  believe."
               The old man's rage was now fearful to witness, venting itself in curses and
                  execrations, while he staggered off, declaring he would find a constable, and take
                  forcible possession of the person of his son.
               Fortunately for the boy, there was a wretched little dram-shop which it was
                  necessary for the old man to pass, and whose attractions he always found it
                  impossible to resist, if he had a few cents in his pocket. Staggering down into this miserable little cellar,
                  Hiram was soon oblivious of his boy, the constable, and everything else.
               When the man who kept the grocery was about to shut up his shop for the night, he
                  turned out those customers whom he had so cordially welcomed in the day, and whose
                  pockets he had contrived to empty, and among the vile contents thus disgorged from
                  the wretched place at ten o'clock at night, was old Hiram Fairleigh. He staggered
                  along till he reached the railroad track, and then with the infatuation so common
                  to persons in his situation, he fell or threw himself across the rails, an
                  unconscious offering to this juggernaut of Christian lands, to which such numbers
                  of victims yearly fall a sacrifice.
               The tremendous iron horse came rushing, and tearing, and thundering on, regardless
                  of all that might oppose its progress, crushed in its course the wretched man, and
                  then gave a shriek that might well be one of remorse, it was so keen and piercing,
                  and hurried on its way. There might have been a slight jar, as the engine passed
                  over the crushed and senseless form, but nothing of it was felt by the passengers,
                  who, some talking and laughing, and others sleeping, passed unconsciously over the
                  mangled remains of what had a moment before been a human being, though debased it
                  is true to a similitude with the brute.
               And so was hurried out the life of old Hiram Fairleigh. Two facts came close
                  together to him, in his continued existence, uninterrupted for one moment. One was
                  his exit from the cellar of the dram-shop, the other, his awaking in eternity!
               
               "And now what am I to do, aunty?" asked Neddy, when they had settled down once
                  more, after the shock which the sudden and awful death of old Hiram had occasioned
                  them.
               "Doâ€”child? why you are to stay here, and be a comfort to your poor lonely aunty,
                  if you will. You know I've always wanted you since your poor mother's death, but
                  you were never willing to leave that oldâ€” but he's gone to his account, and I
                  won't call him names."
               "But, aunty, I never could be contented to live here in idleness, and a burden
                  upon you; I must be doing something for my own support, or trying to get an
                  education; I've always wanted to be at work or at study, but all the rest deserted
                  poor old father, and I felt as if I must stay by him, for you know a great deal of
                  the time he wasn't able to take care of himself."
               
               "Well, Neddy, you've been a dutiful son, I must say that, and you have nothing to
                  reproach yourself with, as you would have had, if you had left the old man alone,
                  and he had frozen or starved to death. But now you shall do just as you please; if
                  you like it I will send you to school, for I've always been a hard-working woman,
                  and as I have been alone in the world so many years, I've got something laid up
                  against a rainy day; so I can well afford to send you to school."
               "Oh, thank you, aunty, I shall love dearly to go to school, but I want to find
                  some employment too, as I suppose I must always depend upon my own labor for my
                  support. So I shall start out to-morrow through the village, and see if I can get
                  a place where I can earn something for myself."
               The next morning bright and early Neddy started off on his search for employment.
                  He went to one store and warehouse after another, inquiring if they wanted a boy
                  "to do chores;" but some were in too great a hurry to attend to him, others were
                  supplied with all the help they wanted, and after wandering all day, Neddy
                  returned at night to his aunt's cottage unsuccessful, but not discouraged.
               The next morning he started out again, and after wandering half the day, a kind
                  providence directed him to a certain printing-office, at the very time the
                  gentleman at the head of the establishment happened to be in.
               "Yes, yes, we do want a boy to carry about papers, and I was just inquiring for
                  one," was the answer which made Neddy's heart leap for joy. "Turn round here to
                  the light, and let us have a good look at your face, my boy," he continued. "Well,
                  it looks like an honest face any way, and I'll try you. I always give every poor
                  boy a chance, if I can in any way find employment for him; look here, my boy!
                  thirty years ago, when I was about your age, I entered a printing-office
                  bare-footed, and hungry, in search of employment. To the reception I met with, and
                  the good advice I received, I believe with the blessing of God I owe all my
                  success in life. This story I always tell to every boy, or young man, I take into
                  the office, and I say to them if you are honest, industrious, and temperate, you
                  need never fear but you will rise to stations of respectability and usefulness.
                  Some have followed my advice, and their present positions in life prove that I was
                  a true prophet; others have scorned it, and we have been obliged to turn them off
                  in disgrace. We will see what you will do, my son."
               Neddy thanked the kind gentleman for his good advice, and was almost immediately set to work. His
                  only business, at first, was to leave the daily papers from door to door; an older
                  boy, well acquainted with the village, was sent with him, provided with a list, to
                  show him the houses at which he was to call. His business occupied him only during
                  the mornings, and left him half the day to employ himself as he chose, and he now
                  gladly accepted his aunt's renewed offer, to send him to school half of every
                  day.
               Neddy was now very happy, and made the very best use of his time; one dream of his
                  life had begun to be fulfilled; he had the opportunity of acquiring knowledge, and
                  he had also found employment, by which he gained a trifle to himself, though his
                  earnings were small, to be sure, at first.
               A few mornings after he had begun to distribute the papers, as he was entering the
                  gate of one of the houses where it was his business to stop, on looking up at the
                  window, he spied a bright and beautiful little face, surrounded by golden curls,
                  peeping out. In a moment he recognized it as the same which looked down upon him
                  so pleasantly from the carriage, on that dreadful day, which was fixed forever in
                  his memory.
               Little Bessie recognized him at the same moment, and running down eagerly, she
                  opened the door at the moment Neddy was about to throw in the paper. She welcomed
                  him very cordially, and told him how glad she was to see him again, and Neddy, in
                  a very few words, made her acquainted with the events of that day when first they
                  met, and thanked her for her kindness in permitting him to ride behind the
                  carriage.
               Every morning, now, when Neddy called with his papers, Bessie met him at the door,
                  and they had quite a conversation together. One morning, when her mother was
                  passing through the hall, and saw her talking so familiarly with the little
                  barefooted carrier-boy, she called her in, hastily shutting the door, and telling
                  her that "she was a child of low tastes, to be talking with a vulgar, ignorant,
                  newspaper-boy; how could she demean herself so! her mother was quite ashamed of
                  her."
               "He is not a vulgar, ignorant boy at all, mamma, if he is poor,"
                  answered Bessie, with spirit; "he is a great deal more of a gentleman, or
                     gentleboy, than Robert Ellingwood, that you love to have me play
                  with so much, if Robert does live in a fine, large house, and wear handsome
                  clothes. Robert swears, and talks very rough, but this boy is always gentle and
                  pleasant, and seems to have been brought up by nice people; at least he had a
                  nice, good mother once, I know, but she is dead."
               
               One morning, soon after Neddy's first acquaintance with sweet little Bessie
                  Forester, as he stood talking with her on the door step, with his bundle of papers
                  under his arm, the gate opened, and up the gravel walk came the same Master Robert
                  Ellingwood, of whom Bessie had spoken. He was very elegantly dressed, and in his
                  hand he flourished a beautiful little riding whip.
               The Ellingwoods lived next door to the Foresters, but their house was a much more
                  elegant one, indeed it was by far the finest establishment in the village. They
                  lived in much more style too, than the Foresters, had a great deal more dashing
                  company from the city, and always closed their "country house," as they called it,
                  and went to the city themselves on the approach of cold weather. All this the
                  Foresters could not afford to do; and though Mrs. Forester possessed everything in
                  the way of comfort and luxury, that any reasonable woman could desire, "all this
                  availed her nothing," so long as she had directly in sight the evidences of the
                  greater wealth of her neighbors.
               Mrs. Ellingwood, too, rather looked down upon Mrs. Forester, because her husband
                  had acquired his property in the way of "trade," while Mr. Ellingwood had
                  "inherited" his. Upon the mode in which the property thus inherited was acquired,
                  Mrs. Ellingwood never touched. Mrs. Forester very gladly encouraged the intimacy
                  between the two young people; and even while her daughter was so young, like many
                  another mother, she had foolish visions floating through her brain, of a very
                  ambitious nature, as to the result of this early intimacy and attachment, when the
                  young folks should grow up.
               As Robert Ellingwood entered the gate, Neddy, who was extravagantly fond of
                  flowers, had just turned to admire a beautiful rose, and Bessie immediately ran to
                  the bush and broke it off for him.
               "Is that rose for me, Bessie?" asked Robert, as he came towards her.
               "No, it's for this boy," said Bessie.
               Robert's face flushed instantly with anger, as he said:
               "You never gave me a rose, Bessie, and yet you break off one of your handsomest
                  ones for a barefooted beggar."
               "Because you don't care for flowers, Robert," answered the little girl; "I have
                  seen you whip the most lovely roses to pieces; and besides, this boy is not a
                  beggar."
               "No, indeed I am not," answered Neddy, who had been waiting impatiently to speak,
                  his own handsome face being of a crimson
                  glow; "I am not a beggar, I thank you sir, I never begged for anything yet."
               "Well, if you are not a beggar, you are a thief, I'll warrant," said Robert.
               "No, I am not a thief either," answered Neddy; "I am an honest boy,
                  and I mean to be an honest boy; I get my living honestly, and you must not call me
                  names."
               "I will call you what I please," said Robert; "my father is rich, and
                  I shall never have to work, or beg, or steal either, and what is better I shall
                  never have to study; and I shall say just what I please, and do just what I please
                  to a little barefooted rascal like you; so, Sir, if you have left your paper
                  please to walk out of this yard, or I will strike you in the face with my
                  whip."
               The whip was raised, as the proud and passionate young gentleman said the last
                  words, but the next instant it was lying about a rod distant, and Neddy had laid
                  down his papers, and taken Master Robert by the shouldersâ€”
               "Look here, my fine young gentleman," said he, "it would be a pity to spoil your
                  handsome clothes, but if ever you say a word like that to me again, I will lay you
                  in the gutter, I declare I will. There is your whip out there in the grass, you
                  may go and pick it up, but take care hereafter what names you call an honest boy,
                  who has nothing but his character to depend upon; and Mr. Robinson says if I am
                  honest and steady, I may make anything I choose; so, Sir, the day may come when I
                  shall be your equal in all respects."
               The astonished and crest-fallen Master Robert, walked slowly away, picked up his
                  whip, and went out of the gate, muttering threats of vengeance.
               
               The summer and autumn passed away, and then came winter, cold and dreary; and on
                  the first day of the year, a bitter and tempestuous day, the little newspaper-boy
                  stood upon the steps of Mr. Forester's house with the Carrier's Address in his
                  hand. Neddy was not barefooted now, for by his aunt's kindness, and his own
                  earnings, he was comfortably clothed; still he was blue, and shivering with the
                  cold, as he might well be on such a bitter day. The bell was answered by the
                  servant-maid, who took the paper from the little boy, and carried it into the
                  house.
               "Biddy! Biddy! do shut that door! it is enough to freeze one, to have
                  that keen cold wind blowing into the house so!" called out Mrs. Forester very
                  impatiently from the side of her comfortable fire, where she sat elegantly dressed
                  to receive New Year's visitors.
               
               "But the boy is waiting, ma'am."
               "Well, let him wait! but don't freeze us to deathâ€”shut the door!"
               "Oh, it's my newspaper boy!" exclaimed Bessie.
               "Call him in! call him in!" said Mr. Forester, who happened to be at home. "Here,
                  come in my little fellow, and warm yourself by the hall-stove; why you are almost
                  perished! Bessie run and bring a glass of wine, and one of the cake-baskets
                  here."
               The little boy thankfully took a piece of cake, but refused the wine.
               "Take it, my boy, take it, it can't hurt you; it will only give you a good warming
                  this cold day."
               But Neddy firmly though respectfully declined. Ah! Neddy saw that for
                     him, that one glass of wine might be but the first step to an end like
                  that of his wretched father, and nothing would induce him to touch it.
               As Neddy stood by the hall-stove eating his cake, and warning himself, the
                  beautiful parlors, of which he caught a glimpse through the open door, with their
                  rich sofas, and mirrors, and chandeliers, seemed to him like some fairy land, and
                  little Bessie, with her beautiful dress and golden ringlets, like a lovely little
                  fairy, dancing in and out. Had Neddy been able to catch a glimpse of Mrs.
                  Ellingwood's parlors, those at which he now gazed would have appeared small and
                  plain in comparison; but at Mrs. Ellingwood's the fairy would have been
                  wanting.
               "What a face! and what a head!" exclaimed Mr. Forester, as the door closed after
                  the little carrier boy; "if that boy does not make his way in the world, I am
                  mistaken."
               
               Three years passed away, and Neddy came no more with the papers. He was now
                  fifteen years old, and had for some time been employed regularly in the office;
                  now he had advanced another step, and another boy had taken his place as carrier.
                  Mr. Robinson, who loved to encourage rising genius, had given Neddy every
                  advantage he could possibly procure for him. The boy, as he saw, had an uncommon
                  mind, and as he devoted every leisure moment most diligently to study, he was
                  already, in his attainments, far in advance of many who had been favored with
                  superior advantages.
               Soon after this, Neddy's kind aunt was taken ill and died. Her savings lasted over
                  the "rainy day" for which she had laid them up, and made quite a nice little sum,
                  at least in Neddy's eyes, for him to begin the world with. And now Mr. Robinson,
                  having had an application from a friend in a distant city, for an honest, industrious, and capable boy, to
                  fill a station of trust and responsibility, determined to give Neddy this
                  opportunity of bettering his condition, though at a great personal sacrifice. It
                  was a hard thing for Neddy to leave his kind patron, and yet he did not think it
                  right to refuse so tempting an offer; and so with a sad heart, and yet with high
                  hopes and anticipations, he prepared to leave the lovely village on the lake
                  shore.
               His life was now a laborious one, every moment of it filled up with toil and
                  study; and still his progress was ever upward and onward. Step by step he rose in
                  the confidence of his employers, and in his situation in their establishment,
                  until at the age of twenty-two we behold him a partner in their large and
                  prosperous business.
               Bessie Forester was now nineteen years old; when one evening a young Mr. Elliott,
                  who visited often at the house of Mr. Forester, and was engaged to be married to
                  one of Bessie's dear and intimate friends, called, and brought with him a young
                  gentleman whom he introduced as Mr. Edward Fairleigh. Bessie's face flushed as she
                  heard the name, for she had never forgotten the handsome little carrier-boy, whom
                  she had no difficulty in recognizing, though he was much changed, and of course
                  vastly improved in manners and appearance.
               Young Fairleigh had letters to Mr. Forester from his partners in the city. They
                  were about establishing a large publishing house in the village where Mr. Forester
                  resided, and had selected Mr. Fairleigh, whom they described as a young man of
                  great ability, and tried integrity, as the partner who was to be stationed there.
                  Mr. Forester welcomed him kindly, and begged him to visit at his house as often as
                  he felt inclined, an invitation which we may be sure the young man was not slow to
                  accept.
               
               "And so you had not forgotten me, Bessie?" asked Edward Fairleigh of the lovely
                  girl, a few months later.
               "Oh! no! Edward, never; I think I should have known you after a moment, even if I
                  had not heard your name."
               "And the printer's boy has had the presumption to remember his beautiful little
                  friend, through all his toils and labors, and his brightest dream has been that of
                  returning to this lovely village, and finding that she had not forgotten him. It
                  has seemed to me ever, Bessie, that the circumstances of our first days' meeting
                  were but the foreshadowing of my course
                  thus far through life. I have felt as if I were toiling along the hot and dusty
                  road, driven by stern necessity, but encouraged and cheered by the same bright and
                  lovely face which looked out upon me from the carriage, and beckoned forward by
                  the same little hand. And do you think your mother has any idea that she has
                  accepted, for the future husband of her daughter, the same little carrier-boy with
                  whom she was afraid to have her speak in former times?"
               "Oh, no, she has not the least idea of it, Edward, and I think it is better she
                  should not have, for my mother has not changed; and though she may be very well
                  satisfied with your present position, she would be by no means pleased to be
                  informed of your former one."
               "And what has become of your youthful admirer, and my former foe, Bessie?" asked
                  Edward, as he walked to the window, and looked out at the closed and deserted
                  mansion of the Ellingwoods, although it was now mid-summer.
               "Oh! poor Robert is behaving very badly," answered Bessie, "he has almost broken
                  his poor mother's heart; he never comes up here now, in the summer; it is said he
                  prefers the dissipation of the city. We hear that he has involved his father very
                  deeply by his gambling debts, and other extravagances. Their beautiful place is
                  mortgaged now, and we hear they intend never to return to it again."
               Mr. Ellingwood's place was mortgaged it is true, and the person who held the
                  mortgage was Mr. Elliot, the father of the young man who had introduced Edward
                  Fairleigh to Mr. Forester. Mr. Ellingwoods affairs, in consequence of his son's
                  dissipation, and other reverses, had now become so desperate that he had written
                  to Mr. Elliot to beg him to sell the property, as speedily as possible.
               Young Elliot came to Edward Fairleigh and urged him to buy the place. Edward,
                  though ambitious in one sense, was not ostentatious, and had long had his eye upon
                  a snug little spot in another part of the village; but the remonstrances of Mrs.
                  Forester, who had long hoped to see her daughter the mistress of the Ellingwood
                  mansion, and the no less earnest entreaties of Bessie's father, who could not bear
                  to be separated from his idolized daughter, and who insisted upon furnishing the
                  house himself, prevailed, and two years from the time of Edward Fairleigh's
                  establishment in the village, we find him and Bessie most charmingly settled in
                  the elegant mansion formerly owned and occupied by the now sad and humbled family
                  of the Ellingwoods.
               It became necessary for Edward Fairleigh to make a journey to the city soon after their marriage,
                  and Bessie accompanied him. As they were walking down one of the principal
                  streets, a miserable looking wretch reeled up to them, and begged a sixpence for
                  the love of heaven. Bessie drew down her veil, and turned away and trembled.
               "Oh, Edward!" said she, as they passed on, "that was poor Robert Ellingwood!"
               Let all who may happen to read this story, whose counterpart has been found in so
                  many instances, no matter how humble their present circumstances may be, take
                  courage; and with a wise reference to Him who "setteth up one and putteth down
                  another," and yet works after such established laws, that we may, in perfect
                  consistency, be said to make or mar our own destinies, struggle on undaunted, and
                  with the blessing of God they need not fear, but they too may attain to stations
                  of respectability and honor.
            
            
               The Lonely Mourner.
               A SCENE ON A CANAL BOAT.
               IN these days of steam, and hurry, and bustle, when we find it impossible to get
                  over land or water fast enough, and are by no means satisfied with flying from one
                  extremity of our great State to the other in one day; it would be well for us once
                  in a while to contrast the present state of things with that of twenty or thirty
                  years ago. Then, when the roads were heavy after violent rains, or a sudden thaw,
                  the most that could be accomplished at times, was a mile or two an hour, and it
                  was not an uncommon thing for a man to pay his fare, and then walk a great part of
                  his journey, and carry a rail to help lift the stage out of the sloughs of despond
                  into which it was continually sinking.
               Or it is well to remember the days of canal-boat travelling, when you were dragged
                  slowly along, day after day, and night after night, in the little, close, crowded cabin of a packet-boat,
                  suffocated with the heat, devoured by musquitoes, and enduring existence with what
                  patience you might, till your tedious journey should end. Yet there were some
                  pleasant things connected with travelling, even in those days of snail-like
                  motions; and one sometimes made charming acquaintances, and formed lasting
                  friendships on a journey of several days by stage or canal.
               It was when I was quite young, and consequently before the era of railroads, that,
                  on returning home from school in an eastern city, I found myself in a canal boat,
                  slowly travelling west, under the care of a kind and pleasant old gentleman. We
                  were very fortunate in having on board a set of most agreeable and companionable
                  people, and by dint of lending and borrowing books, playing with the little
                  children, and engaging together in games of chess or draughts, we soon felt quite
                  well acquainted with each other.
               There was one young girl, however, in the cabin with us, of most lovely and
                  lady-like appearance, who seemed to be entirely alone and to know no one on board.
                  She sat, or rather partly reclined on one of the fixed seats, which ran along the
                  side of the boat, with her feet upon the seat, and her head resting on her hand,
                  the very image of sadness and grief. In her lap she held a book, which we could
                  easily see was a Bible, into which she looked occasionally, as if seeking for
                  comfort there; she did not weep, indeed it seemed as if it had been long since
                  tears had moistened her cheeks, but at times she would utter the deepest sighs, as
                  if her heart were bursting.
               The other ladies on the boat said often to each other,
               "Do look at that poor girl. What can be the matter with her! She must be in deep
                  affliction. I wish I dared to go and speak to her, but I know nothing of her and
                  do not like to intrude."
               My own thoughts were much occupied with this sad young mourner, but I felt
                  diffident about taking upon myself the task of sympathizer, when those older and
                  more experienced, shrank from it. Little substantial acts of kindness, such as
                  carrying her a cup of tea or a bit of toast, (for she never came to the table,) we
                  were all glad to render; she always thanked us kindly, but no one saw her eat
                  anything from the time we started till she left the boat.
               One inquisitive old woman evidently for no purpose but to satisfy her own
                  curiosity, and be the first to communicate some intelligence respecting the young
                  girl, stepped up to her, and fixing her piercing gray eyes on her face, said
                  abruptly, "Lost a friend?" to which the only answer was a deep groan, as if
                     from the very depths of her heart,
                  while the sweet, sad young face was turned away.
               In the meantime the talking, and reading, and playing of games went on, wholly
                  unnoticed by the youthful mourner, who seemed totally absorbed by her own deep
                  grief, whatever that might be. At length the boat stopped at a small village, and
                  a middle-aged Quakeress came on board. She was one of the neatest and most lovely
                  looking of her people. Her pure white satin bonnet, and dove-colored dress and
                  shawl, and the precisely plaited muslin about her neck, all looked as if spot, or
                  wrinkle, or stain, would never approach them, while her serene and placid
                  countenance told of a spirit as pure and unruffled as her outward garb.
               She took her seat quietly, and looked about her with an expression of the most
                  heart felt benevolence, on all her fellow travellers, smiled kindly on the little
                  children who were paying about on the floor of the cabin, and in short seemed to
                  have a heart large enough to embrace in its love every human being. But her gaze
                  wandered the most often, and rested with the most interest upon the young girl who
                  sat alone in the corner of the cabin, and before she had been an hour on board,
                  she had taken her seat by her side, and her small white hand in hers.
               "Thy heart seems to be burdened with some sore grief, my young friend," she said,
                  in the sweetest and most sympathizing tone. It seemed to go at once to the
                  burdened heart. There was a compression of the under lip, a dilation of the
                  delicate nostril, a heaving of the breast, and then for the first time the large
                  round tears rolled from beneath the closed eye-lids.
               "I seek not to pry into the cause of thy grief, my dear," continued the gentle
                  Quakeress, "whatever it may be. There is but one source of consolation, and I am
                  glad to see that thou art willing to seek it. If thou canst 'cast all thy care
                  upon Him who careth for thee,' and who 'doth not willingly grieve nor
                  afflict the children of men" it will be well with thee, my young friend, and thou
                  wilt have that peace in thy heart which 'the world can neither give nor take
                  away.'"
               Then taking the young girl's Bible in her hand, she began to turn to some
                  consoling passages to read to her. The youthful mourner, having now been relieved
                  by a burst of tears, turned toward the lovely Quakeress, and raising her sweet
                  blue eyes to her face, spoke in low and sad tones, and seemed to be telling her
                  the cause of her grief.
               "Ah! is it so, my young friend?" replied the Quakeress; "thou hast indeed been
                  sorely tried, but there is one who is
                  the 'Father of the fatherless, canst thou not go to Him?"
               Again the low tones of the young girl's voice were heard, though we could not
                  catch the words, and it seemed now to be a comfort to her to pour out her griefs
                  in the ear of one so ready to sympathize, and so competent to console. And the
                  words of consolation, almost invariably in Scripture language, seemed to be
                  singularly appropriate and comforting.
               The relief to the oppressed heart was so great that after a long and earnest
                  conversation, the young girl laid her head upon the breast of the gentle
                  Quakeress, and dropped into a deep slumber, probably the first she had known for
                  many days and nights. Long and soundly she slept, undisturbed by the stopping of
                  the boat, the rattling of ropes, hurrying of feet overhead, or the hoarse cries of
                  the boatmen. After a time the boat drew up at a beautiful village. Upon the bank
                  of the canal stood a hearse, and a carriage, and a group of gentlemen standing
                  together seemed to be awaiting the arrival of the boat.
               "My dear," said the Quakeress, gently kissing the pale forehead of the sleeper, "I
                  think thou hast arrived at thy destination."
               The young girl awoke, and gazed with a bewildered and anxious air from the window
                  of the boat, and at the same moment the door of the cabin opened hastily, and a
                  tall, fine-looking young man entered, and looked eagerly about him. With a scream
                  the young girl sprang towards him, and they were clasped in each other's arms.
               "My poor little sister!" and "My dear, dear brother!" were all that was said,
                  while her head sank upon his breast, and the bitter tears coursed down his manly
                  cheek.
               In the meantime a coffin had been taken from the boat and placed in the hearse,
                  and some friend coming in touched the young man on the shoulder, and told him that
                  everything was ready for their departure. He was leading his sister from the
                  cabin, when she bethought herself of the lovely Quakeress; and disengaging herself
                  from her brother's arm, she stept back, and throwing her arms around the neck of
                  the sympathizing stranger, she thanked her for the consolation and comfort she had
                  afforded her.
               "God bless thee, and sustain thee in all thy sorrow, my young friend," said the
                  Quakeress. "We have never met before, and it is likely we shall never meet again
                  on earth; but I shall love to pray for thee, that 'God may lift the light of his
                  countenance upon thee, and grant thee peace.' 'Hope thou in God,' my dear, 'for thou shalt yet praise him, who is
                  the health of thy countenance and thy God.'"
               The young man then led his sister out, and lifted her into the carriage, and the
                  solemn little procession moved silently off, the village church-bell slowly
                  tolling as it proceeded on its way.
               The story of the young mourner was soon heard from the captain, and whispered
                  round from one to the other. She had accompanied her father on a voyage to the
                  south of France for his health. No fears were entertained of his disease proving
                  fatal when they left home; but as his health was somewhat enfeebled by long and
                  arduous devotion to public duties, his physicians thought a sea-voyage, and a
                  winter in that genial climate, would quite renovate his constitution. With the
                  most sanguine expectations of pleasure, his only daughter prepared to accompany
                  him. But the hopes of friends and physicians proved fallacious. A cold caught on
                  the voyage out, was but the precursor of a rapid decline; and he hastened home,
                  towards spring, hoping to die in the bosom of his family.
               Before he had been many days at sea, however, he breathed his last upon his
                  devoted daughter's breast. She alone listened to his last directions and counsel;
                  she alone wiped the death-damps from his brow, and closed his eyes when glazed in
                  death.
               To the shame of human nature be it said, that there was not one on board that
                  vessel to aid that young girl in the care of her dying father, or to attempt to
                  offer her consolation in her bereavement. She remained alone in her state-room,
                  while singing, and dancing, and card-playing, went on night after night in the
                  cabin; and oh! how painfully the sounds of merriment jarred on the ear of that sad
                  and lonely mourner.
               A few hours' delay was necessary in New York, during which she wrote to her
                  brother to prepare him and other friends for her arrival, and then she started on
                  her slow and tedious journey westward. The first words of sympathy and kindness
                  which fell upon her ear, from the time of her father's death till she reached her
                  home, were those whispered to her by the gentle Quakeress.
               I know we were all thoroughly humbled, and ashamed of ourselves, when we heard
                  that young girl's story, and I think some of us formed the resolution, that when
                  next we met with a stranger lonely and in sorrow, we would at least make an
                  attempt, however awkward it might be, to show kindness and sympathy; if we were
                  repulsed, or our attempted consolation was deemed intrusive, it would then be time
                  to leave the stranger to her own sad and lonely thoughts.
            
            
               
               The Old Red School-house.
               IT stands there yet in the centre of the village green; just as it stood when I
                  was a little child, and see-sawed over my primer within its walls;
                  the same old oak-tree shades it from the summer's sun, the same clear little brook
                  bubbles by over its pebbly bed, directly beneath the windows. Indeed nothing seems
                  changed at Hazleton; and to stand on the hillside and look down at the village in
                  the quiet valley, it would seem that Time, which produces such changes and
                  improvements elsewhere, had been at a stand-still there.
               It has not even been allowed to produce its own legitimate work,
                     decay, for the villagers have at least kept their houses in
                     repair, though few new ones have been erected. Why a village was
                  ever built, or begun to be built, in that out-of-the-way nook among the hills, is
                  and ever will be a mystery; there is no river or canal near, there is no
                  "water-privilege" of any kind but the brook, and that is no privilege to any but
                  the children, who wade up and down with bare feet, and sail their chip boats with
                  paper sails there.
               Speaking of bare-footed children, I remember now how hard we used to think it that
                  we were obliged to wear shoes and stockings, and how earnestly we used to beg to
                  be allowed to go bare-footed like most of our school-mates; and I remember, too,
                  how often we used to sit down on a large flat stone just outside our own gate, and
                  pulling off those incumbrances, consign them to our dinner-baskets till school was
                  out, and then trudge off as independent little bare-footers as any of them.
               Still Time and Death have done some work even at Hazleton; I miss aged forms, many
                  and many a one, and some bright round faces that I remember well are now mingling
                  with their native dust in the graveyard on the hill-side. Of those who are left it
                  is hard to recognize old school-mates in the fathers and mothers, and "maiden
                  aunts," who now people the village of Hazleton, and of the young generation who
                  now wade in the brook, and buzz over their books in the school-house, I know
                  nothing.
               It seems but yesterday that I stood one of a little class of five, in a
                  semi-circle around our dearly loved first teacher, sweet little Miss Mary Hooker.
                     Next me stood my firm and fast
                  friend, Hetty West, and next her, always next her, stood Harry
                  Seymour, the minister's son. Miss Hooker was very poor, and the little she made by
                  teaching she sent to her widowed mother, for whose support she labored. So it
                  happened that Miss Hooker all through the long winter never appeared in any but
                  the same dark green Circassian dress; it had probably done good service in other
                  winters too, for if one looked very closely at it, many neatly set-in patches
                  could be discovered about the waist and sleeves, telling of wear and tear in spite
                  of care, and of patient industry.
               But what a kind, cheerful, patient little soul she was! I never shall forget how
                  heartily she laughed one day when Harry Seymour, who had been puzzling over a
                  sentence in his reading lesson, in a manner that showed his mind to be
                  pre-occupied with some all-engrossing subject, looked up suddenly in the midst of
                  the sentence and asked eagerly:
               "Miss Hooter, han't you dot no other dress but
                  that?"
               I remember well, too, how amused she was, and how impossible it was for her to
                  conceal it, when she one day told that same little lisping Harry Seymour, (for
                  Harry lisped till he was ten years old,) that "if he did not stop whispering to
                  Hetty West, she would certainly shut him up in the wood closet;" to which Harry
                  replied:
               "Oh, Miss Hooter! what yies you do tell; you've said
                  that a dreat many times before!"
               It was a sad day for us, but a fortunate one she esteemed it, when Miss Hooker was
                  offered a situation in a new academy just established in the thriving little
                  village of Bloomsbury, six miles from Hazleton; as her salary was now such that
                  she was able to keep her old mother with her, and I doubt not she was now enabled
                  to treat herself to two dresses for the winter.
               Our next teacher was a "man-teacher," a certain David Pitkin; who had firm faith
                  in the efficacy of birch and rulers, and seemed to have no idea of any other mode
                  of getting knowledge in, or keeping mischief out, of the
                  heads of the urchins under his charge, but by the frequent application of these
                  instruments of torture. I can see him now as he sat on the desk, (he always sat on
                  the desk with his feet on the seat,) his white stiff hair standing up like a
                  frightened brush around his face, and his light cold gray eye glaring round in
                  search of some delinquent on whom to exercise his muscular arm.
               Oh, how we all hated him! I did not dare to show it, and therefore I
                  was a particular favorite with the
                  master, much to my annoyance, for he often insisted upon my sitting up on the desk
                  close by him, a position I by no means desired. Hetty West, on the contrary, was
                  an independent little creature, and showed him so plainly from the first how much
                  she disliked him, that she early gained his ill-will, the effects of which she
                  experienced many a time and oft.
               Poor little Harry Seymour now had to confine his attentions to Hetty to other
                  times than school-hours; the first whipping he received after Pitkin came, being
                  in consequence of leaving his seat to go across the room and ask Hetty West if she
                  would surely be his wife; for which, as he told his mother, "the
                  master flew at him before he got back to his seat, and almost deaded
                  him."
               This task-master remained over us till Hetty and I were twelve years old, and like
                  the ancient Israelites in Egypt, we all groaned under the bondage, but look where
                  we would we saw no signs of a deliverer. After a time, we began to suspect that
                  the master had a sweet-heart somewhere, though how any woman could possibly make
                  up her mind to be his sweet-heart, we could not imagine. But occasionally, when
                  one of the villagers had been over to Bloomsbury, (for we had no post-office at
                  Hazleton then,) he would stop at the school-house and leave a letter for the
                  master, who would presently become so absorbed in its contents, that Harry Seymour
                  might step on tip-toe across the room, and whisper what he pleased to Hetty West,
                  or any other pranks might be played by the scholars, with perfect impunity.
               There was a witch of a girl in the school of the name of Katy Crane; a quick,
                  smart thing, (who would believe that she was now Deacon More's sedate wife!) who
                  did almost all the mischief that was done, and yet was so sly about it that she
                  was the last one upon whom suspicion ever fell. I remember well one day when the
                  master was puzzling over an epistle just brought him from the Bloomsbury
                  post-office, that Katy stole up behind him, and looking over his shoulder, read
                  the first sentence of the letter, and demurely walked back to her seat. As the
                  master folded up the letter, we all saw by the expression of his face that there
                  was something in it that did not please him; during the rest of the morning he was
                  as irritable as if among nettles, and wo betide the urchin who kept not up to the
                  mark that day. In the afternoon, as the master entered the school-room, the first
                  thing that met his eyes was the following, written in large letters on the
                  black-board:
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              "DEAR DAVID:â€”
                           
                           "I don't see as it's at all likely that father will ever consent to
                              our being married, because you see he's bent on my marrying Zeph.
                              Spraker." Ahem!!!
                        
                     
                  
               
               Oh how livid he grew! "Who did that?" he thundered. No answer of
                  course. "Hetty West, that is your work!" Hetty positively denied having anything
                  to do with it, but he evidently did not believe her. One by one he asked all the
                  scholars, but the only answer was a positive denial from each one. Katy Crane, who
                  was waving back and forth over her geography lesson, looked up as innocent as any
                  one, and declared that she had not written a word on the black-board
                  that day. And in that she said the truth, for she had brought in her big brother
                  at noon, when the school-house was deserted, and persuaded him to write the
                  sentence from her dictation.
               It was plain the master suspected Hetty, for no reason that we could think of,
                  except that he caught her pointing at the black-board and laughing, as he entered
                  the school-room; and though he did not dare to punish her without any proof, it
                  was equally plain by his manner, that he meant to take revenge out of somebody
                  before night.
               In the course of the afternoon the stillness of the school-room was suddenly
                  broken by a prolonged and shrill whistle. It certainly came from Hetty West's side
                  of the room, and seemed to come from very near her seat. The master's eye now
                  gleamed with a kind of satisfied malignity, as he called out:
               "Hetty West, step up here; that was you whistled!"
               "It was not, Sir!" answered Hetty.
               "A lie always doubles a fault," said the master, "and this is the second you have
                  dared to tell me to-day; I know you wrote the sentence on the
                  black-board, and I heard you whistle. Step up here directly!"
               "I did neither, Sir!" answered Hetty firmly.
               "Lie the third. O-o-o-h! how you are piling it up, Miss Hetty; come! step out
                  here!" and he seized the ruler.
               Hetty turned very pale, and leaving her seat she walked slowly toward the enraged
                  master. The rest of us turned pale too, and well we might, for a feruling from
                  Pitkin, especially when he was so terribly excited as he was that day, was no
                  light matter. He had a cruel way of turning up the ends of his victims fingers,
                  and striking the blows directly upon them, so that I have known a scholar unable
                  to hold pen or pencil for more than a week after punishment of this sort.
               
               He had just taken Hetty's little hand in his, and was placing the fingers in the
                  position to please him, when Harry Seymour, unable to endure the sight, suddenly
                  left his seat, and stepping up to the master with his face flushed with passion,
                  he said:
               "Mr. Pitkin, I've always heard it said that it takes the meanest kind
                  of a man to strike a woman, or a girl. Now, Sir, you may
                  lick me for that; and, in the next place, I know it was
                     not Hetty West that; whistled, for she can't do itâ€”I've often
                  heard her try; so, Sir, if anybody lies it is yourself; and now you
                  may ferule me for that!" he added, holding out his hand, with the
                  fingers crooked in the proper position for receiving the blows.
               "Never fear but I'll settle with you, young Sir, for your impertinent meddling,"
                  answered the master, apparently well satisfied that work was accumulating on his
                  hands; "but I must attend to this case first;" and he raised the ruler to strike
                  the first blow on Hetty's fingers.
               There was a strange, absent-minded boy, named Dick Waters, whose seat was next to
                  Hetty's. He had all this time been so engaged upon a sum, that he had heard
                  nothing of what was going on; though a boy on the other side of him had kept
                  nudging him with his elbow, and whispering:
               "I say, Dick, 't was you whistled, and the master is going to ferule
                  Hetty West for it." But Dick's attention could not be aroused till the sum was
                  finished; then he suddenly seemed to comprehend what his next neighbor was saying
                  to him, and starting up quickly, he arrested the uplifted ruler by exclaiming:
               "Why here! hullo! Mr. Pitkin, they say it was me whistled, and I
                  think it's likely it was!"
               It seemed to me as if the master would go distracted with all these various
                  interruptions; turning to Dick, with the ruler still raised in the air, he
                  roared:
               "What's that you say, Sir? Do you mean to tell me you don't know
                  whether you whistled or not?"
               "Well, I can't exactly say, Sir," said Dick, moving nervously from one foot to the
                  other; "but I know I've got a trick of whistling right out when anything kind o'
                  surprises me; and I think it's more'n likely I did give a whistle,
                  when I found I'd took a seven for a nine, and that made all the mistake in my
                  sum."
               "Step up here you, then," said the master, "I tell you I'll have
                  satisfaction out of somebody!" He seemed to concentrate all his rage at Hetty in
                  the blows which he struck on Dick's fingers; but Dick appeared all the time to be
                  lost in thought, looking out of the window far off at something on a distant hill. When the master had tired himself
                  out, and stopped to rest, Dick nodded, and said:
               "Yes, that's right!"
               "What's right?" screamed Pitkin.
               "Oh!" said Dick, apparently waking up, "I was thinking about my sum, Sir. Why,"
                  looking at his hand, "you've been licking me, hav n't you? ki! yi!
                  how it tingles! I shan't be able to cipher in a month!" and Dick went to his seat
                  shaking his hand, as if he were wringing off drops of water. We all thought Dick
                  was not quite as absent-minded, or as insensible to pain, as he sometimes
                  pretended to be.
               Then came poor Harry Seymour's turn, and he bore his feruling right manfully,
                  hoping that every blow had saved one for Hetty. Hetty herself escaped that time,
                  for the master did not dare to punish her with so many witnesses against him; and,
                  though with great reluctance, he was obliged to let her take her seat.
               The increased complaints of the master's cruelty, together with the sight of the
                  blood-blistered fingers of the two boys, roused the indignation of the villagers,
                  and Mr. David Pitkin was politely requested to take his departure from the
                  village; leaving us again to the gentle sway of a "school marm," though we never
                  found one that we loved as we did Miss Mary Hooker. Whether the father of David's
                  sweet-heart ever relented, we never heard; but we thought if the poor thing ever
                  did marry him, she was entitled to our sincere commiseration.
               All this time the school-house was also the "meeting-house," for we had no
                  church-building at Hazleton, till I was nearly grown up. Oh, how well I remember
                  sitting on those hard seats without backs, my little feet swinging a foot from the
                  floor, during the delivery of those long, dry, doctrinal sermons of good Mr.
                  Seymour. I well remember looking at him in a sort of despair, and thinking to
                  myself, "Is it possible he ever will finish?" while he went slowly on
                  to seventhly, lastly, and finally; and then "one word more and I have
                  done;" and after that "more last words," and then a practical application, and
                  then a final conclusion. Oh! if ministers of the gospel would oftener give a few
                  words to the "unlearned and ignorant," and would heed the injunction to "feed the
                     lambs of the flock," who certainly need nourishment as well as
                  older and more experienced disciples!
               But the singing! oh, the singing! in that old red school-house on Sunday! how I
                  used to enjoy and wonder at it! The people were particularly partial to a style of
                  music, now nearly obsolete, denominated
                  fuguing. I remember with what intense excitement I used to look from
                  one to the other, wondering whether it was possible that they would all ever get
                  together again. The old ladies would sit with their eyes shut, waving back and
                  forth, and whining out the words, each apparently taking her own course, and
                  utterly regardless of what her fellow-singers might be about, and every mouth, as
                  it seemed to me, made up for a different word.
               An old deacon would be in the midst of "hail and darkness," while an old lady on
                  the other side would be struggling through "fire and storm;" others still, after
                  once safely escaping all these perils, would rush blindly back to them again.
                  "Now," I would think to myself, "Deacon Watkins is left clear behind, and he never
                     can catch up, and he does n't seem to know a word about it," when,
                  just as they all seemed to be finishing without him, one would kindly hold her
                  breath on one word till it seemed as if she never would catch it
                  again, and another on another word, and some, who it seemed had not breath enough
                  for that performance, would go back and repeat the last line over again, till to
                  my never-failing astonishment, they all actually did reach the last
                  word, at the very same moment of time.
               I have heard since, in my riper years, what were called wonderful performances in
                  the way of music, but never have I heard anything that so called forth my wonder
                  and admiration, as those fuguing feats in the old red school-house
                  at Hazleton.
               The love of Harry Seymour and Hetty West, unlike most affairs of the kind began so
                  early in life, grew with their growth, and strengthened with their strength, till,
                  at the age of eighteen, Hetty was quite willing to renew the promise she made to
                  Harry when she was six, (and for asking which he got almost "deaded,"
                  that she would surely be his wife. It was when Harry was going away
                  to New York, to be a clerk in his uncle's store, that they became actually
                  engaged; but as the engagement was likely to be a long one, Hetty preferred it
                  should be kept a secret for a time at least, as the good people of Hazleton were
                  in the habit of making themselves quite as busy with affairs of that kind, as they
                  are said to be in other places of like size and description.
               No one actually knew of it, but Hetty's and Harry's family and myself, though all
                  suspected the attachment between them. It was easier to keep the secret, as the
                  post-office was at Bloomsbury, and Hetty's father, or one of her brothers, took
                  her letters, and brought Harry's, when they rode over there on business. Harry
                  wrote every week; he was well, he said,
                  and as cheerful as he could be so far from Hetty, and she was very happy.
               But the course of true love runs no smoother in quiet nooks like Hazleton, than
                  throughout the rest of the world; if fate in some other form does not come in to
                  trouble the stream, and impede its even flow, doubts or jealousies on the part of
                  the lovers themselves, will raise barriers to its progress, and sometimes turn it
                  altogether from its original destination.
               A few months after Harry Seymour left for New York, we attained to the dignity of
                  a post-office of our own; which was a great event in our little place, and a great
                  convenience to the few who ever expected to receive communications from absent
                  friends. The post-office, was the drawer of a small table, in one corner of Uncle
                  Zeb. Merryweather's store. Uncle Zeb's was literally, and truly, a
                     variety store; such as you may find in any small country village,
                  where only one or two stores can be supported. There was only one other in the
                  place; and that was one of much the same kind, kept by Col. Turner; there was a
                  long struggle for the post-office between Col. Turner and Uncle Zeb, but Uncle
                  Zeb's store being the most central, and he the oldest resident, and having more
                  influential friends in Hazleton and Bloomsbury, it was settled in his favor.
               In Uncle Zeb's store might be seen,â€” (but what might not be seen there!) There
                  were dishes, and shoes, calicoes, and brooms, bonnets, and hoes, ribbons, and
                  churns, a glass case of knick-knacks, a shelf of hardware, a counter of sugars and
                  teas, cans of oil, jugs of molasses, wet groceries and dry, millinery, and
                  saddlers-wares, books, and onions, wooden-ware, and worked collars, in close and
                  most inconsistent proximity. But Uncle Zeb's crowning glory was the post-office;
                  and never was prouder man than he, when he opened his first mail, consisting of
                  three letters, and seven newspapers. He seemed to grow broader and rounder, and to
                  wheeze more consequentially, from the day when he put up by the side of his door a
                  little piece of paste-board, with Post-Office printed on it in large
                  letters in ink.
               Perhaps it is not in human nature to bear a great accession of honor and dignity,
                  with entire meekness; but the Hazleton people did think that Aunt Patience need
                  not have tossed her head with quite such an air, the Sunday after the
                  post-office sign was put up, or the children, and even the grand-children, say so
                  plainly by their manner, "Ha! ain't we all postmasters now!"
               The first letter Hetty received from Harry directed to Hazleton, instead of Bloomsbury, looked strange
                  to her, and she congratulated herself, that she could now get her letters direct
                  as soon as the mail was opened, without having to wait till father, or one of her
                  brothers, could make it convenient to ride over to Bloomsbury; in which case her
                  letters had sometimes been lying there several days before she received them. Now
                  the mail came twice a week, and she always expected to hear by every other
                  mail.
               But no second letter came to Hetty, after the establishment of a
                  post-office at Hazleton. Directly after the mail came in by which she certainly
                  expected a letter from Harry, she called at the store, and asked in as careless a
                  tone as she could assume, "if there were any letters for their folks?"
               "Well, I don't rightly know, Hetty," said Aunt Patience, who was the only person
                  in the store; "the old gentleman took in the mail, and he's just stepped out, and
                  I've been so busy baking, that I haint had no time to look the letters over. No,
                  Hetty, no, there's only two letters in the drawer, and there aint neither of them
                  for none of your folks."
               "Three whole days to wait!" sighed Hetty, as she walked away from the
                  Post-Office.
               The next time the mail came in, Hetty was at the office, by the time Uncle Zeb had
                  taken the letters from the little bag in which they were brought over from
                  Bloomsbury.
               "I was just passing by, Uncle Zeb," said she, (oh! Hetty! what a fib!) "and I
                  thought I'd call and see if there was any letters for our people."
               "Wal, I'll see, Hetty, I'll see," wheezed the old man, drawing up as near to the
                  table as he could conveniently get, and slowly putting on his spectacles; "a
                  pretty heavy mail to-day, Hetty;â€”aâ€”prettyâ€”heavyâ€”mail! here's six letters in all,
                  and nine newspapers; Squire Hackett, and Dr. Phillips, have begun to take a New
                  York paper, since we've got a post-office of our own. I hope I shall get a chance
                  to look'em over before they call for'em. Now let's see about them letters, Hetty!
                  Here's one for old Mrs. Stebbins; why, it's a ship letter, I declare! Now I should
                  n't wonder if that was from Ike. You know Ike run awayâ€”oh I guess it was before
                  your recollection, Hetty; and 'twas thought likely he went to sea; I should n't
                  wonder now if that was from himâ€”how pleased the old lady will be, to be sure! And
                  here's one for Squire Hayes."
               "Oh that aint for me, Uncle Zeb, nor that next either; I never get such square
                  looking letters!" exclaimed Hetty, in an agony of impatience. "Just look on through the rest, if you please. I'm in
                  something of a hurry."
               "Yesâ€”walâ€”I be a looking," said Uncle Zeb, taking his own time
                  however, and making his own comments on each letter, as to who it might be from
                  and what might be its contents, while poor Hetty stood by hoping in each
                  superscription to see the well-known hand-writing.
               But no! there certainly was no letter for her, and with a sinking of heart
                  understood only by those who have experienced like disappointment, Hetty turned
                  towards home.
               "Harry must be sick," said she to herself; "I will wait till one more mail comes
                  in, and then if I hear no tidings of him I will write." Just then she met John
                  Hurlburt, who as well as Harry had gone to be clerk in a New York store, and had
                  just come home on a short leave of absence.
               "Ah! how are you, Hettyâ€”how are you?" said he giving her a hearty shake of the
                  hand. "I saw somebody just before I left the city," he added.
               "You did, hey?" said Hetty in a very indifferent tone; "well, I hope somebody was
                  well."
               "Oh yes, very well, and happyâ€”he had such a lovely young lady on his arm; oh! such
                  a beauty! she boards at the same house with himâ€”but I must hurry onâ€”for I have n't
                  seen our folks yet."
               "That's it, then!" said Hetty to herself, sighing as if her heart was broken,
                  "Harry has forgotten me already! I might have known he'd see some one in the city
                  that he would like better than a plain country girl. But I could n't think it of
                  Harry! so long as we have known and loved each other;" and the tears rolled down
                  poor Hetty's cheeks. "If that is the reason he does n't write to me," she
                  continued, "I'll just let him alone. I shan't trouble him with any more of
                     my letters, I can tell him."
               John called once at Squire West's during his stay at Hazleton, and found there
                  sitting with Hetty, a certain Aaron Gaylord, a clerk, or rather the
                  clerk of Col. Turner; a silly, gawky youth, who was desperately in love with
                  Hetty, but whom she disliked with her whole heart. John staid but a few moments;
                  but when he went back to New York he reported to Harry Seymour that he had found
                  Hetty looking very blooming and happy, and in close tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with a most interesting youth, who had arrived in the
                  village since they left, and from all appearances they were very devoted to each
                  other.
               Now in all this John had no idea of doing any serious mischief; he did not even
                  know that Harry and Hetty were engaged;
                  but suspecting their attachment to each other, he could not resist the occasion to
                  exercise his inveterate love of teazing. The reports he carried, however,
                  connected with the non-appearance of letters at the expected time, caused the
                  estrangement, and well nigh the final separation of two devoted hearts.
               "This is the reason then, that Hetty has ceased writing to me," said Harry to
                  himself. "Well, I've heard a great deal of the fickleness of woman, but I surely
                  thought if there was a true-hearted woman on earth, it was Hetty West;" and so
                  saying, Harry dashed away a tear. He was naturally proud and impetuous, and
                  without seeking an explanation, he said, that "Hetty might do as she pleased; if
                  she liked this stranger better than one who had known and loved her from
                  childhood, why, let her go; and he wished her joy with her choice."
               No more communications passed between these two young people, who seemed
                  determined on wrecking their own happiness, till one evening, on returning to his
                  lodgings, Harry found a package from Hazleton, left by one of Hetty's brothers,
                  who had come down to the city, but who did not wait to see him. It contained only
                  his own letters to Hetty, and the few little things he had given her.
               "Ah! she has remembered at last that there is such a being as Harry Seymour in
                  existence;" said he. "I suppose she is going to be married now, and this is a
                  gentle hint that she would like to have her own letters returned. Well! she shall
                  have them," and sitting down he began, in a most melancholy mood, to look over his
                  own letters to Hetty. To his surprise he found that his last letter was not there.
                  He remembered it well, for in it he had asked Hetty some questions, to which he
                  particularly wished an answer. A ray of hope shot into his heart. "Here may be
                  some mistake, after all," said he to himself, "and if I can get a few days' leave
                  of absence, I will take a journey to Hazleton, and find out all about this
                  business."
               The next week, as I was sitting by my window sewing, I raised my eyes on hearing
                  the latch of the gate raised, and who should I see coming up the gravel walk, but
                  Harry Seymour. I received him very coldly, for I thought he had treated my dear
                  friend Hetty, ill. He told me he had come to me first, to learn if Hetty was going
                  to be married.
               "Married," I exclaimed in astonishment, "to whom, pray? Hetty thought she was
                  going to be married to one who has treated her shamefully. Yes, I will say it,
                  Harry! you have ceased to write to her, and she has heard of your attentions to a
                  certain beautiful ful young lady, who
                  boards in the same house with you."
               "Now what under the sun does all this mean?" asked Harry in amazement. "I cease to
                  write to Hetty? why, she has never answered my last letter, and I have heard of
                  her receiving with so much pleasure, the attentions of a certain clerk of Col.
                  Turner."
               "What, Aaron Gaylord?" I actually screamed. "Why, she perfectly detests him! I've
                  known her to go round by the back road, half a mile out of her way, to avoid his
                  joining her; and only last week she gave him an answer that, I think, will quiet
                  him finally."
               "And now what is the story Hetty has heard about me, and from whom has she heard
                  it?" asked Harry, the clouds beginning to clear away from his frank, handsome
                  countenance.
               "Why, John Hurlburt." ("The scamp!" muttered Harry, "it was he who brought me the
                  story about Hetty!") "Well, he told her that he had met you walking in Broadway,
                  looking very happy, with a most beautiful young lady, who boards in the same house
                  with you, leaning on your arm."
               "Oh, now I remember," exclaimed Harry, "and its strange I never thought of it
                  before, there is a forlorn lorn old maid, an aunt of the lady with whom I board;
                  she is very deaf, and very disagreeable; the other young men who board there, have
                  a way of making fun of her, and for that reason I feel sorry for her, and always
                  take pains to treat her with civility. One day, as I was going home to my dinner,
                  I passed her in the street; she was puffing along, and seemed very tired, and so I
                  waited and offered her my arm to help her on the way. I remember now, John
                  Hurlburt passed me, and whispered in my ear, "I am going up to Hazleton next week,
                  and I'll tell Hetty of your devotion to the fair sex." I laughed, and never
                  thought of the circumstance again from that time to this. I shall go straight to
                  Hetty now, and sift this thing to the bottom, and if the rest of the mystery can
                  be explained as easily as this, I shall be so happy, that I believe I shall be
                  almost ready even to forgive John Hurlburt, though I do think he richly deserves a
                  cow-hiding."
               Harry, who was a great favorite in the village, was stopped by many an
                  acquaintance on his way to Squire West's; and as he was passing Uncle Zeb's door,
                  the old man, who was sitting in the door way, endeavoring to catch a draught of
                  air, hailed him, crying out,
               "Hullo! if here aint Harry Seymour! Wife! wife! why here's Harry Seymour back again! bless me! how the b'y's improved; I
                  should n't hardly have know'd him. Come in, Harry! come in! We've got the
                  post-office here, you see, since you left; come in, and look round a little; the
                  old lady's a cleaning to be sure, but you'll excuse all that I dare say."
               Though impatient to get on, Harry could not avoid stopping to shake hands with
                  Uncle Zeb and Aunt Patience. To his inquiries to the former, as to his health, the
                  old man answered,
               "Why tol'able, Harry! only tol'able! nothing to brag on; the azmy's been pretty
                  tough on me this summer."
               In the mean time the old lady, in the process of cleaning, had come to the
                  post-office proper, and giving the drawer a sudden jerk, out it came, and with it
                  out dropped a letter to the ground.
               "Why! what's this?" said the old lady picking it up, and looking at it closely, "I
                  thought all the last mail had been called for. Why! it's a letter for Hetty West,
                  as sure as I'm alive! it must have got caught behind the drawer, and been lying
                  there this good while, for there haint been no letter for Hetty, to my knowledge,
                  in months."
               Harry glanced at the letter as Aunt Patience was showing it to Uncle Zeb, and
                  recognized his own hand writing. It was the last letter he had written to Hetty,
                  three months before.
               "I am just on my way to Squire West's," he said, in as careless a tone as he could
                  assume, "and if you like I'll take the letter up to Hetty."
               The post-master handed it to him, sending with it numberless apologies.
               "He must have thought the old lady had given it to Hetty," he said,
                  "and she must have thought he had; and all the time it
                  had been stuck back there between the drawer and the table. He would take care
                  such a thing did not happen again, for no one could tell but trouble might come of
                  it."
               "Trouble enough!" said Harry, as he hurried on to Squire West's.
               Hetty tried to be reserved and cold when she met Harry, but she could not keep the
                  light of joy and hope from beaming in her face.
               "I have come, dear Hetty, the bearer of my own last letter to you," said Harry;
                  "strange to say it has just been discovered in this wonderful post-office of Uncle
                  Zeb's, while I was in the store."
               A very few moments sufficed for explanations, and then the course of true love was
                  all smooth again; and so it has continued ever since; for I saw them both with their lovely little family,
                  during my last visit to one of the pretty little villages on a certain western
                  river, where Harry is a prosperous merchant; and many a hearty laugh we had, over
                  reminiscences called up by one and another of days of childhood passed at

               A Lesson of Contentment.
               
                  
                     "Be content with such things as ye have."
                  
               
               IT was on a Saturday evening, in one of the western cities of our State, and in a
                  small but neat dwelling in one of the principal streets, that a little woman sat
                  busily sewing by the window, endeavoring to catch some of the last rays of
                  daylight, before it should be necessary to light her tallow candle. And as her
                  fingers flew over the beautiful and costly work upon which she was engaged, her
                  thoughts were as busy as they, and unconsciously to herself, as our thoughts will
                  sometimes do, they ran off to themes with which they had no business, and began to
                  get the little woman into trouble.
               For she was very tired; twice that day had she been obliged to rip out a great
                  part of her work, which, for many reasons, she was anxious to finish early, and
                  she had now reached that nervous time, of which most seamstresses
                  know something, when the work seems
                  drawing to its completion, when one is so heartily tired of it that it would be an
                  inexpressible relief to be able to lay it aside for a few moments, and rest the
                  weary eyes, and hands, and side, and yet the stitches must go on just so
                  regularly, and be taken just so carefully, till the work is finished.
               "Sophie, I must have a candle, I cannot see to take another stitch by
                  this light; and you must get your father's supper; I cannot stop even to take any
                  to-night," said the little woman, and then on ran the thoughts again, something
                  after this fashion:
               "Here I sit day after day, and plod, and work, and stitch from morning till night,
                  with never a moment for rest or for pleasure! And William, I am sure, works as
                  hard as a man can work, and brings home all his wages, and the boys and girls are
                  all industrious, (the little woman did not think then how much cause for comfort
                  these very things should give her, for, as I said before, she had allowed her
                  thoughts to run where they should not, and when that is the case, they will surely
                  lead us into bad places.)
               "And what does it all amount to?" continued these unruly thoughts; "we only just
                  manage at the close of the year to make both ends meet. To be sure we had begun to
                  lay up a little sum, when that unlucky fall of William's from the scaffolding laid
                  him up for months and put us all back again. Now only to think of the difference
                  between our lot and that of the people who live in that fine row of marble houses
                  opposite. I havn't time to look up now, but I suppose just as my tallow candle
                  comes to me, a servant steps in and touches the gas, and lights up those elegant
                  parlors; and just as we are going to our plain supper, (at least just as the rest
                  are, for I have no time to take a mouthful to-night,) they will sit down to their
                  splendid dinner, and then the carriages will roll up to take them to balls, or
                  parties, or the theatre, and it's nothing but enjoyment all day long. The money
                  comes in easily, and I dare say it is just as easy to spend it; now I suppose the
                  money spent on the lace with which I am flouncing this dress, would keep my family
                  in provisions a year. The most troublesome thing they have to think of is how they
                  shall pass away the time, while the longest day is not half long enough for all I
                  have to do. Heigh! ho! what a difference, eh? No lovely rides in the green country
                  for me; no time for even a walk for mere pleasure; nothing but work, work, work,
                  from morning till night." 
                     
                        "Oh why not some of the pain to them,
                        And some of the joy to me?"
                     
                  
               
               By this time the husband entered with a pleasant smile, happy that his Saturday's work was ended,
                  and he was at leisure to spend the evening with his family.
               "Well mother! at work yet," he exclaimed cheerfully; "here, hold your hands,
                  wifey, I've brought you my month's wages, as usual."
               "Oh, William! don't stop me," exclaimed the wife, I am afraid a little
                  impatiently, "lay the money in that drawer for the present; this dress must be
                  finished to-night, for Miss Moreton starts early Monday morning for Bâ€”, where she
                  is to attend a grand ball; and then I must take it home, and at the same time take
                  that mantilla to Miss Wilton, and that child's dress to Mrs. Harley. They've been
                  finished two or three days, but I had no time to take them home."
               "Hallo, mother!" exclaimed Thomas, the oldest boy, coming in accompanied by his
                  sister Ellen, "what do you think! Mr. Hare has raised my wages, and he never told
                  me of it till he put the money in my hand. Here, mother, take it all."
               "Well, I'm glad to hear it, my son; but don't come so near me, I am afraid you
                  will step on this lace, or shake the candle over it."
               "And here, mother," said Ellen, "are my month's wages, too; and I have got some
                  good news, as well as Tom; Madame Câ€” is going to take me into the trying-on room
                  after this, and I shall have less work and better pay."
               All these pleasant things should have taken the cloud from the little woman's
                  brow, but they did not, they only seemed to lift it a little.
               "Come, wifey! come to tea," said William, drawing up the table.
               "No, William, don't ask me to-night; I must finish this work and take it home. I
                  want the money to-night, and I did hope to get down street before the shops are
                  closed."
               "Oh, come, mother, come," urged the husband; "lay aside the work a few minutes; a
                  cup of tea will do you good, and your fingers will go faster than ever after
                  it."
               "They can't well go faster than they are going now," answered Mary, "and, indeed,
                  I must not stop for anything."
               The simple meal was over, and the rest of the family drew up around the cheerful
                  fire, the father with a newspaper, and the boys with their books, while the two
                  older girls washed up the tea-things; but the mother sat apart at her little table
                  as busy as ever, and the wrong thoughts had not yet got into the right track.
               
               In about an hour she started up hastily, exclaiming, "There! I am thankful to say
                  the last stitch is taken; now, Sophie, bring me the large paper box, and I'll pack
                  these things, and take them home."
               The mother was no sooner out of the house than William, laying down his paper,
                  said, "Girls, do you know what mother wanted the money, and wanted to go down
                  street to-night, for?"
               "Yes, I know, father," answered Sophie, "but perhaps mother would n't
                  like to have me tell."
               "If it is to get anything for herself, Soph, do tell us," said
                  Thomas, "for I've been thinking all the way home whether I could not get something
                  for her out of my wages."
               "Well, it is something for herself," said Sophie.
               "Oh, do tell us then, Sophie," urged the father, and Thomas, and Ellen, in a
                  breath.
               "Well, I happened to be down town with her the other day, when she went to take
                  some work home, and she stopped at Brown's, and looked at a blanket shawl; and
                  after we left there, she said she believed she would treat herself to it out of
                  this week's pay, for she had not been decent to go to church since cold weather
                  began."
               "What kind of a one was it, Soph?" asked Thomas, eagerly.
               "Brown and blue, it was the only one of the kind in the store; mother liked it
                  because it was so plain. The price was four dollars."
               The father now took two dollars from his earnings, Thomas put in one, and Ellen
                  one.
               "Now, Tom, scamper!" said the father, "and see if you cannot get back before
                  mother does;" and putting on his cap, Thomas darted off.
               In the meantime, the little woman had crossed the street, and going first to the
                  house of Mrs. Moreton, she ascended the broad marble steps, and rang the
                  door-bell.
               "I have brought home Miss Moreton's dress," she said to the servant who opened the
                  door. The man called to a maid-servant who was passing through the hall, and who
                  desired Mrs. Hanford to walk up to Miss Bella's room, as there might be some
                  alterations to make after the dress was tried on. Mrs. Hanford quietly entered the
                  room of the young lady, who was dressing for a party, and laying the box on a
                  chair, she took out the elegant dress, and held it up for her inspection.
               There was a poor cousin in the room who was assisting Miss Bella to dress, and who
                  held up both hands in admiration, exclaiming:
               
               "Oh, beautiful! lovely! I never saw anything so superb
                  as that lace!"
               But Miss Bella walked up and down the room in a state of great discomposure,
                  exclaiming:
               "I won't have it! I won't wear it! I won't touch it!"
               "Why, Bella! what do you mean?" asked the surprised cousin.
               "Why, do you believe I thought I had got some thing different from what any one
                  else would have pitched upon!" exclaimed the enraged Miss Bella; "and especially I
                  was determined to outshine Cornelia Wilton, for she is going to the ball too. Now
                  that lace cost twenty-five dollars a yard, and was cheap at that; I got the last
                  scrap Jones had, and I was sure there was no other as handsome in town; when what
                  does Cornelia Wilton do but find out somehow just what I intended to wear, and
                  send down to New York and get a lace a great deal handsomer. She says it
                  cost-twenty-five dollars a yard, but I don't believe a word of it. And then she
                  had Madame Câ€” to make it," sobbed Miss Bella. "And I know just what she will say,
                  she is just spiteful enough; she will go and say that she got hers first and I
                  tried to copy it. I won't have it, I say! and I don't care what becomes of
                  it."
               And the young lady tore across the room, and plunged her head in the bed, (it was
                  well it was a feather bed,) and screamed with rage.
               "Miss Bella, your mamma requests that you will not stamp round so, right over her
                  head, and talk so loud; she has got one of her bad nervous head-aches, and she
                  says the noise almost distracts her," said she house-keeper, coming in.
               "Well! I can't help it," answered the young lady. "I'm sure I am almost distracted
                  myself! everything always goes against me! and whenever I think I am going to
                  enjoy myself, something always happens to cross me! It is the most
                  provoking thing about that dress! Take it away, Kate; take it out of my sight; I
                  never want to look at it again."
               "Miss Bella," said the housekeeper in a low tone, "Mrs. Hanford is waiting; I
                  suspect she wants her pay."
               "Well, she must wait then; I'm sure I have n't a cent; I spent the last
                  to-day."
               "You will have to call again, Mrs. Hanford," said the housekeeper. "Miss Bella has
                  no change, and Mrs. Moreton is very sick to-day; indeed she is sick pretty much
                  all the time, poor lady; I don't know for my part what life is worth, when it is
                  such a scene of suffering as hers is."
               
               "And this is one of the houses at which I have looked with so much envy!" said
                  little Mrs. Hanford, as she left the house. "A vast deal of happiness here to be
                  sure!"
               The next house at which she was to call, was that of Mrs. Wilton. Again she was
                  conducted up stairs, and desired to take her seat in the hall. The servant entered
                  what seemed to be an elegant dressing-room, and presently returned, saying:
               "Mrs. Wilton is very busy talking with Mr. Henry just now, but she will see you
                  presently;" and the girl went down stairs. She had left the dressing-room door
                  partly open, and those in the room being so engaged in their conversation, that
                  they thought of nothing else, raised their voices so that what they said was
                  distinctly heard in the hall, where Mrs. Hanford sat an unwilling listener.
               "But what can I do, Henry?" were the first words Mrs. Hanford
                  caught.
               "Why, ask father for the money, can't you, mother; a few hundred dollars surely
                  can make no difference to him."
               "I can tell you it makes more difference than you imagine, Henry," answered his
                  mother. "Only to-day your father called me down to look at your sister's bills,
                  and he said we were all ruining him with our extravagance, and there must be a
                  change somewhere or there would come a crash soon. And all this money you have
                  persuaded me to ask him for, he thinks is for myself, and if you were to hear him
                  talk to me, I know you would pity me."
               "Well, mother, I'm sorry, but this money I must have to-night by fair means or
                  foul."
               "And you will not tell me what you want it for, Henry?"
               "I tell you I cannot, mother! I am involved in more ways than I can
                  describe to you, and if I don't have that money to-night terrible things will
                  happen; you may make up your mind to that. I tell you, mother, you will be sorry
                  then that you were not willing to make some sacrifice for me."
               "Oh Henry! my son! as if I had not made 
                     sacririfices
                     sacrifices
                  . Have I not given up to you one after another of my valuable things?
                  Have I not faced your father over and over again to beg for money for you, when I
                  knew how sternly he would receive me?"
               "And yet, mother, to save me from ruin and disgrace, you will not give me your
                  watch, and that diamond ring you never wear."
               "That watch was my mother's, Henry, and I cannot part with it; the ring for which
                  you have begged so often, was given me by your father, on our wedding-day, when, foolish thing that I was, I
                  thought wealth was sure to bring happiness. Oh! what bright anticipations I had
                  then, and how false they have all proved!"
               "Then there are my sisters," continued the young man, "with drawers full of
                  jewelry that they never think of putting on; they certainly are very selfish not
                  to be willing to give me some of it."
               "It would do no good, Henry; it is like pouring water into a sieve; in another
                  week you would come with demands just as urgent for more things to be converted
                  into money."
               "Well, mother, if you are determined not to assist me, there are two or three ways
                  of getting what I want," said the young man in a desperate tone, "some one of
                  which I will try this night, though any of them would land me in the State prison,
                  unless I am so clever as to avoid detection; or unless a pistol-shot, or a rope,
                  leaves them nothing but a lifeless body to arrest," he added, with a bitter laugh.
                  "I tell you I am desperate, mother; ready for anything."
               "Oh Henry! Henry! you will drive me crazy! Here, take my purse, there is a hundred
                  dollars in it, that I have tried to save to pay a bill to one who needs the money
                  badly enough; but take it all, and here is the diamond ring," said she with a
                  sigh; "there will soon come a time when I have nothing more to give; all this is
                  only putting off the evil day."
               "Well, mother, here is almost enough, that is, if I can get three
                  hundred dollars for the ring, which I doubt; now the watch, or one or two sets of
                  my sisters' jewelry, would make me all right."
               "That watch, I tell you, I cannot part with, my son," answered the
                  mother, sighing deeply; "but I will go up to your sisters' room, and if they have
                  not gone out, I will see what I can persuade them to do."
               As Mrs. Wilton stepped into the hall, the sight of the little dress-maker sitting
                  there, recalled to her mind what the servant had said.
               "Oh, Mrs. Hanford, I forgot," said she, "you have brought my mantilla; well, just
                  leave it, I cannot try it on now; I suppose you would like the money, hut it is
                  quite inconvenient for me to hand it to you just now. I will send it over some
                  time next week." And Mrs. Wilton went slowly up the stairs.
               "Another happy home!" exclaimed the little woman, as she went down the steps. "I
                  have but one place more to go to, and I am certain I shall not find unhappiness
                  there. The young, beautiful and wealthy Mrs. Harley, with her affectionate
                     husband and lovely children, must
                  have everything that they can wish;" so saying, she rang the
                  door-bell.
               The servant desired her to sit down in the hall, and again our little friend was
                  an unintentional listener to a conversation which was going on in the parlor.
               "I tell you, Ella, paradoxical as it may seem, that I honestly believe you are
                  unhappy because you have no desire ungratified."
               "Indeed, you are very much mistaken Clarence, if you think that. I can tell you I
                  have a great many ungratified desires."
               "Have n't I done everything since we were married, that I could think of, to make
                  you happy, Ella? Did n't I leave my business and take you to Europe when you took
                  the whim, though I would much rather have remained at home? Then I bought a
                  country-house because you took a liking to it, and fitted it up to please you, and
                  you tired of it after one summer; then you selected this house yourself, and just
                  as we were comfortable settled, as I thought, nothing would do but I must pull it
                  all to pieces to alter the ceilings and make them higher; and for six weeks I had
                  not a place to sit down in. I really thought I was doing a sensible thing when I
                  married a country clergyman's daughter. I am inclined to be a domestic man myself,
                  and, fool that I was, one of my castles in the air was a comfortable home to which
                  I could retire in the evening, and find there a sensible little wife who would sit
                  at her sewing while I read aloud to her. But oh! how different it is! Your desires
                  have increased with their gratification, till I do believe the fortune of the
                  Rothschilds would not satisfy you."
               "Oh Clarence! how cruel you are!" answered the sobbing wife from the sofa on which
                  she had thrown herself. "I am not so unreasonable as you think, and it certainly
                  is not such an unattainable thing that I want now."
               "Well, let's hear it then, Ella; what is it?"
               "Why, Clarence, when we had our ceilings painted in fresco, I really thought our
                  house would far surpass the Moretons, and I meant to give a great party just to
                  show it off; but before I was well enough after the birth of the baby to give the
                  party, Mrs. Moreton went and pulled her house to pieces and raised the ceilings
                  higher than ours; and, oh Clarence, they are so beautiful! Only think of it! she
                  has had people come all the way from New York, and before I had even heard that
                  there were such things, she has had her ceilings made of pa-pier ma-che!" This was
                  said with a sob of anguish.
               "Well, if this is not past bearing!" exclaimed Clarence Harley, striding up and down the room. If
                  I were able to get ceilings of gold for you, Mrs. Moreton, or Mrs.
                  somebody else, would be determined not to be outdone by you, and they would come
                  out with theirs studded with jewels, and then you would be as wretched as you are
                  now. No, Ella! you never will be contented; there will always be some one a little
                  more grand, and there is no use in trying to please you! I give it up!"
               Nothing was heard now but the sobs of the distressed lady.
               "I am not naturally inclined to dissipation," continued the husband, still pacing
                  up and down the room; "but you cannot wonder if I am driven to places where, after
                  my hard day's work, I can see cheerful faces, and hear something besides
                  fretfulness and repining. My conscience is clear, Ella, as far as your happiness
                  is concerned, and if you will fret and make yourself miserable, you must do it
                  alone. So wishing you a better humor, I will bid you good night;" and the unhappy
                  husband dashed out of the house.
               Mrs. Hanford now ventured to touch the door-bell again.
               "Oh! have you been waiting all this time?" said the servant, taking the little
                  dress from her. Then opening the parlor door, he said, "Mrs. Hanford has brought
                  home Miss Bella's dress, ma'am."
               "Well, lay it down, John."
               "I think she's waiting for the money, ma'am."
               "Well, my purse is clear up stairs, and no one can get it but me, and I do not
                  feel able to go up for it to-night. She must call again some time or other, when
                  it is more convenient for me to give it to her."
               "Is there no such thing as happiness in all the fine houses in this great city?"
                  said Mary Hanford to herself as she descended Mr. Harley's steps and turned
                  towards home.
               Ah, had she gone from one handsome dwelling to another, and asked that question,
                  we venture to say that if she had received an honest answer from all those whose
                  hopes centre in this earth, not one could have been found who, in all sincerity,
                  could declare himself perfectly contented with his present lot. There is always
                  some wish ungratified, some distress of mind or body, something to pine for or
                  regret.
               It is not in the nature of earthly things to satisfy an immortal mind. Everything
                  says to the dwellers on earth, "This is not your rest." Only the Christian can
                  honestly declare himself contented; only he can speak with certainty of a coming time, of which he can say "I
                     shall be satisfied."
               "Well, wifey, and what success?" asked William Hanford, as his wife entered the
                  door.
               "The people in those grand houses were none of them able to give me any money
                  William," she answered, "but they have given me what is far better, and what it
                  seems all their wealth cannot purchase for themselves, a feeling of perfect
                  satisfaction and contentment with my own condition. I had dared to indulge in some
                  repining thought as I sat at my work this evening, and contrasted my circumstances
                  with theirs, which in my blindness I fancied so much more happy. But I have seen
                  my error. I have found envy and jealousy, sickness and trouble, complaining wives
                  and undutiful children; and I have returned a happy woman to my kind husband and
                  affectionate children, and bless God for such a healthy, happy family."
               Just then Thomas opened the door and threw the shawl over her shoulders,
                  exclaiming:
               "Why! it covers our little mother all up, does n't it?"
               "What under the sun does this mean?" asked Mary in astonishment.
               "It means that father, and Nelly, and I ask you to accept this shawl, dear
                  mother," said Thomas, kissing her; "and we should n't have known about it if it
                  had n't been for Sophie, and she and the little ones are only waiting till they
                  can earn something themselves to ask you to accept a present from them."
               "Come, wife," said her husband, for the little woman's eyes were full, and though
                  she tried she could not speak one word, "come, wife, don't take off the shawl,
                  just take a cup of tea that the girls have ready for you, and then we will take a
                  walk down street and buy some things for to-morrow. The children have their books,
                  and they will keep each other company till we come back."
               "Ah! poor Mrs. Wilton!" said Mary, as she left the door and looked across at the
                  brilliantly-lighted mansion, "instead of my envying her, how much reason she has
                  to envy me my kind, affectionate husband and dutiful children, who, instead of
                     begging from me, vie with each other to see who can do the most to
                  make me happy. How truly does the wise man say: 'Better is little with the fear of
                  the Lord, than great treasure and trouble therewith.'"
            
            
               
               The Husband of a Widow.
               NEVER was a wiser piece of advice put into the mouth of any person, real or
                  imaginary, than that which Dickens makes the elder Weller give to his hopeful son,
                  "Never marry a vidder, Samivel," and I would add from my own bitter experience,
                  especially if she have a family of young children.
               Amelia Dart was "my first love, my last love, my only love." For a long time I
                  fondly imagined that my feelings were reciprocated, when just as I was making up
                  my mind how I should proceed to pop the question, whether it should be in a
                  star-light ramble, or on perfumed paper, the astounding intelligence was conveyed
                  to me, without any previous warning, that Amelia was 
                     engagaged
                     engaged
                   to Tom Benson.
               It was a most cruel blow! I cannot bear even now to think of those nights of
                  agony, when I walked the floor, wishing for the morning, that I might find some
                  relief in the bustle and noise of the day; or of those days of restlessness when I
                  rushed from one scene of excitement to another, longing for the night, that I
                  might throw off the mask, and indulge my grief, unwitnessed and undisturbed. At
                  length I determined to go to Europe. I sailed the very day Amelia was married, and
                  I found even the 
                     
                        "Stormiest sea a resting place,
                        For him who left such grief on shore."
                     
                  
               
               I was absent about six years, roaming hither and thither, seeing everything that
                  was to be seen, but never able to drive the image of Amelia from my constant
                  heart, when just as my funds were exhausted, with the exception of about enough to
                  enable me to reach home, I heard of the death of Amelia's husband.
               I will not attempt to describe my feelings; I did struggle to keep down the wicked
                  part of them, but I immediately set sail for home, determined to resume my study
                  of the law, which this unfortunate affair had interrupted; by the time I was ready
                  to practiceâ€”who could tell?
               Two years dragged slowly by, and at the end of that time I again took up my abode
                  in Câ€”, and resumed my acquaintance with Amelia. She was now twenty-six, and I was
                  two years older; but the years had gone lightly over Amelia's head, and she was far lovelier than at eighteen.
                  There was a dignity and grace about the woman, which had been wanting in the girl,
                  and in short it would be hard to imagine anything more enchanting than Amelia
                  appeared to me, after our long, and to me sad separation.
               Time, however, had added a few charms to my former love, which I could well have
                  dispensed with. Amelia was now the mother of four children, all boys; but I was so
                  infatuated that these four appendages seemed to me but little trials, (and in
                  truth they were so in one sense,) in comparison with the thought of again losing
                  my beloved Amelia. When I at length found courage to make known my sentiments, and
                  was so happy as to find that they were reciprocated, all else was forgotten in the
                  happiness of being the accepted lover of so charming a creature.
               Those who love to croak, say, "that every rose has its thorn, and every sweet its
                  sting," and I don't know but they say true; certain it is, that for every moment
                  of delightful intercourse with Amelia, I was made to suffer from the sting of one
                  of the young Bensons.
               Amelia was a most doting, indulgent mother. She did not believe in turning off her
                  children to the care of servants, but attended to all their wants and complaints
                  plaints herself. I had become so convinced before I offered myself, that one way
                  to her heart, and perhaps the shortest cut, was by taking all due
                  notice of the children, (having heard, too, that she had said to a friend that she
                  would never marry any man who was not fond of them,) that I had done violence to
                  my feelings, and petted and fondled these four young plagues, squandering upon
                  them my loose change (of which I had little enough) in the purchase of candy,
                  oranges, &c., as by so doing I sometimes purchased for myself a few moments
                  quiet conversation with Amelia.
               Indeed, for the undisturbed half-hour in which I found opportunity to make my
                  declaration, I was indebted to a pound of candy, which I sent them out to the
                  porch to divide among themselves. Unfortunately, however, these little attentions
                  in part defeated their own object, for they made me such a prime favorite with the
                  young folks, that my arrival at the house was the signal for a simultaneous rush
                  by the four young torments to the parlor; and Amelia had not the heart to dismiss
                  them, and looked so hurt if I hinted that it would be agreeable to dispense with
                  their company for a time, that I did not dare to urge the point.
               I usually tried to get an hour every morning to devote vote to Amelia, and as the incidents of one such
                  morning-call, will serve as a pretty fair specimen of all the rest, I will just
                  describe it here. I slip into the house very quietly, desiring the girl, in a tone
                  of voice hardly raised above a whisper, to inform her mistress that Mr. Gâ€” is in
                  the parlor. Amelia enters looking most lovely in her simple white morning dress
                  and neat little apron. A few words are exchanged, when Amelia exclaims:
               "Oh, excuse me one moment, Charles; I forgot to tell that neglectful
                  girl, Nancy, to dress Bobby and Frank." In a few minutes Amelia returns, and just
                  then comes a roar from the garden:
               "Oh, dear! one of the children is hurt!" groans Amelia, and she rushes off leaving
                  me again solus. She is gone much longer this time, and returns breathless,
                  saying:
               "Poor little Bobby fell down with his face in the gravel, and do you believe he
                  would not let anybody pick him up till I came, and then no one else must wash his
                  face, or bind up his head."
               She closes the door, and takes her seat by me on the sofa, when immediately there
                  is a tap at the door, and Nancy's by no means gentle tones are heard:
               "Miss Benson, now that there butcher's come, and he wants to know
                  what you'll have for dinner; he's got mutton, and lamb,
                  and veal!"
               "Excuse me a moment, Charles," says Amelia, and another five minutes are taken up
                  in conversation with the butcher. Amelia at length returns, and has just seated
                  herself by me again, when again Nancy's shrill voice is heard at the door:
               "Now, Miss Benson, Bobby's a screamin', and a screechin', and a kickin', and he
                  declares he won't be dressed, no how. Won't you just come and see to him a
                  minute?" Exit Amelia again.
               She has hardly returned when Nancy screams again:
               "Miss Benson, some one wants you to the door."
               The conference with this "some one" proves a very long one, and my hour is rapidly
                  passing away. But at length Amelia comes back, and I begin to propose to her some
                  of my cherished plans, when the door bursts open, and master Tommy rushes in,
                  bellowing tremendously, followed by Dicky, dragging a little tin horse and
                  wagon.
               "Now, ma, my wagon's broke, and Dick won't let me take his; won't you make
                  him?"
               Amelia tries to settle the difficulty, but the dispute waxes hotter, till in the
                  hope of getting rid of the young rebels for a while, I draw a quarter from my pocket, (it was the last but one,) and
                  tossing it to Tommy, told him to run down town and buy himself a horse and
                  wagon.
               "Then his'll be the best!" roars Dicky, making up a horrible face. "I
                  want a quarter too!" there is no help for it. My last quarter must go; with a
                  shout of delight the young rascals rush out of the house. But the peace I have
                  purchased at so great a sacrifice, proves of short duration; for they have no
                  sooner gone, than in rush Bobby and Frank.
               "Now, ma, the boys has got a penny; and we want a penny too."
               I toss them each a copper.
               "No, we want white money, like Tommy's and Dicks."
               Two fippenny bits are the next sacrifice wrung from my reluctant pocket, and just
                  as I have fairly rid the house of them, and Amelia is ready to talk to me as it
                  would seem undisturbed, my hour is up, and I have an engagement that must be
                  attended to down town.
               If I attempted to take an evening stroll with Amelia, it was no better. I would
                  try to get her off quietly, and unseen, when, just as we reached the gate, she
                  would stop and say:
               "Oh, Charles, I must run back one moment, to see that that careless Nancy gives
                  the two little ones their bread and milk." By the time she reached the gate again,
                  a little night-capped head would be thrust from the window, with the cry:
               "Ma, ma, don't go out."
               "Just a few moments, Bobby dear."
               "No! I say you shan't!"
               "Oh, dear! Charles, I don't see as I can go."
               "Won't candy do?" I asked, for I always kept a plentiful supply for such occasions
                  in my pocket.
               "Well, perhaps it will," answered Amelia; "I will try." And running back, she
                  succeeded in a few moments in quieting number three. Just preparing to leave the
                  gate again, when the cry came from number four:
               "Ma, come back and kiss me!"
               "Good little soul!" exclaimed Amelia, "he does not insist upon my staying;" and
                  for the third time she ran back, and when she appeared again I hurried her away,
                  before the candy should be all eaten up. But before we had gone a rod from the
                  gate, came a cry from the oldest hope:
               "Ma, where are you going?"
               "Oh! only to take a little walk, Tommy; mamma will be back in a few
                  moments."
               "No! wait for me, I'm coming too;" and in spite of remonstrances and promises on the
                  part of the indulgent mamma, master. Tommy persisted in favoring us with his
                  company, seizing tight hold of my unwilling hand.
               Presently came the pattering of another pair of little feet, and our pleasant
                  party received the delightful addition of master Dick's company. And then came a
                  fight which should have possession of my hand: this contest Amelia witnessed with
                  undisguised delight, remarking that she really believed the dear little fellows
                  were fonder of me already than they were of her. The only way the quarrel was
                  adjusted, was by allowing master Tommy to take my cane for a horse, and taking the
                  hand of torment the second.
               You may imagine how pleasant and romantic was this evening ramble, taken up with
                  settling disputes between the two interesting young characters who accompanied us,
                  and worrying about the two at home, lest they should be unhappy and cry for mamma,
                  when they had eaten up all their candy.
               One day I tried to take Amelia out for a drive, and really hoped we should be able
                  to get off unobserved, the two eldest being at play in the back garden, and the
                  youngest being in process of preparation for a ride in their own little wagon. But
                  before Amelia had given all due directions to the young nurse, Nancy, about the
                  care of her charges during the absence of the mamma, (for which purpose she
                  returned to the house four different times after she had fairly had her foot on
                  the step of the buggy,) these two oldest responsibilities came rushing around the
                  house, and before I could interpose to prevent it, had clambered over the wheel
                  into the buggy, insisting upon it that they were going to ride too. I mildly
                  requested them to alight, but Amelia said, in her most coaxing way:
               "Oh, no, Charles, they would enjoy it so; and it is so seldom they get a ride.
                  They can sit down there on the floor in front of us, as well as not."
               With a sigh of despair I assented, when as fate would have it, just as we were
                  going to start, that young imp of a nurse, who seemed born to be the bane of my
                  existence, and who, I know, had hurried all she could in the hope of getting a
                  ride, came round the house, dragging the long wagon, in which rode master Bob and
                  Frank, face to face. Immediately there were two distinct howls, and four little
                  hands stretched towards us, with the cry: "me go too! me go too!"
               I cannot attempt to describe the state of my feelings now, when Amelia, looking
                  over the back of the seat said:
               
               "Now, Charles, I don't see but Nancy could get in there as well as not with the
                  little boys, and sit on the floor; and it would make them all so happy."
               This was just what Miss Nancy, who much preferred riding to
                     drawing, had been aiming at; and in another moment she and the two
                  youngest hopes had clambered in at the back of the wagon, the young nurse in a
                  very giggle of delight at the success of her manÅ“uvre, and stowed themselves
                  comfortably on the floor. My patience was, for once, thoroughly exhausted, and I
                  exclaimed:
               "Well, Amelia, if I am engaged to you, I do n't see as it follows
                  that I am engaged to all these children, and the nurse too!"
               But Amelia looked so deeply grieved at this unfeeling speech, that I saw at once
                  that I was treading on very tender ground, and hastened to atone, as speedily as
                  possible, for my cruelty. If Amelia had not been in, I cannot answer for the kind
                  of tricks that horse might have performed. They say it is the same as murder, to
                  wish in the heart for the disappearance of any individual, or individuals, from
                  this sublunary sphere. It is well it is not so considered in the eyes of the law,
                  else a certain genteel figure I wot of, might have been seen, long ere this,
                  dangling ingloriously between heaven and earth. Just
                  imaginenow, an engaged young gentleman, driving out his
                  lady-love, with two children on the floor in front, and two more and a nurse on
                  the floor behind!
               Well, I married Amelia; and I may say I married the children too; and now my
                  troubles seemed but to have begun. I am a very particular man about my dress; at
                  least I was so once; but where is the use? At this very identical moment, as I
                  write, my handsomest pair of slippers, worked for me by Amelia's fair fingers, are
                  going about the yard as vehicles for the carting of gravel, with a string tied
                  through the heel of each; and that same gravel, when it reaches its destination,
                  is dumped into my new fashionable beaver, which arrived only last week from
                  Genin's!
               "Why don't I rush out, and rescue my valuable things from such desecration?" My
                  friend, there is no use at all in such a proceeding; I have tried it over and over
                  again; the moment my back is turned, something more valuable will be seized on as
                  a source of amusement for these rapacious young Goths. I never can find my cane,
                  till I have been on a voyage of discovery all over the garden: I never lay down my
                  watch for a moment, that it is not borne off in triumph around the neck of one of
                  my graceless step-sons. My best razors are taken to whittle out masts for boats,
                  and yet not one of them has ever
                  severed an artery yet: my whisk-broom, sacred in intention to my best broad-cloth,
                  sweeps the sidewalks; and my nicest hair-brush is used, after being dipped in soap
                  and sand, to scrub the hobby-horse!
               My friend, did you ever make your nightly bed on bread crums dried?
                  If not, you are by no means prepared to sympathize with me, in one of the sources
                  of trouble that grate continually on my feelings. I've heard those
                  self-tortured devotees spoken of with astonishment and admiration, who sleep night
                  after night on a bed strewn with dried peas. Why! peas are
                     round and smooth! If they want to endure anything
                  that deserves the name of martyrdom, let them get into a bed where a child has
                  been eating itself to sleep, on bread and butter, or crackers; let them try it I
                  say, just for once!
               I had a friend come to town, whose acquaintance I had made in Europe. He was a
                  gay, dashing young bachelor; very neat and particular as to his dress, and very
                  fastidious in all respects. He came when I had been married about a week; and when
                  I met him in the street, he began to joke me about marrying a widow with four
                  children. All I could do, was to take him home with me, and show Amelia to him, as
                  some excuse for my folly.
               As we approached the gate, who should stand awaiting us, but that torment of a
                  nurse, with the youngest boys, whose hands and faces were guiltless of water since
                  their last lunch of bread and molasses. My heart died within me as we neared the
                  gate, for I thought I descried a gleam of malignant satisfaction in that young
                  nurse's eye. As soon as we came within hearing distance she called out:
               "There now, Bobby and Franky, run to meet Poppy!" and sure enough off
                  they both scampered, and soon each had one leg of my white pantaloons clasped in
                  its dirty arms. It was well for the young ones that I just then spied Amelia
                  watching for me from the window. I cannot answer for the consequences had not her
                  restraining glance been fixed upon me.
               My friend, who seemed bursting with the effort to restrain his merriment, accepted
                  my reluctant invitation to dinner. Poor fellow! if he took any unamiable
                  satisfaction in my evident mortification, I was amply avenged before dinner was
                  over. His unconcealed admiration of Amelia, however, acted as a balm to my wounded
                  spirit. I took Amelia aside before dinner, and implored her to take measures to
                  keep the two youngest from the table, telling her that my friend was very
                  particular, and by no means fond of children. I saw that he fell at once several
                  degrees in her estimation, but for that there was no help.
               
               Directions were given to Nancy, to keep Bobby and Frank out of sight till dinner
                  was over; but this was a proceeding not all to Miss Nancy's mind, who usually took
                  that time to visit a neighboring friend. So what does she do, but very cleverly
                  allow them to give her the slip, and just as we had seated ourselves at the table,
                  and Amelia was dispensing a very hot, and very delicious soup, in they both
                  rushed, and each seizing a high chair, they placed themselves on either side, and
                  in very close proximity to my unhappy friend.
               I saw that he was in agony, and was kept in a state of continual shrinking, first
                  from one of his near neighbors, and then from the other; till, as might have been
                  expected, just in the midst of dinner, Master Bob turned his saucer of hot soup
                  directly over my friend's spotless pantaloons, while at the same moment, Master
                  Frank, from the other side, drenched him with cold water.
               With a smile of anguish, my friend rubbed the scalded leg endeavoring to
                  perpetrate some witticism about a hot and a cold bath at the same time, but I saw
                  that it was all that the habit of politeness could effect, to restrain him from
                  bursting out into some exclamations of a very different sort. I took him up stairs
                  and gave him a clean pair of pantaloons; and this is the last time I have dared to
                  ask a friend to dinner.
               I did try to have a supper party once, for some friends to whom I wanted to show a
                  little attention; and we thought we had kept it safe from the young fry, who, to
                  my great relief, were snugly stowed in bed before the guests appeared. But I have
                  always thought that young wretch of a Nancy gave them a hint of what was going on,
                  on purpose to torment me; for just in the midst of supper we heard a titterâ€”and
                  then another, and, through the folding-doors, we spied four figures in white,
                  peeping in. They darted away with shrieks of laughter on being discovered; but
                  soon returned, and continued to rush back and forth, giggling, and dodging, and
                  snickering, till supper was over.
               These are but a small portion of my daily and nightly annoyances. The patience of
                  Job surely had no trial like mine; sore bereavements I could stand, but these
                  daily and hourly petty trials are wearing me to skin and bone. My health has
                  really suffered; my physicians prescribe change of air; but I cannot go without
                  Amelia; she will not stir without the four boys and Nancy. Again I say, my friend,
                  never get so entangled as to feel it necessary to your happiness to marry a widow,
                  especially if she have a family of young children.
            
            
               
               Discriminating Charity;
               OR, A CHARITY THAT ENDED AT HOME.
               "AN orange! Fanny, do listen to that! Did you ever hear anything to equal the
                  impertinence of these street-beggars? The child wants two or three pennies to buy
                  an orange for her father! I declare I believe that instead of asking
                  for cold victuals they will soon come round begging for Charlotte-Russe and
                  ice-cream.
               "You certainly cannot deny that in the latter case they would be asking for
                     'cold victuals," answered the one addressed as Fanny, and the
                  silvery voices of the two elegantly-dressed young ladies joined in a merry chorus
                  of laughter; while the little suppliant before them grew pale and red by turns,
                  and the quivering lip showed that the tears of mortification and grief were ready
                  to flow down her cheeks.
               Just then a tall, fine-looking young man, who was passing by, touched his hat to
                  the two young ladies, and paused for a moment to speak to them.
               
               
                  
                     STOOPING TOWARDS HER, HE TOOK HER LITTLE HAND IN HIS. Page 175
                  
               
               "Oh, Doctor Glentworth!" said the first speaker, "here is too good a joke to be
                  lost; I should really like to know if your philanthropy extends to a case like
                  this. What do you think now, doctor, of feeding street-beggars with oranges, and
                  such like dainties, for an opportunity of exercising our benevolence in that line
                  has just been presented to us."
               Dr. Glentworth looked down upon the little creature, whose apron was now at her
                  eyes, and then stooping towards her, he took her little hand in his, and in his
                  kind, pleasant voice, said:
               "Why do you want an orange, my dear?"
               "Oh, Sir! it's no matter," sobbed the child; "I did not know it would be bad or
                  wrong to ask for an orange for papa. He was once used to having all such nice
                  things; but we are poor now, and papa is sick with a burning fever, and the water
                  we have to drink is so warm; and this morning I heard him say, 'Oh if
                  I only had an orange!' but he didn't know any one heard him, and when mamma gave
                  me five cents, and told me to go and get a loaf of bread, I thought I would ask
                  the first nice, kind looking lady I met, if she would give me two or three
                  pennies, because I thought it would please papa so, if I took him an orange. I am
                     not a 'street-beggar,' Sir, as the lady called me; I never asked
                  for a cent before in my life;" and here
                  the sobs of the little creature choked her utterance.
               "Come with me, my dear," said the kind young doctor, keeping the little hand in
                  his, "and we will see if we can find an orange for papa;" and then touching his
                  hat, and bowing less cordially than before to the two young ladies, he said in a
                  grave tone:
               "Miss Alice, I hope you may never know what it is to pine in vain for one of those
                  luxuries which now surround you in such profusion;" and, leading the little
                  stranger by the hand, he passed down the street.
               Alice More's conscience smote her; she was not hard-hearted, only
                     thoughtless. Had she seen the home of the child from whom she had
                  just parted, and been made acquainted with the circumstances of the family there,
                  she would gladly have emptied her purse into their hands, if they would have
                  received her bounty; but she did not trouble herself to think of the
                  poverty and distress which did not appeal directly to her senses. She was not in
                  the habit of seeking out, in order to relieve, cases of suffering. Oh no! that was
                  too disagreeable, too trying, too dirty work for the refined and
                  elegant Alice More.
               But the heart of Alice, as well as her conscience, was somewhat
                  troubled by the scene in which she had just borne a part. She knew, she felt, that
                  she had fallen in the estimation of the handsome and interesting Theodore
                  Glentworth, who had lately paid her marked attention, and whose approach already
                  caused her a fluttering of the heart, which the presence of no other of her many
                  admirers had power to produce.
               "And yet why should I care!" she said to herself for about the twentieth time; "if
                  Doctor Glentworth chooses to think less of me for refusing to give an orange to a
                  beggar, I can very well afford to lose his attentions."
               Oh, Alice! Alice! it was not that! it was your want of thought, of
                     feeling, of discrimination! Doctor Glentworth would
                  have esteemed you no more highly, had he seen you rather ostentatiously put a
                  dollar into the hand of that handsome Italian boy the other day, who won your
                  sympathies by his 'lovely black eyes, and his sweet,
                     charming voice,' and who told you one lie, and had another ready
                  for the next passer-by. Dr. Glentworth believes no more in 'feeding street-beggars
                  with oranges, and such-like dainties,' than you do, Alice; but had you been as
                  well accustomed to the different phases of human suffering as was the kind young
                  doctor, you would have taken a good look at the sweet face of the
                  young child before you; you would have
                  noticed the clean, though well-patched garments, and the nicely-arranged hair; and
                  your imagination might have pictured to you the possibility of suffering never
                  before experienced, and of a longing for luxuries once common, but now through
                  poverty untasted and unknown.
               And how many there are like Alice, kind enough people at heart, who take no pains
                  to acquaint themselves with cases of unobtrusive suffering, perhaps within a
                  stone's throw of their very doors, while, in order to get rid of an importunate
                  beggar, they give blindly and carelessly, most likely to some unworthy wretch,
                  with a story or a petition got up in order to deceive.
               Blessings on those who seek out in unfrequented lanes, the poor and suffering, who
                     "visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction"! And a
                  blessing does come upon them even before the words "ye have done it unto me," fall
                  upon their ears; a blessedness which the careless giver can never know; the
                  consciousness of having admitted one ray of comfort and hope into the abode of
                  uncomplaining poverty.
               Doctor Glentworth talked pleasantly and cheerfully with the little girl whose hand
                  he held in his own, as they walked together down the street, and in a few moments
                  her tears were dried, and her little confiding heart opening to the gentle tones
                  of kindness, she had made the good young doctor acquainted with all that she
                  herself knew of the circumstances of the family. From the simple and artless
                  answers of the child, and from what he afterwards gathered, the doctor became
                  acquainted with the following facts in relation to the sick man whom he was about
                  to visit.
               Malcolm Worthington was born in one of the most elegant of those lawn-surrounded,
                  tree-shaded mansions on the banks of the beautiful Hudson. Here his father dwelt
                  in the enjoyment of every luxury that money could procure. The old gentleman was
                  reputed wealthy; perhaps he thought himself so; at all events he lived as if his
                  means were abundant, and the source from whence they were derived, unfailing. He
                  was careless, extravagant, open-handed, and hospitable; his house, through the
                  pleasant summer months, was filled with friends, who were glad to
                  escape from the heat and dust of the city, and spend a part at least of the summer
                  in so cool and lovely a spot as "Silent-shades." The old man provided for to-day,
                  literally "giving no thought to the morrow;" not from any trust in the care of an
                  over-ruling Providence however, but from the sheerest and most improvident
                  carelessness.
               
               The sons were sent to college, because other young men went there, but after that
                  they did as they chose; no one proposed to them to study a profession; no such
                  idea was ever hinted to them as the possibility of their being obliged, at some
                  future day, to do aught for their own support. Their father had
                  always lived elegantly on the means he had inherited from his father,
                  and somehow, if they ever gave a thought to the matter at all, they expected to do
                  the same. So their time was passed during the summer in hunting, and boating, and
                  fishing, with the friends who visited them from the cities, and in the winter they
                  either returned these visits, to friends as hospitably disposed as themselves, or
                  passed their time at some large hotel in the city, entering into all the
                  dissipation and gaiety which on all sides offered attractions for them.
               Their demands upon their father for money were generally met, and little recked
                  they if the stream only flowed to them, what might be the state, or
                  depth, of the fountain from which it proceeded. As for the old gentleman, he took
                  all things easily. If dunning letters came to him, as come they often did, he did
                  not allow them to trouble him, neither did he trouble others with them. At length,
                  in answer to some large and urgent demands, he was induced, in compliance with the
                  suggestions of his creditors, to mortgage his estate to its full value, and thus
                  it happened that when the old man fell down one day in an apoplectic fit, and was
                  gathered to his fathers, his sons found, to their infinite amazement, that six
                  feet of earth was all they could claim for him, and for themselves not even
                  that.
               With the fate of the family in general we have nothing to do. One son we know
                  occupied for some time a subordinate place in a billiard-room; another was for
                  many years the non-salaried, but very appropriate sign of a low
                  drinking establishment in one of the smaller streets in New York; of the fortunes
                  or misfortunes of the rest, with the exception of the hero of our story, we are
                  not informed.
               Malcolm was saved from the vices of his brothers, by an early marriage with the
                  lovely and pious orphan niece of one of their neighbors on the river. Mary Graham
                  was utterly dependent upon those who had given her a home, rather reluctantly it
                  was thought, and therefore it was with the most cordial approbation that they
                  witnessed the attentions of Malcolm Worthington; and she, poor thing, was happy to
                  leave a situation where she had drudged unrewarded and unloved for years, and
                  remove as she thought to a home of plenty and opulence. She was devotedly attached to her husband, too, and for
                  the six or seven years that she lived in the house of old Mr. Worthington, she was
                  very happy, far happier than she had been at any time since the death of her
                  parents.
               But when the old gentleman died, and the true state of his affairs was disclosed;
                  when they found themselves with three little children, homeless, penniless, and
                  without resource of any kind, they were nearly overcome by the shock.
               "What is to become of us, Mary?" asked Malcolm, in a tone of
                  despair.
               "What? why we must do as many another poor person doesâ€”we must go to
                     work," answered Mary.
               "Work! but what is there I can do, child? I am in the condition of a certain man
                  whose story I have heard sometimes when I have been to church; 'I cannot digâ€”to
                  beg I am ashamed.' Besides, even if I could bring my mind to beg, or try to
                  borrow, or even to ask for employment, from those fine city friends
                  who have enjoyed my father's hospitality for so many summers, I do not believe
                  they would be able to recognize me now, even with the aid of their
                  eye-glasses."
               "But you have had a good education, Malcolm: can you not in any way turn it to
                  account?"
               "Yes, I suppose if I were to go to work, and brush up my knowledge of arithmetic,
                  book-keeping, &c., I might make a second or third rate clerk, and possibly
                  earn bread for you and the children. Oh! what a miserable, worthless, butterfly
                  life, I have led. My father must have known that he had nothing to
                  leave us; why did he not bring us up with the idea of doing something
                  for ourselves! It was cruel! yes, I will say it, Maryâ€”it was wicked! to leave us
                  in such perfect ignorance of the state of his affairs; to bring us up as if we
                  were each entitled to an independent fortune, and then leave us without a cent in
                  the world! Well! I have the horse my Uncle Malcolm gave me, and a few other things
                  I can call my own. My father's things are all coming to the hammer; but these are
                  really mine, and need not go to satisfy his creditors."
               "And there is my piano, and two or three sets of jewelry left me by my mother,
                  Malcolm," said Mary; "do the best you can with them; they may keep us in bread
                  till you can find employment."
               "And then, Mary, we will move westward; I will ask no favors of mis-called
                     friends; I am too proud for that; and if by my own industry I can
                  make a bare support for my family, I shall feel more independent, and shall know,
                  I think, more real happiness, than has
                  been mine in all these years of idleness and folly." And so it was that Malcolm
                  Worthington found himself with his family, in one of the midland cities of our
                  State, without any object in resting there, except that, so far as he knew, there
                  was not a creature in the place of whom he had ever heard, or who had ever heard
                  of him.
               Two rooms were taken in the third story of a third-rate boarding-house, and then
                  two or three weeks were consumed in a fruitless search for employment. At the end
                  of that time Malcolm found a situation as book-keeper in a hard-ware store, with a
                  salary of six hundred dollars, to be paid quarterly. For three weeks he labored
                  indefatigably at his business through the day, and studied diligently at night, to
                  revive his knowledge of long-forgotten studies, which might now be useful to him.
                  But in the midst of his labors, he was alarmed one night to find himself shivering
                  with chills, and before morning he was in a raging fever.
               Day after day, and night after night, he tossed about in extreme suffering, in
                  that hot, close little room, almost distracted with the intense burning agony in
                  his head. It was during the withering, scorching heat of a summer of unparalleled
                  suffering, when those who were in health, and could command every cooling luxury,
                  were panting and sighing as if life itself were a burden, when none left their
                  doors till the shades of evening fell, except such as were driven out by
                  necessity, and these sought the shade wherever it could be found, and with
                  umbrellas raised, panted slowly along, wiping the perspiration from their dripping
                  faces; and when men were dropping down, stricken by the power of the sun, and
                  carried lifeless to the homes they had left a few hours before in health, that
                  poor Malcolm Worthington lay in that small room so near the roof, where the rays
                  of the sun burned with the most scorching power. No breath of air stirred the
                  curtain which fell before the raised window; no cooling beverage could be indulged
                  in by the sick man, who must save all his fast-dwindling means, to keep his family
                  from starving. With his lips parched, and his tongue dried with fever, he yet
                  endeavored, for the sake of the dear ones around him, to refrain from expressions
                  of suffering; but in his troubled slumbers, or in a moment of temporary delirium,
                  he would murmur of the cooling streams and fountains of "Silent-shades," his
                  childhood's home, and fancy he heard the breeze rustling the leaves of the tall
                  old trees which shaded that cool and lovely spot. But he woke to the intense heat
                  and glare of the sun, to the suffocating dust, which rose even to the height of his windows, and to the
                  rattling of carts and wagons, so agonizing to the aching head, burning with fever.
                  It was in one of these moments of forgetfulness, that he had sighed for the
                  refreshing coolness and acidity of an orange, and knew not that any ear was
                  listening.
               Little Mary was gone a long time, and the sick man was unusually restless and
                  depressed that evening. All his courage seemed to have died out, and he saw
                  nothing before his family but the most sad and gloomy prospects.
               "Oh, Mary!" he groaned, "I must die! No one can live long in such
                  intense suffering; and what is to become of you and the little ones! what
                     is to become of you?"
               "Trust in God, my poor husband," said Mary. "He can cause light to shine in the
                  deepest darkness; in Him alone is our hope; let us pray to Him and he may show us
                  mercy, even yet;" and kneeling by her husband's bedside, Mary poured forth the
                  desires of her heart, in a prayer of simple and child-like faith and trust.
               While the words of prayer were yet upon her lips, there was a soft, low tap at the
                  door. On opening it, Mary saw standing there, a gentle and lovely looking girl,
                  dressed in the purest white, with a little muslin sun-bonnet on her head; her dark
                  brown hair was smoothed back from her pure forehead, and she looked so cool and
                  sweet, Mary thought she must be an angel of mercy. Her voice was just such as
                  might be expected from one who looked so kind and lovely, as she said:
               "I hope I am not intruding, but I have just learned that there is a sick person
                  here, and as I know a boarding-house is not the best place in which to procure
                  delicacies for the sick, I came over to see if there is any little thing I could
                  prepare that he would relish."
               "Oh, you are very good," said Mary, her eyes filling with tears at
                  this kind and unexpected offer from a stranger; "will you walk in?"
               The young lady came in and took a seat, and Mary whispered to her husband, and
                  seemed to be trying to urge him to give his consent to something, while he seemed
                  reluctant to do so. At length, Mary turned from the bed-side, and said:
               "My husband dislikes to trouble you, but he is parched with fever, and the thing
                  which would be most grateful to him just now, would be a glass of iced-water, if
                  it is not difficult for you to procure it. You know it is hard to get ice in a
                  house like this, and though I have sometimes bought a little from the ice-cart, it melts directly in so warm
                  a room as this."
               "He shall have it immediately," answered the young lady, "and I beg you will not
                  let him be without it one moment, night or day. We live directly opposite, and
                  have a large and well-filled ice-house. I will run over this moment, and bring
                  some." And the sweet little creature tripped across the street, and entered a
                  large and elegant house opposite, from whose open parlor windows Mary had often
                  heard the music of a piano, or guitar, accompanying a rich and melodious voice.
                  Presently she returned, followed by a servant, bearing on a salver a pitcher of
                  iced-water. Only those who have experienced like suffering, can realize the
                  eagerness with which the sick man grasped the tumbler, or the earnestness with
                  which in his heart he prayed for a blessing on her who had brought him a "cup of
                  cold water."
               "And now what more can I do for you?" asked the kind stranger; "pray let me have
                  the satisfaction of doing something more than merely bringing a
                  pitcher of water."
               "Oh! if you only knew how much more you have done;" said Mary,
                  bursting into tears; "you have given hope and comfort to the hearts of the
                  desponding sponding strangers; yours are the first words of kindness and sympathy
                  that have fallen upon our ears since we entered this great city. Our landlady is
                  too busy to give us a thought; not one of our fellow-boarders has even been to the
                  door to inquire after my husband; the old doctor for whom I have sent once or
                  twice, has hardly remained long enough in the room to take a look at him, and has
                  certainly done him no good; and we felt as if we were deserted and alone. If you
                  have never had this feeling, my dear young lady, you cannot realize how deeply
                  your unsolicited kindness has touched our hearts."
               "If you only knew the happiness it gives me," answered the stranger, "to be the
                  means of carrying any comfort or consolation to those who are suffering, you would
                  consider, as I honestly do, the obligation all on my side. I live alone with my
                  father in the great house opposite; it has pleased God to bless us with abundant
                  means; my time is at my own disposal; and I have no taste for the gaiety and
                  dissipation of the city; do you not think then it ought to be a pleasure to me, to
                  be able in any degree to lighten human suffering, or to add to the comfort or
                  pleasure of those around me?"
               Just then the door opened, and in came little Mary, her face beaming with pleasure, and her hands
                  filled with oranges.
               "Oh, see mamma! see! what this good gentleman bought for papa!" she exclaimed, and
                  running to her father's bed-side, she put one of the large fine oranges into his
                  hand.
               "Why, Mary, where did you get this?" asked her father, in a feeble voice.
               "Oh, this good kind gentleman, papaâ€”why!â€”where is he?" for no gentleman had yet
                  appeared. Little Mary now ran, and pushing open the door, caught Dr. Glentworth by
                  the hand, and drew him into the room.
               "Excuse this intrusion," said the young doctor, in the low soft voice which he
                  knew so well to modulate to the key suited for a sick room; "but I saw this little
                  lady in the street, and fell in love with her at first sight; and hearing from her
                  that her father was a stranger here, and sick, I concluded to accompany her home,
                  and offer my services either as friend or physician," and stepping to the bed-side
                  of the sick man, he placed his fingers upon his pulse.
               "Mary, dear," said Malcolm, calling to his wife, "explain to this gentleman that
                  our circumstances are suchâ€”"
               "Now stop just there," said Dr. Glentworth, leaning ing over and speaking in a low
                  tone to the sick man; "don't you say one word to me about
                     'circumstances;' you are just in the circumstances to need a
                  physician, my friend, and if you have none that you like better, I shall just take
                  the liberty of introducing myself, and shall not consent to be dismissed till this
                  fever has first taken its departure."
               The young lady now rose to take leave, and calling Mrs. Worthington into the hall,
                  she so strenuously insisted upon the privilege of doing something for her husband,
                  that Mrs. Worthington promised to send little Mary over, and let her know what
                  delicacy the doctor would allow him. After a kind and cheering visit, the good
                  young doctor left, saying that he should come in early in the morning; and then
                  the gratitude of Mary's heart burst forth, as she exclaimed:
               "Oh, Malcolm! shall we ever again distrust the mercy and goodness of God?"
               "He has indeed most wonderfully answered your prayer, sweet wife," answered the
                  sick man; "may he grant us grateful hearts for all his mercies."
               Emily Mowbray, for that was the name of the young lady who had stepped in like an
                  angel of goodness, to befriend the suffering Worthingtons, was not one to be
                  seized by a charitable impulse, and to
                  let it die out after one or two exhibitions of kind feeling. As long as her care
                  and kindness were needed by the objects of her benevolence, so long she continued
                  them, without ever being "weary in well-doing." A firm and fast friendship was
                  very soon established between Emily and Mrs. Worthington, who were indeed kindred
                  spirits, and worthy of each other's confidence and love. Many times in a day did
                  the Worthingtons experience the kindness of their lovely young friend, in the
                  receipt of some little delicacy for the invalid, or something more substantial for
                  the other members of the family. Often, too, Emily sent for the children, who were
                  most winning, engaging little creatures, to come and pass the day with her, and
                  not unfrequently, after Malcolm was able to leave his bed, did she call in her
                  carriage, and persuade Mary to leave her husband's side for an hour, and,
                  accompanied by the children, take a drive into the fresh, green country.
               And Dr. Glentworth was no less attentive to the invalid. No kindness and attention
                  that could have been bestowed upon an own, and much-loved brother, was neglected
                  by him; and under his skilful and judicious management, together with the
                  encouragement which the sympathy of these two kind friends afforded him, the
                  recovery of the sick man was very rapid. Still he could by no means banish
                  depressing thoughts from his mind, for his means were now nearly exhausted, and he
                  had received a message from his employers, to the effect that they had already
                  waited for him longer than was consistent with their interests, and had been
                  obliged to supply his place with another clerk. This was accompanied with a small
                  sum as a remuneration for his services during the short time he had been with
                  them. But where to look now for employment, or what to do for the support of his
                  family, was the subject that brooded continually on his mind, causing him many
                  wakeful anxious hours, and retarding his restoration to his usual strength.
               Mr. Mowbray, the father of Emily, was a wealthy banker, but was still, from habit
                  and choice rather than from necessity, a laborious man. He was rather blunt and
                  abrupt in his way, but overflowing with kindness and benevolence, and very many
                  were the recipients of his bounty. Of late he had seemed so perplexed and worn
                  down by intense application to business, that his daughter one day said to
                  him:
               "Dear papa, why do you toil so incessantly? there surely can be no necessity for
                  it."
               "The bank business must be kept up, my child," was the answer, "and we are now
                  short of hands, having been obliged to
                  dismiss one clerk, who proved unworthy to be trusted, and we have not yet been
                  able to supply his place."
               "How much salary did you give him, papa?"
               "A thousand dollarsâ€”but why do you ask, Emmy?"
               "Oh, dear papa! because I was thinking how I wish you would try my protÃ©gÃ©, as you are pleased to call him, the father of
                  those lovely children you see here so often. I know nothing of course as to his
                  capabilities for the situation, but any one can see at a glance that he is a
                  gentleman, and a man of education. I suspect the family have been suddenly reduced
                  in their circumstances; everything about them shows that they have seen far better
                  times, and that poverty is a new thing to them. They came here entire strangers,
                  and he had just found a situation in Blackwell's store, when he was taken down
                  with this fever; his wife thinks his illness was partly in consequence of his
                  studies till a late hour every night, to revive his knowledge of book-keeping; and
                  my own impression is that anxiety as to his future prospects now prevents his
                  entire recovery. I do wish, papa, you would just give him the hope that you will
                  try him; I believe it would do him more good than anything else that could
                  possibly be done for him."
               "Oh, Emmy! Emmy! your geese are all swans, you know," answered her father; "but,
                  however, I am very willing to give this young man a fair trial, and to let him
                  have the situation, if he proves fit for it. But I must see Blackwell first, and
                  hear what account he has to give of your protÃ©gÃ©."
               "The result of Mr. Mowbray's inquiries was satisfactory in all respects. Mr.
                  Blackwell said he thought that after a little more practice, young Worthington
                  would make a most useful and valuable clerk; he was very sorry to lose him, but
                  circumstances made it necessary for him to fill his place with another clerk, whom
                  he was now as reluctant to turn off, as he had before been to dismiss
                  Worthington.
               That same evening, as our sick friend was sitting in a disconsolate mood in his
                  easy chair, his wife and children having gone to take a drive with Emily, he was
                  surprised by a visit from Mr. Mowbray, who, in his usual abrupt manner, at once
                  disclosed the object of his coming, and offered him the vacant situation in the
                  bank, as soon as his health should be sufficiently re-established to admit of his
                  entering upon the duties of the office. It seemed too good to be true; and the
                  sudden transition from despondency to hope, was almost too much for the excitable
                  nerves of the invalid.
               "But you never can expect to get well in this hot close room!" said old Mr. Mowbray; "and you see it
                  is for my interest now, to have you about and strong again as quickly as possible.
                  Come, you must pack up bag and baggage, chicks and all, and move across the
                  street. We have some large, pleasant rooms there, and Emily and I are so lonely,
                  that it would be nothing but a kindness to come and keep us company for awhile.
                  Those little folks of yours I know very well already, and they are just like three
                  little sun-beams, whenever they enter the door. Now, not a word if you please, not
                  a word of objection, for there is nothing but selfishness at the bottom of this
                  offer of mine, I can assure you, and I honestly consider that the obligation will
                  be all on our side."
               Mrs. Worthington and Emily entering just then with the children, the proposition
                  was again made by Mr. Mowbray, and most warmly and urgently seconded by his
                  daughter. The reluctance which the Worthingtons naturally felt at bringing so much
                  trouble upon their friends, was all overruled by them, and before they left, it
                  was determined that the Worthingtons should remove to Mr. Mowbray's house the very
                  next day.
               "And when you are quite tired of us, and are as well and strong as ever," said the
                  old gentleman, "I have a snug little place on the corner, for which I have in vain
                  been trying to find a tenant; and I should like mighty well to put you all in
                  there, if for nothing else but to keep it from going to decay. As to the rent, we
                  will talk about that when the first year's salary becomes due." And Mr. Mowbray
                  and Emily took their departure, leaving the Worthingtons overwhelmed with
                  gratitude and joy. The next day saw them delightfully settled in the cool,
                  pleasant rooms of which Mr. Mowbray had spoken. The contrast was very great
                  between the close and meanly-furnished little apartments in the third story of the
                  boarding-house, and the luxurious dwelling of the Mowbrays; and in a very few days
                  Malcolm Worthington was declared, rather reluctantly it must be confessed, by Dr.
                  Glentworth, as stricken from the sick list, and able to begin his duties at the
                  bank, if he would but labor with moderation.
               There were some results of the new ties formed and cemented by the afflictions of
                  the Worthingtons, upon which we have not yet touched. Dr. Glentworth and Emily
                  Mowbray met often of course in the room of those in whom both were so deeply
                  interested, and if the good doctor had once fancied himself much attached to Alice
                  More, and had "fallen in love at first sight," as he said, with little Mary
                  Worthington, a deeper interest was now awakened in his heart, at being brought into almost daily
                  contact with one so lovely, so gifted, and so good, as Emily.
               "What a wife for a physician! what a treasure for any man!" said he to himself
                  often, as he thought of Emily. "But what folly for me to dare to think of her! How
                  could I, a young physician, with no expectations in life but from my profession,
                  raise my eyes to the daughter and heiress of the wealthy banker. No, no, there is
                  no hope for me there!"
               But "chance," and "accident," to which the events of life are attributed by those
                  who do not choose in all things to see the hand of an over-ruling Providence,
                  bring about strange and unlooked-for changes in the affairs of men. Malcolm
                  Worthington had scarcely got established in the bank, and acquainted with his
                  round of duties, when old Mr. Mowbray was seized with a violent attack of the
                  gout, a complaint to which he was subject.
               "Oh Emily, what shall I do for a doctor now!" he exclaimed, as he was warned, by
                  its first twinges, of the approach of his old enemy. "Old Dr. Bellamy is dead, and
                  I am sure I do not know whom to trust," he added.
               Emily could very well have suggested a physician, but she felt a very natural
                  diffidence at doing so Malcolm Worthington, however, had no such scruples and
                  urged the old gentleman to send, without loss of time, for Dr. Glentworth, in
                  whose skill he had the utmost confidence. At length, in a fierce paroxysm of pain
                  he consented, and Malcolm himself went and brought his friend to Mr. Mowbray's
                  bedside.
               The result of the young doctor's attentions was highly satisfactory. Old Mr.
                  Mowbray was perfectly charmed with him. He said the young doctor battled more
                  skilfully with the terrible enemy, and drove him out quicker than ever old Dr.
                  Bellamy had done, and without giving him half as many nauseous doses to take
                  either. Before Dr. Glentworth left him as a physician, he had become so warmly
                  attached to him, as to wish to retain him as an intimate friend; and thus it
                  happened, that even after his services were no longer needed professionally, he
                  continued to visit often and intimately at the house of Mr. Mowbray.
               At her father's bedside, the young doctor had constantly met Emily, and here their
                  mutual affection and esteem were daily and hourly augmented; and yet the young
                  physician did not dare to declare his sentiments, and thus as he feared put an end
                  to all hope, and cut off even the opportunity of seeing Emily as often as he had
                  done. The Worthingtons were now snugly settled in the neat little corner house, which was prettily furnished by
                  Mr. Mowbray's kindness in advancing the means, and ornamented with many beautiful
                  little gifts from Emily, such as Mrs. Worthington had once been accustomed to, but
                  which she would never have thought of purchasing for herself now.
               Mr. Mowbray being still too lame to leave the house, seemed, since their
                  departure, to depend more and more upon the society of his new friend, the young
                  doctor, and constantly urged him to spend whatever time he could spare from his
                  professional duties, and could not pass more agreeably elsewhere, with him. One
                  evening, as they sat together in Mr. Mowbray's library, Emily having gone down to
                  the corner house to see the Worthingtons, the old gentleman with his customary
                  bluntness said:
               "Doctor, I may be mistaken, but sometimes while I was sick it occurred to me that
                  you and Emily had taken a sort of liking to each other."
               "I cannot answer for Miss Mowbray, Sir," answered the doctor, who was thrown into
                  quite a trepidation by this sudden and unexpected address; "but as far as I am
                  concerned, if you imagine that I am deeply attached to her, you never made a
                  shrewder guess in all your life." ("It's out now," thought the doctor, "and now
                  for my fate.")
               "Neither can I answer for Emmy," said the old gentleman, "for of
                  course I never said a word to her on the subject; but when I was lying there on my
                  back, and you two thought I was either asleep, or too much taken up with my
                     own sufferings to notice anything that was going on, I saw and
                  heard more than you thought I did, and formed my own conclusions, as to you, and
                  Emmy too. Now, if it is as I suppose, or even as you acknowledge, if you love
                  Emmy, why don't you step up, and ask her to marry you, and find out whether she
                  likes you or not? I certainly should take that course, if I were in your
                  place."
               "Mr. Mowbray," said the doctor, "I have my own way to make in the world, and
                  nothing but my profession to depend upon."
               "I thought there was some such nonsense as that!" interrupted the old
                  gentleman.
               "And how," continued the doctor, "could I ask your lovely daughter, your
                     only daughter, to leave you, and to leave a home of luxury and
                  ease, to share my fortunes, whatever they may be."
               "I've no idea of having Emily leave me, I can tell you, Sir," answered the old
                  gentleman, "neither have I any idea of leaving the old house; but if Emmy likes
                  you well enough to marry you, and if you will come here, and share our fortunes
                  with us, why well and
                  good, and I am sure no one will be better satisfied with such an arrangement than
                  myself. With such a son as you, and such friends as the Worthingtons near me, I
                  think I may calculate upon passing the evening of my days in tranquillity and
                  happiness. Only one stipulation I must makeâ€”I cannot have any doctor's shop in my
                  house; if you come here you must leave your office down town. All this is in case
                  Emmy does not object; if she should, then all my fine plans are knocked in the
                  head. She is down at the corner house; now just go down for her, if you like, and
                  tell her I sent you, instead of Robert, to bring her home; and if you should take
                  a little longer than usual in coming home, why I shant wonder. Now aint I an old
                  fool of a match-maker?"
               The doctor was not slow in following old Mr. Mowbray's advice, and he and Emily
                  were so long in returning, that the old gentleman wondered, and wondered, again
                  and again, his promise to the contrary notwithstanding.
               What the doctor and Emily were about all this time, I surely need not say; the
                  reader, if a person of any shrewdness at all, will never suppose that I told all
                  this story to end in a love-disappointment for so fine a fellow as the doctor. Not
                  a bit of it.
               A few months later, when Malcolm Worthington was pressing Doctor Glentworth to
                  allow him to remunerate him for his services, saying that his circumstances were
                  now such that he could well afford to pay so just a debt, though the doctor's
                  kindness he could never hope to repay; the answer was:
               "My dear fellow! not a word more on that subject if you care anything about me. If
                  a wife could be paid for, I should ask you to send your bill to me, for how should
                  I ever have known Emily but for you. They say 'kindness brings its own reward,'
                  and if I have shown you any such extraordinary kindness as you are forever talking
                  about, I am sure I am rewarded for it a thousand-fold. I have always thought that
                  my accidental meeting with your sweet little Mary saved me from marrying a
                  thoughtless, heartless girl, with whom I fancied myself in love. I now see that it
                  was also the means of gaining for me the noblest, truest heart, that ever beat. On
                  what apparent accidents do the great events of life turn."
               And with words much like these, did Emily silence Mrs. Worthington, whenever, from
                  her full heart, she attempted to pour forth her gratitude for Emily's unwearied
                  kindness to her and hers.
               And often, as Alice More met Doctor Glentworth and his lovely wife, driving or
                  walking together, she would sigh, and say to herself:
               
               "Ah, for three cents I lost the only man I ever cared for."
               Alice! Alice! again I say, it was not that. Three cents did not lose him, neither
                  would thousands of dollars have bought him for you, as long as he suspected you of
                  a want of thought and feeling for the sufferings of others; a want of sympathy in
                  their sorrows, and a heart that would prompt you to seek them in their homes, and
                  relieve the wants of the deserving poor by the exercise of a discriminating
                  charity.
            
            
               Lizzie Ellison's Story.
               IT was on a bitter, bitter night in December, that my poor young mother, with me,
                  a puny little thing of six weeks old in her arms, fell upon the door-step of my
                  grandfather's house, chilled and insensible. Even as she fell, a mother's instinct
                  led her to protect the little soft head that rested on her arm, so that it was not
                  injured in the fall; and there we lay, and the relentless winter wind heaped over
                  us the thickly-falling snow. The whistling and 
                     shriekng
                     shrieking
                   of the blast, and the slamming of doors and shutters about the old
                  house, prevented the noise of our fall from being heard by the occupants of the
                  parlor, and no other sound broke upon their ears for half an hour or more.
               Perhaps we lay there under the snow wreath as long as it would take to tell my
                  mother's sad history, and the reason of her lying thus in the keen cold winter
                  night upon the steps of her father's dwelling, with her little baby in her arms; and this is
                  perhaps the best place in which to tell it.
               My grandfather had once growing up around him a large and promising family of sons
                  and daughters, who he fondly hoped would live to cheer and support him in his
                  declining days, and lay his head beneath the sods of the valley. But death had
                  been very busy in the once merry household, and he found himself a gray-haired
                  man, bereft of wife, and children nearly all. Two only were left, the oldest and
                  the youngest of the flock. Aunt Martha was about twenty years of age, when the
                  little Lizzie (my mother) was born, and as my grandmother survived her birth but a
                  few weeks, the little helpless one was thrown upon Aunt Martha's care, to which
                  she was solemnly confided by the dying mother. They two were all that were left to
                  the old man now; Martha was his companion and dependence, but the little Lizzie
                  was his pet and his pride; the child of his old age; the last of the stricken
                  flock.
               Wherever the old man went, whether about his small farm, or in his little
                  one-horse wagon to the village; or if at home he sat in the porch devouring the
                  contents of his one newspaper, the little golden-haired Lizzie was forever by his
                  side or on his knee. Her cheerful prattle never seemed to disturb or annoy him,
                  but he was ever ready to answer her childish questions, or sympathize in her
                  innocent glee. In short, with the little Lizzie, the old man was a child
                  again.
               When in the warm summer afternoons, or sitting by the cheerful winter's fire, he
                  threw his red silk handkerchief over his head, and she knew that he was about to
                  take his afternoon's nap, she would slip gently from his knee, and amuse herself
                  very quietly by his side, with her doll, or her kitten, and, as she grew older,
                  with her book, till he woke again; and then she would be ready to climb up on a
                  chair and reach down his pipe from the high mantel-shelf, and filling and lighting
                  it, a privilege she always claimed from the first moment that she was trusted with
                  so great a responsibility, and placing it between the old man's lips, she would
                  watch the wreaths of smoke as they curled up over head, and begin again her
                  engaging prattle.
               As Lizzie grew older, it was decided by her father and Aunt Martha, that she must
                  have some education, and as no better plan presented itself, it was agreed that
                  she should go into the village daily, a distance of only two miles, and attend the
                  academy there. To Lizzie, who was constantly rambling about the fields in active
                  exercise all day long, the walk was
                  nothing; but still the old man often made some excuse to get up the pony in the
                  afternoon, and ride over to the village for his pet; and if it stormed, she was
                  always sure to find him waiting for her at the door of the school-house, with a
                  warm hood and cloak, in which to wrap her up.
               Oh! what should come between those two, to separate them so widely even while
                  Lizzie was still but a child, that her father would not listen to her agonized
                  pleadings, or look upon her still idolized face? What should make the old man's
                  and the sister's pet and darling an outcast from the home of her childhood,
                  pining, in sickness and sorrow, for the kind voices and tender care of those who
                  had cherished her so fondly, and entreating to be received to their arms once
                  more, in vain?
               I fear I cannot go on with my mother's history, without appearing to throw blame
                  upon either her or Aunt Martha, which I should be loth to do. Perhaps I must in
                  honesty confess, that there was fault on both sides. Aunt Martha, always kind and
                  indulgent, could not find it in her heart to refuse any request of her darling
                  Lizzie, and thus it came that she was allowed at times to remain in the village
                  over night, with some of her young companions; leaving the old house lonely and
                  still, for want of her merry, cheerful voice; but the old man and Aunt Martha
                  consoled themselves with the reflection, that by this self-denial of their own
                  they were increasing Lizzie's happiness; and it was but for a night once in a
                  while, and she would be back as bright and sweet as ever to-morrow.
               But in this way Lizzie had formed some intimacies which were, by no means, the
                  best for her. There was a set of wild and rather romantic girls, boarders in the
                  village, and attendants at the academy, who, being absent from the restraints of
                  home, followed their own inclinations, easily by various tricks and artifices
                  eluding the vigilance of those under whose care they were placed for the time.
                  These young ladies were well supplied with works of fiction, many of them of the
                  lowest and most demoralizing tendency; all of them romantic and unnatural, and
                  calculated to fill their minds with the most distorted views of life, making the
                  daily round of home duties appear dull and distasteful to them.
               Upon these books poor Lizzie seized, and read them with the greatest avidity;
                  never leaving the village for home, without one or more of them concealed under
                  her pile of school-books in her basket; and in the perusal of these she often sat
                  up half the night, after her old father and Aunt Martha were soundly sleeping. Poor, unsuspicious Aunt
                  Martha, noticing Lizzie's dull eye, and pale face, mourned over her as a victim of
                  hard study, and was the more willing to indulge her in her desire for what she
                  supposed to be innocent gratification, because she thought it would serve as a
                  relaxation, after her intense application to books.
               Thus it came that Lizzie was often allowed to accompany her young companions upon
                  a sleighing frolic, or a ride in the summer time to some neighboring village, Aunt
                  Martha, in the simplicity of her heart, never dreaming of the injury she was doing
                  her, by granting her such frequent indulgences. Of course in all these frolics,
                  and in the dances to which they returned in the evening, there were a number of
                  young men concerned; some of whom were wild and unprincipled, and totally unfit to
                  be the companions of a set of gay and giddy girls.
               One of these, (I cannot bring myself to mention his name,) a youth of about
                  twenty, who had always been reckless and dissipated, and had twice secretly left
                  his home and gone to sea, was very particular in his attentions to the young
                  Lizzie, then but sixteen years of age, and, from the accounts I have since heard
                  of her, very beautiful. Lizzie, who was naturally of a romantic turn, and whose
                  imagination was excited by the style of reading in which she had indulged, was all
                  ready for a lover, and fancied herself deeply interested in this young man, who
                  had a handsome face, and a gay and agreeable manner.
               Aunt Martha, in giving her consent to Lizzie's accompanying her young companions
                  upon a sleighing frolic, one winter afternoon, little imagined that the ball that
                  night was to be at a tavern about six miles distant; but supposing that the party
                  had merely taken an afternoon ride, from which Lizzie was to return, as she often
                  did, to pass the night with a friend in the village, she felt quite at her ease
                  about her. How little she dreamed of the consequences of that evening's frolic!
                  how little she imagined, that seasons would run their round ere she should again
                  behold her darling's face, and that when next she saw her, it would be lying
                  beneath the snow wreath, as cold and as white as the snow itself.
               It was during the intervals of the dance, that Lizzie's admirer whispered to her
                  of his devoted love, which she, poor child, hesitated not to give him reason to
                  think was returned; he next proposed a private marriage, and that it should take
                  place immediately, he having a friend in that place, he said, a young clergyman
                  who had just taken orders. At first Lizzie was shocked. A vision of kind,
                     loving sister Martha, and of the
                  gray-haired old man at home, who doted upon her, rose up before her, and she
                  refused, for a time, to listen to such a proposal. Still the romance of the thing
                  pleased her disordered fancy, and there were silly young friends to whisper in her
                  ear, and encourage her to take this foolish and wicked step, and to assure her
                  that however shocked her friends at home might be, they would soon receive her
                  back with open arms.
               The poor young thing, (I never think of her as my mother, but as one younger than
                  myself, for whom I feel the tenderest compassion,) the poor young Lizzie then, at
                  last consented, and after a little delay, the preparations for a wedding were
                  completed. A young man in spectacles, and with long flowing hair, was introduced
                  as the clergyman. Lizzie was led to her place, and two or three young friends
                  placed themselves in a row beside her as brides-maids; the ceremony began, and
                  ended very briefly, and Lizzie believed herself a wife. She had been too much
                  agitated to notice the absence from the room of one of the wildest and most
                  reckless young men of the party, and the evident disguise of him who was
                  introduced as the clergyman. Neither did she notice that those who stood by her
                  were bursting with laughter, at what they supposed was a capital joke. Ah! how
                  little did they realize the horrible wickedness of their doings that evening!
               Throughout the next day, which was fiercely tempestuous, Aunt Martha felt quite
                  unconcerned about Lizzie, supposing of course that she was at school, and would
                  return with her father when he went in for her in the afternoon. The old man was
                  so long in returning, however, that she began to be uneasy, and often went to a
                  window from which she could see a long distance down the road, to watch for him
                  and Lizzie, but without success. The candles were lighted, the fire blazed
                  brightly, the supper was ready to be placed on the table, and yet they had not
                  come. Aunt Martha was pacing the floor in intense anxiety, when she heard the
                  sound of the sleigh-bells, not jingling merrily, as they usually did, when Lizzie
                  was on her way, but giving an occasional tinkle, as if the old horse was making
                  his own way slowly through the snow-drifts, and was reluctant to approach the
                  house, to which he was bearing such a weight of sorrow.
               Aunt Martha was at the door in one moment; at first she could not plainly see who
                  was in the cutter, and called out in her cheerful, pleasant way, "Why father!
                  Lizzie dear! how came you to be so late? supper is waiting; come, hurry, you must
                  be frozen!"
               
               The old man, who was sitting with his hat over his eyes, and his head upon his
                  breast, seemed to be roused by the sound of his daughter's voice, and raising his
                  head, and looking wildly about him for a moment, he made an endeavor to step from
                  the cutter; the light from the hall then fell upon his face, and, to Aunt Martha's
                  horror, she saw that it looked twenty years older than when he left home two or
                  three hours before. His hat, unnoticed by himself, was blown away by a sudden gust
                  as he rose to step from the cutter, and his long gray hair blew about his now
                  haggard and ghastly face; the light seemed all to have faded from his eyes, and he
                  stretched his hands out helplessly, for some one to guide him to the house.
               "Father! dear father! what is it? where is our Lizzie?" asked Aunt Martha in tones
                  of entreaty.
               At the sound of Lizzie's name, the old man fell upon a chair in the hall, and
                  covering his face with his wrinkled hands, he rocked to and fro, crying and
                  moaning bitterly. Oh, it was a sad, sad thing, to hear an old man crying so!
               At length Aunt Martha perceived a bit of paper, which had been crumpled up in his
                  hand ever since he left the village, but had now fallen to the floor. Picking it
                  up she stepped to the lamp, and in one moment comprehended the extent of the
                  calamity which had befallen them. No! not its full extent even
                  then.
               It was a note from Lizzie, sent back by one of her young companions, telling them
                  of her marriage, and speaking of her return to them in a few weeks, as if
                  confident of a welcome at the homestead. Aunt Martha's anguish was no less keen
                  than that of the poor old man, but she was enabled to retain a wonderful calmness
                  of manner, even while her heart was breaking. The many trials through which she
                  had passed had softened and subdued her, and taught her where to look for strength
                  and consolation in the darkest hour; she had thus learned to discipline her own
                  feelings, and keep them in subjection as long as there were others to lean on her
                  for support; and her old father was her first care now.
               All that terribly long night she sat by his bedside, holding his wrinkled hand in
                  hers, or smoothing back his thin gray locks; and in his waking hours, or in his
                  troubled slumbers, the loud wailing, or the low moaning, never ceased. Poor,
                  broken-hearted old man! he never was himself again from that night, but, though he
                  lived on for many, many years, he was but a shattered wreck. He had always been
                  warm and ardent in his feelings, and very strong in his prejudices; he was what his neighbors called an
                     obstinate old man, who, when he had once said a thing, would stand
                  to it through fire and water.
               All night he never mentioned Lizzie's name, and Aunt Martha sat by him, wondering
                  how it would first be mentioned between them, and what would be her father's reply
                  to her proposal to receive Lizzie back. Would his lips now be sealed in gloomy
                  silence, as had been the case with regard to all whom he had lost, and would he
                  forbid her even to speak of Lizzie? Aunt Martha could not tell. Affliction had now
                  come to them in a new and terrible form, and how the old man would bear it after
                  the first shock was over, she could form no conjecture.
               For many days he never left his bed; and when at last he began to creep round
                  again, it was plainly to be seen that a great change had come over him. His mind
                  was evidently weakened by the nature and suddenness of this last bitter trial, and
                  his obstinacy seemed greater than ever. He would pace the room slowly and moodily;
                  back and forth, back and forth, his eyes fixed steadily on the carpet, but with a
                  stern and determined expression on his countenance, that frightened poor Aunt
                  Martha from her purpose whenever she tried to speak the name of the absent
                  one.
               At length, one morning she summoned all her courage age, and entering the room
                  where the old man was walking up and down,
               "Father," she said, "I have received a letter from our little Lizzie, our poor
                  little Lizzie, father."
               "Marthy!" exclaimed the old man, stopping suddenly in his walk, and striking his
                  stick upon the floor, "Marthy! never speak that name to me again; do you hear? I
                  won't bear it; let her henceforth be to us like those who sleep in the valley
                  yonder."
               "Oh, father! our precious Lizzie? our baby?
                  our pet? She's nothing but a child, father, and she needs our care so
                  much. She has done very wrong, and she feels it now, but others were to blame as
                  much as she; and she says if dear father would only forgive her. Here, father,
                  just let me read you what she says."
               "Not one word, Marthy!" said the old man, shaking his head, but his voice
                  trembled. "I tell you, never again let her name be mentioned between us; never
                  again under any circumstances."
               Oh! how he prided himself upon his wonderful firmness, and how his old heart
                  yearned even then towards his little darling! We must hasten on with my poor
                  mother's story. He who had so cruelly deceived her, took her to a seaport town,
                  where they boarded together for a time at the house of a Mrs. Henryâ€”fortunately
                  for poor Lizzie, a kind-hearted,
                  Christian womanâ€”then, when he had tired of his plaything, and was anxious for
                  change, he determined again to go to sea. To Lizzie's earnest entreaties to be
                  allowed to accompany him, he replied by coolly telling her the thing was
                  impossible, and explaining to her the cruel farce by which she had been made to
                  believe herself legally married. And then, when in her agony and distress, she
                  fell upon the floor insensible, he seized the favorable moment to hasten away, and
                  she never saw him more.
               Oh! what letters of entreaty she now wrote to Aunt Martha, begging her to
                  intercede with her old father to let her come to her dear home once more. She was
                  so lonely, so homesick. Oh! to lay her head on dear Sister Martha's breast! to
                  clasp her arms around her poor old father's neck! Her yearnings for home would
                  have melted a heart of stone; the old man surely could not have held out in his
                  obstinacy had he suffered Aunt Martha to read them to him In vain she left
                  Lizzie's letters in his way, hoping that when he was alone he might take them up
                  and read them; but he seemed to understand who they were from, for they had no
                  other correspondent, and never noticed them by word or sign.
               Aunt Martha often wrote to Lizzie, and in that way gave her all the comfort she
                  could. She wrote, too, to Mrs. Henry; and denying herself many necessary comforts,
                  she sent supplies to this kind woman, urging her to take every care of her
                  darling. She even tried to persuade Janet, their only domestic, who had been with
                  them from her childhood, to leave her, that by thus diminishing her expenses, she
                  might be better able to aid the absent one; but the faithful Janet would not be
                  turned off. Seeming to suspect the motives of her mistress, she begged to be
                  allowed to remain on half wages, or to work for nothing, rather than to leave the
                  house where she had been so kindly treated, and which had been her only home.
               Months passed away. The cold winter came round again; and in the house of the
                  good, kind Mrs. Henry, Lizzie's poor, little baby first saw the light. Oh! how in
                  that time of sickness and trouble did the poor, lonely sufferer long for the
                  gentle, loving voice, and tender care of dear Sister Martha. Day after day, and
                  night after night, her pillow was wet with tears of remorse for her own folly, and
                  longing for the loved ones far away. She felt that she should not live long. Oh!
                  to lay her little baby in Sister Martha's arms, and if she might but receive her
                  poor father's blessing, then she could die in peace.
               "I will arise and go to my father," was her sudden determination one
                  day when she first began to walk about
                  her room. "He will not surely turn his little Lizzie from his door, and if he does
                  I will lie down and die, with my eyes fixed upon my dear old home; and they will
                  not visit upon my little baby her poor young mother's sins. Yes, for my baby's
                  sake, I will go!"
               Mrs. Henry tried to dissuade her from so great an undertaking in her present weak
                  state, urging her to wait till she was a little stronger; but Lizzie said, "No! I
                  shall never live to go, unless I go now; every day I grow weaker; let me make the
                  attempt while I can."
               Providing her then, with means for the journey, and wrapping her in a warm shawl
                  of her own, the kind Mrs. Henry saw her seated in the stage-sleigh in which she
                  was to take her long journey; and giving her pale cheek a last kiss, the good
                  woman turned away wiping the tears from her cheeks.
               The feeble, delicate little creature lived through that long cold journey, and on
                  the evening of the second day, after riding all of one night, she reached the
                  village inn. Here she found a countryman, who was just starting for his home in a
                  neighboring village, and asked him if he would take her as far as the road which
                  turned off by old Mr. Ellison's. To this the man readily consented, for he had a
                  good team, and a light load, and about two hours after night-fall he drew up at
                  the corner, from which, if it had been a clear night, the old house would have
                  been plainly visible. The good-natured man apologized for not driving her up to
                  the gate, as he was in haste to get home; ah! had he known how weak and tired she
                  was, and that the little bundle in her arms was a poor, feeble baby, he would have
                  gone miles out of his way to leave her safely with her friends.
               Taking her bundle of clothes on her arm, poor Lizzie started along the path over
                  which she had so often skipped and danced in childish glee, and staggering through
                  the deep snow, she made the best of her way towards home. The wind blew her light
                  form hither and thither among the snow-drifts, at its mercy; and now finding her
                  bundle of scanty clothing altogether too heavy, she dropped it by the roadside,
                  and steadying herself by the fence in a sort of desperation, she went on.
               To her other little burden she clung with a grasp like death; but that, too, grew
                  very heavyâ€”she would not have thought that her little thin baby could be such a
                  weight. And now at last she has reached the gate; but it is closed, and the snow
                  is piled up in a bank against it, and she has no strength to pull it open. But oh.
                  it is home! dear, dear home! and the
                  light is shining from the parlor windows, and the loved ones are there. Can she
                  reach the bars! Courage, poor tired one! to fall, or lie down now, is death! Grasp
                  your little baby closer in that poor aching arm, hold tightly by the fence, a few
                  steps more and you are there!
               The bars fortunately are down, and with a mighty effort the poor little creature
                  climbs over the lowest one, and staggers on diagonally across the door-yard for
                  the porch: now she has partly fallen, and supports herself by one arm plunged into
                  the deep snow. Oh! she can never rise, with that little heavy burden in her arms.
                  Courage once more, poor Lizzie! the steps are almost reached; now! now! one stroke
                  upon the knocker; one turn of the door-knob;â€”but no! she has not strength to reach
                  either. That last step was too much for her, and shielding her little baby's head
                  with her arm, she falls upon the porch, all cold and stiff and senseless.
               When Aunt Martha stepped to the front door to lock it for the night, she stopped a
                  moment, for she thought she heard the mewing of a kitten outside. Aunt Martha
                  could not have found it in her heart to let even a kitten stay out on so bitter a
                  night, and now hearing the sound again, she opened the door to call the little
                  creature in. Shading the light with her hand, she looked out, and at first saw
                  nothing but a great snow-heap upon the porch; but just as she was closing the
                  door, she heard that cry again, and now it sounded like the wail of a young child.
                  Casting the light upon the porch, she now saw fluttering out from the snow-heap, a
                  portion of a bright woollen shawl, and became convinced that some poor creature
                  had tried to take refuge there, from the darkness and the storm.
               "Father!â€”Janet!â€”come here!" she called. Then stooping, she brushed away the snow,
                  and by the aid of a light Janet had brought, she saw the face. Then, in tones of
                  the most utter amazement, mingled with those of tenderest pity, she cried:
               "Oh! oh! father! father! it's Lizzie! it's our own poor
                  little Lizzie!"
               The sight of his long, lost darling lying in the snow upon his doorstep, on the
                  cold, cold winter night, effected what nothing else in the world would have done.
                  The old man's heart melted at once, and stooping and taking the dear head in his
                  arms, while Aunt Martha raised her from the porch, they carried her into the hall.
                  Again that feeble wail!
               "Oh, father! it is her baby, her little, little baby!" exclaimed Aunt Martha,
                  while Janet took the "wee thing," as she called it, from the stiffened arms of
                     its mother. They carried
                  her to the parlor, and laid her on the settee, and then kneeling by her, the old
                  man's long pent-up feelings burst forth.
               He bent over her, and kissed her so tenderly, the tears falling from his wrinkled
                  cheeks over hers, so cold and white. He called her his lamb, his baby, his
                  darling; and implored her to open her eyes, and look at him once more, and tell
                  him she forgave him for all his coldness and cruelty. Then he would turn to Aunt
                  Martha, who, with great energy and self-possession, was using every appropriate
                  remedy for her restoration, and ask her if Lizzie would ever wake again? For more
                  than an hour Aunt Martha continued unremittingly her efforts, at the same time
                  directing Janet what to do for the little creature in her arms. At length warmth
                  began to return to the chilled and stiffened limbs, Lizzie began to swallow more
                  easily the warm broth which Aunt Martha occasionally put between her lips, and at
                  last she heaved a long and fluttering sigh, and slowly opened her eyes.
               They fell with a gaze of astonishment upon the familiar and dearly-loved faces
                  bending over her, and then with a look of intense satisfaction she closed them
                  again. Then raising her head with a bewildered and troubled air, she looked down
                  at her side, and passed her other hand over as if feeling for the little head
                     They carried her to the parlor, and laid her on the settee, &c. P.
                        224.
                  
                   that had rested there before insensibility
                  stole over her.
               "Here is your little one, dear Lizzie," said Aunt Martha, taking it in her arms,
                  and laying the young mother's hand upon its little face. She languidly raised her
                  eyes, nodded very gently as if perfectly understanding what Aunt Martha said, and
                  then turning her head upon her pillow, dropped into the sound and dreamless sleep
                  of utter exhaustion. Aunt Martha now persuaded the old man to lie down, and
                  bidding Janet take the little baby and go to bed, she sat all night by her young
                  sister's side, administering restoratives occasionally, and watching her still
                  death-like slumber. The next morning poor Lizzie woke conscious, but in a state of
                  the most extreme prostration; and it was evident to Aunt Martha that her race was
                  almost run, and that she had only wandered home to make one more among the "graves
                  of a household." Full consciousness returned, however, and with a heart filled
                  with gratitude, she found herself welcomed and forgiven by those dear ones whom
                  she had so longed once more to see. Her decline was more gradual than Aunt Martha
                  had anticipated, and she lingered with them very patient and very loving for
                  several weeks. The almost daily visits of good Dr. Morrison, the village pastor,
                  were earnestly watched for, and eagerly
                  prized by the dying girl; and from her tranquil and happy state of mind, Aunt
                  Martha doubted not that his prayers and exhortations were blessed to her. In peace
                  and joy she closed her eyes at last, and one more grave was added to many already
                  heaped side by side in the graveyard in the valley.
               Again a little baby was thrown upon Aunt Martha's care, whose lot it always seemed
                  to be called out of herself by the necessity of thought and watchfulness for
                  others. This last blow almost broke the old man down, and for a time Aunt Martha
                  thought he would not recover from it. Gloomily and silently as ever he brooded
                  over his sorrows, probably dwelling reproachfully upon his unkindness to poor
                  Lizzie, but keeping all his thoughts and feelings tightly locked within his own
                  heart.
               Oh! it is a mournful thing to see an old man tottering to the grave, laden down
                  with trouble, and yet seeking never the only true source of consolation. So it was
                  I fear with poor old grandfather. His step became more feeble, his locks grew
                  whiter, the wrinkles in his brow furrowed themselves more deeply, and mind and
                  memory failed day by day.
               And now I come to the time of my own recollection. The first thing I remember, was
                  climbing on a chair to get down grandfather's pipe, and then lighting ing it and
                  placing it between his lips. Aunt Martha taught me to do this, and to do many
                  other things which the other little Lizzie (my mother) had done for the old man,
                  before me, for she saw that already there was a confusion in his mind, and that at
                  times he went back many years, and looked upon me as the same little Lizzie who a
                  long time since sat upon his knee, or played by his side, with her doll or her
                  kitten. My hair, like my mother's, was light, and curling, and like her they
                  called me Lizzie; and Aunt Martha said that she often found herself
                  forgetting the flight of time, and the dark days of trouble that had come between,
                  and fancied it was her own little sister playing and singing about the room. No
                  wonder then that the old man, with his failing mind and memory, should be deluded
                  into the same belief; and it was well for him that it was so.
               When I was five years old, I thought grandfather must be more than a hundred; it
                  seemed to me that he was too old and feeble to live much longer; and yet it was
                  trouble more than years that weighed him down, and there was many a man older than
                  he, who was hale and hearty and active yet; and it was twenty years after that,
                  when the old man finally closed the eyes which had seen so much sorrow, and shed
                  in lonely places so many bitter tears.
               
               As I grew up, I wondered that Aunt Martha was so exceedingly particular as to my
                  education and associates; I wondered that she did not allow me to attend the
                  academy, as my young friends and companions did, that she was so careful as to my
                  choice of reading; she herself, or my kind friend and pastor Dr. Morrison,
                  superintending that, and my studies also. It was not till the time came when Aunt
                  Martha thought it best to tell me my mother's sad history, that I understood it
                  all.
               At Dr. Morrison's house, where I went two or three times a week to attend to some
                  studies in which Aunt Martha did not feel competent to assist me, I constantly met
                  his son Philip, a lad two or three years older than myself; and some studies I
                  pursued with him. He was a serious, thoughtful boy, very kind and gentle; and Aunt
                  Martha never made any objection to his accompanying me home, as he often did from
                  the village. Indeed Philip was always welcome at the old house, and we grew up
                  just like brother and sister; for each, in our own home, was an only child.
               I had a dear friend too, Mary Landon, to my intimacy with whom Aunt Martha never
                  objected, for she was a gentle and lovely girl, brought up by pious parents, with
                  the utmost care. When I was about fourteen years old, there came to reside with
                  Mr. Landon a nephew, who by the death of his father was left an orphan, and the
                  heir of quite a pretty property, for that part of the country.
               Robert Landon had been brought up in the utmost indulgence by a doting father, and
                  though frank and pleasant in his manner, was, as I afterwards learned to my cost,
                  (at least to my cost for the time,) thoroughly selfish and heartless.
                  He was very different from Philip Morrison, being gay, and lively, and very
                  devoted in his manner to the young girls of his acquaintance; while Philip was
                  grave and quiet, but always kind. Of these two I saw necessarily a great deal,
                  from my studies with Dr. Morrison, and my intimacy with Mary Landon, and I liked
                  them both; it would have been hard then to tell which I liked best. Robert's gay
                  and frolicsome manner amused me, and I could not but think him an agreeable
                  companion; but with Philip, I felt as if with an own dear brother.
               Aunt Martha did not much like Robert Landon, and looked grave, (perhaps she would
                  have looked cross if she knew how,) when he accompanied me home from
                  the village; but Mary and I loved each other dearly, and it would be hard to
                  separate us, and so of necessity I was much in Robert's society. But when I was sixteen years of age, Robert
                  and Philip both went away to college, and for four years I saw them only in their
                  vacations. At length they both graduated, and returned to our village. Robert was
                  now of age, and had come into possession of his property; he immediately purchased
                  a pretty farm not far from the village, upon which he built a beautiful cottage,
                  and settled down as a gentleman farmer. Philip told me, when I first saw him, that
                  he had made up his mind to study for the ministry.
               About this time I experienced my first bitter grief in the death of dear Aunt
                  Martha, after an illness of very few days. Her attack was of so violent a nature
                  that from the first she had little hope of recovery; and whenever her sufferings
                  and strength would allow, she talked with me and advised me as to my future
                  conduct. She then told me for the first time of one whom she had loved in her
                  youth, but for whom she would not leave her old father, and the other
                  Lizzie, then a mere child; and she asked of me a promise, which I readily granted,
                  that I would never desert the poor old man so long as he lived.
               Grandfather was kept in another part of the house during the funeral; and though
                  for a time he seemed to miss something upon which he had leaned, yet it was very
                  clear that he did not at all understand the nature of his loss, and he soon seemed
                  to settle down under my care, and to be quite as contented as with Aunt Martha,
                  whose loss I endeavored to the utmost of my ability in all things to make up to
                  him.
               In my loneliness now Mary Landon came often to see me, and sometimes her cousin
                  Robert accompanied her. Philip Morrison came often, too, sometimes with his good
                  old father, and sometimes without him, and he was just as kind and brotherly in
                  his way as ever. I knew now very well which of the two I liked best.
                  Robert's manner had become more and more devoted to me, and Mary had whispered to
                  me how much her cousin loved me. Bright visions of future happiness now floated
                  through my mind as I thought of myself as the mistress of Robert's pretty home.
                  The idea of separation from grandfather never occurred to me, for I thought it
                  would be an easy thing to remove him to another home, and that he would hardly
                  notice the change.
               My life now was a lonely and a quiet one, spent by poor old grandfather's side,
                  and ministering to his comfort. People sometimes remarked to me how strangely the
                  old man lived on, for now he was past ninety, and dead to nearly all things in the
                  present, though at times his memory as to events that happened years ago was clear
                  and distinct, and he fancied he was
                  living over those years again with the friends who were about him then. If I left
                  him, however, Janet said he seemed to miss something, and cried and moaned till I
                  returned; and so it came that I seldom left the house, or breathed the air, except
                  in the evenings after grandfather's early hour of retiring, for he always went to
                  bed when the chickens went to roost. It was a dull and lonely life for a young
                  girl, now that I look back to it, but it was the spot where Providence had placed
                  me; there lay the path of duty, and strength was given me to walk in it with
                  cheerfulness.
               Two or three years passed away; and though Robert came to see me often, and was
                  more and more devoted in his attentions, he never spoke to me directly of his
                  love, or asked me to marry him. Very many tender things he said, and his
                     manner was that of a lover, but to the point he never spoke. Ah! I
                  did not know that he was waiting for the poor old man to die!
               And now I lost a dear, kind friend, and one who had been to me a father and a
                  guide, and I did not mourn alone. The whole village was in grief; for never was
                  pastor more dearly loved than good Dr. Morrison, whom they were now called upon to
                  follow to the grave. Philip, who was now preaching, and was for the time supplying
                  a pulpit in a neighboring village, was called home by his father's illness, and
                  while he lingered was requested to fill his place. The talents, and zeal, and
                  eloquence of the young preacher captivated his hearers, most of whom had known and
                  loved him from his childhood; and when the old man's head was laid low, they said,
                  with one voice, "Philip is the man for us!"
               It was with much diffidence that the young minister took upon himself so arduous a
                  duty as filling his father's place for the time even, and it was with much
                  hesitation and reluctance that he at last consented to the earnest entreaties of
                  his father's old parishioners and became their pastor. The congregation were very
                  indulgent, saying they would be perfectly contented if he would give them one of
                  his own sermons in the morning, and read one of his father's to them in the
                  afternoon. The latter was a favor they could not ask of any but his son, and their
                  dear old pastor thus being dead would yet speak to them. The parsonage was there
                  all ready for him to step into, and his mother need not remove. These were all
                  great inducements, and the modest and humble young minister, deeply as he felt his
                  inability for the great work, dared not refuse; but in dependence upon a strength
                  greater than his own, he consented at last to try in some humble measure to supply his father's loss to
                  them.
               And the people said, "The mantle of Elijah hath surely fallen upon Elisha!" and
                  they blessed God that he had sent them one, whose ministrations were so likely to
                  prove a blessing to them.
               It was not long after Philip Morrison's settlement over his deceased father's
                  congregation, that he came out to see me one beautiful summer evening. Grandfather
                  was asleep for the night, and Philip asked me if I would take a walk with him. I
                  had been as usual sitting quietly by grandfather's side all day, and the beauty of
                  the evening tempted me; calling to Janet to listen to the old man, and telling her
                  that I should not go beyond the brook, so that she could call me if he should
                  wake, I threw my handkerchief over my head, and went out with Philip.
               I cannot describe my astonishment, when he almost immediately entered upon the
                  object of his coming, by asking me if I could consent to be his wife. He had loved
                  me for many years, he said, but dared not ask me to marry him, till he had a
                  prospect of a home to offer me. Most unexpectedly he had been abundantly provided
                  for, and he had now come to ask me if I could find it in my heart to love him, and
                  make him happy.
               Oh! how I grieved that he had said those words.
               No! no! I could not find it in my heart; the heart is a strange
                  thing, and mine was filled with another object; one so far inferior! but I loved
                  Philip Morrison as I would have loved a kind and gentle brother if I had had one,
                  and I could not bear to pain his noble heart. I tried to speak, but all I could do
                  was to burst into tears, and cry as if my heart would break. Oh! how kindly and
                  gently Philip spoke to me; if I could not love him, he said, he would leave me and
                  trouble me no more, wishing me every happiness, and hoping I would still feel for
                  him as I had ever done, the kindness and affection of a sister. And then how
                  tenderly, and respectfully, he spoke of poor old grandfather; saying that if I
                  could consent to make my home at the parsonage, the old man should be made as
                  comfortable and happy as possible there, and should ever receive from him the
                  respect and affection of a son.
               I could not stop him, I cried so bitterly; oh! why would he go on,
                  opening to me that kind and noble heart, only for me to grieve and crush it?
                  Making a gesture for him to stop, I shook my head, and gave him to understand that
                  it could not be; I could love him as a brother, but I could not look upon him in
                  any other light. Philip walked back with me to the gate, and then very kindly, but
                  with a sad and dejected air, he took his leave.
               
               And not many weeks after that, Robert Landon came out to the old house one
                  evening, and he came alone. He too asked me to walk out with him, as he had often
                  done before, but his manner was so different now, that I was sure of what was
                  coming, and my poor heart was all in a flutter. And part of what he had to say to
                  me, was the same that Philip Morrison had said, and my heart bounded with joy when
                  he asked me if I could love him well enough to marry him. He said that question
                  had been many, many times on his lips, but he had been waiting for an event of
                  whose occurrence he now despaired. Oh how little I thought to what he referred,
                  but imagined he was speaking of some of his own private affairs.
               I told him frankly that my heart was his, and for a few moments while we proceeded
                  to talk over plans and prospects, I was very, very happy. But when I spoke of poor
                  old grandpapa, as forming part of my arrangements, what a change came over
                  Robert's manner. Then all his selfishness glared out. "I did not think he was
                  going to burden himself with an imbecile and helpless old man!" he said. I told
                  him of course I could not expect that, if it was against his wish, and perhaps it
                  was very unreasonable in me to dream of such a thing; but one thing was certain,
                  so long as grandpapa lived, nothing but my own death should separate me from
                  him.
               Then, oh how unfeelingly, and how cruelly, Robert talked of the poor old man. He
                  told me that he would be just as well off with Janet, and just as contented as
                  with me; and when I told him how he pined and moaned, when I was away from him, he
                  said he would soon get over it, and forget all about me. Then he changed his tone,
                  and urged me with the utmost tenderness of manner, to think of him,
                  and his love for me since childhood, and not to break his heart; and then when I
                  returned to that one point on which we differed, he grew very angry,
                  and said I did not love him, I could not love him, if I
                  would not leave a silly, childish, helpless old man, who had no claims upon me,
                  for him.
               I did not attempt to say anything more, but we parted, he in high indignation, and
                  I in grief, for my hopes which were shattered, and my idol which had fallen to the
                  ground. "There let it lie!" said I, "I will not raise it to its place again;
                  Robert is thoroughly heartless and unfeeling, and I am only thankful my eyes are
                  opened in time."
               Heavily, and wearily, passed the lonely days, and weeks, and months. Mary Landon
                  was married, and had removed to a distant city. Robert never noticed me now, if we did meet, and Philip came
                  very seldom. Sometimes he called to see grandpapa, and in his dull ear repeated
                  the words of everlasting life, in language suited to the simplicity of a child,
                  but I fear the old man comprehended not what he said.
               When I could get away for half the day on Sunday, what a comfort it
                  was to me to go to the village church, and hear Philip preach. And when I looked
                  at his pale, intellectual face, and at his deep, dark eye, and heard the words of
                  eloquence that fell from his lips, I thought, "And is this the being whose love I
                  have slighted and rejected, for one utterly flippant and heartless?" I now felt
                  Philip's worth, and every time I heard him preach, or saw him at home, my esteem
                  and affection for him increased. But the precious privilege of attending church,
                  even half the day, I must now resign. It took a long time to walk to the village
                  and back again, and attend the morning service there, and when I returned I always
                  found that poor old grandfather had fretted and moaned so sadly during my absence,
                  that I felt assured now it was my duty to remain at home with him. Janet said he
                  would bid her draw his chair to the window which overlooked the village road, and
                  laying his withered forehead against the glass, he would moan for
                     Lizzie. "Why does n't Lizzie come from school?" he would say; and
                  then he would call upon Aunt Martha, and tell her to have the pony brought round,
                  that he might go to the village for his little darling; "the poor old pony," said
                  Janet, "that's been dead so many a year!" and then he would fall to crying, and
                  sobbing, so bitterly; saying that "Lizzie had left him forever; she had run away,
                  and would never, never come back again."
               Noâ€”it was plain I must not leave him any more. And so I told Philip when he came
                  out to inquire after grandpapa one day, and I asked him if he would be so kind as
                  to let me take his sermons sometimes to read. And so it came that Philip often
                  walked out during the week, to bring me a sermon, or a book, for my next Sunday's
                  reading; and sometimes he would kindly hand me his sermon not yet preached, to
                  read, so that on Sunday morning I knew the very words he was saying to the people,
                  and it was almost like being there. I felt quite at ease with Philip now, for a
                  gossipping neighbor had assured me that he was soon to be married to a young lady
                  of his congregation; and I went out so little, and saw so few, that I had no
                  opportunity to hear the falsehood of the report.
               One morning, about five years after dear Aunt Martha's death, I rose from my couch
                  in grandpapa's room, and went to his
                  bedside to call him; but he did not stir, and when I laid my hand upon his face it
                  was icy cold. I summoned Janet hastily, and we were both assured that he was dead.
                  Then I had to remain alone with the lifeless corpse, while Janet went to summon
                  neighbors and friends, and to the village for the minister. Kind friends remained
                  with me till after the funeral, and there were voices about the old house, and
                  something going on to take up my time and attention; but after the funeral was
                  over, and the old man was borne to the house appointed for all living, and the two
                  or three neighbors who had remained with me had just put everything in order, they
                  went away, and left me alone in the old house with Janet.
               Oh! what a sense of utter loneliness and desolation came over me! My care, my
                  occupation, all gone; nobody to labor for, or to watch; nothing, nothing to do. If
                  those good neighbors had only left the house in confusion, so that Janet and I
                  might have something to occupy ourselves about, but noâ€”every pin was in its
                  place.
               It was a still, sultry summer evening. Through the raised windows no sound could
                  be heard but the melancholy chirping of the katy-did in the distant tree, and the
                  croaking of the frogs from the mill-pond. "And did this old house once ring with
                  gay and merry voices?" I asked myself as I slowly paced back and forth in the
                  deserted parlor. How changed â€”how silent now! The mother in her prime, eight
                  children tenderly beloved, and now, last of all, the old father had been borne
                  from that door, and down that gravel walk; there, in the graveyard, they lie side
                  by side, and I the only representative of the family am left alone, without an
                  object in life!
               Oppressed with these melancholy thoughts, I went out to the kitchen, thinking it
                  would be a relief to talk to old Janet; but she had fallen asleep over the embers
                  in the fire-place, for even in the summer time she always drew her chair to the
                  chimney-corner, and I returned to the parlor to my lonely walk, and to my sad and
                  gloomy thoughts.
               What was I to do? I would not stay in the old house alone with Janet. No; we must
                  move to the village. I would take a school; I would do anything for occupation,
                  and to hear the sound of human voices round me. I should grow crazy to stay there
                  in the old house, and hear evening after evening no sound but the katy-dids, and
                  the tree-toads, and the bull-frogs in the pond. Just then the gate-latch was
                  raised, and looking through the window I was so happy to see Philip Morrison
                  coming up the walk. How kind, how
                  considerate in him, to come out again when he had so lately left there with the
                  funeral train, just to comfort me in my loneliness and sorrow. I met him at the
                  door, and told him how happy I was to see him, for I was very, very lonely. He sat
                  down by me on the sofa, and said such sweet words of consolation, calling my mind
                  so gently from my own griefs, and aiding me to fasten upon heavenly consolations,
                  that in a short time my mind became tranquil, and even the sounds which had before
                  seemed so melancholy lost their gloomy associations.
               At length, after a long pause, Philip said:
               "Lizzie, would it now be too presuming in me to ask you once again, if you will
                  come and cheer us at the parsonage? Could you, Lizzie, now make up your mind to
                  accept my love, which has only increased and strengthened as time wore on, and I
                  saw daily so much more reason to love and esteem you?"
               I remember the unmitigated astonishment with which I turned and looked into his
                  face.
               "Philip! Philip!" I exclaimed, "are you not engaged to Alice Gâ€”?"
               "No! Lizzie, no! never for a moment has my heart wavered in its deep affection for
                  you. Often and often have I longed to tell you this, but remembering bering your
                  former distress when I proposed the subjectâ€”"
               "Oh, Philip! I was very foolish then, and very blind, and now how little do I
                  deserve the happiness your words have brought me!"
               Long, long we talked that summer night, and when Philip at last left me how
                  changed all things seemed! The sounds from the trees and the water no longer
                  suggested thoughts of loneliness and gloom. My heart had now an object to rest
                  upon. I should not be alone and unloved through life, without an aim or purpose.
                  Oh! how could old Janet sigh and groan so, and say that this is a weary, weary
                  world! There are very bright spots in this world yet, Janet, and you and I are
                  going to leave the dull and silent old house, and we are going to live at the
                  parsonage; for Janet, the faithful creature, was not forgotten even in that first
                  talk of future plans and prospects.
               And now I write from my own pleasant room at the pretty parsonage, where I was
                  received a month ago to the kind and loving arms of my husband's mother. And the
                  people have welcomed me so cordially, and there is such a general rejoicing that
                  the minister is married at last! Everybody is so kind; and after my quiet, lonely
                  life in the old house with poor grandpapa, the world seems too bright and
                     beautiful tiful a place for mortals
                  to live in. Even old Janet seems to take a brighter view of it, for I have not
                  heard her call it a weary, weary world since we came to live at the parsonage.
               Well for me my husband, that you chose for your last Sunday's text the words,
                  "This is not your rest," and bade yourself and your people rest not in earthly
                  pleasures, and trust not for happiness to earthly friends and companionships, but
                  to look away from these to those never-fading joys and ever-enduring friendships
                  which await those who have fixed the anchor of hope within the vail, and are daily
                  drawing nearer and nearer to their heavenly inheritance.
            
            
               The Heir of Glen-Howard.
               IN one of the largest and most elegant dwellings in a certain city, which may as
                  well be nameless, a gay and brilliant company had assembled to grace the marriage
                  of the oldest daughter of the house. Everything that wealth and fashion could
                  contribute was there to render the scene a bright and gorgeous one; and whether
                  the young ladies present looked at the graceful and lovely bride in her rich and
                  costly array, or wandered to the dressing-room to examine at leisure the
                  magnificent display of presents lavished upon the favored one, and there laid out
                  for exhibition, or thought of her future prospects in the home of her wealthy
                  husband, they deemed the lot of Marion Vincent one to be envied.
               What though the groom was more than twice her age, and had a look somewhat stern
                  and overbearing, was he not the owner of Glen-Howard, the richest estate in the
                  country? What was there that wealth could procure that Marion would not possess?
                     Oh! what a favored lot was hers!
                  True, there were some sad faces and tear-dimmed eyes even in the midst of that gay
                  and brilliant scene. The father, about to lose that dear eldest daughter, who for
                  three years had taken the place of the dead mother in his household, might well
                  look grave and turn away to choke down the rising sob when congratulated upon her
                  brilliant prospects.
               The brothers and sisters nearest her own age could not repress the sigh or keep
                  back the tears when they thought of the lonely house that would be left them on
                  the morrow, when dear Marion, the sister, friend, adviser and sympathizer should
                  be far away, never again to be to them as she had been; and the little ones, who
                  were lifted up immediately after the ceremony to give Sister Marion the last
                  good-night kiss, made no effort to control their grief, but sobbed aloud, and then
                  cried themselves to sleep.
               The next morning Marion departed with her husband to travel for a time, and then
                  to settle down at Glen-Howard, the loveliest seat on one of our lovely inland
                  lakes. Marion was in raptures with her new home, the beauty of which far exceeded
                  the expectations she had formed of it. The place had been in the possession of the
                  Howard family for three generations, a long time for this country of change and
                  removal moval. The house, which was large and old, but in excellent repair, was of
                  a light cream color; and standing as it did upon quite an elevation sloping upward
                  from the shore of the lake, appeared to great advantage through the opening in the
                  trees as you approached it, with its green blinds, and broad piazzas, and tasteful
                  conservatory.
               Around it was every variety of rich and beautiful scenery; and the charms of
                  nature were, wherever it was a possible thing, enhanced by the hand of taste. The
                  fine old forest trees were in many places left in clumps and groves, and only
                  sacrificed to afford views of the magnificent scenery commanded from the piazza or
                  observatory of the house in whatever direction the eye might gaze. There was hill
                  and dale, and broad rich meadow. At the foot of a hill which descended suddenly on
                  one side of the mansion ran a stream not broad or deep, but winding and beautiful,
                  now lost among the trees, now appearing to view again, and spanned here and there
                  by a little rustic bridge thrown over it, more to give a romantic and picturesque
                  addition to the scene than for any object of utility.
               It would be hard to say amid so fair a scene which was the brightest object, but
                  there was one upon which the eye never could tire of gazing. The lovely lake, with its back ground of green
                  hills covered with the richest verdure, and crowned with noble forest trees, ever
                  varying its aspect with the changing wind or the passing cloud, beautiful whether
                  in perfect repose or when tossed by the wind into waves of the deepest green and
                  blue, capped with pure white foam; the beautiful lake was to the eyes of most of
                  those who gazed over the landscape the crowning glory of the scene.
               "Oh!" thought Marion, "were my father and that dear home circle but near me, what
                  would be wanting to complete my happiness!"
               But throughout the summer the house was filled with company, for Mr. Howard was
                  fond of his charming place and beautiful wife; and as he could do so without
                  trouble or inconvenience, he kept his house thronged with friends, who were by no
                  means backward to accept invitations to a spot offering so many facilities for
                  enjoyment. In the winter they repaired to the city, where Marion always found
                  herself the centre of a circle of dear and loving friends, among whom she had ever
                  been and still continued to be an unparalleled favorite. Oh! what a favored, happy
                  couple were Mr. and Mrs. Howard!
               But where will you find the cup without its one drop of bitter?
               Marion Vincent was Mr. Howard's third wife. The first had died within a year of
                  their marriage, the second lived with him three years; but both were lying far
                  away among the graves of their kindred, and neither of them had left a living
                  child, and Mr. Howard's all-engrossing desire was for a son and heir to his name
                  and estate.
               "Give me a son or I die!" was almost literally his daily prayer: he no more
                  thought of the possibility of having a daughter than if Eve had never
                  appeared in the garden, or there had never been a woman born into the world
                  since.
               "A son! a son!" oh how, as he paced that long piazza, did he rear before his eye
                  golden visions, or build castles with "airy foundations," in all of which that
                  beautiful boy calling him "papa!" bore a conspicuous part. How in fancy he watched
                  him through his babyhood and fascinating childhood; how he almost felt the little
                  hand in his as he walked over his beautiful grounds; how he saw the little fellow
                  cantering by his side on his pony, as they rode together over the country. What
                  pride he took in the development of his faculties and the cultivation of his
                  intellect, as he grew up toward manhood; how he would lean upon this darling son
                  when bowed down by age, how he would leave him his loved and honored representative when death should lay him
                  low.
               Visions, visions, all! scattered and banished by the first sound that startled the
                  day-dreamer from his reverie. Two, three, four years passed away, and that little
                  soft hand had never yet been laid on his cheek, or played with his hair, and that
                  little prattler was never at his side. Mr. Howard grew more sullen, and morose,
                  and gloomy; and Marion's thoughts went back more and more frequently to the
                  pleasant home of her childhood, and to the kind and cheerful voices sounding
                  there. Mr. Howard wrote no more letters of invitation to friends; he did not even
                  welcome them with cordiality when they came; he seemed to have no heart for
                  anything; and the beautiful house was silent and dull; and many were the bitter
                  tears shed in secret by poor Marion.
               But at length Mr. Howard seemed to wake up to new life; his step was once more
                  elastic, and his eye bright; again he was pleasant and cheerful, more so than
                  Marion had ever known him. Again came those bright visions to banish his gloom,
                  and again and constantly now that lovely little prattler was at his side.
               One anxious night he paced his study floor hour after hour, occasionally leaving
                  it and stepping with a light foot up the stairs, and then returning to pace the
                  floor again hour after hour. At length there was a tap at the door; opening it
                  very quickly, he saw standing there the little fat Scotch nurse, her face radiant
                  with smiles.
               "I've come to tell you, Sir, that you've got a bonny little daughter, and both
                  mother andâ€”"
               "What!" shrieked Mr. Howard, growing almost black in the face.
               "The bonniest little fat daughter, Sir."
               "Woman!" shouted Mr. Howard, his eyebrows knit, his eyes flashing, and shaking his
                  fist in her face, "Woman! if you could bring me no better news than that you might
                  better have kept away from here!" and as he stamped up and down the study-floor
                  his heel came down as if he had the poor baby, or the old nurse, or somebody upon
                  whom he intended to take revenge, under it, and was grinding them to powder.
               "Poor Mr. Howard," said Marion, "how bitterly disappointed he will be; I do not
                  believe he has ever thought of this as a possibility."
               And in truth he had not. Strange as it may seem, the idea of a
                     daughter had never intruded itself into his thoughts; and his
                  disappointment was proportionably the greater, as he was in no wise prepared for
                     it. Every inmate of his house, even
                  his poor, feeble wife, experienced its ill effects; as for the helpless baby, he
                  never noticed it by word or sign, except perhaps by an expression of anger or
                  impatience if he heard a cry from the cradle. Marion, understanding his feelings,
                  never intruded the baby upon his notice, though, as the little creature began to
                  display signs of intelligence, and practice her pretty infantile tricks, she
                  seemed to her mother so winning and lovely, that she could not imagine how he
                  could steel his heart against her, if he would but conquer his prejudice enough to
                  take a few moments' notice of her.
               She never even consulted him as to the baby's name, knowing that he would manifest
                  the most entire indifference, if not indignation, at the subject being referred to
                  him. She therefore quietly gave her her own and her mother's name, Marion, hoping
                  that at some future time that might be the means of drawing the father's heart
                  towards his now neglected child. Little Marion was indeed a most beautiful and
                  engaging little creature, and so entirely engrossed her mother's time and
                  attention, affording her such constant occupation and amusement, that she had no
                  more space for dull or lonely feelings. Her only cause of anxiety now was her
                  husband's apparent alienation from her, and the settled gloom and depression
                  pression which appeared to have made him their prey.
               Between two and three years passed away, and little Marion was running about and
                  prattling to all who would listen to her, in her pretty broken language. Her nurse
                  had learned to keep her entirely out of her father's sight, taking her out to
                  ramble over the grounds when he was engaged in his study, and letting her have the
                  range of the house and piazzas when he was absent on his daily rides. Incredible
                  as it may seem, he did not know her face. Had his first-born been a son, and had
                  this little daughter been content to take the second place, he might have found
                  room in his heart for her too; but as it was, he seemed to owe her a grudge for
                  taking the place of the son and heir he was so confidently expecting, and he could
                  not and would not forgive her.
               When little Marion was about three years old, the same old Scotch nurse who had
                  been so unfortunate as to announce her birth to her father, tapped again at his
                  study door. Had she been sent to communicate the same tidings she had carried
                  before, she would have approached the door with fear and trembling, or would have
                  sought a substitute as bearer of the message; but understanding the state of
                  things now, and expecting a different reception from that with which she had been met before, she tapped at the
                  door with confidence.
               "I've come to tell you, Sir, that you've got 
                     a a
                     a
                   bonny little boy!"
               "What!" exclaimed Mr. Howard, but in a very different tone from that in which he
                  had made the same exclamation before.
               "A beautiful bonny little son, Sir."
               The fist was not shaken, or the door slammed in her face now, but instead of that
                  something was dropped into her hand, and Mr. Howard closed the door, that the old
                  woman might not see what a fool he made of himself in his delight and exultation.
                  He had not dared this time to indulge in any such hopeful anticipations as he had
                  done before, remembering his bitter disappointment, and his joy and happiness at
                  the announcement were unbounded.
               Oh how he hung over the cradle where that little red unconscious object of his
                  hopes and affections reposed, while his beautiful little daughter retired at his
                  approach and hid among the curtains of her mother's bed, or behind the old nurse's
                  chair. Mr. Howard knew nothing about babies; he had never looked at a young baby
                  before, and he had had no idea how extremely interesting such a little lump of
                  flesh and blood could be.
               And now he asked innumerable questions of the mother and nurse, as to when the boy
                  would begin to notice; when he would know him; at what
                  age children might be expected to sit alone, creep, cut teeth, walk, &c.? He
                  sent for an elegant rattle and silver goblet for the baby, before it was a
                  fortnight old, and seemed a little surprised that it did not shake the one and
                  drink out of the other immediately. Whenever he could leave the cradle long
                  enough, he spent his time in writing to friends, making any excuse he could
                  contrive for writing, in order to be able to say at the end of the letter:
                  "Congratulate me, my dear friend, on the birth of a son."
               Some gentlemen who were travelling in that part of the country stopped to see him;
                  but the conversation on Mr. Howard's part was so continually taken up with
                     that boy, who, wrapped in flannel from head to foot, was brought
                  down for exhibition; and so many messages were sent to different acquaintances,
                  announcing the arrival of that important little personage, that as soon as his
                  friends were out of his hearing they burst into a shout of laughter,
                  exclaiming:
               "What a fool Howard makes of himself over that brat; one would think it was the
                  first boy that ever was born into the world!"
               
               About a week after the birth of Mr. Howard's son and heir, he received a letter
                  from the husband of Marion's sister next in age to herself, and who had been
                  married about a year, announcing that he too was the happy father of a boy, and
                  stating many interesting particulars relative to the little stranger, such as the
                  color of the hair and eyes, its name, weight, &c. Mr. Howard was in quite an
                  ecstasy to find that his own boy weighed a pound the most, and wrote back to Mr.
                  Malsom to "tell Emma that hers no doubt was a very fine child, but they could not
                  expect to show such children in the city as the one on exhibition at Glen-Howard."
                  He would like to place them side by side some three or four months hence as
                  specimens of town and country breeding. And a great deal more nonsense of the kind
                  he wrote, and was continually writing to the Malsoms and other friends, and his
                  wonderful boy was ever the theme.
               As the child grew to be six weeks, two months, and three months old, the father
                  watched in vain for those signs of intelligence and animation which he had been
                  taught to expect at those periods of babyhood. Hour after hour he would sit before
                  the cradle, shaking the gaudy rattle, or dangling his watch before the beautiful,
                  deep blue eyes of the child, without being able to call forth any manifestation of
                  interest, or even evincing an intimation that the child noticed the brilliant
                  things passing before his eyes.
               In the evening he would move the candle back and forth, place it near the little
                  boy and then withdraw it, but the eyes only stared straight forward and took no
                  more heed to the brilliant light than if the power of vision were not there. And
                  all this time they were receiving such wonderful accounts from Emma Malsom of the
                  vivacity and intelligence of her child.
               "Marion, why doesn't he notice the watch?" Mr. Howard would often say. "See, his
                  eyes do not follow it; Mrs. Scott, is n't it time he should begin to take a little
                  more notice of things?"
               But Marion would only turn away her pale, sad face, while Mrs. Scott would
                  answer:
               "Well, children is very different, Sir. Now, Miss Marion, there;" then, checked by
                  a look from her mistress, she would return to her first and oft-repeated
                  assertion, "Children is very different, Sir."
               Time wore on, and the boy was six months old, and still there was no more
                  intelligence in the beautiful eyes, no sign of knowing parent or nurse, no
                  inclination to amuse himself with the glittering baubles with which children of
                  that age are commonly delighted. To Marion, who, having been the oldest of a large
                  family of children, well understood the ways of baby-hood, the cause was clear; and her health,
                  which had been feeble ever since the birth of the little boy, declined gradually
                  under her own anxiety and distress of mind, and the anticipation of the terrible
                  blow that was in reserve for her husband.
               About this time Mrs. Malsom arrived to make them a visit with her baby, a bright,
                  intelligent little fellow, laughing and clapping his hands with glee at pleasant
                  sights or sounds, and ready to spring from one's arms at the sight of his father
                  entering the room. Oh! how great was the contrast now! for the heir of Glen-Howard
                  lay silent and dull in his cradle, and never moved or stirred, or made a sound
                  except to fret occasionally when hungry.
               But still Mrs. Scott said, "Children is very different, Sir; the bonny little boy
                  may be a little backward, Sir, but its like he 'll rouse up in time and beat 'em
                  all yet." But his wife gave him no such encouragement; and Emma, now understanding
                  the state of things, kept her bright, beautiful boy as much as possible out of Mr.
                  Howard's way. Months more passed away. The little heir of Glen-Howard developed
                  physically, and was really a beautiful child, but, intellectually, there was no
                  change. Dull and unobservant as ever, he reached the age of a year.
               And now Mr. Howard became seriously awake to the child's deficiency; and noticing
                  Marion's sad face and tearful eye when he questioned her on the subject, he
                  determined to send to the city for an eminent physician, who was also an intimate
                  friend, and wrote urging him to come and make as long a stay as he conveniently
                  could at Glen-Howard, to make the child's case his study, and advise what was best
                  to be done for him.
               Without loss of time Dr. Maxwell came, and after trying various experiments upon
                  the little fellow, he accompanied Mr. Howard into his study, and said to him:
               "My dear friend, our art may do much where the bodily powers alone are disordered;
                  but I must say to you candidly, and I do it with the deepest sorrow and sympathy,
                  that where God has denied the gift of intellect, man can do nothing to supply its
                  place."
               The wretched father threw himself into his chair, and covering his face with his
                  hands gave vent to his anguish in bitter sobs and groans.
               It was true thenâ€”the heir of Glen-Howard was a hopeless idiot!
               Poor Mrs. Howard, whose worst fears as to her little son were now confirmed, and
                  who found the effect of the terrible announcement to be worse upon her husband
                  than even she had anticipated, seemed to have no more courage or strength to bear up against the power of a disease
                  which had long been undermining her constitution. Her symptoms now became
                  alarmingly worse, and though Dr. Maxwell remained as long as possible, and did
                  much to alleviate her sufferings, it was not in the power of man to arrest the
                  ravages of her fatal malady.
               It was not without many sad forebodings that she found herself sinking to the
                  grave, to leave behind her a little daughter unloved and neglected by her father,
                  and an idiot son, both of whom seemed to require so imperatively a mother's gentle
                  care; but even in these disheartening circumstances faith at length triumphed, and
                  she was enabled to say with confidence, "I leave my motherless children with
                     Thee," for "thou doest all things well."
               After the death of his wife Mr. Howard shut himself up more closely than ever, and
                  abandoned himself to a gloom as deep and dark as the grave. He could not take
                  comfort in his poor little boy, he would not seek it in his daughter; and he
                  turned resolutely from those higher and more enduring consolations, which are all
                  sufficient to alleviate the most bitter woes to which humanity is liable. Poor
                  disappointed man!
               Years passed awayâ€”the little Marion grew in grace and loveliness, and in such
                  knowledge as she might acquire from the hirelings under whose care she was placed.
                  Her little brother, now five years of age, would have been pronounced at first
                  sight an uncommonly lovely looking child, but a second glance would reveal the
                  want of that without which no human countenance can be beautiful. Oh! it was
                  pitiful, to look upon a form and features so exquisitely moulded, and to know that
                  the soul and mind were all dark within, and in intelligence below the brutes that
                  perish.
               One day as Mr. Howard, according to his wont, was pacing gloomily up and down the
                  long piazza, some movement at a window as he passed attracted his attention, and
                  turning his head he saw gazing up at him a pair of deep earnest eyes, looking from
                  among soft brown ringlets. The face, the expression were so precisely those of his
                  own lost Marion, that he paused in astonishment; and after reflecting a moment he
                  said to himself: "It must be so; and there may be companionship for me even
                  here."
               He then called, "Come here child!" and the timid little creature came out of the
                  door and crept to his side. Seating himself upon a piazza-chair which was near he
                  drew her towards him and said:
               "What do they call you, child?"
               "My name is Marion," answered the little girl.
               
               "Marion!" repeated the father; "how strange that I should not have known it; and
                  oh! oh! how like!" he added, putting back her hair. Then noticing her sun-bonnet
                  dangling on her arm, he asked:
               "Where have you been, Marion?" The name came out as if the utterance
                  choked him; he had not spoken it before in years.
               "I've been over there, with Kitty," answered the child, pointing to some white
                  palings, of which glimpses might be caught through the trees on an opposite hill.
                  "We have been," lowering her voice to a whisper, "to mamma's
                  grave."
               "Do you go there often?" asked the father, tears dimming his eyes for the first
                  time in many a day.
               "Yes Sir, we go there every day; and we plant pretty flowers, and water them; here
                  is a violet from mamma's grave." Then, as those eyes which had seemed to her so
                  stern, when she had caught sight of them from the window, gazed on her more
                  tenderly, with the instinct of childhood she took encouragement from their
                  expression, and spoke with more confidence to the father who had hitherto been a
                  stranger to her.
               "We draw Willie over there too, every day," she said, "but Willie does n't know
                  that it is mamma's grave. When will Willie know?"
               No answer but a groan.
               "I try, and try, and try to teach Willie to read," continued the
                  child, "but I cannot make him learn. When will Willie learn?"
               An allusion in words to that which was ever the uppermost thought in his mind was
                  too much for the father's impatient and disappointed spirit to bear, and pushing
                  the child from him rather angrily, he rose and began again his rapid walk up and
                  down the piazza which the sight of the little earnest face had interrupted.
               Frightened and grieved, the little creature sought refuge in the nursery, and soon
                  in spelling out slowly a psalm to the old nurse she forgot for the time her
                  trouble. After a few days she ventured again to steal to the window from which she
                  had before watched her father, and to raise her timid little eyes toward him as he
                  passed.
               "Oh, if he would but love me; if he would but love me!" she thought to herself;
                  "he can speak kindly and gently, for he spoke so the other day, but
                  nursey says I must never say anything to him about Willie. Poor dear Willie, and
                  poor me, nobody cares for us but nursey and Kitty."
               For several days she watched unnoticed, but at length her father's eyes were again
                  attracted towards her, and seating
                  himself as before, he again called her to him, and began to talk with her. Little
                  Marion was now very careful to keep from the offensive subject, and they got on
                  much better together. The old man became interested in her childish prattle; he
                  saw that here was a bright mind totally uncultivated, and through the rest of the
                  day he was busied in plans for the education and improvement of his little
                  daughter. This was just what he wanted; something to occupy his thoughts and draw
                  them from himself and his own disappointments and troubles. From this time a new
                  era may be dated in the history of father and daughter. They were now inseparable,
                  and the quick mind of the little Marion unfolded rapidly, and hourly acquired new
                  and useful ideas under her father's instruction. It was wonderful to see the
                  change in the old man now that he had something to think of and to love, and but
                  for the thought of poor Willie, Marion's heart would have been as full of
                  happiness as it could hold.
               As she grew older her father took her to the city in the winter time, that she
                  might have the advantage of the best instruction in music and drawing, of which
                  she was passionately fond, while her graver studies were never neglected by him.
                  In his own eagerness to perfect his daughter in many branches of learning, which
                  was seconded by her intense desire for the acquisition of knowledge, he forgot
                  that over-exertion of mind might wear out the body, and was reminded of the fact
                  only too late, when his lovely daughter's pale cheek and languid step, and
                  inability for exertion, mental or physical, showed him his mistake, and warned him
                  that the time had come for rest and recreation. That time was past, and it was not
                  in the power of rest or remedy now to restore vital energy wasted and
                  destroyed.
               It is very sad when we have trained a pet bird or flower till its beauty and
                  loveliness begin to repay our care, to see it wither, and droop, and die; but oh,
                  to rear a loved and petted child, to watch the unfolding graces of a gifted mind,
                  to see the form and face growing in loveliness day by day, to train that dear one
                  till it becomes a companion, and comforter, and support, and then to be doomed to
                  watch its slow decline! God grant the consolation, where he sends the trial!
               Nothing can be conceived of more lovely than was Marion Howard at the age of
                  eighteen, but the extreme delicacy of her complexion, and the bright hectic tinge
                  which at times showed itself upon her cheek, told in language plainer than speech,
                  that she was passing away. From the time the old man's fears were first awakened and then corroborated by
                  Dr. Maxwell, whom without loss of time he consulted, he was like one frantic. He
                  felt as if his only prop was sinking from beneath him. What had he to care for but
                  Marion, and now it was but too plain that she was slowly, surely, slipping from
                  his grasp, and he would soon be left alone again.
               The usual means were resorted to; a journey to a milder climate; all that love,
                  and wealth, and skill could do were tried, but what could all avail when He who
                  gave the boon thought it wisest and best to withdraw it to himself again? Did that
                  old man remember in this time of trial how the boon had been received?
               Out upon the tossing waves a soul is quietly and gently passing out to its new
                  existence. With the dying one all is peace, for the same blessed word which she
                  learned to love when she slowly spelled out its teachings to her old nurse, has
                  ever been a "light to her feet and a lamp to her path," and it now illumes that
                  valley which she is entering alone; yet not alone, for one "like unto the son of
                  God" is walking with her and supporting her feeble footsteps. By her side and
                  holding her thin white hand sits the poor old man in silent, despairing agony, and
                  his thoughts are of the coming desolation. He has never learned to look upward; he
                  has never leaned upon any but failing reeds; there have been lights across his
                  pathway, but one by one they have gone out, and now thick darkness is coming;
                  desolation! desolation! poor old man!
               What sight can be more sad and dreary than a funeral procession on a lonely
                  country road. Slowly it moves onâ€”the black, dismal, hearse in front, and two or
                  three carriages following; they wind along, now hidden by the trees, now appearing
                  to view again; solemnly and slowly they move; and so they bear Marion to her home.
                  And after a day or two the dull, silent house is opened, the neighbors who loved
                  the winning child, and the beautiful girl, gather to bear her to her last
                  resting-place within the white paling, where rest the ashes of her sainted mother.
                  And so the light of the dwelling goes out.
               Those who now pass along that way and look up at the fine mansion on the hill, may
                  see an old man walking with feeble steps up and down the long piazza; his form is
                  bent now, his thin gray hairs are lifted by the breeze; his eyes are sometimes
                  raised to the white palings on the opposite hill-side, where rest the objects of
                  his love and pride, but they never look upward; and within all is darkness and
                  despair.
               In one room in that dwelling sits the heir of Glen-Howard Howard, playing with the rattle which should have
                  amused him in his infancy, unnoticed and uncared-for by the father who welcomed
                  him at his birth with such frantic demonstrations of joy.
               Poor disappointed old man! Why will he not, turn from the dried-up streams of
                  human affection to the never-failing, ever-satisfying fountain open for all who
                  thirst? Life is waning awayâ€”a broad eternity is just before him. All has been vain
                  longing and bitter disappointment here. What will the end be?
               Ye who wish and long for those things which to you seem all-sufficient to make
                  life a scene of happiness, pray that your wishes be not granted; for there is one
                  who knows better than you do what is best for you; be content to let Him order and
                  arrange all, and if you leave yourself in his hands, be assured that "All things
                  shall work together for your good."
            
            
               Poor Nina, the Fugitive.
               IT was on a bright beautiful Sunday afternoon in midsummer, that a large party of
                  children, of all sizes, sexes, and colors, might have been seen sporting upon the
                  oak-covered lawn, which sloped from a fine southern mansion down to the winding
                  river. These children all looked neat, and clean, and happy, though some of them
                  had skins as black and shining as jet, and hair as woolly as the sheep's back; but
                  their home was a happy one, they had a kind, indulgent master and mistress, and as
                  yet knew nothing of the true miseries of their condition.
               A short distance apart from the rest of the merry group, were two little girls,
                  who with their arms about each other's necks, were tripping and dancing down the
                  lawn. One of these was very fair, with long golden ringlets, and eyes of the
                  deepest blue; the other was a few shades darker in complexion, with eyes as black
                  as jet; she too had long curls hanging about her face and neck, but they were
                  black as the raven's wing, and smooth
                  and glossy. The fairest of the two appeared the most richly dressed, if one
                  examined them closely, but the other looked as neat and nice as possible, in her
                  pure white frock and pantalettes.
               If you had seen those two children playing together in one of our northern cities,
                  you might have taken them for two beautiful little sisters, or neighbors. What was
                  the difference between them in the eye of God? None. They were in His eyes two
                  little immortal beings, both of whom His hand had made,â€” for both of whom His only
                  Son had died. He had given to both never-dying immortal souls, destined alike to a
                  never-ending eternity, and was ready to embrace them with equal affection, in the
                  arms of his love.
               What was the difference between them in the eye of the law? One was a little
                  free-born girl, under no control but that of kind, loving parents, surrounded by
                  luxuries and comforts, and everything to make life happy. The other was a little
                  slave, not belonging even to her own mother; happy now because surrounded by kind
                  friends, and ignorant of her own true position, but liable to sad and sudden
                  changes; and with no right to a will, but that of those who owned
                  her, as we own any animal we buy.
               Such was the difference between Miss Hatty Evelyn and the little slave Nina. But
                  of this difference they were all unconscious, as they ran about so lovingly, with
                  their arms around each other's necks, telling each other beautiful stories, and
                  talking of the fine things they would do when they grew to be women.
               It was a favorite amusement with little Miss Hatty to get her young companions
                  around her and play school, she of course being the teacher; and so after running
                  about with Nina till she was tired, she seated herself on a grassy bank under a
                  wide-spreading oak, and called them all around her. Putting on as much of an air
                  of dignity and authority as she could assume, she said:
               "Now, children, I am going to teach you all some Bible lessons, because this is
                  Sunday, you know, and I want you all to listen, and see who will answer best.
                  Dorcas, you must stop turning somersets, and be attentive."
               "Yes, Miss Hatty," said Dorcas, sitting up as demure as possible, and fixing her
                  shining eyes on the face of her little mistress.
               "Now, Dorcas, I will begin with you," said the young teacher. "Who made you,
                  Dorcas?"
               "Some God, I 'spose," said Dorcas, chucking her head for another
                  somerset, but restraining herself suddenly on a glance at Miss Hatty's face.
               
               "What do you mean by that, Dorcas? You must say, 'God made me,'" said
                  Hatty.
               "Did the same God make the white folks and the niggers, Miss Hatty?" asked
                  Dorcas.
               "I suppose He did, Dorcas, because my mamma taught me to say, 'There is One only,
                  the living, and true God.'"
               "Where will the good people go when they die, Nanny?" was the next question to the
                  little blacky who sat next to Dorcas.
               "'Spect they'll go to Heaven, Miss Hatty," answered Nanny.
               "Will the niggers and the white folks go to the same Heaven, Miss Hatty?" asked
                  the persevering Dorcas.
               This was something of a puzzler for the young teacher, who, like many an older
                  one, however, was too wise to let her pupils see that there was
                     anything she did not know. So putting on a very wise look, she
                  said:
               "We can't exactly tell, Dorcas, because none of us have ever been
                  there." Then lighting on a bright thought, as she supposed, she added: "I've heard
                  my mamma say that there were many mansions up there, so I suppose
                  some how or other there's room for all."
               "What is a mansion, Miss Hatty?" asked one of her young pupils.
               "Oh, a mansion is a kind of a great house, like ours or Mr. Thornton's," answered
                  the wise little teacher.
               "Then I'll tell you how I 'spect it is, Miss Hatty," said the talkative Dorcas,
                  who thought she had as much right to her own opinion on the subject as any one
                  else. "I 'spect there's one mansion for the masters and the misses, then there's
                  another not quite so han'some for kind o' white niggers, like Kitty, and Emma, and
                  Rufus, and then there's another for real brack niggers, like us, and Pomp, and
                  Aunt Judy, and then there's a kind o' big cabin-like for de good fiel' hands;
                  don't you 'spose that's the way of it, Miss Hatty?"
               "I tell you we can't exactly tell about that, Dorcas, till we've been there; but
                  you must remember that the bodies don't go to Heaven, because my mamma said the
                  good people's souls went to Heaven. No, let me see, she did say something about
                  the body rising too when the judgment-day comes, but I don't remember all she
                  said; anyhow the bodies will be very different from what they are now."
               "What if we should come up white, Nan!" exclaimed
                  Dorcas, giving her next neighbor a dig in the side, and opening her big eyes to their utmost
                  stretch. Then turning to her young teacher, she asked:
               "Is niggers' souls white, Miss Hatty?"
               "Oh, Dorcas! you ask altogether too many questions," said the young teacher,
                  rising suddenly, and breaking up the school; determined, however, that she would
                  seek an early opportunity to put these same puzzling questions to her mother, and
                  take some other occasion to enlighten her dusky little pupils. Then calling her
                  favorite Nina to accompany her, she put her arm lovingly round her, and away they
                  went bounding over the grassy lawn.
               Being alone with her mother one day not long after, she began:
               "Mamma, Dorcas and the other children ask me a great many questions that
                     I can't answer at all. They want to know if the same God made the
                  white people and the black people, and if all that are good will go to the same
                  Heaven, and if the black people's souls are white; and I don't know what to say,
                  mamma."
               Her mother sighed, and opening her Bible, she said, "Listen, Hatty:
               "'God that made the world, and all things therein, hath made of one
                     blood all nations of men for to dwell on the face of the earth;' and if
                  we look the whole Bible through, we cannot find that God makes any difference
                  between his people because of their color or condition in life. He invites
                     all to come to Him; His Son died for all, and
                     all who trust and love Him will be welcomed to the same Heaven,
                  for they are all His children alike."
               "But, mamma, now how do you suppose Mr. Thornton would feel to meet Shadrach, and
                  old Moses, and all his field servants he is so cruel to, in Heaven?" Then,
                  checking herself, she said: "Oh, but I forgot, Mr. Thornton can't ever go to
                  Heaven."
               "Why, Hatty! why do you say so?" asked her mother.
               "Oh mamma, of course he can't, because he swears so awfully, and he
                  is so very cruel and wicked; of course he can't go to Heaven."
               Mrs. Evelyn was silent a few moments, while she thought of the vast changes which
                  would take place in the condition of some of those who occupy the
                  relation of master and slave here. While the man of intelligence, and light, and
                  privileges, who knew his Lord's will and did it not, will be beaten with many
                  stripes, the humblest and most ignorant disciple of Jesus, even though his portion
                  here may have been stripes and bondage, will be welcomed to the arms of the
                  Saviour, and greeted as friend and brother.
               
               Time passed on, and Hatty and Nina reached their fourteenth year. They had grown
                  up together almost like twin-sisters; all that Hatty knew she had taught to Nina,
                  so that a stranger in conversing with the two, would perceive very little
                  difference between them as to their education. But alas for poor Nina! sudden and
                  dreadful changes now took place at Oaklawn. The good, kind father and master, Mr.
                  Evelyn, was found dead in his bed one morning, and oh! how much in the lives of
                  many poor creatures depended upon the life or death of that one man.
               By Mr. Evelyn's will, Oak-Lawn, their present beautiful residence, was left to
                  Mrs. Evelyn, and in case of her death, to Hatty. So were also the servants whom
                  Mrs. Evelyn had inherited from her father, with all their descendants born on the
                  plantation. Mr. Evelyn's other estate, Blooming-Grove, was left to his son by a
                  former wife, John Evelyn, a young man who had been for many years in Europe, and
                  of whom since he grew up, little was known by the family at Oak-Lawn, except from
                  his letters to his father, which were proper and respectful enough, though the
                  demands for money were frequent and urgent, and often caused great surprise to the
                  easy and indulgent father. To Mr. John Evelyn, also, descended all the slaves
                  purchased by his father, and these were to be removed to his plantation at
                  Blooming-Grove, on the young man's return, if it suited his pleasure so to dispose
                  of them. Among these were poor Nina and her mother, who had been purchased by the
                  deceased Mr. Evelyn when Nina was a mere infant; not that he needed more slaves,
                  for he had almost made a vow never to purchase another, but to prevent their being
                  separated, the person who was about purchasing Aunt Hannah not wishing to be
                  bothered with the child.
               Had little Hatty's bright face only peeped over her father's shoulder as he was
                  writing that will, she would have begged for Nina as a present to herself, and
                  that Aunt Hannah might be left at Oak-Lawn; but Hatty was not there, and Mr.
                  Evelyn was only intent upon making what he supposed the most satisfactory
                  arrangement for all parties.
               As soon as possible after the tidings of his father's death reached him, John
                  Evelyn was on his way home, to take possession of his inheritance. He made but a
                  short stay at Oak-Lawn, and then leaving one whom he had hired at Bâ€” as his
                  overseer, to superintend the removal of the servants, he went on to his own estate
                  at Blooming-Grove.
               And now the news spread among the people at Oak-Lawn, that there was to be a
                  separation there, and some of them had
                  become the property of Mr. John Evelyn, and were to be removed from the home where
                  they had been so happy. Anxious suspense was on every face, for none knew who were
                  to go, or who to stay. Aunt Hannah was almost the only one who seemed at her ease
                  on the subject, for knowing the affection which Miss Hatty bore to Nina, it never
                  occurred to her that they would be separated, and from the long-tried kindness of
                  her master's family she felt sure they would not part her from her child.
               What, then, was the grief and anguish of poor Aunt Hannah, when she was told that
                  she and Nina must leave the house where they had been so kindly cared for, and go
                  "whither they knew not." As yet Hatty and Nina were entirely ignorant of the
                  changes about to take place, and, happy as ever in each other's society, were
                  sewing, reading, or rambling together. The night before they were to leave, Aunt
                  Hannah broke the sad tidings to Nina, whose distress was such that for a time she
                  seemed almost frantic. Long and late they sat and talked it over, sometimes
                  crying, and sometimes praying, till at length Nina raised her head, and said:
               "Mother, does Miss Hatty know?"
               "No, my child, Misses said she must not know, till we are fairly off."
               "And we start so early in the morning?"
               "Yes, by day-light."
               "Oh, mother! can't I just kiss Miss Hatty for good-bye? Dear, sweet Miss Hatty!
                  Mother, go and ask Mrs. Evelyn if I may just kiss her while she is asleep."
               Poor Mrs. Evelyn, whose heart was too sad to allow of her sleeping that night, was
                  slowly pacing her room when Aunt Hannah appeared with Nina's last request.
               "Certainly," Mrs. Evelyn said, "poor Nina might kiss Miss Hatty, but she must take
                  care not to wake her, she would feel so sadly."
               Hatty lay in a gentle and peaceful sleep, her lovely curls falling about her face,
                  and poor Nina, no less beautiful, leaned, over her, wiping away her tears, lest
                  they should fall on the young sleeper's face, and disturb her rest. Then stooping,
                  and giving her one parting kiss, she was led away by Aunt Hannah, who said they
                  must try and get a little rest before they started.
               Few slept that night at Oak-Lawn; Mrs. Evelyn had seen enough of her step-son, to
                  feel assured that he was thoroughly selfish and unprincipled; and of the overseer
                  whom he had chosen, to know that mercy and kindness were not to be expected at
                     his hands, and she grieved for the
                  poor creatures, for whose comfort and religious training she had always been so
                  solicitous. She rose early from her sleepless bed, to see that they were provided
                  with a good breakfast before startingâ€”and then came the separation, and the
                  broken-hearted adieus.
               Poor Nina's tearful face was turned back, as long as she could catch a glimpse of
                  Miss Hatty's windows, and then hiding it on her mother's lap, she burst into loud
                  and bitter wailings.
               John Evelyn was not naturally cruel, but, as I have said before, he
                  was selfish and unprincipled. His time was spent in reckless dissipation, his
                  house filled with the worst class of young men from the neighboring city, while
                  his poor people were left to the care of a brutal overseer in the fields, and a no
                  less unmerciful housekeeper at home. Those who had been reared with so much care
                  and kindness, in Mr. Evelyn's family, now felt for the first time what it was to
                  be in bondage, and upon none did the change come with more crushing weight, than
                  upon poor Nina. Her life at Oak-Lawn, as the friend and favorite companion of the
                  lovely and gentle Hatty, had ill-prepared her for the scenes of trial and hardship
                  through which she must now daily pass.
               I cannot describe to you all that poor Nina suffered, in the home of her new
                  master; which was the resort, as I before said, of wicked and dissolute young men
                  from the city. It is sufficient to say, that she must now lead a life of sin, from
                  which her soul revolted, or submit day after day to severe punishment. Her poor
                  mother, who I doubt not was a sincere Christian, encouraged her by her
                  exhortations and prayers, to adhere to a life of virtue, urging her rather to
                  suffer death from the lash of her oppressors, than to live a life of sin and
                  shame; and pointing her ever to the reward awaiting them that endure to the end,
                  no matter what may be the hue of the blood that courses through their veins.
               Nina had thought that no drop of bitterness now could be added to her cup of
                  suffering; but alas! a more terrible trial awaited her than any she had before
                  experienced. One night when John Evelyn and his companions were engaged as usual
                  in gambling, they drank deeper, and played more desperately, than ever; and at
                  length when John, who was too much intoxicated to play with his usual caution, had
                  already lost large sums, Nina was the stake proposed by one who had
                  often seen and admired the beautiful slave. Again John Evelyn was the loser, and
                  Nina had now become the property of a wild and reckless youth, whose home was in
                  New Orleans. He was a man destitute
                  alike of principle and feeling, and the next day the frantic Nina was torn from
                  her poor broken-hearted mother's arms, and taken to this young man's home, in that
                  great city.
               We love not to dwell upon scenes of mental, or physical suffering. There are those
                  who attempt to school themselves to the belief, that the slave has no strong
                  feeling of affection towards his kindred; that the ties of blood with him are
                  weak, easily severed, and lightly forgotten. We know not how it may be in general,
                  with that oppressed and despised race, but we do know, that with all
                  this is not the case; we know that there is no free white child, beloved and
                  idolized by a fond and doting mother, whose heart would be torn by more bitter and
                  despairing anguish, than was poor Nina's, when dragged from her mother's arms. Add
                  to this, that she was going to the home of an unprincipled and cruel man, to be
                  his slave, in every sense of the word, and that her only choice would
                  be between a life of sin, and a life of bitter suffering.
               All the night before Nina was to leave, she and her poor mother talked, and wept,
                  and prayed, in anguish of heart; it was a night of distress far keener than that
                  which preceded their departure from Oak-Lawn, for now they were to be parted from
                  each other, without out even the distant hope of ever meeting
                  again, this side eternity. Nina was now no more to be comforted
                  and encouraged by her mother's counsels and prayers; and light, and hope, seemed
                  to fade from her sight forever. Her eye already shone with an unnatural
                  brightness, and her cheek was tinged at times with the hectic, which foretold
                  consumption. Poor Nina! dark, and still darker hung the clouds which overshadowed
                  her fate. She had but one resource, a never-failing one; in her mother's God was
                  her only hope. Communion with Him could not be denied her, so long as life and
                  reason remained. No dungeon so deep, no bolts so strong, as to keep the Saviour of
                  sinners from the side of the weakest of those who put their trust in Him. To the
                  great and wicked city, the prison house of bondage, where the hopeless cry of so
                  many despairing wretches daily goes up to God for vengeance, was poor Nina
                  borne.
               "Shall not I visit them for these things? saith the Lord; shall not my soul be
                  avenged on such a nation as this?"
               And has He not been avenged? He has sent forth his swift-winged
                  messengers, "the pestilence that walketh in darkness, and the destruction that
                  wasteth at noon-day," and for a time well-nigh depopulated the once busy city;
                  stilling the hum of business, and
                  heaping master and slave, oppressor and oppressed, in one common grave. "Vengeance
                  is mine, I will repay," saith the Lord.*
                  
               
               
                  
                  *IT is not for us, to be sure, to say that special judgments are sent in
                     punishment of particular sins, or to deny that we at the North, had we our
                     deserts, might expect to be visited by scourge and pestilence; still it does
                     seem to us that signal vengeance is sometimes taken by Jehovah even in this
                     life for crying wickedness, and that it would be well for us all, as a
                     nation, to humble ourselves in the dust, to put away from us the evil of our
                     doings, and to raise our united cry to Him who taketh vengeance, that he
                     will avert from us his righteous indignation.
               
               During her master's frequent absences, poor Nina often strolled down to the Levee,
                  and looked with anxious, eager eyes into the dark deep water. And the tempter
                  whispered to her to plunge beneath the rolling waves, and go, 
                     
                        "Any where, any where,
                        Out of the world."
                     
                   But she had been too well instructed to look upon self-destruction as aught
                  but sin, and with a prayer to Him who is mightier than the
                  tempter, she was enabled to say, "Get thee behind me, Satan!"
               But the sight of the swift-moving steamers, daily leaving their moorings, and
                  gliding down the river, some of them bound to that far away "North,"
                  to which the eyes of the slave so often turn with eager longing, suggested other
                  thoughts. "Would it be a sin to escape? to leave that hateful place, and that
                  hated life, and make one struggle for freedom?" Something within urged her to make
                  the trial; and with a palpitating heart, she one day slipped unperceived on board
                  a large steamer, just ready to sail, as she learned by the conversation of the
                  bystanders, for New York, and concealed herself among the lading.
               Almost suffocated, and in an agony of fear lest her absence should be discovered,
                  and search made for her before the vessel left the port, she lay concealed among
                  barrels and boxes; but oh! how her heart bounded with joy, as she knew by the
                  motion of the vessel, that she had loosed from her moorings, and that the waves
                  now rolled between her and the house of her bondage, and every moment the distance
                  was increased.
               No thought had as yet occurred to her how she should sleep, or how she should
                  fare. Escape, and freedom, were the two ideas that
                  filled her mind, to the exclusion for the time of every other. Fearing, however,
                  that her cough, which was now very troublesome, would reveal her hiding-place, she
                  sought the opportunity when the cabin was deserted for dinner, to steal towards it
                  unperceived, and secrete herself under one of the elegant sofas, inwardly and
                  fervently praying that some friend might be raised up for her even there.
               When the passengers returned to the cabin, they were still continuing an animated
                  discussion, which had been commenced at the dinner table, on the
                  "fugitive-slave-bill," passed the winter before, in the Congress of this free and mighty republic. One old
                  lady, who seemed very blunt and decided in the expression of her opinions, was in
                  a high state of excitement and indignation at this "iniquitous law!"
                  as she termed it. "If the slaves are so perfectly contented and happy as you say,
                  madam," she said in reply to a remark of a southern lady, "why should they be so
                  anxious to escape? I suppose we cannot prevent the southerners from doing what
                  they please with their slaves; but what I do say is, it is a sin and a shame to
                  try and make us at the north aiders and abettors of slavery, by ordering us to
                  assist in sending the poor creatures back, when once they have escaped from
                  bondage. For my part, I'll assist them with money and with food, if
                  ever I have a chance; I'll conceal them if they come to me, and I'll help them on
                  their way to Canada, if I have to go to prison and to death for it! there."
               Little did the old lady dream how soon she would have an opportunity of putting
                  her benevolent designs into execution.
               At this moment the captain came down, and called the passengers to come up on deck
                  and see some fine sight on the water; and the old lady, of whom I have spoken, and
                  to whom I will give the name of Mrs. Ellis, stepped to her state-room to put on a
                  hood and shawl before venturing into the air. Nina noticed carefully from her
                  hiding-place the number of the old lady's room, and when all had left the cabin,
                  she sprang towards it and shut herself in. All had happened now, or we should say
                  a kind Providence had ordered all concerning her so far, so as to exceed her most
                  sanguine hopes; and while her heart was yet raised in thankfulness, the old lady,
                  who feared the dampness from the water, returned sooner than the rest, and entered
                  her room.
               In a moment Nina was at her feet, and a very few words enabled the kind old lady
                  to understand who she was, and why she was there.
               "You a slave, my poor child?" said she, smoothing back her black and
                  glossy ringlets, and gazing upon the beautiful face now flushed with excitement;
                  then, locking her door, she sat down again by Nina, and bade her tell her whole
                  history. From Nina's appearance, and from her account of herself, the old lady
                  soon came to the conclusion that she was far gone in consumption; bidding her take
                  the unoccupied berth in her state-room, and to have no fears of detection, as the
                  chamber-maid had not yet visited the room, and would not know when she did come
                  that Nina was not one of the regular passengers the old lady proceeded to the
                  kitchen, and easily prevailed on the
                  cook by that most persuasive of all arguments, a piece of money, to make her a
                  bowl of gruel, by which the exhausted girl was so much refreshed that she soon
                  fell into a gentle slumber.
               "What is the matter with your daughter, ma'am?" asked the chamber-maid, when she
                  came for the first time to put the room in order.
               "The poor child has the consumption, I fear," answered the old lady; "but she is
                  not my daughter, she is only under my care for the present."
               And so the matter was easily got along with, and Nina remained in the state-room,
                  and most of the time in her berth, during the passage, which was a remarkably
                  short one. When they arrived at New York, the old lady singled out one of the many
                  hackmen who rushed on board clamorous for passengers, and telling him that she
                  would pay him double fare if he would wait for her till the crowd dispersed, as
                  she had a sick girl under her charge, she easily persuaded him to accede to her
                  wishes.
               In two or three hours after the landing of the boat, good old Mrs. Ellis and Nina
                  found themselves at a certain hotel in New York, where the old lady had a friend,
                  warm and ardent in his anti-slavery feelings. To him she told Nina's story, and
                  with him agreed upon a message to be sent her by telegraph in case pursuit should
                  be made after the fugitive girl. That same afternoon they were on their way in the
                  cars towards the western village in which Mrs. Ellis resided, and the next morning
                  they reached the old lady's headquarters, which was a private boarding-house, she
                  being almost alone in the world, and having no other home. Here she introduced
                  Nina as a young girl who was under her care; but on account of her delicate
                  health, as well as for certain other good reasons best known to herself, she
                  thought it advisable that Nina should keep closely to her room.
               On the third or fourth day after their arrival came the following telegraphic
                  message to Mrs. Ellis:
               "DEAR MADAM,â€”The goods will be called for tomorrow." Which was the message agreed
                  upon in case search should be instituted for Nina. The old lady thought it best to
                  acquaint the poor girl with the state of things, which she did, assuring her,
                  however, that she would immediately take measures to send her on to Canada.
               "Oh, not to Canada! not to Canada! dear lady; let me get back to my sweet Miss
                  Hatty, and die at Oak-Lawn. It will not be long anywhereâ€”but, oh! to see Miss
                  Hatty once before I die!"
               "What, child! after escaping once from slavery, would you go back to it
                  voluntarily?"
               
               "Oh! it was not slavery, dear lady, with Mrs. Evelyn and Miss Hatty. I was like a
                  daughter and sister there; and they will take care of poor Nina, and love her, and
                  nurse her the little time she has to live."
               The old lady thought a few moments, and then said:
               "Well, I have hit upon a plan, if we can only conceal you till the time comes. I
                  have a young friend who feels as strongly for the slave as I do, though all of her
                  family do not sympathize with her in her feelings. She is to be married in about a
                  week, and is going South. I doubt not she will take a little trouble to get you
                  back to Oak-Lawn, if we can only contrive to hide you till then; for it seems the
                  pursuers have somehow got upon my track, and this house will be searched
                  to-morrow."
               "Oh, dear lady! and will your kindness to poor Nina bring trouble upon you?"
               "Nothing more than a fine I think, Nina, and I should be willing to lose all I
                  have, in such a cause."
               The old lady then put on her bonnet, and walking up the beautiful street of the
                  village of Wâ€”, she stopped at a pretty cottage-like building, and asked at the
                  door if "Miss Helen were at home?"
               She was shown into the parlor, and in a few minutes utes a bright and beautiful
                  girl entered the room, and threw her arms around the old lady's neck, welcoming
                  her most cordially back to the north.
               There was not much time to lose, and the old lady soon made her young friend
                  acquainted with Nina's history, and the circumstances of peril in which she was
                  now placed. The enthusiastic, and somewhat romantic girl entered into the case
                  with eager interest and excitement, saying:
               "I have always said, my dear Mrs. Ellis, that I would protect a fugitive, if I had
                  to be torn upon the rack for it; brother George feels as strongly as I do on the
                  subject, and so does Mr. Walters," (the gentleman she was to marry,) "but papa and
                  Aunt Eunice are forever talking about 'law and order;' they are real southerners
                  in feeling, and think all runaway slaves should immediately be sent back to their
                  masters, and every good and honest citizen should be glad to aid in so noble a
                  work. However, I think I can out-wit them, Mrs. Ellis; bring poor Nina here after
                  dark to-night; I will be ready to open the door for you, and will lead Nina up
                  stairs; we have a snug little dark garret to which the only entrance is by a
                  trap-door; Aunt Eunice has such a horror of rats and mice, that she never dares to
                  venture up there, and papa is so large, that he could n't squeeze through the trap-door if he should do his best;
                  George will help me with all his might, and the little boys need know nothing
                  about the matter. When I am ready to go south, I will introduce Nina as the maid
                  who is to accompany me. So bring her to-night Mrs. Ellis, at about eight
                  o'clock."
               Nina's master had returned to the city of New Orleans the morning after her
                  flight, and the first thing he heard, was of Nina's disappearance. Filled with
                  rage and disappointment, he immediately caused strict search to be made, posting
                  handbills about the city minutely describing her appearance, and offering high
                  rewards for any information of the missing girl. Before night he heard of her as
                  wandering on the Levee, just before the Bâ€” sailed, and eagerly watching the
                  vessel. He soon made up his mind that she had secreted herself on board that
                  vessel, and though he did not relinquish his search at home, he determined to send
                  by a boat leaving the next day, two experienced and keen-scented slave catchers,
                  with particular directions as to their proceedings, when they should arrive at New
                  York. These men arrived the day but one after the Bâ€”, and immediately went on
                  board that vessel, which was still in port, taking with them the description of
                  Nina, which her master had furnished them. On application tion to the captain, he
                  showed them his list of passengers, and there happened to be not one unmarried
                  young woman among them. There were gentlemen with their wives, single gentlemen,
                  plenty of children, and two old ladies.
               The men were about leaving the boat in despair, when one of them suggested that
                  they should examine the chambermaid; she was immediately called, and telling her
                  to refresh her memory as to the events of the voyage, and tell the whole truth and
                  she should not be a loser by it, they again, with her and the captain, went over
                  the list of the passengers.
               "Why bless me, Sir!" exclaimed the girl, "the young lady's name is n't down here,
                  that was with the old lady, in sixty-seven!"
               "What young lady, and what was she like?" eagerly asked the pursuers.
               "Oh, she was very beautiful, Sir, with black curling hair, and bright black eyes;
                  and in the afternoon she had a very bright color, but she was real sick, and
                  coughed awful, and kept her berth pretty much all the time."
               The men nodded at each other with a satisfied air, while the captain
                  exclaimed:
               "And how is it that I knew nothing of this extra passenger?"
               
               "Why, I supposed you did, of course, Sir. But now I remember she never left the
                  state-room from the time I first saw her there, and the old lady always went to
                  the kitchen, and had gruel made, and rice boiled for her, and paid the cook extra
                  for it; how the young woman got aboard, if she did n't come reg'lar, the Lord only
                  knows."
               "And what is that old lady's name, and where did she go to?" asked the men
                  eagerly.
               "Well, now I think of it, being as she was old, and did n't like a bustle, and had
                  a sick young lady with her, she got a hackman to wait till all the rest had gone,
                  and then they went off kind o' quiet like."
               The next thing was to go from hack to hack, questioning the drivers, and offering
                  a high reward for information, till at length the very man was found, who had
                  taken Mrs. Ellis and Nina from the boat to the hotel. The latter place was then
                  visited, and searched, but the birds had flown; it was very easy now, however, to
                  trace them; and but for the old lady's forethought, and the promptness of her
                  friend in New York, the poor slave girl would soon have been recaptured. But the
                  pursuers had telegraphed likewise, to one in the village of Wâ€” whose sentiments
                  and principles were well known, and the movements ments of old Mrs. Ellis, all
                  unsuspicious as she was of such scrutiny, were well watched.
               And now we return to the evening of the day in which the old lady called at the
                  cottage of Mr. Masten, and had an interview with his daughter Helen. At eight
                  o'clock, the door-bell rang, and Helen, who happened to be passing
                  through the hall at the moment, opened the door, and whispering to Nina to slip up
                  stairs, as the coast was clear, she welcomed Mrs. Ellis loudly and cordially, and
                  introduced her into the parlor, where old Mr. Masten and Aunt Eunice were sitting,
                  the one reading and the other knitting.
               Begging to be excused for a few moments, Helen left the room, and hurried up the
                  stairs, at the head of which she found the trembling Nina. Hastily lighting a
                  lantern which she had ready in her own room, she guided the young fugitive to a
                  closet, from which a ladder led to a small trap-door above. She ascended the
                  ladder, Nina closely following, and crowding their way through the trap-door,
                  which was narrow even for the slender figures of the two girls, they found
                  themselves in the small garret, in the centre of which only, could they stand
                  upright.
               Helen had been busy there, whenever she could slip up the ladder unperceived,
                  through the whole day, and she now had
                  a screen of old carpets and boxes, apparently thrown down without much care,
                  behind which she had contrived quite a comfortable bed for Nina. She had also
                  placed food there, and leaving with her a dark lantern and a box of matches, she
                  bade her extinguish the light, if at any time she heard steps ascending the
                  ladder, and telling her not to fear anything, but to lie down in perfect safety,
                  she left her for the night and returned to the parlor.
               The next morning the younger boys, who slept in the room from which the closet
                  containing the ladder opened, complained of being disturbed all night by noises in
                  the garret; and said it sounded just like a person coughing.
               "Garret! nonsense!" exclaimed Aunt Eunice, "if you heard any
                  coughing, it must have been me, for I've got a terrible cold; and the noise in the
                  garret must be them plaguy rats again. I believe I'll go up there this very day,
                  with a light, and see if I can find any rat holes."
               "Oh, no, Aunt Euny, let me go," said George, at whom Helen had
                  glanced eagerly; "just give me the big rat-trap, and a bit ef cheese, and I'll
                  engage to quiet them. I shall ask a bounty on rats though."
               "Well, you shall have anything you choose, if you 'll only rid the house of them,"
                  answered Aunt Eunice; "but that garret wants a real over-hauling; I know it is all
                  in confusion, for my rheumatis' has been so bad, that I have n't ventured up the
                  ladder this spring."
               "Well, do wait, aunty, till I am fairly off," said Helen; "you know I have only a
                  few days more, and I want all your time to help me. When I am once out of the way,
                  you can take clear comfort rummaging in the garret, and in all sorts of
                  out-of-the-way holes and corners. You will want occupation then, you know, to keep
                  you from being lonely."
               That same day, as old Mrs. Ellis sat at her work, feeling very comfortable, and
                  congratulating herself upon the safety of her protÃ©gÃ©, she was surprised by rather
                  a rough knocking at her door; on opening which she was at first startled, on
                  seeing two strange men accompanied by a third, who she soon found was an officer
                  called a deputy-marshal.
               "We have called upon you, madam, because we have pretty good evidence that you
                  have brought to the North and have secreted here a slave girl belonging to Mr.â€”,
                  of New Orleans," said one of the men.
               Mrs. Ellis was a very brave and determined old lady, and in a moment her calmness
                  and self-possession returned. Taking her seat, she said, quietly:
               
               "If that is all you want, gentlemen, you are at perfect liberty to search my
                  apartments, only please do not put my things in confusion, as I am very particular
                  about them."
               "Come, come, Madam," said the other man, "you cannot get off so. We know to a
                  certainty that you had the girl under your care on the Bâ€”, and that she left the
                  boat with you; and we are quite certain that you either have her here, or have
                  secreted her with friends in the village, or have sent her off to Canada. Now, if
                  you will be kind enough to tell us which of these you have done, you will save us,
                  and possibly yourself, a vast deal of trouble."
               To which the only answer from the old lady was, "Find out!"
               "Do you know, Madam, that you subject yourself to a fine of a thousand dollars for
                  this open violation of the law?"
               "Fortunately, then, Sir," said the old lady, rising, and in her excitement laying
                  aside her work, "I have got the money to pay it, and I shall think it well
                  expended if I have helped to free one poor slave. I only wish I had
                     thousands upon thousands to spend in the cause, and
                  that every thousand could aid one fugitive on his way to Canada. Fine me, Sir!
                  fine me! it will do the anti-slavery cause good to fine an old lady for helping a
                  poor girl away from a brutal oppressor. Perhaps you would like to put me in
                  prison, that would do more good; perhaps you'd like to stretch me on
                  the rack, if they have such things now-a-days, that would do more good
                     still. I'm ready for anything, Sir, but to tell where that poor
                  girl is, and racks and tortures won't draw that from me, there!" And the old lady
                  sat down, quite out of breath.
               Helen Masten had ascended the little ladder to the garret with some food for poor
                  Nina, when she was startled by a loud and furious ringing and knocking at the
                  front door. Setting down the food behind the carpet screen, she hastily descended
                  the ladder, closing and fastening the trap-door after her. As she reached the
                  hall, she heard her father's voice in loud and angry tones, exclaiming:
               "I? Sir, I? I harbor a fugitive slave? Why, Sir, I'm a
                  law-abiding citizen! I go for law and order, Sir! I'd send back every slave that
                  shows his head at the North, Sir! I've been a southern man myself, Sir! I, indeed!
                  but if you 've any suspicion of me, search, Sir! search! only I tell you it will
                  be labor lost, and your fugitive will be getting further away towards Canada, and
                  I should be as sorry to have that happen as you would, Sir!"
               "We, indeed!" exclaimed Aunt Eunice, in a state of high indignation; "we, indeed! as
                  if a rat could harbor in this house, and I not know it! Let 'em
                  search, if they like, but they'll jist turn everything topsy-turvyâ€”men always
                  doâ€”and it's all in such nice order for the wedding, too. It's a disgrace that
                  might last one through life to be even suspected of harboring a runaway
                  slave!"
               "We know how you feel, Mr. Masten," said the officer; "but some of your family are
                  suspected of not sharing your sentiments, and we know that only yesterday old Mrs.
                  Ellis, the lady who brought this fugitive to the North, called here to see your
                  daughter."
               "Well, then, if Helen is in the case, she must answer for herself. Here, Helen!
                  Helen!" he called up the stairs; but there was no answer, and Miss Helen could not
                  be found. George, a boy of sixteen, stood by, apparently curious as to the result;
                  but no one thought of questioning him. In spite of the indignation of the old
                  gentleman and Aunt Eunice, the search began at the cellars and proceeded
                  cautiously through the house. At length every nook and cranny had been searched,
                  except the closet from the younger boys' room.
               "See here!" exclaimed one of the men, "here's a ladder, who knows what is up
                  beyond that trap-door."
               "Rats and mice, if you want to know," answered the enraged Aunt Eunice.
               "I don't know about trusting myself up there," said the most forward of the
                  searchers, a very portly gentleman; "it looks rather ticklish for a man of my
                  weight."
               "Let him go, let him go, Aunt Euny," said George, loud enough for the man to hear;
                  "he'll get stuck fast in the trap door, and then, if I could only get
                  a bounty according to weight, would n't I make my fortune?"
               "Here, let me try," said the other, a thinner and lighter man; "I really do not
                  suppose there is any one up there, but it would n't do to leave without searching
                  every spot."
               "Let me just give you one word of warning, Sir," said George; "that garret is not
                  much used to go into, we only push things up through the trap-door,
                  and it is only boarded over for a little way; the rest is only lath and plaster,
                  and if you step far you'll find yourself breaking through and coming down into the
                  lower hall, and then I guess you'll have to wait awhile, before you use your legs
                  to travel after another fugitive."
               "Well, give me a light then," said the man, who began to think they had come on a
                  fool's errand, after all; "give me a
                  light, I say, I can at least get my head through that trap-door."
               A very feeble light was brought by George, with which the last speaker proceeded
                  up the ladder, and began his scrutiny. But the "little candle" did not "throw its
                  beams" very far, and he saw only a pile of old carpets and boxes, apparently
                  heaped so closely against the wall, that nothing larger than one of Aunt Eunice's
                  rats could be concealed behind it.
               "Oh, pshaw! there's nothing here!" he exclaimed, "and all this while the girl is
                  getting further and further on her way to Canada, and we shall lose our reward
                  after all. My advice is," he added, coming down the ladder, "that we telegraph
                  immediately to Buffalo and Niagara to have her stopped, and hasten on as rapidly
                  as possible."
               And apologizing to the still much excited Aunt Eunice, and the equally angry old
                  gentleman, for the unnecessary trouble they had given them, the three men left the
                  house, and took the first cars for the west.
               And there were three persons in old Mr. Masten's house, who drew their breath more
                  freely, when the door closed after the slave-catchers, than they had done in an
                  hour.
               The morning of Helen Masten's wedding, Aunt Eunice went out to a store for
                  something, and when she returned, she found Helen talking with a young girl in the
                  kitchen.
               "See, Aunt Eunice," said Helen, "I have engaged a girl after all to go south with
                  me; she comes very highly recommended from the last lady she was with, and I think
                  I shall run no risk in trying her."
               "She looks mighty delicate though," said Aunt Eunice.
               "She says she is not strong, but thinks a journey to the south would do her good,
                  and you know it is not much I shall want of her while we are travelling."
               Helen had put back Nina's curls, and dressed her in a plain but decent suit,
                  befitting the situation of lady's maid, before she brought her down stairs, and
                  Aunt Eunice no more suspected her of being a fugitive slave than she did of being
                  the Queen of England.
               Our story is stretching out to double the length we intended, and we must hasten
                  over Helen's marriage and the events of the journey, which were prosperous to all
                  concerned, and bring our poor Nina to her final destination, Oak-Lawn, her
                  childhood's home.
               Two years had now passed since Mr. Evelyn's death, and the removal of a part of
                  his slaves to the estate of his son.
                  Mrs. Evelyn had heard a few weeks before of the death of John Evelyn in a duel
                  with one of his gambling associates, by which, according to her father's will,
                  unless John Evelyn had married, the slaves again returned to Oak-Lawn, and became
                  the property of Harriet, upon her coming of age. With rejoicing and thanksgiving,
                  the poor creatures had returned, and now Harriet had learned for the first time
                  from Aunt Hannah, of her cruel separation from Nina, and of the poor child's being
                  carried off to New Orleans.
               It was while thinking of Nina and her sad fate, for she had never ceased to
                  remember her with the warmest affection, that Hatty Evelyn, now a beautiful girl
                  of sixteen, was pacing the piazza at Oak-Lawn on a beautiful afternoon, as spring
                  was just verging into summer, when, hearing the sound of carriage wheels, she
                  raised her eyes, and saw a party, all of whom she supposed were strangers,
                  approaching the house. A lady and gentleman alighted from the carriage, the former
                  of whom approaching Harriet, who stood waiting to receive her, asked if it was
                  Miss Evelyn whom she addressed.
               On receiving a reply in the affirmative, she said:
               "I suppose I need hardly mention my own name; I am an entire stranger to you, but
                  I think it will be enough for you to know, that we bring Nina
                  back."
               "Nina!" screamed Hatty, stretching her arms towards the carriage, and now
                  recognizing the companion and friend of her childhood, who was too weak and too
                  much agitated to leave her seat. "Nina, have you come back, indeed?" again
                  exclaimed Hatty, aiding Mr. Walters to lift the poor girl from the carriage. But
                  poor Nina could not reply; the excitement of once more seeing her much-loved early
                  home, and her dear young mistress, had completely overcome her, and she fell on
                  the steps of the piazza, and fainted away.
               No description can give any idea of the astonishment that spread through the
                  mansion at Oak-Lawn, when it was told that Nina had returned. Aunt Hannah fell on
                  her knees, and raised her hands and her voice, in fervent thanksgiving; but the
                  joy of all was subdued by the assurance that poor Nina had only returned to die.
                  And the surprise and joy of the poor child who had endured such hardships, such
                  intense excitement and terrible suspense, were no less, at opening her eyes and
                  finding not only Mrs. Evelyn and Miss Hatty, but her own old mother, bending over
                  her.
               Safe! safe! at last, poor fugitive!
               
               But Helen Walters, who had braved so much to bring Nina back to them, and who
                  sympathized so deeply in their joy, at this unexpected restoration, was by no
                  means forgotten by those thankful and happy ones. Her determination to leave
                  immediately was overruled by her kind and hospitable hostess, who insisted upon a
                  visit of several days; and Helen has often said since, that no part of her sojourn
                  at the South, was more delightful to her than the few days she passed with the
                  Evelyn's, at Oak-Lawn.
               Contrary to the expectation of all, Nina lingered through the summer, and then
                  sank slowly, tranquil and resigned, towards the grave; and just when the leaves
                  were falling, she gently breathed her last, with her old mother's arms around her,
                  and her head upon Miss Hatty's breast.
               Safe! safe! at last, poor Nina! in that harbor from which the malice of wicked men
                  can never tear thee; safe in the arms of Him who shelters there, the humblest of
                  his faithful ones.
               Nina left messages of gratitude, and prayers for many blessings to fall upon the
                  heads of her two kind friends in Wâ€”, old Mrs. Ellis and Helen Walters, which were
                  faithfully transmitted to them by Hatty Evelyn.
               As for the kind old lady, she paid down cheerfully her fine; but we never heard
                  that she suffered either imprisonment, or "racks and tortures." Perhaps those in
                  authority were of her opinion, that they would by such a course only be
                  strengthening the great and noble cause of Anti-Slavery.
            
            
               
               What Makes the Difference?
               IT was nearly midnight, and it was the night before Christmas. In a large,
                  poorly-furnished back room, in the second story of a house, filled with many
                  tenants, sat a pale but handsome lady (for lady she was, though all
                  round her told of poverty), busily engaged in writing. She was carefully copying a
                  law paper by the light of one tallow candle; but while she diligently copied every
                  word from one paper to the other without mistake or blot, she knew not what she
                  wrote, for her thoughts were busy with other things and other scenes.
               Sometimes she would stop writing for a moment, and press her hands upon her
                  forehead and eyes, while the tears oozed slowly through the white and delicate
                  fingers, from which all but the wedding-ring had disappeared. Then wiping away the
                  tears, she would again apply herself to her task. She did not know that all this
                  time a pair of bright little eyes from the low trundle-bed were fixed upon her
                  face, or that the gentle little one, who was lying awake there, was wondering what
                  could be the cause of mamma's grief.
               As the old town clock, which was near, slowly tolled the hour of twelve, the lady
                  rose and left the room. And little Alice crept from the bed and followed her. She
                  walked the whole length of the large, uncarpeted, unfurnished and desolate-looking
                  hall, till she reached the front window, which she threw open, and leaning out she
                  looked long and earnestly up and down the street, for the bright moon shining upon
                  the snow made it almost as light as day. Sometimes a footstep would be heard
                  approaching the house, and the lady would draw in her head; but when it passed,
                  she would again lean out and look up and down the street. At length she closed the
                  window, and heaving a deep sigh she turned to go back to her room, when for the
                  first time she became aware of her little daughter's presence.
               Starting, she exclaimed, "Why, Alice, darling, what are you doing here?"
               "I saw you leave the room, mamma, and I came to see where you were going."
               "But you should not do so, love; you will take a dreadful cold;" and taking the
                  child up in her arms, and laying her own thin cheek to hers, she carried her back and laid her in her little bed
                  by the side of her little sleeping brother, and resuming her seat at the table,
                  she again took up her pen.
               "Mamma, are you not coming to bed? It is very late; I heard the clock strike
                  twelve."
               "I cannot come yet, darling; I must finish this writing before morning."
               "But you get up so very early, mamma, you will have no sleep at all. Mamma, where
                  is father?"
               "I don't know, dear; you must not talk to me any more, or I cannot write."
               When the paper was finished, the little bright eyes were still open, and so the
                  mother came and laid herself down beside her little daughter on the low bed, and
                  laid her cheek to hers.
               "Mamma, tell me this; is it true, or have I only dreamed it, that we
                  once lived in a beautiful house, and had pretty things, and you had people to work
                  for you, and did not have to work so hard as you do now?"
               "Yes, darling, that was so."
               "Is not this Christmas Eve, mamma?"
               "Christmas day has begun sweet, and these little eyes should be closed in
                  sleep."
               "Well, just tell me this, mamma; did not we use to hang up our stockings on
                  Christmas Eve, and did not you and papa put beautiful presents in them?"
               "Yes, dear."
               "Dear mamma, it is very different now. What makes the
                  difference?"
               The tears of the mother falling on her little one's cheek were the only answer to
                  this question. It was one which the mother could not answer to her child.
               Ah! what makes the difference in so many homes, once bright and cheerful?
               What makes the difference in so many faces, once blooming with health and
                  happiness.
               What makes the difference in so many hearts, once filled with peace and joy?
               Alice was too young to suspect the truth, but she saw that her question had caused
                  her mother's tears to flow afresh, and she said no more.
               When Alice awoke in the morning, though it was scarcely light, her mother was
                  already up and busy about the room. Alice raised her head and looked into the
                  large bed, and there she saw her father. He was sleeping heavily, and so he
                  continued to sleep for a long time.
               Alice arose, and dressed herself and her little brother, as she was accustomed to
                  do, and then their mother gave them their
                  simple breakfast; and having left all things in order, and something ready for her
                  husband in case he should wake and want it, she put on her hat and shawl, and
                  taking the bundle of papers in her hand, she went out.
               After she had been gone about half an hour, Alice heard a rustling of the
                  bed-clothes, and looking up she perceived that her father was awake.
               "Alice, where is your mother?"
               "She has gone to take the papers home, papa."
               "What papers?"
               "Oh! I don't know, the papers she writes every night after we are all in bed."
               "Does she write every night, Alice?"
               "Yes, papa, whenever she can get any writing to do. She copies from one paper to
                  another, and last night I watched her a great while as she wrote. Oh! she wrote
                  long after twelve o'clock. Papa, what makes mamma press her hands over her eyes,
                  and what makes the tears trickle down through her fingers?"
               "Do they so, Alice?"
               "Yes, papa; and last night when the clock struck twelve, she went to the front
                  window of the long hall, and she looked up and down the street till we both got so
                  very cold. Who was she looking for, papa?"
               
               
                  
                     Here, Agnes, is a Christmas Present for you." Page 313
                  
               
               No answer.
               "And when I asked her if we once lived in a beautiful home, and if we hung up our
                  stockings on Christmas Eve, and had pretty presents, she said we did. But when I
                  asked her 'what made the difference?' she did not answer me, but her
                  tears made my cheek all wet. Papa, will you tell me what makes the
                  difference?"
               It was very strange, Alice thought, that that question should make both her
                  parents cryâ€”for her father was certainly sobbing now, with his face hid in the
                  pillow; sobbing as if his heart would break.
               The door opened and her mother came in.
               "See here, Aliceâ€”see here, Willie," she said, in her subdued, gentle voice, "I
                  have brought you each a nice pair of warm mittens for a Christmas present."
               "Oh, thank you, dear mamma; now we can play out doors without freezing our
                  fingers!"
               The father had now risen, and declining his wife's offer of breakfast, but in a
                  kind and gentle tone, he took his hat and left the house. In a few minutes he
                  returned, and saying to his wife, "Here, Agnes, is a Christmas present for you,"
                  he handed her a paper.
               What was it that sent such a glow over the mother, as she first raised her eyes in
                  thankfulness to Heaven, and then threw her arms around her husband's neck?
               Oh, there was a magic in that paper which all cannot understand.
               It was a Temperance Pledge.
               
               "Yes, Agnes, I have tried and tried, but it has been in my own strength. Now I
                  hope in the strength of God, and with your prayers and counsel to aid me, that I
                  may yet regain the place I have lost in the esteem and confidence of my
                  fellow-men. Ah, when little Alice asked me 'what made the difference?' I saw it
                  all. The gratification of my own selfish appetite has brought us all, step by
                  step, through sorrow and privation, to this wretched place where you should never
                  have been, dearest. No more copying law-papers for you, Agnes. No more coarse fare
                  and wretched clothing for the children. I know what I can do if I am true to
                  myself, and I know now 'what makes the difference."'
               He was true to his word and to his pledge. Ere long the family found themselves
                  again in a comfortable home, and when the children asked, with wonder, "What makes
                  the difference?" the father answered, "The Temperance Pledge, my
                  children."
            
            
               The Old Scotch Couple.
               IT was for many years my duty and privilege to make one of a number of individuals
                  who visited monthly through our little village, leaving at each house one of those
                  little messages of truth, a tract. Amid the many discouragements and
                  trials attending this humble labor, there were still some things cheering and
                  encouraging to the heart. While to some our visits were matters of perfect
                  indifference, and to others an unwelcome interruption, there were some few places
                  where our entrance was hailed with delight. The dim eye brightened, and the feeble
                  arm was stretched out to welcome us, and we went forth from those houses
                  encouraged and strengthened for the work before us.
               That part of the village which formed my "district" was a street of straggling
                  houses, each with its little court-yard and flower-garden; these were not the
                  dwellings of the very poor, but of those just above that class, those who were too
                  proud to subsist on charity, and just
                  managed to live by the labor of their own hands. As I walked through this little
                  by-street last summer, and noticed the pretty flowers, and the climbing vines by
                  each cottage door, I thought to myself, how contagious and how elevating is the
                  love of the cultivation of flowers. I remember when I was a child being sent of an
                  errand through this very street; and as I picked my way along through the mud, I
                  saw no beautiful flowers and pretty court-yards, with their fresh green grass; no
                  vigorous shrubbery or luxuriant climbers. What had brought about the change?
               Why, a few years ago one of the cottages was purchased by a stranger; he was a
                  mason by trade, a poor man, no better off than his neighbors; but he did not think
                  that for that reason he need forever live in the midst of mud and filth, and have
                  no bright, beautiful things about him. No; John Wilkes believed in making the most
                  of the good things which even he in his poverty might enjoy. And soon the old
                  cottage appeared in a new white dress, and looked so pretty with its neat calico
                  window curtains, that the people about thought that the Wilkes' must be getting
                     proud, and beginning to feel better than their neighbors. And in
                  the spring, when they saw the grass springing up, and the pretty borders, in John
                  Wilkes' garden, and the bright crocuses and daises showing their heads, they were
                     sure he was proud, and felt better than his neighbors. Not a bit
                  of it; as they found out when walking by his garden, (they were not obliged to
                  pick their way in front of John Wilkes' cottage, for he had laid boards along and
                  made a dry clean walk,) they stopped to chat with Mary Wilkes, over the fence.
               "Well, Mrs. Wilkes, what beautiful posies you have got, to be sure: for my part, I
                  can't see how you've growed 'em so quick. Jest look at my mud-hole; I
                     know I could n't make such posies grow there, if I tried all my
                  life."
               "O yes, indeed, you could, Mrs. Moss, if you tried only one season. Why, don't you
                  remember what kind of a place this was last spring, when we took it?"
               "Yes, yes, I do, and how you've done it all; and you've five children, and you
                  take in tailorin'. Well, things will always grow for some folks."
               "And things will always grow for other folks, Mrs. Moss. Now, just
                  ask your man to put an hour's work on your yard every morning, before it is time
                  to go to his work, as my man does; and then you rise yourself an hour earlier, and
                  spend that hour in your garden, and I will give you all the flower seeds you will plant, and see what a different
                  place yours will be next year."
               "I'll do it, Mrs. Wilkes." And as it was with Mrs. Moss, so it was with all, or
                  nearly all her neighbors. And as their places improved year by year, just so they
                  grew in self-respect, and real elevation of character; as they themselves
                  expressed it, "they felt more like folks." And as the external
                  appearance of their little places improved, so did the interior of their cottages
                  improve in neatness and order; and their children look nicer, and are taught to be
                  have as it becomes the children to behave who live in white-washed
                     cottages, with flowers before the door. Ah, Clay street,
                  (it was not named after Henry Clay, dear reader, but took its name from its own
                  clay soil,) Clay street is a different place from what it was when I was a
                  child.
               But I did not sit down to tell you about Mary Wilkes or Mrs. Moss, though they are
                  both very good friends of mine, but to conduct you, if you will go with me, dear
                  reader, to a small and humble dwelling, standing beyond and apart from the rest,
                  on the side of a hill, at whose foot runs a clear little stream. We will cross
                  this foot-bridge, enter the gate and pass through this row of shrubbery up to the
                  door of the cottage. Part of this cottage was occupied by an old Scotch couple,
                  and I have never entered their door that the words of the sweet old Scotch song,
                  "John Anderson, my Jo John," did not come to my mind. They were, indeed, going
                  hand in hand down the hill of life, after wandering over its thorny and rugged
                  paths for many weary years. But though the way had been rough, and the Lord had
                  led them by "a way which they knew not," yet these dear old people, so near the
                  grave, loved to sing of his loving-kindness and tender mercy.
               But let us open the door, and enter the cottage. How neat and cheerful it looks;
                  the clean and nicely sanded floor, the cheerful blaze, the little strip of
                  rag-carpet by the side of the fire, where the old people always sit, the little
                  stand, with the large old family Bible upon it, and lastly, but most important of
                  all, the dear old people themselves, always in their places, side by side; old
                  Janet, with her knitting, and her husband reading to her from the Bible, or some
                  other good book. They had always belonged to the same humble rank of life in which
                  I found them, and yet the old gentleman's cheerful, hospitable,
                     courtly welcome, as he rises and extends both hands to greet us,
                  would grace a much nobler dwelling.
               There was none of that feeling of pride about these people which I so
                  often met with in their neighbors, and
                  which led them to think that I considered it a great condescension to visit them,
                  and a matter of charity to leave them the tract. There was no resenting of any
                  offers of aid, in the way of little comforts or delicacies in time of sickness,
                  with the words I so often heard, "You may send it round if you choose, but I guess
                  we could afford to get it ourselves." No, these dear old people were cordial,
                  kind, and frank; ready to receive a favor in the spirit in which it was offered,
                  and more ready to offer kindness, when in their power to do so, than to receive
                  it.
               Many an hour of pleasant intercourse have I enjoyed with these charming old
                  people, and I always felt that "it was good to be there." Thanks for mercies past
                  were ever on their lips, and cheerful hope for the future beamed from their
                  wrinkled faces. And though their sailor son was lost beneath the wave, and their
                  only daughter, their darling Jessie, had died in the first year of her marriage,
                  and, with her "baby on her breast," had been laid in the cold ground; aye, and
                  though their oldest son, their hope and pride, and he whom they fondly trusted
                  would be the stay and support of their old age, and close their eyes in death, had
                  disappointed their fond hopes, and though living, was worse than dead to them,
                  these aged servants of God would still say, from their hearts, "The Lord is just
                  and right," "He doeth all things well."
               The love of these dear old people for each other was truly beautiful to see; one
                  of them was never seen without the other; they sat together in the house, and
                  though they did not often walk together by the way, yet they very rarely failed to
                  go to the house of God in company; the old man supporting his tottering footsteps
                  with his cane, and his old wife leaning on his arm. I often looked at them at such
                  times with a feeling of sadness, thinking of the utter desolation of the solitary
                  mourner, when "one should be taken and the other left."
               And my fears were soon realized. I was sitting reading one summer Sunday
                  afternoon, the services of the day being over, when a little girl rang at the
                  door, and wanted to know if the lady would please come down and see old Mrs.
                  Angus, for they thought she was dying. Much shocked, I hastily prepared to
                  accompany the little messenger, questioning her on the way as to the cause of the
                  old lady's illness. All I could learn was, that she had been taken ill in the
                  night, had been growing worse all day, and the doctor, who had just been there,
                  said that she could not live more than an hour or two.
               As I approached the house, I found, as I had expected pected, that it was filled with people. Among those
                  of a higher rank, the room of the sick and dying is a sacred place. A few chosen
                  friends are admitted, one by one, and that as a very great favor. But among those
                  in the humbler ranks of society, in villages like ours, it is a matter of course,
                  that where there is extreme illness, and especially when the hour of death draws
                  near, all the friends and neighbors, and often those who belong to
                     neither of these classes, throng to the house, and crowd the room
                  of the sufferer, sometimes almost to suffocation. Particularly is this the case on
                  Sunday, when these people have nothing else to do.
               Seeing the sitting-room quite full, and perceiving that the bed-room where the old
                  lady was lying was still more so, I drew back hesitating about entering; but one
                  of the women seeing me, came out and said, "Oh, do go in ma'am, she has been
                  wishing so that you would come." As I went in, I said something about the
                  suffocating atmosphere of the room, and asked whether it would not be better if
                  those of the friends who would be of no use should retire; but no one seemed
                  inclined to move.
               The poor old man sat by the bed-side, his hand clasped in that of his dying wife,
                  and his head leaning upon it. I missed his hospitable welcome, for he did not
                  raise his head on my approach. Grief had mastered every other feeling. But the old
                  lady turned towards me, and such a smile of heavenly peace beamed from her lovely
                  countenance as I had never before seen, and never since but once. She
                  pressed my hand, but said nothing at first. Some of her neighbors and friends sat
                  around the bed, and with a freedom repulsive to more refined natures, remarked
                  upon the approaching end of her who was dying. "Another saint almost got home!"
                  sighed one. "A mother in Israel is falling!" groaned another. The old lady echoed
                  the words, "almost home," and then turning towards the old man she said, in a low
                  and feeble voice, "Canna ye yet say, the will o' the Lord be done, Andrew?" "I'm
                     tryin' to, Janet; I'm tryin' to, dear old wife; but
                  what sall I do wi'out ye?"
               "Put your trust in the Lord, Andrew, an He will sustain ye."
               After lying silent for a short time she suddenly said, "Raise me up, friends,
                  raise me up, and let me look upon the setting sun and the green earth for the last
                  time." The burying-ground on the hill side was in sight of her window. We raised
                  her up, and long and earnestly she gazed, and then she said,â€”
               "Raise your head, Andrew; raise your head, old husband; see how the sun streams
                  across the very spot where this poor
                  body will lie. You can look upon it from this very window."
               "I shall na' look upon it long, Janet."
               "No, Andrew, it will na' be long before we lie side by side; it will na' be long
                  before we shall meet in our Father's home. Dry your tears, then, Andrew, and fix
                  the eye of faith upon that heavenly home, where I shall really be;
                  and, friends, I charge you all to meet me there."
               As I was talking in a low voice with old Janet, and repeating in her ear some
                  precious promises calculated to sustain the dying saint, one of her Methodist
                  friends suddenly struck up a hymn, in which several voices immediately joined.
                  Their voices blended sweetly; and altogether, under the circumstances, the
                  impression was affecting and solemn, as they all joined in the chorus, "Going home
                  to glory!" In the midst of the singing, the old lady fell into what appeared to be
                  a gentle sleep, and feeling that I could be of no further use, I kissed her
                  forehead and slipped quietly from the house. At the door I was stopped by the
                  woman of the house, who had her apron at her eyes. "Oh dear, ma'am," said she, "to
                  think that I shall never again hear their dear old voices, as they sang their
                  morning and evening hymn, when they prayed and read the Bible together."
               The next morning I heard that old Janet had never wakened from the apparent
                  slumber into which she had fallen while I was there. Her spirit had most probably
                  "gone home to glory," even while those about her were singing the words.
               I did not go to the house of old Andrew again till I went to the funeral. Being
                  early, I was standing gazing upon the coffined form of my old friend, when I heard
                  a step, and looking round, I found the old man standing beside me. He seemed
                  unconscious of my presence, but stood with his eyes riveted on the face of his
                  dead wife. Soon the big drops began to roll down his cheeks and fall on the sanded
                  floor; then he leaned over her, and parting her gray hair on her forehead, and
                  smoothing it with his hand, he said, over and over again, in a tone of
                  inexpressible tenderness, "Dear Janet; sweet auld wife; dear, dear Janet!"
               I saw the old man again, his white locks flowing about in the wind, leaning on the
                  arm of a middle-aged man, whom I had never before seen. It was the prodigal
                     son returned to his father's house, repentant and reformed, only to help
                  lay the ashes of his mother in the dust. He had returned a reformed man, and with the means to make his parents
                  comfortable: to settle down with them, and to atone to them, as far as he could do
                  so, for the years of grief he had caused them.
            
            
               The Burning of York Minster.
               "MOTHER, are you not going to give us a story to-night?" asked the children of
                  Mrs. Waring, as they gathered about her chair, one winter's evening.
               "Why, as you have learned all your lessons so well, I suppose I must try to think
                  of one," their mother answered.
               "I do wish you would tell us fairy stories, dear mother, such as Mrs.
                  Marsh tells her children," said little Emma.
               "My daughter, I never tell you anything that I have not at least good reason to
                  believe is true. Never shall you have it to say, that your mother told you
                  anything which she did not suppose to be entirely true. I was thinking, to-day,
                  about the magnificent building in the City of York, in England, called York
                  Minster; and how it was set on fire about twenty years ago, by a man supposed to
                  be crazy. Much of what I am going to tell you has been published lished somewhere or other, as was also the trial of
                  Jonathan Martyn, who set fire to York Minster; but, as my old nurse lived in the
                  city of York at the time, and saw the fire, and was present at the trial, I may
                  have some interesting things to tell which have never been published. Nurse Barker
                  is a good, pious woman, and I can rely upon whatever she tells me as being
                  true.
               "York Minster is said to be the largest and most magnificent Gothic structure in
                  the world. You will, perhaps, form some idea of its size when I tell you that it
                  measures a mile around, and you might walk for days and days in it, and not see
                  half the splendid things. I cannot undertake to describe them to you, because I
                  never saw them myself; but there are the vast windows, all of brilliantly-colored
                  glass, and the magnificent organ, and the bishop's high gold chair, and gold swan
                  in front of it; and when they have service, there are twelve men and twelve boys
                  who stand in front of the organ, dressed in white robes, and sing. Then there is
                  one window celebrated far and wide, and called the 'five sisters.' The pattern of
                  it was worked in the fifteenth century, by five sisters, and, if I understand it
                  right, was afterwards copied in painting on glass. I believe the art of painting
                  on glass, as exquisitely as it was done at that day, is entirely lost to the
                  world. This window is painted in five stripes, and represents, I think, our
                  Saviour and his apostles, and somewhere, in different parts of the window, you may
                  read whole chapters from the Bible. It is protected on the outside by a fine
                  net-work of silver wire, so that, if a stone should be thrown against it, it would
                  remain uninjured. Each of these sisters had a thousand pounds a-year as long as
                  she lived, for her labor upon that window; which is still to be seen, and admired
                  by the traveller, while the fingers which first traced the beautiful design have,
                  for four hundred years, been quiet in death.
               "At that time, York Minster was called by another name, and was in possession of
                  the Roman Catholics; but at the time of the Reformation it was taken from them by
                  the Protestants. At one time, the splendid building was used for a stable, and the
                  horses of the soldiers were turned loose in it, to roam amid the splendid works of
                  art, upon which such a vast amount of labor and means had been expended. It was
                  soon, however, restored to its former splendor, as a place of worship of the
                  Church of England.
               "One Sunday evening, just twenty years ago, the people, on foot and in carriages,
                  thronged the way to the Great York Minster to attend evening prayers. Among them was a plain and
                  common-looking man, who went in with the rest, but came not out with them, and
                  when all had left the Minster, and the great doors were closed, Jonathan Martyn
                  crept from behind a pillar, where he had been concealed. He waited till the
                  Minster clock struck nine, and the Minster bell, which rings by machinery
                  connected with the clock, rang for nine, and then he went to work.
               "He piled up all the benches in front of the splendid organ, and he took the
                  bishop's gold swan, and put it under the organ; then he took the robes of the
                  singing men and boys, and all their music-books, to make his bonfire; and in a
                  little time, the cry went through the great city, that 'York Minster was on fire!'
                  Then the crowds began to gather from all parts of the city, and large bodies of
                  troops were called out to protect the streets leading to the Minster, and keep off
                  all but those who went to arrest the progress of the flames. The fire raged, and
                  much of the splendid building was burned, and many of the 
                     valuble
                     valuable
                   things in it were injured or destroyed. The flames rose up through the
                  roof, and melted the lead, and while some men were up there endeavoring to tear
                  off the lead, three of them slipped and fell, and the melted lead ran on them, and
                  killed them, and many other lives were lost. Nurse Barker was sick in bed, when a
                  friend came in and said:
               "'Neighbor, do you know the Minster's on fire?'
               "'Nonsense,' said she, 'I'm sickâ€”don't tell me such a tale as that; the Minster
                  could n't burn.'
               "'Woman, I tell you York Minster's on fire!' said her friend; and Nurse Barker
                  sprang from her bed, and went with the rest of the gazing town to see all that
                  could be seen of the sight.
               "After much time and exertion, the flames were extinguished, but no trace could be
                  found of the incendiary. A reward of three hundred pounds was offered to the
                  person who should take him alive.
               "During the progress of the fire, the man at the head of the police, whom I will
                  call Gilbert, was walking through one part of the Minster, and by the light of the
                  flames he saw sticking out from behind a pillar a hammer and a pincers, and a
                  tinder-box. He took them up and examined them, and on the handle of the hammer and
                  pincers he saw the name of 'Carr, shoemaker.' Gilbert was a very cunning man, so
                  he put the articles he had found into his pocket, without saying a word on the
                  subject to any one, and on Monday morning he stepped over to Carr's shop. Finding
                  no one in but a journeyman, Gilbert said, 'Where is Mr. Carr? I want him to make me a pair of shoes.' The young
                  man said he had stepped out for a moment, but would be in presently. So Gilbert
                  sat down on the bench and began to talk with the journeyman. After awhile he took
                  up a pair of pincers, which were lying on the bench beside him, and began to
                  examine them. Then he said, 'It seems strange to me that you do not have your
                  pincers marked. I should think you would lose them.'
               "The boy answered, 'Master has all his tools marked with his name, except this
                  pair of pincers.
               "When Carr came in, Gilbert led the conversation to the same subject, and at
                  length asked him where his pincers were that were marked with his name.
               "'Why,' said Carr, 'I lent them to Jonathan Martyn yesterday afternoon, and my
                  hammer, too, and I have never laid eyes on them since.'
               "'At what time did you lend them to him?' asked Gilbert.
               "'At about five o'clock,' answered Carr.
               "'And pray what should he want of your tools on Sunday afternoon?"
               "'That I can't pretend to say; all I know is, he asked me to lend them to him,
                  which I did.'
               "'Has he been home since?'
               "'Yes he came in late last evening, and went out again at five o'clock this
                  morning, and that is the last I have seen or heard of him.'
               "Gilbert had now got all he wanted out of Carr, so he started off and immediately
                  raised the 'hue and cry' after Jonathan Martyn. Gilbert took one of the great
                  roads, and after a time he came upon the track of Jonathan, and heard where he had
                  taken breakfast. At an inn further on, he found a piece of the gold lace which was
                  wrapped about the bishop's Bible, and which Jonathan had either left in his haste,
                  or bartered for his dinner. Soon Gilbert came to a town. It so happened, that in
                  the very first lodging-house he entered there sat Jonathan Martyn!
               "'Ha!' said Jonathan, rising up, 'I know what you are after, Gilbert; and now
                  you've found me; but tell me, is it down? is the Minster down? if so, I will go
                  back with you willingly.'
               "Gilbert told him it was not burned down, though very much injured.
               "'Oh!' said Jonathan, in a tone of deep sadness, 'there were four things I wanted
                  to do. I wanted to fire York Minster, Lincoln Minster, Beverley Minster, and
                  Westminster Abbey, and see them all burned to the ground, and then I would have
                  gone gladly to the rope.'
               "'But why would you destroy these splendid places of worship?' said Gilbert.
               
               "'Places of worship!' exclaimed Jonathan, 'they are places of corruption! with
                  their show and glitter, and pomp, and singing men, and singing boys; they are
                  places where men and women go to look at the gaudy things, and hear the grand
                  music, and to show their fine clothes. They are not places for the
                  worship of Godâ€”they are places of corruption!"'
               "But, mother," interrupted Robert, "do you think Jonathan was right in that?"
               "Jonathan was a member of the Church of England himself, but it seems he thought,
                  whether crazy or not, that the worship, or rather the places of worship, ought to
                  be more simple.
               "Gilbert put the handcuffs on to Jonathan, and took him back to York; and when the
                  day of the trial came, crowds flocked to the Great York Castle, where it was held.
                  The doorkeepers tried to keep out the mass of the people, but many a one slipped
                  in by giving them a small bribe. On the trial, if any of those who were in the
                  Minster at the time it was burning were called to give their testimony, and stated
                  anything that was not exactly true, Jonathan would interrupt them and say, 'No,
                  no, that was n't the way at allâ€”let me tell! I'll tell just how I did it. I went
                  to the bell-room, and cut down all the bell-ropes, and fastened them together, and
                  hung them outside of one of the windows; then I cut out a pane of glass to make my
                  escape by, and piled up some benches so as to climb out; then, after the Minster
                  bell rang nine, I began to gather my bonfire. I took all the benches, and the
                  robes of the singing men and boys, and I took their singing-books to light my fire
                  with. I did not burn a single good book,â€”not a Bible or prayer-book, but I burned
                  all their singing-books, and I took the great gold swan, my lord, and put it where
                  it would melt first, and when the pile got all well blazing, I let myself down
                  from the window, and went off.'
               "In the presence of the lord judge, with his great curled wig down to his waist,
                  and all the other judges in their wigs, and rows of learned lawyers, and crowds of
                  interested spectators, Jonathan stood up and told his story as easily as if he had
                  been relating it to one single friend. About noon, Jonathan said, 'My lord, I'm
                  hungry,' and he pulled from his pocket a crust of bread, and a piece of cheese,
                  which he had taken with him as a lunch. After eating awhile he said, 'My Lord,
                  this is dry fare.' 'Fetch Jonathan a mug of beer,' said the lord judge, and after
                  he had drank the beer they went on with the trial. Jonathan was pronounced, upon
                  the testimony of a celebrated physician and others, to be crazy, which was all
                     that prevented him from being hung,
                  and was sentenced to the Tower (a vast prison in London) for life. It was commonly
                  reported among the people that a brother of Jonathan's, a very wealthy tobacco
                  merchant, by the payment of a large sum, bribed the physician to give this
                  testimony, and by the same means induced others to swear that they had known of
                  his having been in two mad-houses.
               "There was a poor woman of the name of Webster, who kept a confectioner's shop in
                  the city of York, and her son was placed in the same room with Jonathan Martyn as
                  a guard. One night young Webster woke up, and hearing no sound from Jonathan's
                  bed, went to it and looked, and behold, Jonathan was gone! Webster immediately
                  roused the keepers with the cry, 'Jonathan has escaped!'
               "'What have you been doing to let him escape?' asked the head-keeper. 'Your door
                  was fastened, your windows are firmly secured, where is he?'
               "'Oh, I have only been sleeping in my bed like other folks,' answered Webster;
                  'how it happened I cannot tell, but Jonathan is out! Jonathan is out!'
               "'No, no,' answered a voice from the chimney, 'Jonathan's not out; Jonathan would
                  have been out, but the chimney is grated at the top.' He had been up to the top of
                  the chimney to endeavor to make his escape that way, but others had been
                  beforehand with him, and the top of the chimney was securely grated.
               "The next morning Nurse Barker stepped over to Mrs. Webster's shop to buy some
                  muffins, and found the poor woman crying as if her heart would break.
               "'What is the matter, neighbor?' she asked.
               "'Oh, to think how near my poor boy has come to losing his life through Jonathan
                  Martyn,' answered Mrs. Webster. 'Jonathan attempted to escape last night, and if
                  he had got off, my poor boy would perhaps have been hung for it. I never shall
                  have peace or comfort more while he is guarding Jonathan Martyn, for I am afraid
                  he will kill him, if he can get out no other way.'
               "At last poor Mrs. Webster set off for London, and she talked with the keepers and
                  with Jonathan, and cried bitterly in her distress. But Jonathan said to her,
                  'Never trouble yourself, my good woman, on that score. I will not hurt a hair of
                  your boy's head; he is a good boy; he is placed here to watch me, and he does his
                  duty well; no, no, I will not harm your son; but, if I can by any means make my
                  escape from this place, I shall do it.'
               
               "Jonathan Martyn made one more unsuccessful attempt to escape from the Tower, and
                  after six or seven years' imprisonment died there."
               "Well, that is a very interesting story," said Robert, when his mother had
                  finished; "and now, dear mother, will you answer my question as to whether
                  Jonathan was right in what he said about York Minster?"
               "I suppose you want to know, in other words, whether I think it right to have so
                  much show and magnificence in our churches?"
               "Yes, mother; I have thought a great deal about that, and I should like much to
                  hear your ideas on the subject."
               "I confess it is a pretty hard matter for me to answer you, my dear boy," replied
                  his mother: "had we anywhere in the Bible exact directions for the architecture
                  and decorations of our churches, such as were given to Noah for building the ark,
                  or to David for the temple his son Solomon was to build, we should be more certain
                  of not erring; but we see such a wide difference of opinion among very good people
                  that we are puzzled to tell where is the proper medium. Some Christian churches
                  are very magnificentâ€”with richly-colored glass, and lofty arches, and costly,
                  deep-toned organs; while others are in the very extreme of plainness, and the
                  sound of even the flute or violin is an abomination there; and yet I believe that
                  in both may God be worshipped from the heart.
               "For my own part, I like to see our churches handsome and comfortable, though I
                  think, in many of them, there is a vast outlay of money that might have been
                  expended much more profitably. While there are so many dark corners of the earth
                  yet to be enlightened by the beams of the Sun of Righteousness, I cannot think we
                  are right in expending such vast sums in mere ornament and show in
                  our places of worship. But then, on the other hand, I could not bear to live in a
                  handsome and commodious house myself, and attend a church, like some I have seen,
                  more like a barn with seats in it, than anything else."
               "You feel as David did, mother," said Anna, "when he said, 'Lo, I dwell in a house
                  of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the Lord remaineth under curtains."
               "I believe some of our strict forefathers thought it wrong to have their places of
                  worship comfortable," said Mr. Waring. "I have heard my father say that he well
                  remembered the suffering of riding some miles to church on a bitter winter's day,
                  and sitting the whole day on hard, bare seats, without a particle of fire, for there were no stoves in the
                  church, and it was too far to go home at noon."
               "One thing is certain, they had not the temptation which old Deacon More has, and
                  yields to every Sunday, of curling up in the corner of a pew and going to sleep,"
                  said Anna.
               "But to show you that we have no right to say that any particular mode of worship
                  is exclusively acceptable to God, I wish you would read first the account of the
                  splendor of Solomon's Temple, in 2d Chronicles," said Mrs. Waring, "that Temple
                  which was to be 'exceeding magnifical,' and of the show and pomp of the worship,
                  which was surely approved by God, for we are told that fire came down from Heaven
                  and consumed the burnt-offerings; and moreover, God promised to Solomon, that if,
                  when his people were in any trouble or distress, they would come to the Temple and
                  pray, he would hear from heaven, his dwelling-place, and answer; but it was
                     first necessary that they should 'humble themselves, and pray, and
                  seek his face, and turn from their wicked ways.' But the splendor of the Temple,
                  and its service, have long since passed away.
               "Now, look in contrast at the place of worship of our Saviour and his disciples.
                  By the still lake, on the hill-side, their seats the 'green grass,' and their
                  temple dome the blue canopy of heaven, Jesus of Nazareth taught his disciples, and
                  prayed with them. Or, in 'an upper room, furnished,' they held their simple
                  service; no swelling organ pealed, no sound of instrumental music was heard, but
                  'when they had sung an hymn they went out.'
               "One thing is certain, that in the most splendid of earth's temples, some humble,
                  heart worshippers may be found, while a proud heart and wandering thoughts may
                  exist in a little plain church with bare walls and pine benches. But there is a
                  most delightful thought to me, which is, that whether in the great city church, or
                  the country school-house, whether in the heart of the wisest philosopher, or the
                  simplest, untaught child of God, true religion is ever and always the same, a
                  simple, trusting faith in Christ; and all who possess this, will at
                  last reach that happy place, where the pious, rich, and poor of this world shall
                  meet together, and walk those golden courts in that upper temple 'not made with
                  hands,' before whose glories the splendor of York Minster, or even of Solomon's
                  Temple, shall become dim."

                     work. For the intellectual and thinking, it has a deeper lesson, and while it

                     infancy the misery of man. "Lewie" is one of the most popular books now before

                     fall as heavily as they do at first, else how could the burden of this life of
                     change and sorrow be borne. But the loved ones are not forgotten when the tear
                     is dried, and the smile returns to the cheek; they are remembered, but with
                     less of sadness and gloom in the remembrance; and at length, if we can think of
                     them as happy, it is only a pleasure to recall them to mind."â€”Patriot,

                     reigning King, and the evidence pro and

                  * * * A most interesting volume. We need but mention the fact that the
                     author has selected for his stories two of the most important periods in the
                     annals of France. To the general reader, as well as to the scholar, this
                     portion of French history is confessedly remarkable for its intense
                        interest.â€”Syracuse Journal.

                     arguments, and pronounced it "at least highly probable" that Mr. W. is the
                     Dauphin. This volume will be found a very attractive one to young readers, and

                     the Dauphin, are of an exceedingly interesting character, and
                     deserve a careful examination. The extraordinary resemblance which the Indian
                     Missionary bears to the portraits of Louis XVI. and Louis XVIII. is not the
                     least remarkable part of the matter. We commend this readable book to the

                     replete with interest, and will repay a perusal. * * * The author's object has
                     been to re-produce these great eras with vividness and freshness, rather than
                     to express any novel views respecting them. He has certainly produced vivid
                     pictures, and condensed a variety of historic information that ought to be in
                     every reader's possession. The idea is a capital one, which ought to be more

                     Cousin Cicely's "Lewie, or the Bended Twig," published and widely
                           read not long ago, was a volume to sharpen the reader's
                        appetite for "more of the same sort." * * * * * "Ups and Downs" is a cluster
                        of sketches and incidents in real life, narrated with a grace of thought and
                        flow of expression rarely to be met. The sketches well entitle the volume to
                        its name, for they are pictures of many sides of lifeâ€”some grave, some gay,
                        some cheering and some sad, pervaded by a genial spirit and developing good
                        morals
                     Either of the fifteen sketches will amply repay the purchaser of the volume,
                        and unless our judgment is false, after a careful reading, "Ups
                        and Downs" will make an impression beyond "the pleasant effect to while away
                        a few unoccupied moments." The Publishers have given Cousin Cicely's gems a
                        setting worthy of their brilliancy. The ten illustrations are capital in
                        design and execution, and it strikes us as remarkable how such a volume can
                        be profitably got up at the price for which it is sold. The secret must lie
                        in large circulationâ€”which "Ups and Downs" is certain to secure.â€”N. Y

                        somebody, and feel disposed to ask, who is she? We
                     several months ago noticed her "Lewie" in this journal. It is a story with a
                     fine moral, beautiful and touching in its development. It has already quietly
                     made its way to a circulation of twelve thousand, "without beating
                     a drum or crying oysters." Pretty good evidence that there is something
                        in it. Our readers have already had a taste of "Ups and
                     Downs," for we find among its contents a story entitled "Miss
                     Todd, M. D., or a Disease of the Heart," which was published in this journal a
                     few months ago. We venture to say that no one who
                     read has forgotten it, and those who remember it will be glad to know where
                     they can find plenty more of the "same sort."â€”U. S. Journal.

                     Cicely has improved her former good reputation in our opinion, by this

                  Of "Lewie," by "Cousin Cicely," we have recently spoken in terms of
                     unqualified praise. "Cousin Cicely" may take her rank with the several
                     remarkably successful female authors of the day, who within the last two or
                     three years, have created a public mania for female literature.â€”N. Y.

                     descriptions, and many others concealing a good deal of covert and well-merited
                     satire. We make the following extract from a sketch entitled "Miss Tod, M. D.,
                     or a Disease of the Heart;" from the portfolio of a young lawyer. The extract
                     will give a sample of the author's style.

                           pressed upon my head, to still its irregular pulsations, there was a soft
                           tap at the door. 'Come in,' I called out, and to my surprise in stepped
                           the neatest, brightest, most cheerful looking little woman it had ever
                           been my lot to meet.
                        "'You sent for me, I believe sir?' she said in a brisk, pleasant way.
                        "'I? No, Madamâ€”you are laboring under a mistake.'
                        "'Ah! I beg pardon,' said the little woman; I found on my slate the name
                           of Mr. Hubbs, No. 14, Mrs. Grays' boarding-house, with a request that I
                           would call and see him.'

                  Cousin Cicely has studied human nature, and expresses her views easily and
                     gracefully. Well written sketches, and are calculated to re prove the follies

                  These sketches are pictures of many sided life. The grave and gay the lively
                     and severe, the sad and glad, the fortune of prosperity, and the misfortunes of
                     reverse, are all depicted with a felicity of expression that is rare in this
                     day of "writing for effect." There is no straining or "high-falutin," no
                     construction of mere words for the sake of their own jingle, no appeal to bad
                     passions, and no mere effort at humor. If we mistake not, this book is destined
                     to have a large sale.â€”Roch. American.

                  We do not know of a writer whose works evince a purer or more wholesome
                     taste. This book of sketches under the above title, is like her former
                     productions, of a very superior tone. The "Vermont Cousin," and the "Adopted
                     Daughter," are rich in quiet humor, and the latter peculiarly so, in depth of
                     feeling and fine sentiment; while the "Lesson of Contentment" is one which
                     every person ought to read, in these hard timesâ€”Orleans

                  Cousin Cicely has acquired an enviable reputation as a writer of pleasing
                     stories. The sketches in this work are highly interesting, and at the same time
                     of a high moral character. The book will have a great sale.â€”Newark

                     vivacity of the narrative and dialogue is admirable. The characters are well
                     exhibited, and the talk of the country people is given with singular
                     correctness, and with a peculiar charm. Virtue finds its reward, and a good
                     moral tone marks the story. We predict that the "Ups and Downs" will be a
                     favorite with the public. It is not a desperate effort for popularity. All is
                     easy and amiable, and the reader not only honors, but loves the kind, genial,
                     heart-moving, and heart-purifying influence of the story which is making his

                  Cousin Cicely has made herself well known the world over by her beautiful
                     sketches. Her stories are made up of song, sentiment, sermon fancy, essay, and
                     philosophy, amusingly mingled in a manner greatly to interest. The present
                     volume assumes more the form of connected tales, the object of which shall be
                     to "point a moral." The authoress, with ease and elegance, has sent out her
                     books to instruct and improve the reader. They abound in rich moral tone and

                     unquestionable strength, that she can afford to be natural. In presenting her
                     interesting reminiscences she proceeds in a straight-forward manner, and tells
                     her story in unaffected, and often in beautiful and impressive language. Her
                     former productions have procured a place for her in many hearts, and the
                     present sketches fully sustain her position. They are lively, vigorous, and
                     always to the purpose, frequently illustrating an important moral truth by a
