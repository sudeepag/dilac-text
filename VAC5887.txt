            PREFACE.
            I SHOULD have no need to write a preface, if I had not some explanations to make to
               my musical reader. The counsels to teachers, and the analytical descriptions of some
               of the compositions of those great masters, Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin, which this
               book contains, are not given presumptuously on my own opinion solely. Although I have
               enjoyed valuable opportunities of musical culture, not only from artists as masters,
               but from artists as friends, having listened to fine instrumentalists in their hours
               of leisure, and thus formed my taste and opinions; I have also studied very closely
               the writings of those excellent critical authors, Berlioz, De Lanz, Oulibicheff,
               Liszt, Scudo, and others. I am sorry we have not such writers on musical æsthetics in
               English; and still more sorry that translations of their masterly works, so useful to
               the musical student, could not be given to the public. But after seeing a cultivated
               woman spend her time in translating that exquisite and difficult book, "Liszt's
               Chopin," just for the pure love of art, with the hope of being useful to the musical
               scholar, and then knowing that her fine, conscientious translation traveled from
               publisher to publisher, each one, shrugging his shoulders, saying, "the book is
               clever, but will not sell," I thought it would be labor lost to give the time I have
               devoted to the construction of this book to the translation of even one of those
               valuable works; but, wherever I could use their excellent counsel, or give their
               technical analysis, I have done so. To Berlioz, De Lanz, and Liszt, particularly, I
               refer my readers, that they may see how useful such works are to the musical
               student.
            I wish I could now mention also my artist friends, in acknowledgement of the valuable
               service they have rendered me; but I cannot
               with delicacy. However, those of them whose characters and genius have served me as
               originals—as life-studies for the artists, which I have, with my weak pencil, striven
               to paint here in my book—are not only gifted, but young; the artist world may yet
               hear of them; and as great a future may be before them as I have, in my fiction,
               given to Marie Merle, Ehrenherz, and Henzler.
            And now, a word for my poor little fiction itself. Mrs. Norton sang, to an ugly
               child,— 
                  
                     "The loved are lovely, so art thou to me,
                     Child, in whose face strange eyes no beauty see."
                  
                And thus I feel toward this little book. I commenced it at a season of great
               sadness—at a period when the very ground on which I stood seemed reeling. Old ties
               were rent asunder, old faiths, old hopes; all I had lived, loved, and prayed for,
               swept from me; links severed, never to be clasped together in this state of being. To
               keep my sorrow from feeding on me, I gave my "serpent a file." The world
               has nothing to do with all this; but my little public may look more favorably on my
               book-child when they know what an angel of blessing it has proved to me. It has done
               its duty well; it has cheered me when hopeless; given me fresh spring and impulse
               when failing health and morbid spirits refused their aid. Now its work is finished
               with me. It will go out into the world to take its chance by the side of lovelier and
               cleverer ones. I have done all I can for it in return for its good done to me. I am
               only sorry that my doing has been so weak.

               GOOD-BY.
               "IT will tire you too much, give you useless pain, to spend this day in your new
                  home. Send Dora to make all the necessary arrangements. We do not have to leave
                  you until five o'clock this afternoon. Stay the day with us, and this morning we
                  will go boating on this beautiful lake."
               Thus kindly talked my friends, and Dora, my maid, urged their proposition so
                  earnestly that I yielded, and let her go with my luggage and a note of apology to
                  my hostess, Madame Bouvreuil: then off we started in the pretty little boat with a
                  gondola screen and American flag on the mirror-like waters of this lovely Lake of
                  the Desert. The sky was of a deep purply blue, soft and tender like an Italian
                  sky, with hazy clouds hanging around the tops of the mountains. Dents du Midi
                  coquettishly vailed its serrated heads; and even Mount Catogne and Mount Velan,
                  the St. Bernard peak rising in the center of the Rhone valley, were dim and misty
                  looking; but these graceful wavy clouds did not detract from the beauty of the
                  landscape; on the contrary, they gave to it a more charming effect. We skirted
                  along the doubling shores of the lake, stopping at various points, as some
                  beautiful shady hill or old chateau attracted our attention. At Zillium we spent a
                  pleasant hour: in the souterraines we listened
                  to the guide's stereotyped descriptions, and hunted up with idle curiosity the many distinguished names
                  cut on the stone pillars commemorative of their sympathy for an imaginary martyr
                  who never merited it. Beautiful sprays of the maiden-hair fern grew around the
                  high narrow arched windows; the walls were covered with a soft green mold: the
                  blue of the heavens mingling with the green color of the waters of the lake near
                  the shore, aided by the sun's rays, shot in at the windows and played over 
                     "the seven columns of Gothic mold"
                   in fantastic broken gleams of the most delicate shades of purple, blue, and
                  emerald, reminding us of Capri's Grotto of Azure. Then we mounted to the
                  bedchamber of "le petit Charlemagne" of Savoie, and lingered in the adjoining
                  bower room of his duchess, the view from her window recalling to us what the old
                  chronicler, had said of Count Wala's imprisonment in this same old fortress,
                  nearly four centuries before Pierre of Savoie's birth.
               "The Empress Judith wickedly instigated Louis le-Débonnaire to seize the good
                  Count Wala, the cousin, friend, and wise counselor of his father, the great
                  Charlemagne, and they threw him into a fort surrounded on all sides by water, and
                  from its windows could only be seen the heavens, the lake, and the savage
                  Alps."
               "He was the true Prisoner of Zillium," said C., "and yet no one has ever written a
                  poem to his memory; and how few even know of him and his noble career!"
               As we rambled off from the castle up the shady mountain road which looked so
                  tempting from its picturesque beauty, we talked rebelliously, as people will, over
                  the injustice of history, forgetting that it is a human thing, a creation of man,
                  and necessarily unjust. The charming young husband and wife dwelt with tender
                  sadness on Count Wala's beautiful character, his courageous truthfulness and
                  simple unostentatious piety, which make his memory stand out in that distant
                  period of history as the light of one pure clear star in a dusky night; and as we
                  strolled along, bringing back the golden days of Charlemagne, they gathered fern
                  leaves, and moss, and forget-me-nots, as graceful memories of this spot so rich in
                  historical associations. A little cascade came bounding and leaping down the
                  hill-side, 
                     "with its light foot of pearl."
                  
               
               "What is the name of that pretty waterfall?" I asked of a peasant who was lounging
                  lazily along.
               "Oh! ce-ça, ce n'est rien!" he answered in a pooh-pooh sort of style; "c'est
                  seulement une source."
               La Source! How the name and the sound of the dancing waters, and the cool mist
                  arising from it, brought back ——'s music. "La Source" of Blumenthal rang in my
                  ears, and filled my eyes with heart-spray; the unison of memory's melody was in
                  perfect diapason with the tone of the little chime bells of the waterfall, and
                  they rang together in melancholy but sweet harmony. While my heart was running
                  over with regrets for the lost and gone, the old life broken rudely off, and the
                  dreaded unknown new life so chill and lonely, C. and A. were talking of their home
                  across the broad waters; they had left the good old Count Wala to fall back into
                  his gray misty past, and with hearts full of sweet young hope and love, they were
                  talking of the cozy library in their quiet country home,—that little library room
                  whose windows looked on the setting sun, and where the sweet twilights of their
                  honeymoon had deepened into bright happy starlights. The old chronicler, who had
                  led to the memory of the Abbot of Corbie, had also guided their thoughts
                  peacefully back to their quiet happy fireside.
               The sun's rays growing warmer, and the shadows stealing back into the bushes,
                  reminded us of the hour, so we retraced our steps and returned to the boat. We had
                  a hard row back, for the bize, a northeast wind, blew up and caused quite a little sea: cunning white-caps, petits
                  moutons, crested the miniature billows: the boatmen lowered the screen and raised
                  the pretty lateen sail, which causes our lake boats to look like birds skimming
                  over the surface of the water, and we rocked swiftly and merrily along. We were so
                  near the shore as to be free from danger, and yet just enough tossed about to give
                  the appearance of insecurity; it roused our animal spirits, and we sang and
                  laughed aloud in as mad glee as three children frolicking in the breakers. Soon we
                  were at the steps of the hotel terrace, and a few moments after were seated at our
                  early dinner,—the last dinner we should take together for many years. We drank
                  each other's health in the wine of the country, the light golden Yvorne; then we
                  sat under the trees in the beautiful garden, while we sipped our coffee, gazed
                  dreamily on the glorious lake and opposite mountain shores, and talked pleasantly
                  and lingeringly together; every moment was growing so precious to us.
               At last the time approached for them to leave, and I accompanied them on their way
                  to the diligence; how jealously memory holds on to every incident! We loitered
                  awhile in a wood-carving store, then to the post where C. mailed his letters, and
                  I left my new address, then to the diligence. We arrived just as they were putting
                  the horses to the heavy lumbering vehicle. While we were standing on the corner of
                  the Rue du Lac and the Rue de Simplon, four or five Italian musicians came along,
                  looking like the Zampognari bagpipers from the Abruzzi, who are to be seen in the
                  Neapolitan streets in winter, "virtuoses ambulants," as Töpffer calls these street
                  artists; they wore ragged, dirty, but picturesque dresses, pointed hats, brown
                  cloaks, short leathern breeches tied with gay-colored worsted cords and tassels
                  that left their brown legs bare from the knee down, and sandals on their naked
                  feet; some played on the bagpipes, others sang, and one danced carelessly but in
                  perfect time to the wild mountain melody; some had sheepskin cloaks hanging from
                  their bare shoulders, and their shining black elf locks streamed in ragged curls
                  from under their hats; they were all beautifully formed and moved with classic
                  grace and ease. The dancer was the tallest and best made of the group; he was a
                  handsome dog, with sparkling eyes, teeth glittering white like the ice tops of
                  these Savoy Alps, brown skin, and a merry saucy laugh on his broad, full,
                  red-lipped mouth, while his gait had a glorious swing as if he knew and felt his
                  superb proportions.
               "He is the twin-brother of Teverino," said C., laughing, "the handsome impudent
                  rogue!"
               But while our eyes followed them up the road, as they sang, and laughed, and
                  swayed about with careless insouciance, it was
                  announced to us that the diligence was ready. I bade my friends good-by, and stood
                  watching with filling eyes the care and tender attention bestowed by the young
                  husband upon his pretty little wife, as he arranged her and her shawls and
                  numberless feminine accessories in the coupé.
               "It is so sweet to be loved! How a woman's heart naturally yearns for the
                  protection and care that springs from a man's love!" were the words I felt rushing
                  to my lips.
               C. turned to wave a good-by, and seeing my filling eyes and quivering lips, shook
                  his finger playfully at me, while his honest handsome face showed the sympathy he
                  felt; A. looked as though she must spring from the coupé window to come and
                  comfort me. I dashed the weak tears aside with resentment, and forced a laugh.
                  What, after all my enduring bravery, to fail just at the end? My expatriation, my
                  solitary new life, though a wise conclusion, had it not been a voluntary one? Now
                  was not the time for weakness and tears.
               "Voila!" I cried, pointing to the gaudy driver, who, springing to his seat, seized
                  his bright horn which hung from his shoulder on a gay-colored leathern strap.
                  "C'est le Postillon de Lonjumeau!" And turning abruptly on my heel, I walked off
                  rapidly to the sound of the cracking whip, the running chords of the horn, and the rumbling wheels of the diligence, which
                  rolled away in its cloud of dust up the road to F. It all sounded in my ears, this
                  mass of confused noises, like the thundering clang of a heavy iron gate. I felt
                  shut out, Hagar-like, in my wilderness. "And not even an Ishmael to comfort me!" I
                  said with a choked voice to myself.
               I had a long, lonely walk, and weary enough was I when I reached my new residence.
                  I lifted the latch of the iron-clamped door softly, walked quietly up the stone
                  staircase over the brick-paved hall of the massive old house, which hundreds of
                  years before had been an old convent, to my salon door. I opened the door and
                  entered the room; there sat Dora at a window, with her eternal crocheting hanging
                  from her fingers, looking out with that vague German rapture on the beauty of
                  nature spread before her. Beau, my pet dog, a King Charles spaniel, leaped from
                  her lap and greeted me with a howl of delight.
               "Voila! my little Ishmael!" my heart said.
            
            
               CHAPTER II.
               MY NEW HOME.
               I CAN scarcely imagine a prettier, cozier scene than my little salon presented the
                  first evening of my arrival at Peilz. From the windows could be seen a view of
                  ravishing beauty; there were the grand Alps topped with snow, the beautiful lake
                  that swept between me and them, and then a pretty rustic garden and orchard lay
                  beneath. Inside the room everything bespoke the presence of comfort, mixed with
                  the picturesque, one sees so often in Europe. We are so practical, so positive in
                  America, that our domestic interiors rarely possess this charm; wealth and culture
                  may bring magnificent elegance; the regular, industrious habits of our people of
                  moderate means procure cleanliness and orderly arrangements; but rarely
                  picturesque attractions decorate our homes. In America we are all living to work;
                  in Europe there is little of this feverish unrest, they barely work to live; and
                  it is folly to say which is right—each people do as an unseen destiny impels them.
                  A great overruling power quiets the life-pulse of one nation, and sends bounding
                  along in a hot, feverish, throbbing tide, the life-current of another, and it is
                  only when cycles of ages have passed, that the great events intended to be gained
                  by His wise direction are shown; but individual man, like the silly fly on the
                  wheel in the fable, will continue to fret and fume, and fancy he creates all that
                  is made; he may mar for awhile, and cause jerks and harmless confusion in the
                  great whirring machinery, but that is all—he is still but the fly on the wheel, or
                  one of the trifling accessories to a great system. But I am wandering out of my woman's sphere, and far off
                  from my simple salon in Suisse.
               Thin fleecy white mull curtains were looped back with crimson cords from either
                  side of the windows; in front of these windows was a soft-cushioned canapé,
                  covered with a gay bright chintz, over whose light ground wandered vines covered
                  with roses of the most brilliant hues; a round table stood in front of the canapé;
                  and half advanced from one of the corners of the room, that the light might fall
                  on it, was a tall, carved walnut cabinet, with a falling desk and brass-mounted
                  drawers. A semi-grand piano stood in front of the doors of the alcove chamber of
                  my maid. On the other side of the room a door opened into another fine airy
                  chamber as large as the salon, which was also draped in snowy-white curtains,
                  bound and looped with crimson; that was my sleeping apartment. Dora, good
                  creature, had done all she could to make the rooms look natural and comfortable to
                  my eyes. She had unpacked all my books and scattered them about to the best of her
                  knowledge. Voltaire, Jeremy Taylor, Molière, Pascal, and Rousseau, were piled in
                  friendly companionship on the mantel top of the brass-bound, white earthen stove.
                  She knew little of books except by their bindings, and when left to her own
                  judgment in arranging them, was very apt to make odd groupings. Shakspeare,
                  Cowper, Byron, and Shelley, my four literary gospels, were ranged around the
                  table, with Mrs. Browning's dearly-loved volumes piled up in the center,
                  suggesting Joseph's dream: the stronger brethren bowing to the weaker member of
                  the great family circle of poets, only weaker because she is a woman, and in her
                  weakness is her strength. That soft, low woman voice of this age! It rings out
                  pure and clear, like the silvery tone of an angel's trumpet music, as heard in one
                  of those dreams that come to us when sorrow or sickness almost emancipates the
                  soul from the body. Thrice blessed and happy should this woman poet be, for her
                  poems have sustained many a sister woman in life's weary journey, elevating her
                  above its petty but cutting miseries, and consoling her for its shortcomings. Oh,
                  that glorious state of existence into which the works of genius lift us! To many
                  of us it is the only real being, and this feverish state of "distorted wills"
                  called life, is but a horrid dream.
               The desk was open, and all my writing materials out,—the portefeuille and locked
                  journal, as if I had sat there at work for months. A comfortable fauteuil, covered
                  with the same cheerful chintz as the sofa, stood in front of it. Even the piano
                  lid was laid back, and Schubert's volume of Romances was placed on the music
                  stand, opened at the girl's favorite song, "Lobe der Thränen," the very sight of
                  which sent a thrill to my heart. Could I ever sing again? Would music be a comfort
                  to me in my loneliness? For when I am sad and suffering, my own music is always a
                  scourge. The sound of my voice acts like the magical sesame; it unfastens the
                  doors of memory, and straightway phantoms surround me; phantoms of the past, forms
                  of joy and sorrow, rapture and agony,—all these cluster and press close upon my
                  heart, demanding tribute, the memory of the past joys more keen in its pain than
                  the sorrow even, 
                     
                        "Nessun maggior dolore
                        Che ricordarsi del tempo felice
                        Nella miseria,"—
                     
                   and the melody breaks sharply off in a sob which shows how bitter is the
                  anguish.
               Dora, as I have said, was sitting by the window in front of a little sewing table.
                  Good, girl, she knew how much first impressions affected me, and she wished to
                  create as much as lay in her power the appearance of a home. "Home! ah that is so
                  hard to recreate after physical and moral death step over the threshold," my
                  rebellious heart murmured. She sprang up as soon as she saw me, and hastened to
                  take off my wrappings. She looked so bright, and the room so pleasant and cheery,
                  everything was so much more comfortable
                  than I had looked for, that—shall I confess my naughty weakness? yes—I felt
                  provoked; I shivered from head to foot in my peevish misery.
               "Mademoiselle is cold," she said tenderly.
               "Of course," I answered in a husky voice, made rough by the unshed tears which
                  clouded over me; "in these bleak mountainous countries one is always cold."
               The girl made no answer, but hastened to unfasten my dust cloak. I hurried past
                  her, leaving the mantle behind me, and entered the bedroom; as I did so my eye
                  caught sight of a little table in the corner near the door, on which she had put
                  all the miniature cases, my work-box, and one or two little keepsakes; my heart
                  clutched tight like the gripe of a hand; I grew blind, and reeled, and but for her
                  strong arms should have fallen to the ground. She laid me on the bed, over which
                  the curtains fell like a tent-covering, from a gilt eagle beak, and commenced
                  undressing me as if I had been an infant. But I would be uselessly brave, so I
                  arose and hurried with fretful haste to help her in the work.
               My eyes glanced around the room, where I saw new proofs of the thoughtful care of
                  my kind maid: on the table under the long mirror was my dressing case, spread
                  open, neat and tidy, showing no marks of the long journey it had taken, or the
                  hasty rude usage it had been forced to receive in the past few months; every one
                  of my old bedroom luxuries was out, as though I had dressed and undressed in the
                  chamber from childhood; the pincushion, with its clean, fresh cover, had the pins
                  put in carelessly, and also two or three common morning brooches hung from it, as
                  if my own hands had stuck them there after the morning's toilette. On an
                  easy-chair by the bed lay spread out temptingly my dressing wrapper, whose rosy
                  lining and border shone gayly against the snowy fringe of the bed curtain which
                  fell beside it, and on a footstool were the crimson crocheted slippers. Everywhere
                  was displayed the graceful orderly disorder of occupied pied rooms. On a little
                  table in the corner at the head of the bed, she had piled my Bible and devotional
                  books, placed on either side a blessed candle, and in the center a little round
                  porcelain altar lamp, all the furniture of a simple bedroom altar; upon the wall
                  she had tacked a small engraving which she had found in my book trunk, a Madonna
                  della Sedia, and around it she had, with simple grace, woven a rustic frame of the
                  dark woodbine leaves, and with some white rose-buds and leaves she had formed a
                  cross, which she had fastened to the wall inside the canopy covering of my bed,
                  and from it hung my prayer beads. Now she was a good steady Lutheran, this Dora of
                  mine, so this part of her work was a touching evidence of her Christian liberality
                  and charity. Would that all Christians in this world could live together as
                  affectionately as my Lutheran maid and her Catholic mistress; the season of peace
                  and good-will would surely be near at hand. And her reasoning is so simple on the
                  subject of my Catholic observances and ceremonies:—
               "What is meant good is good; God makes it good with a blessing."
               She had used the day industriously as well as lovingly, and I could not but
                  acknowledge it to myself, if I did remain so ungraciously silent; but still I was
                  miserable; "a spring of tears welled back o' my eyelids," and I would not allow
                  myself to be comforted.
               "Madame Bouvreuil," commenced Dora, as she unfastened the buttons of my under
                  sleeve.
               "I do sincerely hope," I interrupted in a bored tone, "that I am not to be annoyed
                  with seeing any one this evening."
               "That is just what madame thought," answered Dora, as she gave me a chair to sit
                  on, and stooped down to unlace my boots. "She said mademoiselle would feel too
                  weary to see any one to-night, so when she brought in the jolie bouquet on the table, she left her compliments, and hoped if
                  mademoiselle wished for anything——"
               
               By this time the boots were off, and I sprang up so hastily and jerked my collar
                  off so impatiently, that poor Dora, with admirable tact, seeing that I was not in
                  the mood for conversation, remained quiet and said not a word during the rest of
                  the undressing. I wrapped my soft gown around me and crept into the little bed; my
                  senses were steeped heavily in the black opium tide of sorrow; I longed for a
                  sleep of forgetfulness. Dora smoothed the pillows, giving them that comfortable
                  slope some women hands understand as by instinct; she then drew the curtains
                  around me and over the windows in pretty folds, on which she knew my eyes would
                  rest gratefully, arranged Beau's basket,—even that detail she had not
                  forgotten,—and I laid there apparently ungrateful, so selfish does extreme grief
                  sometimes make us. But Beau, like his mistress, would not take what was prepared
                  for him in kindness and love, with pleasant grace; he growled and snapped, and
                  crouched close to my feet on the outside of the bed, scarcely allowing her to
                  throw a shawl over him, the thankless little beast; he intended that we should be
                  cross and miserable together. She then brought me a plateau, on which were a cup
                  of fragrant tea, some tempting slices of beurrée, and some delicate confitures,
                  with a little panier of large anana strawberries in a huge grape leaf. I swallowed
                  the tea chokingly, then turned my back, and buried my face in the pillow. The girl
                  lighted the night lamp, set it up in the niche above the porcelain stove, and
                  withdrew silently into the salon.
               Sleep, little Fanny Fauvette, and dream of that past which, with all its miseries,
                  will always be dearer than the most golden-hued future.
            
            
               CHAPTER III.
               THE FAMILY.
               NOW of that past of Fanny Fauvette there is nothing to say. Like the buried towns
                  on the Sorrentine promontory of Southern Italy, a hot wave had passed over it,
                  burning out all life and quieting to sleep even restless hope; its only future,
                  like that of the grave, rested on God's hereafter. In Peilz the new life was to
                  commence, and its happiness or content depended upon circumstances; the characters
                  of my new associates would affect it greatly, but the principal things required
                  were physical and moral ability on my own part to enable me to take it up with
                  strength and courage; and this I faced steadily from the beginning.
               The first morning I awakened to a glorious sunrise. I sprang from the bed, and,
                  wrapping my dressing gown around me, stepped out on the gallery in front of my
                  windows to enjoy it fully. It was only four o'clock, and the whole human world
                  seemed asleep, except that in a neighboring yard two men sat listlessly talking
                  together in front of a grange. The Rhone valley was lighted up with the most
                  gorgeous colors, and Dents du Midi and Dent du Morcles, on either side, seemed as
                  if holding out banners to herald the approach of the day-god. The opposite
                  mountains reared their snow-crested heads, and up their rugged sides crept little
                  clouds that grew rosier and rosier in their ascent, like the graceful mountain
                  nymphs in classic legend. The lake lay smooth as a plain; two boats stood on its
                  surface with their shadows clearly defined beneath them. I sat as one entranced,
                  and enjoyed the varying beauty of the scene.
               
               "Ah!" I said over and over again to myself, "I can find contentment of spirit
                  surely here, for the sublimity of these glorious mountains, the loveliness of
                  beautiful nature, must give rest and stillness."
               I had so lately known the bitter experience of sorrow, that it seemed in the very
                  rustling of the leaves I could 
                     
                        "hear the stir
                        Of his black mantle trailing in the dust;"
                     
                   and this made my bruised being, struggling for strength, turn toward sweet
                  mother Nature, to claim kindred with her, and ask her gracious healing aid. I sat
                  and drank in sweet comfort, and also sweet pain, from the mountains, sky, and
                  lake; there was the regret for the absence of the dead-lost, which became milder
                  grief when I recalled how much of my agony they were spared; then came grander,
                  holier thoughts, as if the high mountains had bowed down and lifted up my spirit
                  to their level, and it seemed as though I too was made capable of 
                     "drinking in the soul of things."
                  
               
               So much strength and wisdom did that morning reverie give me, that I was
                  courageous enough, after my solitary breakfast, to occupy myself industriously. I
                  arranged my books, ordered my hours, and laid out my plan of study. Oh yes! I
                  would accomplish an immense deal, for is not occupation the great secret of a
                  certain kind of happiness, that negative happiness which arises from satisfaction
                  with one's self? The dinner hour arrived, and then I had to break through my
                  morbid desire for solitude, and unite with the family of my host and hostess. I
                  way as well give here an outline of the characters and appearance of the members
                  of my new domestic circle. The family consisted of a father and mother, one son
                  and daughter, both grown, and a young man who, like myself, was unconnected by
                  blood with the Bouvreuils.
               Professor Bouvreuil, the father, was a man of great learning and pleasant manners;
                  he was over mid-age when I came to Peilz, of middle height, with a figure inclined
                  to stoutness; he had a cheerful, kind face, with fresh complexion, thoughtful,
                  dreamy blue eyes, a fine Scipio Africanus brow and head, with thin silky gray
                  hair, which hung in sparse locks over his clear blue-veined temples. The outline
                  of his face was slightly Jewish, the nose being half way between the Italian and
                  Hebrew type, and the eyes were set in oblique angles from the nose, having a
                  drooping of the lid at the outer corners which added a sad look to the dreamy,
                  speculative expression of the eye itself; but for the cheerful, almost merry smile
                  which played about his full good-natured mouth, his face would have been a
                  melancholy one. The very first look at him convinced one that he was never
                  intended by nature for an actor on life's stage. He was a thinker—not a very
                  positive or practical one, however; and I have heard superficial judges call
                  Professor Bouvreuil inexact in his knowledge; but he was not; his speculative,
                  inquiring habits of mind, his vague manner of thinking aloud his undigested ideas,
                  which was his way of giving them form and shape for the satisfaction and benefit
                  of his own mind, produced this impression on persons who did not know him
                  intimately, or who judged all minds by one narrow positive rule; then his entire
                  freedom from ambition made him indifferent about bringing his speculations to any
                  practical result. He loved and wooed learning for learning's sweet sake, not for
                  what learning could procure for him of worldly goods or reputation. He always
                  recalled to me those lines of Wordsworth:—
               
                  
                     "what happiness to live
                     When every hour brings palpable access
                     Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight,
                     And sorrow is not there."
                  
               
               His father had been a wealthy merchant of Berlin, and had educated this son and
                  two daughters with infinite care and
                  cost. They had studied under the direction of the great Neander, and were all
                  marvelously clever. As they grew up, the poor father failed in business, and died;
                  then they found their learning truly better than house and land. One sister,
                  Ottilie, a girl of great promise and beauty, went to sleep at the same sorrowful
                  period, and was laid in the grave with the poor broken-hearted father and the
                  mother, who had died seventeen years before, when she gave birth to this lovely
                  creature. Often I regarded, with dreamy admiration, an exquisite portrait they had
                  of this young girl, whose Sappho-like fragments of poetry, filled with lofty
                  tenderness, and journals containing high glorious thoughts, showed how well she
                  had merited the tears of regret and admiration shed over her remains by the
                  solemn, taciturn Neander, of whom she had been a favorite, even an idolized
                  pupil.
               The other sister, with her husband, had established, soon after her father's
                  death, the college for which Peilz is and has been famous for many years, and in
                  which the brother became a professor. Professor Bouvreuil was one of those men so
                  often met with in these old countries of Europe, with enough science and
                  acquirements to endow a whole faculty; his fine head contained a library of
                  knowledge, but he was quite out of place in this practical age. Had he loved
                  mankind as he loved bookkind, he would have been one of the
                  philanthropic reformers of the day; but he had been brought up under the mild,
                  reasonable rule of the Prussian government; happiness and public rights had never
                  seemed rare or difficult to him; the simple, unostentatious living of the Prussian
                  nobility makes life more easy for the poorer classes; he had never seen the
                  violent contrasts, the injustice arising from the ostentation and selfish
                  indulgence of wealthy rank. He was one of Guizot's esprits
                     exigeans, caractères complaisans. He was content, after the daily
                  routine of class lessons and lectures, which brought the quotidian bread, to bury
                  himself in his library, working at his book on India, (where he had gone as
                  chaplain to some government mission the first few years after his father's death,)
                  his geographical studies, and the plan of an immense map on a new system, for
                  geography, treated in a philosophical light, was his favorite study; he had some
                  curious notions of the effect of certain geographical formations and changes upon
                  the human mind and character; he could account for all the great events in the
                  history of humanity by his geographical system. How often I have listened to his
                     thinkings aloud on this subject, for they could not be called
                  conversations; but his vague shadows of thoughts thrown on to the cloudy, dreamy
                  mirror of my mind which had never produced an exact reflection of any scientific
                  or metaphysical idea during the whole time it had dwelt in my body, of course left
                  no trace behind them. I loved, however, to listen to him, to his mild musical
                  voice; and the very vagueness and disjointedness of his talk gave a poetical
                  dreaminess to the abstract subjects, while from the lips of a more positive talker
                  they would have been tedious. Then he liked to talk to me next best to his wife,
                  for we both listened without requiring exact definings of his position; and I must
                  say he gave me credit for possessing more cleverness than I merited, just because
                  I listened to him in a quiet understanding manner, and this he valued all the more
                  as he did not meet with many such patient listeners; his wife listened from a
                  habit born of a deep sympathizing love; I did, as I have said, because I loved to
                  hear him talk, and also because he let drop from the richness of his acquirements,
                  historical facts and associations, suggestions that gave me food for sweet poetic
                  thought—"imp feathers," as it were, to the weak wings of my own imagination.
               I have described thus minutely the peculiarities of the professor's mind and
                  manner, not that he played any prominent part in my new life, but because I think
                  he had a character à lui, as the French say, and
                  I always loved to analyze it even in my
                  unskillful manner; it was one of which a word-portrait might be made by a clever
                  pen, that would resemble one of those suggestive portraits of Holbein, Cuyp, or
                  Rembrandt, some of those curious life-like faces in which the looker-on can read a
                  life history; no idealization of the countenance, but all the individual
                  characteristics speaking out in some curious details of the features; nothing
                  symbolic or romantic, as in Raphael's or Da Vinci's, but a close imitation of
                  nature, such as some certain furrows on the brow, some cunning unknown lines about
                  the mouth, or a sly wrinkle in the eye-corner, which betray the workings of the
                  hidden soul, and that will show themselves on the face after long years of secret
                  life-labor, no matter how calm may be the countenance, or self-concentrated the
                  nature, or harder than iron the will.
               Madame Bouvreuil was just the wife for such a man: intelligent, appreciative, and
                  at the same time fond of domestic life, home duties, and home pursuits. She
                  superintended her house, which was no easy business; her skillful fingers seasoned
                  the white sauces so pleasant to the taste of the professor, who, unconsciously,
                  was just on the edge of being a gourmand; prepared the delicious confitures,
                  ordered the quarterly lessive, directed the huge
                  ironings, made every one comfortable in the house, and yet did it orderly and
                  quietly. She had a peculiar tact about such things as domestic affairs. Her
                  husband was one of the few appreciative husbands I ever knew, and probably that
                  contributed to make her more successful. Domestic praise, that rarest of all kinds
                  of praise, is a great incentive and spur to perfection. The professor used to say
                  that his wife had brought as much intellect to bear on a nursery and household as
                  would have sufficed to have governed a kingdom. She possessed some clever
                  qualities that fitted her well for her position in life; she was prompt and
                  decided, without being opinionative; energetic, but not disagreeably so; then she
                  had a natural tendency to classify everything, and this aided her in what would
                  have been for any one else very laborious housekeeping. She was a little woman,
                  well made in her form, and without personal vanity, although she paid great
                  attention to her appearance—to the cut and fit of her robe, and dressing of her
                  hair. Morning, noon, and night, Madame Bouvreuil always looked the lady, whether
                  in the neat print morning wrapper or dark silk evening dress, whose cut defined
                  well the slender roundness of her pretty waist, the graceful fall of her
                  shoulders, and the full proportions of her exquisite little figure. She had a
                  clear olive complexion, deep dark gray eyes, a firm mouth, and a great quantity of
                  dark-brown hair, over which she wore, more for ornament than necessity, a lace
                  kerchief folded in half, with the point falling over the front of the
                     head—à la Marie Stuart—and tied in light soft
                  folds under her round pretty chin; it was excessively becoming. The general
                  character of her face was rather serious; it indicated a firm, concentrated
                  nature, and an even, well-balanced disposition and mind; she soared far above all
                  littleness of life and of people; she took a wide extended view of things, and
                  seemed always to act as one who thought everything that interfered with the quiet
                  and happiness of life as unavoidable but mysterious mistakes and errors, that
                  should not happen, but at the same time should not be fretted over. Madame
                  Bouvreuil's domestic life had had enough of contretemps in it to have made it to many women insupportable. Her
                  husband, though a loving and appreciative one, did not care for any one's comfort,
                  scarcely his own; he had been brought up with all the appliances that wealth
                  procures, and needed, or rather expected, certain domestic comforts which, with
                  his income and position, were positive luxuries, and cost great labor to his wife;
                  but he always acted about them as if they grew spontaneously. Then his sister,
                  Madame Eperveil, the principal of the institution at Peilz, a most provokingly
                  imperious woman, would have been an unceasing cause of torment to a sister-in-law
                  of a different disposition. Madame Bouvreuil mildly and quietly managed all these domestic difficulties
                  as if they were faiblesses and errors in her
                  domestic machine, which must be accommodated, but not dwelt on or fretted over.
                  She loved her husband tenderly, and her son with more anxiety than she showed
                  about anything else, but she adored her daughter.
               Hélène Bouvreuil was not at home when I first came to Peilz, being absent with her
                  aunt on a summer visit to some relatives in Berlin; but I will sketch her here in
                  this collection of family portraits. She had all her mother's attractions of form,
                  but was much taller, and her features were more strikingly beautiful. Madame
                  Bouvreuil's face was too thoughtful and elevated in its expression to be merely
                  pretty, yet it had not the points to make it what her daughter's was—beautiful.
                  Hélène resembled her father a little, and the portrait of her Aunt Ottillie more;
                  she was just a little above middle height, and to her form could be applied those
                  expressive French adjectives, svelte, elancée;
                  she was full enough for beauty, and every movement was attractive and graceful; it
                  was a pleasure to see her move about a room, she handled everything and used her
                  well-proportioned fair hands so agreeably. She had a well-shaped head, which was
                  set finely on her beautiful neck and shoulders; a clear fair skin, very pale at
                  times, and then a color flushing over it as delicate as the soft pink of a shell;
                  her eyes were a brown gray, with long lashes and drooping lids; her hair might
                  have been called black, but for a shade of golden brown that played over it in
                  some lights; she wore it with one rich tress braided and bound around her temples,
                  and the rest all gathered in a large knot of plaits low down on the back of her
                  head. The outline of her face resembled her father's—the same blending of the
                  Italian and Jewish—and what an indefinable beauty a slight expression of the
                  Jewish type gives to a certain style of womanly loveliness! There is a poetical
                  dreaminess in it, an exquisite charm hangs around the full red lips, a delicate
                  feeling in the quivering nostril of the slightly curved but beautiful nose: then
                  in the expression of the eyes there is all the Rachel love and Mary-mother
                  tenderness,—deep, adoring love without passion; love so intense that it seems a
                  little still and sad, as do all human emotions when very profound. There is a Holy
                  Family by Carlo Maratti, whose Madonna-mother has just this beauty that Hélène
                  Bouvreuil had when I saw her in her first flush of early womanhood.
               Though Hélène took her beauty from her father's family, she had more of the
                  disposition of her mother; there was the same quiet, calm, self-control, but not
                  the same self-dependence; she was more clinging and demonstrative; she needed
                  expressions of tenderness; she had to love and also to be loved to be happy.
                  Madame Bouvreuil had no such need; she loved others profoundly, but although she
                  valued their love in return, it was not a necessity as it was to Hélène. Like her
                  mother, Hélène was very domestic in her habits and tastes; she was born to be a
                  wife and mother, capable and loving her work.
               I have said that Madame Bouvreuil loved her son with more anxiety than she showed
                  for anything else; and well she might, for Octave Bouvreuil was one of those young
                  men who, when they can make a true, clear-minded woman love them, it is against
                  her better judgment, and the love is deeply blended with fear and trembling. To
                  some families the gift of beauty seems given in its richest fullness, and so it
                  was to the Bouvreuils; this son was one of the most attractive young men one could
                  possibly imagine; he was of just height and proportions, neither too tall, nor
                  under size; he had exquisite hands and feet, like his mother; like Hélène every
                  movement was graceful, but he was not active as she was—an indolent languor hung
                  around him that was indefinably attractive. His eyes were superb; they burned and
                  glittered, and were the only part of his body that did not seem to partake of the
                  careless indifference that appeared to be part and parcel of his nature; he had a
                  steady gaze that was a little tle
                  embarrassing, and would have been impertinent had it not been unconscious. The
                  varying expression of his eyes was no index of his character, however, for they
                  were sometimes grave, then gay, then stern, then irresistibly tender; and I do not
                  believe the master of them ever felt all these changes of feeling, certainly not
                  so often as the eyes expressed them—it would have bored him excessively.
               He had a well-outlined face, a beautiful mouth, and over the upper lip curled the
                  softest brown mustache, which set off finely his superb teeth when he laughed; his
                  head was good, not remarkable in its shape, but gentlemanly looking; his hair was
                  a deep chestnut, that curled in rich masses, and which he had a habit of throwing
                  off from his clear, brown temples in a picturesque style that showed to advantage
                  his well-made hand and graceful gestures; he was so handsome that his very
                  presence was a pleasure. There was something of the quiet concentrated manner of
                  his mother about him; but while it arose in her from a truly elevated mind and
                  character, a habit of looking at things en
                  grand, in him it came from coldness and indolence. He was eminently
                  distinguished looking, although without any air of native nobility about him, even
                  with all his beauty; he was gentle, graceful, and polished; had a winning, musical
                  voice, and a little empressement of manner at
                  times, as if be wished to serve you particularly and no one else, which was very
                  agreeable, even though one might feel right sure that it invariably meant and
                  ended in nothing. He talked well, but if the conversation grew earnest, or
                  conflicted with his feelings, he assumed a steady, calm silence which was very
                  gentlemanly, but which built up straightway a barrier between him and those who
                  loved him, and who would fain be one with him.
               The first time I saw Octave Bouvreuil, his beauty attracted me as beauty always
                  does; his sweet low voice, his gallant, elegant manners delighted me; but I did
                  not from the first moment feel any dependence on him, and it was well I did not,
                  for it would have bored him and disappointed me; and I remember sinking as I sat
                  listening to and looking at him,—when the first novelty of our acquaintance made
                  him display himself agreeably before me, showing off all his fine points,—how
                  miserable any woman would be who loved him, and how thankful I was I had not met
                  him in my own enthusiastic spring season of life.
               He had seen a great deal of what men call "life." From the age of eighteen he had
                  been out in the world as his own master, and he was seven-and-twenty when I came
                  to Peilz. He had been adopted, when very young, by his aunt, Octavie Eperveil, the
                  Principal of the Peilz College, and she had taken every pains she could to both
                  educate and spoil him. She wished him at some time to take charge of her
                  institution, but this was an affair of the future, and for many years he had done
                  little else besides making pleasant but useless preparations for this mythical
                  position. Some winters he spent at Vienna, or Paris, or some of the great
                  continental capitals, under the pretence of studying; but the past year he had
                  been a sort of tutor or traveling companion to a young Englishman of fortune. He
                  knew everything and everybody; was au courant in
                  literature and the fine arts; with a graceful smattering of science; and was the
                  most charming companion, for the mere amusement or occupation of conventional
                  society life, one could imagine. His aunt thought he was exactly what he ought to
                  be, and yet she must have had some misgivings about what the opinions of others
                  might be, for she was constantly saying,—"Octave is so peculiarly fitted by nature
                  and by management for his future position; the chief of an institution like mine
                  does not need profundity of learning, so much as general intelligence, a popular
                  easy manner, and gentlemanly habits and pursuits."
               Well if those were the qualities she required, Octave was just the man for her
                  purpose, as he certainly had, as much as any man I ever knew, what are called out
                  in the world "the habits, requirements, and principles of a gentleman."
               
               And now I come to the last member of the little family, circle of the Bouvreuils,
                  Kinnaird Graham. He was the very opposite in every way of Octave; he could not be
                  called handsome, and yet there was in his appearance all the evidences of that
                  natural nobility of character so wanting in Octave, and which is so much better
                  than mere physical beauty. How true is that distinction which some clever writer
                  has made: "Nobility of appearance arises from the character, and is the work of
                  nature; a distinguished air that of art: one is born with a person, the other is
                  acquired." He was tall, erect, and slender; his head was a fine intellectual one
                  and his face cold and classic in outline as some antique bust; his brow was always
                  slightly knit, and his clear-cut, firm lips a little compressed, which would have
                  made him repelling but for the serene expression of his thoughtful brown eye, and
                  winning sound of his kind voice. His movements and manner were as quiet as
                  Octave's; with one, however, you felt that a total absence of interest, a laissez aller prevailed, a cui
                     bono indifference caused the calmness; with the other, you could
                  almost see every nerve and muscle tightly reined up for action and struggle if
                  necessary. He talked very little, but it was evident his silence proceeded from
                  thought and preoccupation; he was as intelligent as Octave, but in a different
                  way; his knowledge was positive, exact, and proceeded from hard study; Octave's
                  from a natural brightness and an early intercourse with what are called "men of
                  the world."
               From the first moment of my acquaintance with the two young men I commenced
                  drawing a contrast between them, and as years went by and my intercourse with them
                  grew more intimate, this contrast shone out more vividly. As I do not intend to
                  develop either of them gradually by any events in this account of my new life at
                  Peilz, I will conclude here this contrast which I have commenced, and which
                  displayed itself more strongly month by month to me; then in the account I give of
                  their different acts, as connected with my little recital, will be shown only
                  natural effects proceeding from their causes.
               Octave had the reputation of being a brave, generous fellow, and yet I never saw
                  courage, self-denial, or self-sacrifices in his daily acts, although in some
                  emergencies excitement did make him perform startling acts of bravery and
                  generosity, concentrating years in one ebullition, and this produced more effect
                  than if he had hourly given quiet evidences of a truly generous nature; this was
                  the reason why Kinnaird was never talked of by any one; he applied to his daily
                  life, with himself and others, the principles dictated by his noble generous
                  character, without regard to effect, and therefore he produced none. With one,
                  doing right was a question of emotion; with the other, a question of duty—or,
                  rather, no question at all; it seemed a matter of instinct. Octave gained more
                  praise for some trifling but showy act of generosity than Kinnaird did for his
                  constant life of simple duty performance; few noticed his influence; indeed it was
                  only after living with the two, and suffering from the cold selfishness of the
                  one, that you learned to appreciate the unobtrusive excellence of the other, and
                  to feel that he was a truly brave, strong man, on whose unwavering character you
                  could rest as securely as on anything human.
               Kinnaird Graham's youth had been severely disciplined. He had lost father and
                  mother early in life, and had been educated at Institution Eperveil, where he was
                  glad to obtain a sub-tutorship to bear part of the expenses of his education,
                  before fairly through his studies. By dint of severe application, he had
                  surmounted all the obstacles naturally surrounding him, and had risen to the
                  position of a useful and respected assistant professor in the very institution at
                  which he had received his education. All this had resulted from early self-control
                  and his native dignity and reserve of character. He was of English birth and
                  parentage, and had wealthy, proud relatives, it was said; but the relationship was
                  too remote to give him influence; the shaping ing of his future rested on his own good strong
                  energy and industry. He was younger than Octave by some two or three years, and
                  Octave always acted impliedly as if he were still the senior and Kinnaird the
                  junior, although Kinnaird was so far before him in usefulness and actual position.
                  Kinnaird seemed to show a desire to be cordial with Octave, and never evinced any
                  restlessness under the cool gentlemanly air of superiority which Octave affected;
                  but there was little sympathy between the two, as might well be imagined. It was
                  evident that Octave thought himself the finer gentleman of the two; like his aunt,
                  he regarded Kinnaird as a good drudge, or one of his subordinates, and he expected
                  him to possess in detail all the industry and knowledge necessary for his future
                  purposes. When he spoke of him, which was rarely, he called him "a quiet, good
                  sort of fellow, full of tedious text-book knowledge, fitted for his position, but
                  no life, spirit, or taste in him." And yet, of the two, Kinnaird was better fitted
                  than Octave for life's purposes, even for the gay worldly life he and his aunt
                  valued so highly; for though Octave possessed a physical courage that would have
                  led him up unflinchingly before a storming of Sevastopol, he had not, like
                  Kinnaird, a moral courage that would enable him to face and pass unscathed through
                  a life full of fiery temptations.
            
            
               CHAPTER IV.
               THE BIZE.
               OCTAVE BOUVREUIL liked new pleasures, new places, and new people; therefore, a
                  little while after my arrival at Peilz, as I came under the category of the last
                  named of his likes, I was honored with his attentions. He accompanied me daily in
                  my walks; to him I owed my first introduction to Hauteville, a beautiful Swiss
                  estate in the neighborhood of Peilz; to Chatelard and Les Crêtes, rendered famous
                  by Rousseau's charming descriptions in that excessively fâde love story, "La Nouvelle Heloise;" to Blonay, so dear to the
                  lover of Moyen Age legend; and to many a pretty little mountain village and
                  charming point of view.
               He took me also boating, and to him I was indebted for my first hearty fright on
                  the water. We had a habit of going out on the lake at sunset, although constantly
                  counseled not to do so by the worthy professor, on account of the sudden changes
                  of wind which take place on these Swiss lakes at sundown; the bize, a northeast
                  wind, which is very violent, is apt to spring up at nightfall and lash the calm
                  lake into a fury of white-crested waves. But, notwithstanding all these warnings,
                  I had great confidence in my handsome batelier,
                  and though I am a nervous woman, I am not a timid one; then there is a spirit of
                  contradiction in human nature which impels us to brave sometimes a threatened
                  danger, especially when the danger is an attractive one and there are many chances
                  of escape.
               One beautiful afternoon we embarked in great glee, leaving Madame Bouvreuil, Dora,
                  and Beau standing on the Leignitz
                  terrace, watching our departure, for the boat was too small a cockle-shell to hold
                  many passengers; moreover, of the trio Beau was the only one who had any desire to
                  accompany me.
               "I cannot imagine, Octave," said Madame Bouvreuil, as he lifted me with graceful
                  courtesy into the pretty little dancing boat, "why you bring Mademoiselle Fauvette
                  all the way up here to embark; the Merle terrace is nearer and so much more
                  pleasant."
               "Mademoiselle Fauvette does not know the Merles," he answered in a careless
                  manner, as if only half hearing his mother, and replying at random.
               "Nonsense!" said Madame Bouvreuil, laughing. "You know very well that is no
                  reason. Any one of our family can use the Chateau terrace, even for strangers, if
                  we wish. You are growing very ceremonious all at once. But I trust, Mademoiselle
                  Fauvette, that it will not be long before you do know our friends of the Chateau.
                  It is the family of our good pastor, as I have already told you, who live there. I
                  promise myself great pleasure in introducing them to you; they have been absent
                  from Peilz since you came, or you would have met with them long since, as we are,
                  especially when Hélène is at home, almost daily together. They are expected back
                  to-day, are they not, Octave?"
               Octave had been standing as if waiting for his mother to stop talking, looking
                  down on the pebbly shore with that affected air of courteous patience which is
                  neither courtesy nor patience, because so apparent and intended to be annoying. As
                  she addressed this question to him, he shrugged his shoulders saucily, and replied
                  in a cool, half laughing tone, lighting his cigar and puffing it as he spoke,—
               "Upon my word, madam, you should have told me—puff—this morning that you wished
                  some information—puff—puff—about our estimable and worthy pastor's family,
                  then—puff—I could have inquired. I really—puff—cannot inform you;
                  nor—puff—puff—puff—must we delay much longer even to listen to your agreeable
                  conversation;—puff—if we do, we shall miss one of the prettiest sunsets of the
                  season"—puff—puff.
               And his cigar by this time being well lighted, he bowed courteously and jumped
                  lightly into the boat. As he rowed off, she shook her finger in playful menace at
                  him, crying out,—
               "You saucy fellow! Remember, Mademoiselle Fauvette, that is none of my
                  training."
               He made no other reply than at polite inclination of the head, while he rowed
                  rapidly away from the shore. The clouds were beautiful; some hung in brilliant
                  masses around the summits of the mountains, looking in some places like higher
                  peaks; others, agitated by contending currents of air, rolled and folded together
                  like huge masses of rich drapery. The sun shone out brilliantly, and hung its
                  round red orb, swaying as it were, in a fiery flood, over the dim line of the
                  distant Jura; its rays shot out a gorgeous stream of light, bathing the whole
                  landscape in a golden glow; the clouds grew purple and a fiery red, and as they
                  gathered together in superb folds, hanging curtain-like over the mountains in the
                  Rhone valley, I fancied they looked like royal funeral mantles.
               Octave commenced discoursing eloquently, using Goëthe's striking theory relative
                  to clouds, mountains, and air, as if it was his own original idea, for he could
                  appropriate the thoughts of others in the cleverest manner imaginable; and I
                  listened admiringly, without showing that I was aware of the ruse; indeed, his graceful poetical elaboration of the
                  simple theory made it so much his own, that I felt ready to pardon his
                  unacknowledged appropriation of it.
               He called the mountains and clouds great spirits, warring with and striving to
                  conquer each other, and the air a pretended neutral power, but treacherously in
                  league with the mountains, thus giving them the mastery over their
                     cloud-enemies enemies. He dwelt on the
                  "magnificent come and go" of the pulsations of these huge granite heights, their
                  electric weapons, their attractive and repellent strength; he pointed out the
                  cloud summits which hung so solidly over some peaks, and called them conquered
                  mist spirits, held immovable by the relentless mountains until the internal labors
                  should be completed for their final destruction. Other mountains were still at war
                  with their cloud enemies, and the rolling, and, flying, and changing about of the
                  huge masses of vapor, told of the combat going on which would inevitably terminate
                  in a complete rout and destruction of the misty warriors, for the electric forces
                  of the mountains would make them fall, Beelzebub-like, in rains, fogs, and
                  whirlwinds, as mortals call them, each terrific explosion containing huge rebel
                  giants; and after the destructive rout and defeat, the treacherous elastic air
                  would spread itself invisibly around and devour the remains of the vaporous
                  host.
               All this he told in glowing words, with his rhapsodical brilliant manner, of which
                  my poor resumé gives but a bleak idea, I am
                  sure. Then he directed my attention to the thin cloud which hung, as it so often
                  did, mantle-like around Dent de Jaman. We observed with earnest gaze its
                  evolutions and changes. We could see it devoured, as it were, by some invisible
                  power: the last rays of the setting sun rested on it; it grew purple and golden;
                  its edges detached themselves and mounted up to the mountain peak in fine, light,
                  fiery threads, looking like the ribbons drawn from the mouth of a sorcerer, or the
                  slender thread of flax spun off from a swift-revolving distaff. At last the whole
                  brilliant vapor disappeared under the mysterious influence of this unseen
                  air-enemy. As the last fiery thread hung its raveled end over the mountain peak, I
                  turned toward the west to look at the clouds hanging above the sun and saw a long
                  black spiral cloud ascending into the sky from the port of V., which was to the
                  west of us. We were always cautious not to embark in our little boat until after
                  all the lake steamers had passed, but this cloud told plainly that we were near
                  one, unfortunately.
               "Mr. Octave," I said, "surely there is a steamer at V."
               I had to repeat my remark twice before he heard me, he was so engrossed in
                  watching the beautiful cloud-weaving in the unseen hands of the invisible mountain
                  spinner.
               "Mille pardons," he cried, starting as I touched his shoulder and pointed to the
                  ascending smoke. "By Jove!" he exclaimed, as the little steamer swept out of the
                  port of V., "that is the Hirondelle, as I live! I thought I saw it pass when we
                  were in the garden an hour since drinking our coffee."
               "No, I remember well that was the 'Rhone,'" I said.
               "Eh bien," he replied, with a cool shrug of the shoulders, as he seized the oars.
                  "You must summon up all your courage, for I shall have to row you further out into
                  the lake, for I cannot possibly reach the shore against this wind."
               For while we had been watching the beautiful cloud-changes, we had left unnoticed
                  the springing up of the bize. A few vigorous strokes of the oars carried us out of
                  the line of the steamer, which came puffing by us a few moments after, so close
                  that she threw over us a shower of the sparkling raindrops made by the sharp cut
                  of her prow, and we danced merrily up and down in the swell she left in her wake.
                  Octave looked frowningly up at the sky; and, after the rocking of the waves had
                  subsided a little, he seized the oars with more eagerness than I had ever seen him
                  show in anything. The bize was fairly upon us, and the waves mounted around, in
                  great rage, threatening every instant to ingulf us.
               He rowed with intense energy, large drops of sweat stood on his forehead, the
                  veins in his neck and on his temples looked like whipcords, while his nostrils
                  dilated and his eyes gleamed fiercely—it was the expression of a superb animal
                  goaded on by the presence of danger. I remained perfectly silent, and there swept up before my
                  memory vivid recollections of the different times in the past when I had foolishly
                  trusted myself with daring male friends behind their fast trotters, and I tried to
                  imagine we were in no more danger than I had been then. A grand white-crested wave
                  burst over us. Octave rested his oars and panted fiercely. He looked at me
                  earnestly: there was no expression of fear or cowardice in his face; it was an
                  inquiring look, to see if I was a screaming or fainting woman. I returned his look
                  as calmly as possible. I knew that was no time to weaken or discourage him by
                  showing any of the fears I felt.
               "It is impossible," he said, "to row against such a sea." And his words came out
                  low and hissing between his set teeth, sounding like drops of hail on a hot
                  furnace. "Could you light me a cigar?" he asked, after a few moments of silence,
                  for he did not dare loose his hold on the oars.
               I took out of the breast pocket of his gray paletot a cigar and match-box, struck
                  a light with hands that I could not keep from trembling, and, putting a cigar in
                  his mouth, I lighted it. He puffed it as coolly almost as he did the one a half
                  hour before on the Leignitz shore, and sat holding on to the oars while the waves
                  dashed relentlessly around us. As long as there had been a hope of reaching the
                  shore, he had struggled bravely; now that hope was gone, his excitement was over,
                  and he looked as calm and indifferent as usual, puffing his cigar, and gazing
                  steadily out on the waves and sky; the only show of emotion he displayed was in
                  the elongation of his eyelids, through which the brilliant eye glittered
                  curiously.
               When I had first discovered the steamer, I had taken out my watch to see what time
                  it was, and had forgotten to replace it, holding it in my hand mechanically, even
                  while I lighted the cigar. I became suddenly conscious of having it, and touched
                  the spring of the cover to see the hour,—as if human time was of any consequence
                  to me! This thought rushed over me, and with such force that for an instant I
                  could not distinguish the marks on the dial-plate; at last they stood out dimly,
                  and I saw the hands pointing to twenty minutes past seven, but only as one sees in
                  a dream. I remember closing the watch and putting it quietly up. Then I unclasped
                  a little garnet rosary from my wrist, and commenced slipping the grains through my
                  fingers, endeavoring, by a repetition of the familiar prayers, to rouse my stunned
                  thoughts. Were they prayers, those words that fell mechanically from my lips?
                  Already my body and soul seemed separated, for the simple, comprehensive Lord's
                  Prayer, the beautiful Angelical Salutation, and the child-like, touching appeal of
                  St. Bernard, passed from my mouth, but did not bear sense or meaning to my
                  soul.
               My mind was filled with thick thronging memories of friends far from me. I looked
                  appealingly up into the gray clouds that swept to and fro in fierce combat, and
                  seemed to see their faces dimly gazing down on me, those who loved me, and those
                  over whom I had poured the full libation of my own love without sharing even "the
                  wild-berry wine" of their hearts in return. Ah! why did their faces come there at
                  such an awful moment! I had no time for them. My thoughts should be with the
                  fast-approaching solemn future, not with the bitter unavailing past; and yet that
                  keen, burning sorrow of loving longing filled my heart and brain, and I sighed out
                  my lifeless prayers with agony. Just to see them in the flesh one instant; before
                  all should be over, to meet them spirit to spirit; but for the space of a breath,
                  and in that last moment of life, surely might be understood the great intensity
                  and truth of the love I had felt for them. On went the prayers, and this hot tide
                  of mortal yearning toward earthly things rushed rudely by the side of the holy
                  current.
               While this acute human pain was pulsating within me, and darkening with noisy
                  agitation the moments that should have been still and resigned, the wind tossed
                  the dense clouds aside, sweeping away all these loved but torturing faces, and there seemed to rise in the pale light
                  two other forms over whose graves I had shed the bitterest tears that can be shed
                  by a mortal—tears not of sorrow for them but for myself; then for the first time
                  the words of my prayers reached my soul. I grew quiet and still. I felt strangely
                  detached from earthly ties, and thought only of those toward whom I seemed to be
                  fast speeding. All these emotions passed through my mind much more rapidly than
                  any words can express them.
               Suddenly I heard a dull, rushing, sound. I knew it the instant I heard its muffled
                  plash; it was the tourbillon of the Rhone
                  torrent! Then I became conscious of Octave's presence, for while 
                     
                        "voyaging through those strange seas of thought alone"
                     
                   he had faded quite out of not only my thoughts, but even my physical sight.
                  He leaned forward to put the oars in my hands, sprung to his feet, and unfurled
                  the little sail. I thought he was mad, for I had not noticed that the wind which
                  had swept aside my torturing spirit faces was a wind from G., a favorable one for
                  us, and that the bize had passed over. While he was unfurling the sail a second
                  and a third wave dashed in on us; it was a dangerous expedient, for a sudden gust
                  of the capricious wind might easily upset us, but it was his only resource, as the
                  current was growing, stronger and stronger, and in a few moments we would have
                  been inevitably dragged into the tourbillon of
                  the Bouches du Rhone. I fancy Octave had little hope, and felt that he would
                  rather go over in a struggle than wait calmly for death. But the sail saved us; so
                  soon as it was up the little boat scudded over the bounding waves along with the
                  wind, light as a soaring bird.
               Octave's eyes glistened like those of a snake; he gazed earnestly forward; one
                  hand grasped firmly the sail rope with such a strong gripe that I saw little drops
                  of blood oozing out from the grasp, for the sail, filled with the wind, buried the
                  cord deep into the flesh of his hand, and the other hand managed the rudder. We
                  were only a few minutes in this mad rush for life, but it seemed hours; and in a
                  little while we were able to land about seven or eight miles above Peilz. My
                  companion sprang on the shore as soon as the well-directed boat rattled up on the
                  pebbles of the beach.
               "Ha! ha!" he shouted out in a fierce exulting laugh; "we've gained the day!"
               Some boatmen ran up to us and dragged in the boat while he handed or half lifted
                  me out, for I was trembling and very weak. He laughed with thoughtless boyish
                  merriment at me.
               "Courage, courage!" he cried; "now is not the time to give up after holding out so
                  bravely through all the danger. Here, drink this." And pouring into the little
                  goblet-shaped top of his pocket flask some wine, he made me swallow several times
                  some of that "valor-giving drink, good Sherris sack." After I had revived a
                  little, he said: "Now if you will take my advice, you will walk from here to
                  Peilz; it will help you over your excitement and save you from being ill."
               I knew he was right, and unpalatable as was the wise counsel, I took his offered
                  arm and tottered along the lake road, gaining strength as I advanced.
               "Do you think you could light me another cigar?" he asked, some time after we had
                  started; "for this hand of mine is too lame to help me to such a luxury."
               Lame it was, indeed, and it took both of our kerchiefs and my hat vail to stanch
                  the blood. After wrapping it up, and making of his broad black neck-ribbon a sling
                  in which he rested the lacerated band, I lighted his cigar, while he laughingly
                  recalled the solemn lighting of the "funeral torch," as he named it; and then he
                  described, with graphic but sarcastic humor, my absurd holding on to the watch, "clutching fast to old Father Time," he
                  said, and the still, quiet whiteness of my face, and steady, unflinching gaze with
                  which I had met his look in that fearful moment.
               "I felt certain," he added, "that you were going to die game, especially when I
                  saw you timing our run-away gait to eternity; and I can assure you it was my
                  greatest consolation, for it would have bored me excessively to have had my last
                  moments disturbed by feminine shrieks and faints."
               I could not enjoy his gayety. I felt too solemn to appreciate even the most
                  exquisite and brilliant humor. I had so lately stood face to face as it were with 
                     
                        "the pale-fronted images of my own true dead,"
                     
                   that the chill damps of the grave seemed still hanging around me. I longed
                  for the warm caressing touch of a loving human; and kept pace willingly with the
                  swift, light tread of my companion, looking earnestly forward to the end of our
                  journey, while he rattled on with unusual excitement; for the near approach of
                  death, and his sudden escape from it, seemed to have intoxicated him, and his
                  words mounted up like the sparkling beads of foam on a champagne goblet.
               The clouds had floated off, and the stars shone out on a sky that looked like
                  steel. The Peilz lights glimmered as we descended the road by Maison Monnet, and I
                  hailed them with more gratitude than I had ever felt before at their sight. At
                  last my trembling feet reached our door, and on the inside steps of the entrance
                  we met Madame Bouvreuil. Luckily the professor was absent, therefore no one had
                  known of our real danger. Madame Bouvreuil had felt anxious about us, but had
                  concluded that Octave had rowed up the lake to another landing, at the
                  commencement of the bize, and was waiting for a change of wind to return. We had
                  agreed to say nothing of the real state of the case, therefore I pleaded fatigue,
                  and went immediately to my apartments, leaving Octave to take tea alone with his
                  mother.
               How glad I was to reach my rooms, to hear Beau's frantic cries, see his bounding
                  leaps, by which he testified his joy at my return, and be able to look again on
                  Dora's honest, good face! But still the heavy, stunned feelings hung over me. I
                  sat by the open window in silence, and felt as one does when awakened from a
                  terrible nightmare; the familiar objects of furniture and books seemed almost
                  strange; I looked at Dora while she prepared the evening meal, and poured the hot
                  water from the steaming little urn on to the tea whose fragrant vapor filled the
                  air, as if I had never seen her do it before. I ate, almost without tasting, the
                  delicious anana strawberries and cream, and fed Beau with sponge-cake listlessly,
                  and listened to the plashing swell of the naughty lake, as its beautiful waves
                  rose and fell and rippled playfully on the pebbly beach; then I gazed out on the
                  starry heavens that peeped in like little consoling angel heads between the
                  branches of the large Marron d'Inde under my window, and wondered that my
                  gratitude for my strange relief from danger was not more lively. But there was no
                  bounding chord within me to sound; I was unstrung and voiceless.
               While trying to rouse myself, a delicious melody came floating on the air from a
                  brilliant-toned piano in the distance, a snatch of some Sclavic modulation, so
                  peculiar in its rhythm and melody, filled with fantastical wildness, and a
                  capricious mingling of sadness and gayety. Then there was a wandering over the
                  keys, detached chords leading to curious weird resolutions, as if vague thoughts
                  or the conversation of some one broke in upon the instrumentalist. Then, tenderly
                  stealing on the ear, rose up softly that delicious nocturne of Chopin, in Re
                  bemol, which floated and soared like a graceful vapor filled with volcanic heat,
                  and tinged with a dorée violet hue. It darted to
                  and fro like the reflected beam of the young crescent moon on the waves of a
                  southern sea, breaking into golden sparkles or flashing with phosphoric light
                  across the waters.
               I drew Beau close to me, and let him sleep in my arms, while my cheek rested on his soft silky coat, and I
                  gave myself up to the delicious reveries suggested by this exquisite music.
                  Memories of beautiful creations in painting, poetry, and sculpture came before me,
                  blended with the charms of the flower, cloud, and ocean realm of nature. The
                  executant at one time appeared to trace capricious arabesques; then Shelley's
                  exquisite versification seemed to be attained; a new harmonic formation followed,
                  and there lay mirrored in the glassy flood of the melody the svelte form of that half angel, half woman creation,
                  Angelini's Eve, sitting in graceful questioning reverie, meditating over the first
                  sin. With flying rapid runs and trills, introduced by the instrumentalist, the
                  music passed over curious modulations, suspensions that were like pleading
                  justifications of some coming event, and sad, solemn, anticipated tones, followed
                  by a descent of notes, all sounding
               
                  
                     "As if the soul of melody were pent
                     Within some unseen instrument
                     Hung in a viewless tower of air,
                     And with enchanted pipes beguiled its own despair."*
                     
                  
               
               
                  *Read's "Realm of Dreams."
               The instrumentalist then floated off into that other realm of feeling belonging to
                  the soul, in which sensuous emblems were no longer suggested; there was not the
                  chaste and gracious form of the Italian sculptor's Eve to be seen, but the
                  pulsating music unvailed the heart of that same Eve, innocent still though fallen,
                  throbbing with anxiety, anguish, and fear; the sad secret of love once known, her
                  peace forever gone.
               All this may seem fanciful, but so that music sounded to me on that still, solemn
                  August night. How intensely sad grew the fantastic melodies! One passage after
                  another of that weird master followed, each wedded to the other with a poesy of
                  feeling and expression as correct as it was effective. There were fears, and sad
                  presentiments, and devouring jealousy, and inconsolable sadness, passing like
                  shadows over the stream of harmony, as the invisible fingers swayed to and fro,
                  holding chords with magnetic power, in which predominated "those mournful black
                  keys." Gradually the flame of triste melody grew
                  fainter: it languished. Suddenly, like a dying lamp, it shot up a vivid brilliant
                  light; then abruptly ceased, as the hands seemed to throw off into air a keen,
                  sharp high chord.
               I drew a long delicious breath; the music had dissolved the icy death-damps which
                  had seemed to envelop my whole being, and I lived again. The silence continued for
                  some time broken only by the ripple of the lake waves and the rustle of the sweet
                  west wind through the leaves of a young acacia-tree that stood near the rail of
                  the balcony on which I was leaning, when again the music began. This time it was
                  of a different genre. A brilliant symphony poured out like a rich flood of wine;
                  then came the richer flow of a fine manly baritone voice in a spirited passage
                  from Il Bravo. The accompaniment was crisp and clear, and told well against the
                  voice and melody in its reiterated martellements.
               
               "The Merles have come back," said Madame Bouvreuil, entering my room just at that
                  moment to bid me good night and inquire how I felt after my fatiguing walk; "and
                  that is Octave singing with Marie."
               "Surely," I cried, "it is impossible that a woman's touch can produce such music
                  as I have just heard."
               "Oh yes!" she replied, "it is Marie you have heard; she executes wonderfully well.
                  She will be a great source of pleasure to you; she is such a clever girl, and good
                  too; I am sure you will love her. She is totally different from my Hélène,
                  although both are darling girls in their way. Sometimes I fancy I love Marie as
                  well as if she were really my daughter, which I wish she was, she added, laughing.
                  "If she and Octave would stop their quarrels and settle down into quiet affianced
                  lovers, like Kinnaird and Hélène, I
                  should be much easier in my mind about Octave's future happiness."
               "Then Mr. Graham and Hélène are betrothed?" I asked.
               "Pas du tout, as Germans understand it; that is,
                  we have had no regular betrothal; my sister-in-law would have to be consulted, and
                  my husband does not like to undertake such a difficulty. Madame Eperveil, though a
                  good-hearted, excellent woman, is an odd one; she loves to make a little teazing
                  opposition by way of showing her authority, and in a case like this she might take
                  the fancy of giving trouble, so we have concluded to let the affair rest until
                  Kinnaird should have some independent situation offered him; then, when they are
                  all ready to get married, opposition will be useless. They are sincerely attached,
                  have known each other from infancy, and Kinnaird is an excellent young man, in
                  every way calculated to make Hélène happy."
               "And Mr. Octave and Mademoiselle Merle?" I inquired, as the glorious full finale
                  of the Bravo passage swelled out, and voice and accompaniment rode boundingly on
                  the air together, filling the ear with sounds as brilliant
               
                  
                     "as meteors fleet,
                     Struck from the invisible feet
                     Of Night's wild coursers."
                  
               
               "Oh!" said Madame, smiling, "they have been quarreling and making up since
                  childhood. We cannot any of us tell how that affair will end. They parted in a
                  ferocious pet some weeks ago, but I fancy separation has done them both good, and
                  they have made up their difficulty, as I hear him singing there."
               "Is Mademoiselle Merle a capricious lady love?"
               "Not in the least. She is a straightforward, earnest girl, full of enthusiasm and
                  deep feeling; she is Octave's equal in mind, very brilliant as well as good, and
                  for that reason would have more influence over him than a woman of weaker mental
                  parts, for she will hold him by the intelligence as well as by the heart."
               Dear Madame Bouvreuil! She who was so just in everything else was showing herself
                  unjust on this subject. While talking of Hélène and Kinnaird, she had dwelt only
                  on Kinnaird being calculated to make Hélène happy; but when speaking of Octave, it
                  was Marie upon whom she placed the burden of responsibility.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER V.
               MY NOVEL.
               THE following day Octave was summoned to Berlin, to meet his aunt and sister, in
                  order to accompany them home, and we all persuaded Madame Bouvreuil to go with
                  him; thus the professor and I were left quite alone, for Kinnaird Graham had been
                  absent for some days, with a detachment of boys from Institution Eperveil, on a
                  most interesting pedestrian excursion in the Savoy Alps, to visit there a little
                  Catholic village, which is so overshadowed by the mountains towering around, that
                  the sun shines on its streets but one day in the year. Every season there was a
                  party of the students, especially among the new-comers, who felt a natural
                  curiosity to visit the village on that day, in order to be present at the
                  rejoicing fête celebrated by the paysans over
                  this angel visit of God's blessed sunlight, and this year it had fallen to
                  Kinnaird's lot to guide and manage the little party.
               Left thus to myself, a positive fit of industry took possession of me. I ordered
                  my own time and Dora's, and I fancy I would have made Beau work also if I could. I
                  laid down rules of occupation in the most tiresome manner. What monuments of
                  learning and goodness there would be in this world, if persons ever once adhered
                  to the rules their exacting minds and consciences at certain seasons devise! But,
                  alas! like poor Sheridan, they not only content themselves with making the
                  discovery that their aim is too high for poor mortal strength, but frame an excuse
                  from that for falling far short of it.
               By way of keeping myself to regular work, I resumed the daily lessons I had
                  commenced taking soon after my arrival, in Italian and German, of Professor
                  Bouvreuil. This was a delightful occupation, for my preceptor was a most pleasant
                  teacher; he was thoroughly grounded in the genius and construction of modern
                  languages; and then, his memory was so full of history and biography, in short, of
                  every subject connected with mental pursuits, that to study with him was like
                  opening the flow of a sparkling stream over a dry land; the current of learning
                  poured out generously, beneficently enriching the minds over which it flowed.
               His own tongue being French, of course all my studies were made in it, and this
                  led to a critical examination of my knowledge of this language, which I had kept
                  up for many years, more by reading than study or conversation. He suggested the
                  making of compositions on various subjects, in order to give me a better command
                  of its construction, and I soon became interested in the study of idioms and the
                  curious formation of vernacular phrases, and had all sorts of out-of-the-way
                  works, on the genius of the language, supplied to me by my master: such as Charles
                  Nodier's clever sarcastic dictionary, which afforded me as much amusement by its
                  cutting, ironical ridicule of the French Academy, as it did information by its,
                  scholarly analysis of the sparkling language, of which this author's own beautiful
                  prose is such an ornament and model.
               But I could not confine myself entirely to study. I found I needed some other
                  pursuit to give me relaxation. In former times music would have been my comfort,
                  but in the state of mind and feeling I was in then, it tortured instead of
                  relieving me, and brought on melancholy morbid thoughts, which unfitted me for
                  study or any healthy mental pursuit. Reading proved a great resource; and, as I
                  was beginning to command the literature of three languages besides my own, I ought
                  to have found sufficient relaxation in enjoying the creations of others; but the
                  books would fall from my hands, and
                  thought grow busy in following out my own speculations and creations. If I read a
                  psychological autobiography or romance, it would set me to analyzing my own mind,
                  and to peering down with curious scrutiny into recesses and depths I had never
                  sounded before. Recklessly I would unfold and examine the most delicate petal of
                  feeling, no matter how scarlet might be the tinge of suffering caused by the
                  relentless inquiry, and I often found myself dwelling on acts and mistakes of the
                  past over which I had had no control, and condemning, with morbid restlessness,
                  innocent causes from which had proceeded sad effects.
               One day, while occupied in framing different results and imaginary scenes,
                  producing happiness that had never existed, I exclaimed to myself, "I will write a
                  novel!" I fancied that I felt a pressing necessity to express all these imaginary
                  conclusions for my own mental satisfaction; and yet, when I strove to render into
                  words my idea of a fiction, it remained unexpressed. The harmonies and chords were
                  there in my mind and memory, but the resolving into melodic form would not come. I
                  had had experience enough to have supplied sufficient incident for the most
                  startling fiction. I had felt passionate emotions, and had seen their effects. It
                  seemed as if my mind and memory were just ready to produce fruit; but some
                  powerful influence worked against me and deprived my productions of originality,
                  under whatever form I represented them. And this was the cause: there was a
                  burning tide of overflowing feelings struggling to find vent; but passion, even
                  tenderness, every warm emotion that enriches and beautifies a narrative or
                  creation, especially a woman's, lay stunned and lifeless from the experience of
                  the past.
               After various fruitless efforts, I gave up the attempt discouraged, and concluded
                  I had not the disposition or capability to find comfort by throwing my own
                  experience into verse or prose or imaginary heroes and heroines. I should have
                  been happier, may be, if I could, but I could not. I often read "Jane Eyre" and
                  "Aurora Leigh," and sighed, as I wished to possess gifts like the two marvelous
                  women who have created those two fine artistic narratives; and then, when sad at
                  the thought of my inefficiency, my inability to relieve my pulsing, throbbing
                  brain, I would read "Leila," and thank Heaven that I could not express the bitter
                  tide of resentment at injustice as that other great woman has done— 
                     
                        "That large-brained woman, and large-hearted man—
                        True genius, but true woman,"
                     
                   whose writings show so plainly what Mrs. Browning calls 
                     
                        "the wind-exposed distorted tree
                        Blown against forever by the curse
                        Which breathes through nature. Oh, the world is weak!
                        The effluence of each is false to all:
                        And what we best conceive we fail to speak."
                     
                   But, in order to gratify this impelling desire for mental creation, I turned
                  from imaginary beings and scenes to history, to give me characters and events on
                  which I could bring my imagination and experience to bear, and I hoped, by
                  speaking through them, to avoid the personality that wounded me. I searched out my
                  favorite characters. There they all stood before me, clothed by my fancy and
                  memory in correct costume, exact in detail; but whenever I endeavored to use them,
                  it was like taking the lifeless stone effigies over their monuments. I could not
                  put life and breath into them; and yet, so many of them had heart-warm incidents
                  in their histories which connected them closely with my sympathies.
               The half-told romance of the gay, beautiful widow, Joanna of England, and her
                  cousin, the Black Prince; the vain, frivolous, but fascinating Marguerite of
                  Navarre, and her impetuous lover, the unfortunate Constable de Bourbon, who threw
                  away, his love on a heartless woman and his honor and fame to gratify his temper; Mary Tudor of England,
                  and her deep abiding love for her cold husband, Philip of Spain; and, blended with
                  this narrative, could be woven the silvery gleaming thread of calmer romance, the
                  friendship so tender that it was almost love felt for her by her cousin, that
                  pure, great man, Cardinal Pole; Mary of Scots and Bothwell, and host of these
                  sweet love stories which touch a woman's heart the quickest, passed a leisurely
                  examination in my mind.
               Then swept up before me women nearer my regard, Anne Clifford, Countess of Derby,
                  and her beautiful mother, that Countess of Cumberland whose virtues and charms,
                  disregarded by a neglectful husband, were commemorated in "deathless verse" by the
                  poet Daniel, who loved her with a reverential love such as one feels for gentle,
                  beautiful saints. To merit such pure love and win such immortality as was bestowed
                  on her in that exquisite "Epistle" of the poet's, in which the sublimest lessons
                  of resignation and noble disregard of human injustice are taught, a woman might be
                  willing to suffer sorrow. What proud consolation should have thrilled her high,
                  chaste heart, as she read—
               
                  
                     "I see you labor all you can
                     To plant your heart and set your thoughts as near
                     His glorious mansions as your powers can bear,
                     Which, madam, are so fondly fashioned
                     By that clear judgment; that hath carried you
                     Beyond the feeble limits of your kind—
                     As they can stand against the strongest head
                     Passion can make; inured to any hue
                     The world can cast, that cannot cast that mind
                     Out of her form of goodness; that doth see
                     Both what the best and worst of earth can be."
                  
               
               Many hours of sweet pondering I gave to this charming mother and daughter; then
                  passed on to another one of my favorite characters in history, Marguerite of
                  Austria, daughter ter of the lovely Mary of Burgundy, and she became my chosen
                  heroine, because I fancied I could find more material to work with in her own
                  life, as connected with history, which would save me from drawing on my own
                  experience or imagination for incidents. I searched out a neat little blank-book,
                  given me for a journal by a friend, and which had a nice clasp lock; in it I began
                  my wondrous tale. What laudable industry I evinced in that commencement! I wrote
                  the title and motto on the first page, taking her famous mot or device for the motto,—
               
                  
                     "Fortune, infortune, une forte une."
                     "In fortune or misfortune there shall be one woman strong of heart."
                  
               
               Then I collected, on the first pages of the neat industrious-looking book, all
                  that my memory could tell me of her life,—little incidents that proved her
                  intelligence and happy disposition, her merry spirituelle
                     mots in her girlhood, when she was sent wandering about from one
                  European court to another in search of a husband,—"she did not wonder that fruit
                  should not ripen on a year when monarchs forgot their oaths and troth-plights." I
                  talked to the worthy professor about that epoch of history connected with her
                  life, and took down notes from his conversation. I hunted up books on costume, not
                  many to be found unfortunately in Peilz; then—I stood still. My materials were all
                  collected; but my first chapter was a dead failure. I wished it to be striking and
                  vivid; it did not possess the least originality or life. How I envied James his
                  possession of Wouvermann's white horses! Two young cavaliers "pricking along the
                  grassy road," or even one, would have helped me amazingly.
               At last I hit upon what I imagined fondly was a capital idea: I opened with her
                  shipwreck voyage to Spain. I gave as spirited a descriptions as possible of her
                  calm, philosophical preparation for drowning; the quiet wit of her epitaph, which
                  she wrote and fastened to the folds of her robe,—
                  
                     
                        "Ce gist Margot, la gente demoiselle,
                        Qui ha deux maris, et s'y mourt pucelle."
                        "Here lies Margret, the young gentlewoman who had two husbands, and yet
                           died a maid."
                     
                   I was fairly launched; such a relief! I described her landing, her marriage,
                  her boy-husband, and his mother Isabella of Spain, the loving wife who, with all
                  her tenderness for her selfish husband, had the power, so seldom possessed by a
                  loving woman, of preserving her personal independence. Then the sudden death of
                  the young bridegroom, and the return of the girl-widow to her Austrian home, I
                  dwelt on. To be sure, with all the aid that history gave, I had to admit that my
                  first chapters were dull. However, I comforted myself with the thought that it was
                  a historical novel, and that it did not comport with the dignity of such a fiction
                  to be gaudy and brilliant in commencement; it should advance leisurely and with
                  repose; it would be impertinent in the first chapters of such a book to go
                  trotting off familiarly like any common story. Ah, that blessed gift of
                  self-esteem! What a soothing comfort it is; what a fine atmosphere it creates
                  around us; in it we float and soar, and, no matter what others may say or think,
                  we are content, for it finds excuses for everything, softens down each defect!
               "And every author must possess it," I said one day to myself, apologetically, as I
                  found myself indulging rather too conceitedly in excusing praise over my novel,
                  "or how else should one ever have the courage to publish a book?"
            
            
               CHAPTER VI.
               NEW ACQUAINTANCES.
               TIRED out with close application, and feeling a little dull in "Margaret of
                  Austria," the August weather also growing too oppressive for any kind of mental
                  exertion, I spent a great deal of time in the open air and woods. I now
                  appreciated the advantage of Octave's assistance, given me the first weeks of my
                  arrival, by which I had obtained pleasant places to visit. Hauteville and Les
                  Crêtes were my favorite resorts; and often Dora, Beau, and I would leave our house
                  in Peilz at early morning, with an India basket of two compartments, containing in
                  one food for the mind, and in the other the quite as needful food for the body,
                  and in some part of these beautiful places stay until nightfall.
               Hauteville is situated on the side of Mount Pleiades, on the road to old Blonay.
                  It is not a very spacious estate, nor is the chateau remarkable for any
                  architectural beauty; but the situation, which is very fine, gives it some
                  invaluable landscape points of beauty. The park is the grand feature of the place,
                  and it would be difficult to find a more lovely spot: long avenues of trees; a
                  mountain torrent gliding peacefully through one part and breaking out into a wild
                  cascade in another; hills and slopes and elevations, and openings from which can
                  be seen one of the most beautiful views in the world, for they command the sight
                  on the west and south of the rugged Savoy Alps, Dents du Midi, and the mountains
                  of the Rhone valley, with the more riante
                  Vaudois, spreading out its richly-cultivated terraces of vineyards, on the east
                  and north; there is the whole grand view
                  from Mount Velan to Jura and Peilz, and the lake shore, dotted with nestling
                  villages beneath, like a living border to the blue waters.
               Then Les Crêtes, the famous "Bosquet de Julie," was another one of the places I
                  loved to visit. This is a little cluster of hills nearer the lake shore farther
                  east, and over-hanging the fine lake road, with winding hilly walks, covered with
                  a superb bosquet of chestnut trees. Some of the old trees are still standing, and
                  I often thought of the sad, wild enthusiast Rousseau, while sitting under their
                  shade, and fancied I could see him coming there at early morning when he had risen
                  from solemn, feverish dreams, 
                     
                        "Which, like winged winds, had borne
                        To that silent isle, which lies
                        'Mid remembered agonies—
                        The frail bark of his lone being,
                        And its ancient pilot, Pain,
                        Close beside the helm again."
                     
                   Here he must have sat and gazed over the beautiful expanse spread out before
                  him of mountain, forest, and wave, and drank in draughts of inspiration as be
                  dwelt over the resolving harmonies of his fiction, and tried to picture forth "one
                  green isle in his deep, wide sea of misery." Surely if any place in nature could
                  give soothing thoughts to this "self-torturing sophist—whose minor triads in
                  romance would modulate from minor to minor, instead of following natural rules and
                  rising into a clearer, higher key—Les Crêtes was well calculated for this gracious
                  service; for
               
                  
                     "There was soft sunshine, and the sound
                     Of old forests, echoing round,
                     And the light and smell divine
                     Of all flowers that breathe and shine."
                  
               
               Above hung Chatelard, whose very name seems fraught with poetic loveliness; and it
                  is as beautiful as the dreams of the most imaginative poet could make it. One
                  afternoon, Dora and I, after spending the day at Les Crêtes, wandered up the
                  beautiful, well-made road to this fine old chateau. It is much larger and more
                  imposing near to than when seen from the lake road. It consists of one grand
                  square tower, and was built in 1441, by a certain Jacques de Guinguin, on the
                  ruins of an ancient tower called "Castellum Arduum." It is on the very summit of a
                  hill three hundred and seventy feet above the lake, and this hill is covered with
                  terraced vineyards from summit to base.
               We entered the large, old court-yard gate, and passed out down into the marrow
                  terrace walk which winds around at the foot of the castle on the side opposite the
                  lake, and which is a species of hanging garden, as it were, having espaliers, fig,
                  and apricot trees trained up against the courtyard walls, and rose vines,
                  intermingled with other sweet climbing plants, covering the stone-border wall
                  which forms its division from the first vineyard beneath. Pots of brilliant
                  exotics were ranged along the walk, and luxuriant réséda vied with verveine to
                  fill the air with sweet odors. The view from this narrow walk was charming. Below
                  us lay spread out vineyard after vineyard, lying in terraces one below the other,
                  filled with golden fruit ripening in the August sun; then came Tavel and Clarens,
                  and then the glassy glittering lake. The sun was just setting behind Jura, sending
                  up its flame-like rays above the horizon, gilding with a red light clouds and
                  mountains; just above the Rhone valley hung a young harvest moon, with its
                  attendant star; a variety of shades floated over the landscape, and an opal-like
                  glory seemed to hang above, beneath, and around us.
               As I stood, lost in contemplation of this rapturous scene, I heard, with some
                  vexation, voices near me, and thinking they might be some of the residents of the
                  chateau, to whom I was a stranger, I turned to leave the place, and met, face to
                  face, two ladies. I bowed, and prepared to pass them, when the elder one of the two said: "Pray do not
                  let us disturb you; we have come here purposely to meet you; we have called
                  frequently on you at Professor Bouvreuil's but you have been engaged or out every
                  time, and this afternoon when we called again the professor told us we might find
                  you at Les Crêtes or here, and as we intended taking this walk we concluded, if we
                  should be so fortunate as to encounter you during our promenade, we would take the
                  liberty of presenting ourselves, as we really wish to contribute what little we
                  can toward making your new home in Peilz pleasant to you. I am Cecile Merle, and
                  this is my niece, Marie. I am sure you have heard the Bouvreuils talk of us enough
                  to feel half acquainted with us; so pray let us lay aside ceremony, and forget
                  that we have not known each other always."
               She said this in a sweet, languid, lingering voice, and extended both her hands to
                  me with a frank courtesy, as sincere and warm as her words. She was a woman of mid
                  age, neither handsome nor ugly, but very pleasant looking, tall, slight, and fair;
                  everything about her bespoke a kindly, gentle disposition. She spoke French in the
                  slowest Swiss style, but being a great purist in her languages this peculiarity
                  took away all the paysanne sound, and gave more
                  music to her words than if she had used the quick, sharp, hailstone accent of the
                  Parisians, so much affected by the well-educated Swiss. She was the only and
                  maiden sister of Mr. Merle, the pastor of the Peilz Constitutional Church, and had
                  been his companion from their orphan childhood, and his house-keeper and a second
                  mother to his only child from the time of the early death of his wife, which had
                  taken place in the second year of their marriage. Everybody loved "Tante Cecile,"
                  for this was the name every one gave her, she was so gentle, loving, and
                  indulgent.
               Of course, after so frank an introduction, no gêne could exist, and in a few minutes we were all three leaning
                  over the parapet wall admiring together the sunset. Soon after, Dora, who had been
                  around the corner of the castle, gathering some yellow acacia leaves, came up with
                  Beau, and I introduced this very prominent member of my little domestic trio to my
                  new friends. He barked most insolently at them, and received their 
                     proferred
                     proffered
                   courtesies and caresses with gruff growls in his usual uncivil manner,
                  and Marie told him he needed all his beauty to make him endurable.
               While she stooped to examine his various fine points, to which Dora with partial
                  pride always directed the attention of strangers—the long, black, silky ears with
                  fiery tan lining, the rich tan spots over the large melancholy brown eyes, and the
                  finely-formed muzzle and silky tan-colored fringe to his little legs and flexible
                  paws—I observed also with equal interest my new acquaintance. Octave had made
                  himself sufficiently charming to me, during the time that the novelty of our
                  acquaintance had lasted, for him to make me feel interested in seeing and knowing
                  the woman he was supposed to love—the woman who might be his wife. I noticed that
                  she was very small, but her head was superb. It was not too large in proportion to
                  her form, and yet the shape and carriage was as grand as the Pompeiian Sappho,
                  which beautiful bust hers always recalled to me. The golden sunset atmosphere, I
                  thought, gave her luxuriant brown hair its peculiar tinge, but I afterwards found
                  that it was its natural hue. I have never seen more beautiful hair than that of
                  Marie Merle; it was so long and thick that, when unloosened, it enveloped her
                  slight form like a drapery, its silken ends sweeping the ground. Her features were
                  very regular: the brow and eyes, and delicate nose with its quivering nostrils,
                  bore a striking resemblance also to the beautiful antique Sappho I have already
                  mentioned; but there the likeness ended, for the mouth and chin were totally
                  different: no soft, voluptuous beauty hung around them; the lips were delicate and
                  firm, and they had a varying expression, sometimes not very agreeable, because
                  almost mocking and sarcastic. She was not generally considered pretty, and this was because her face was so powerfully
                  affected by her feelings; notwithstanding the exquisite outline of the upper part
                  of her face, I have seen its effect entirely destroyed by the influence of a cold
                  or discouraged mood; a dull, gray, stony shade seemed to hang around her at such
                  times, as if the soul was absent; but when pleased or animated, it was like the
                  lighting up of a finely-cut transparent onyx head; every feature glowed and
                  pulsated with beautiful life.
               Her little delicate fingers played with Beau's long ears; for he quickly yielded
                  to the powerful magnetic gift she possessed, and I thought I had never seen such
                  infantile hands on a woman; the fingers were slender, effilé, and so flexible that they could be turned back to touch the
                  upper part of the wrist without pain. She was quite as cordial as her aunt, though
                  not so gentle. She had a positive, rather abrupt manner about her, which, if she
                  had been a large woman might have appeared coarse and uncultured at first sight;
                  but she was so delicate in form, her voice had such a melody in it, and there was
                  that unmistakable presence of genius in her which rendered even these defects of
                  manner attractive. I looked at her critically from the first, as one examines a
                  piece of sculpture, a gem, or a painting; but, from the very first moment of our
                  acquaintance, I could not bear to think of her ever belonging to Octave Bouvreuil.
                  Had I been a man, I should have become his rival on the spot; as it was, I am sure
                  I stood many times in his light when in the loving presence of his mistress.
               The sun sank lower and lower behind Jura, sending up long rays across the sky some
                  time after its setting; then we turned to leave the chateau terrace. As we
                  descended the fine road, we stopped to read the inscription carved on the road by
                  some Sieur de Chatelard, and the completion of it under some Dame Jaqueline, his
                  widow, née some other lordly name of old
                  Savoisien descent; then we lingered by the picturesque fountain in the main street
                  of the little village lage of Tavel, while Tante Cecile inquired after the
                  well-doing of some old Swiss grandame; then we skirted Les Crêtes and entered the
                  shady road that led through pretty estates and by the sides of high-walled
                  vineyards, until it joined the lake road near Maison Monnet. The young moon
                  silvered the road, creeping in between the branches of the trees; the sky still
                  looked golden around the sharp-cut edges of the mountains; women passed us with
                  straw bottes fastened on their shoulders filled with the evening meal of their
                  goats, and around them hung the long grass and vine branches, a bulky but not a
                  heavy load; and men, with wooden brandes strapped on their backs and implements of
                  labor in their hands, returning home to the second goûter, after a long day spent at work in their vineyards. It is not
                  possible for people to be more steadily industrious than these same Vaudois
                     paysans are in the culture of their
                  vignobles; their houses and domestic life are all neglected for this work; all the
                  year round they are in them, except when the snows of the two first winter months
                  drive them reluctantly into their dark uncomfortable homes; men, women, and
                  children—every generation from grandparent to grandchild—unite in the labor and
                  feel an equal interest. But no married woman can gather a basket of grapes from
                  her own vineyard and sell them in the public markets, without the permission of
                  her husband; he may have spent his spring, summer, and autumn, like
                  the Prodigal Son in the parable, "in riotous living," and she and her children may
                  have fossoyeé all the laboring days, and done
                  all the needful work to bring the fruit, with the gracious aid of the sun, to
                  autumn perfection; yet, after all this, she holds no ownership in republican
                  Helvetia over one grappe, even to exchange it
                  for bread for her children.
               Can it be true, that which the inhabitants and advocates of despotic governments
                  have so often told me triumphantly, that under no governments are women so
                  despotically treated, and hold so few independent rights, as under republics? But
                  we did not talk on such mooted points as this during our twilight and moonlight walk from Chatelard to
                  Peilz. We got on the subject of music in this way: it was on hearing me sing in a
                  low tone, to a Neapolitan melody, this verse from a little song in the Neapolitan
                  patois, which was recalled to me by the tender smile which graced Marie's mouth
                  and softened down its natural severe expression,—
               
                  
                     "Quant 'e doce chella vocca,
                     Quant 'e bello chillo, riso,
                     Tu te cri dempara di so,
                     Quanno sta vicino a te."
                  
               
               As I sang these words in a low voice, playfully, she laughed, in acknowledgment of
                  the intended compliment, and said: "I must tell you that my father and aunt have
                  listened with great delight to your singing; for we can hear you quite well at the
                  chateau."
               "And you?" I asked with a laugh; "of course my singing has also given you
                  pleasure, although you only mention your father and aunt, has it not?"
               "I am not very fond of vocal music," she answered, frankly, "unless united to the
                  orchestral accompaniment and effect of the opera. Simple salon singing by amateurs
                  tires me, it is so bleak. I miss the rich harmony of instrumentation."
               "Marie!" said her aunt, in a remonstrating tone. "You are a little too candid for
                  courtesy."
               "By no means," was her answer. "I have told the truth, and I am sure Mademoiselle
                  Fauvette would rather I should have said what I have, than evasively complimented
                  her. What little I have heard of her music has proved to me that she is too good a
                  musician to prefer unmeaning compliments to the truth. It is a mere matter of
                  taste, after all. But I think I should like your ballad singing; there is an
                  improvising tone you sometimes give it which is totally distinct from and superior
                  to the style in which you sing operatic passages."
               "Pray do not think that your niece's clever and just criticism can offend me," I
                  said to Tante Cecile, seeing her look anxiously at Marie. "I am sure she is right,
                  so far as it applies to my own singing, and I have often thought the same thing;
                  like her, I am not very fond of operatic passages off the stage, and that is why I
                  cannot sing them with as much pleasure or with so much abandon as a
                  simple ballad." Then, turning to her, I took her little hand, and put it in my arm
                  cordially, holding it affectionately, to prove to her my perfect satisfaction with
                  her candor, saying, as I did so: "I have heard you also; but so remarkably fine is
                  your execution, and particularly your expression, that I could scarcely credit
                  Madame Bouvreuil when she told me that it was a woman; now that I see you, I feel
                  still more surprised. How can such tiny fingers perform such marvels? There is a
                  grasp, a power, and also a pertinacity in the music I have heard, that seems
                  impossible for a woman to possess."
               "Then you do not think a woman's clear perception and quick feeling heart able to
                  produce as much as a man's muscles?" replied Marie, sharply. "I am afraid you are
                  like many others. You have not yet reached the knowledge, that true music does not
                  come from labor of the body so much as from strength and feeling in the soul."
               I laughed heartily at her playful petulance.
               "Oh, I am in earnest," she continued, her mouth assuming its most mocking
                  expression; "about music I am very rigid."
               "And, consequently, unjust," I answered; "of course, as all 'poets born, not
                  made,' are. Because the thing comes easy to you, because you can by force of
                  natural cleverness cover over or dispense with grammar rules, I will answer for it
                  you will have no patience with less gifted ones like myself."
               "Yes I shall," she cried merrily; "I shall have great patience, or pretend to
                  have, whenever you play humble and modest, as you are doing now."
               
               "No, I assure you," I said, "I am not playing either humble or modest. I have
                  often felt of myself what pretty Brulette said of poor Joset, in Madame Sand's
                     Maîtres Sonneurs. Do you remember it?"
               "No, repeat it to me."
               "Joset, I can very well believe that all this is in thy head, but I am not sure of
                  its coming out. To wish and to be able are two things. To dream and to execute
                  differ greatly. I know that thou hast in thy ears, or in thy brain, or in thy
                  heart, the true music of the good God, because I have seen it in thy eyes when I
                  was little, and when more than once taking me on thy knees thou didst say to me
                  with a charmed air, "Listen, do not make any noise, and endeavor to remember it."
                  Then I would listen faithfully, and I could only hear the wind which rustled in
                  the leaves and the water which rung its little foam-bells over the pebbles; but
                  thou! thou couldst hear other things, and thou wast so assured of it that I became
                  so likewise."
               "Beautiful!" exclaimed Marie, with beaming face. "Tante Cecile, I must positively
                  read Les Maîtres Sonneurs. You know, of course,
                  Mademoiselle Fauvette, that Madame Sand's works have been to me les œuvres defendues; but I think papa and Tante
                  Cecile must be more indulgent, and let me draw inspiration and information from
                  this artistic woman's writings."
               "It is a great pity," I said, "that Madame Sand allowed her passions and
                  resentments to dictate to her so much oftener than her judgment and taste. To the
                  artist-student, however, many of her works are invaluable. The most objectionable
                  of her writings appear to have been written during a transition state of her
                  nature, for in them we find principles and opinions different from her better
                  works, and plots and characters developed and offensive subjects dwelt upon,
                  repulsive as well to good morals as to good taste. She made a mistake, according
                  to my fancy, in unsexing herself; in wishing, or rather demanding for our sex the
                  indulgences dulgences and weaknesses of men, resentful at the injustice meted out
                  to the daughters of Eve; despising 
                     
                        'the gauds and armlets worn by weaker women in captivity,'
                     
                   she has contented herself in breaking and casting away chains as useless to
                  contend against as the pretty jeweled ornaments. She has not striven to make women
                  stronger for well-doing, but she has claimed for us what we do not want, license
                  for evil-doing. To smoke cigars, haunt cafés, and wear pantaloons, seems to have
                  been her first crude idea of woman's rights. But, setting aside all this, and
                  overlooking her melodramatic Byronic rhapsodies, Madame Sand is a most suggestive
                  writer to the artist."
               "You have read Liszt's Chopin?" asked Marie eagerly.
               "Yes," I replied, "and he gives, in his description of Madame Sand, just the idea
                  I wish to convey of this remarkable woman, this one of the three great literary
                  women of our day."
               "Three?" repeated Marie inquiringly.
               "The written recognition," I answered, "of Elizabeth Browning and Charlotte
                  Bronté, entitle us to class this great French woman with her equally great English
                  sisters."
               We had wandered into the Leignitz grounds, and were sitting on the broad upper
                  platform of the flight of steps leading down to the lower terrace. The moon was
                  just sinking behind the Corneilles de Bize, peaks of the Savoy Alps; the waves of
                  the lake washed musically up over the pebbly beach; the snipes screamed,
                  Rousseau's bécassines, sounding like necessary discords in a composition rendered
                  tame by too perfect harmonies. We sat for a few minutes in silence; then Marie
                  asked,—
               "Do you remember what Liszt says of Madame Sand in the description of a soirée at
                  Chopin's?"
               "I remember the description you allude to, but not the particular passage; pray
                  repeat it," I answered, for I loved to hear the sound of my new young friend's
                  voice, and judge of her taste and
                  character by her language and choice of passages in her reading.
               "It is after he speaks of Madame Sand's being one of those elect," said Marie,
                  "who perceive the beautiful under all the forms of art and nature, and also of the
                  divine word to be obtained from close intercourse with nature, that word which
                  lies hidden in her infinite harmonies,—harmonies composed of graceful outlines,
                  exquisite sounds, lights, shades, noises, and warblings,—then he adds: 'To have
                  listened early, like Madame Sand, to the whisperings by which nature initiates the
                  privileged to her mystic rites, is one of the appanages of the poet; to have
                  learned of her to fathom that which man dreams, when he in his turn creates, and
                  which in his works of all kinds he uses and adapts like nature, the fracas and the
                  warblings, the terrors and the delights, is a gift more subtle still, which Madame
                  Sand, as woman and poet, possesses in a double right, by the intuition of her
                  heart and her genius.'"
               "I do not wonder," said Tante Cecile, laughing, "that you are so anxious to read
                  the books of that naughty unsexed woman, when she is described in such a
                  fascinating style to you; and now that Mademoiselle Fauvette has come to your aid,
                  I suppose permission must be given to you."
               "It depends, dear Mademoiselle Merle," I answered, "entirely upon the character of
                  the young girl into whose hands Madame Sand's books are placed, and the kind of
                  education she has received. There are many girls to whom her books would be very
                  injurious; but I fancy your niece has sufficiently clear notions of right and
                  wrong, which will enable her to pick out the good grain and throw away the chaff.
                  Moreover, she need not read the objectionable books; par
                     exemple, those written under the influence of resentment against her
                  husband's unmanly tyranny and dishonesty, or those in which she wishes to advance
                  her St. Simonian principles."
               "Mrs. Browning," said Tante Cecile—for the Merles, like the Bouvreuils, were good
                  English scholars, and quite au courant in
                  English literature—"Mrs. Browning, of whom you just spoke, I remember has written
                  two very beautiful sonnets to Madam Sand. As we are in such a quoting mood,
                  Mademoiselle Fauvette, before we leave this terrace, pray repeat 'The Desire,' if
                  you can remember it."
               Luckily, Mrs. Browning's poems were in my basket, and by the fading light of the
                  moon, aided by my memory, I read it aloud to them, and our conversation was closed
                  by this generous and just poem of Mrs. Browning.
               
                  
                     "Thou large-brained woman and large-hearted man,
                     Self-called George Sand! whose soul, amid the lions
                     Of thy tumultuous senses, moans defiance,
                     And answers roar for roar, as spirits can;
                     I would some mild miraculous thunder ran
                     Above the applauded circus, in appliance
                     Of thine own nobler nature's strength and science,—
                     Drawing two pinions, white as wings of swan,
                     From thy strong shoulders, to amaze the place
                     With holier light! That thou to woman's claim
                     And man's, might join beside the angel's grace
                     Of a pure genius sanctified from blame;
                     Till child and maiden presaged to thine embrace,
                     To kiss upon thy lips a stainless fame."
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER VII.
               MY FIRST VISIT TO MARIE MERLE.
               ON my return that evening I found Madame Bouvreuil; but she had come back alone,
                  having left her son and daughter with their aunt, who was to be detained at G. a
                  few days on business. Two or three days after meeting the Merles at Chatelard,
                  they sent for Madame Bouvreuil and me to drink tea with them. Mr. Merle lived in
                  the habitable part of the old Tour de Pierre, or Peilz, which stood on the borders
                  of the lake and had been built in 1249 by le petit
                     Charlemagne, Pierre of Savoy, a famous son of that family, who
                  mingled the blood of the counts of Savoy with all the reigning houses of
                  Christendom. His sister Beatrix, although only a simple Countess of Provence,
                  married her four beautiful daughters to the principal European monarchs of that
                  epoch. One, Sanchie, was an empress; another, Eleanor, the queen of Henry III. of
                  England, whose husband estranged his nobles and people to pay court to his lovely
                  wife and her foreign train; the two others were selected by Blanche of Castile, as
                  daughters-in-law; Marguerite became the wife of the saintly Louis IX., and Beatrix
                  the wife of his brother, the warlike Charles of Anjou, who defeated that hero of
                  old romance, Dante's 
                     
                        "Biondo era e bello e di gentile aspetto,"
                     
                   the unfortunate Manfred, and ascended the throne of Naples, the first of that
                  Neapolitan house of Anjou, whose women, like those of the Stuart race, were
                  celebrated for their beauty and their misfortunes; from the first Joanna, "so
                  lovely and so sad," to the last daughter of the line, the imperious,
                  broken-hearted daughter of the Troubadour King Rénè, Margaret of Anjou.
               This Tower of Peilz, and the little village attached, had been built and fortified
                  by Pierre of Savoy, at the time when he stood at the zenith of his power, after he
                  had received the homage of the lords of Eastern Helvetia, and the seigneurs of
                  Berne and Morat, and had taken his father's place as Duke of Savoy. The little
                  village of Peilz has still the remains of the old walls and fosse, which forms a
                  northern boundary to it. In passing out of our own street in the village, and
                  taking the road which comes up from the tower on the lake that leads out to
                  Hauteville and "old Blonay," we always pass under a grand old arch, which is part
                  of, and on which rises, the beautiful spire, with its ogive windows, of the Peilz
                  church, built also by Pierre. This arch spans the road, and from the church, on
                  both sides, extends the wall and fosse of the ancient fortifications.
               This village and tower Pierre built to command that side of the lake, as he built
                  the one at Martigny to protect himself at the Pass of St. Bernard, and the one at
                  Evian to control the southern shore of the lake; and on the ruins of Count Wala's
                  prison, Zillium, he raised the present castle, so celebrated by the great English
                  poet, who, if he had known better the history of that remarkable place and its
                  more meritorious heroes, would have devoted his verse to the praise of a much more
                  interesting martyr than the renegade priest and unworthy Protestant,
                  Bonnivard.
               He was an ambitious and warlike prince, this Pierre of Savoy, and would have been
                  glad to have erected his aspiring house into a European monarchy, and had a
                  kingdom of Helvetia ranked among the sovereignties of Christendom. "Fier, hardi et
                  terrible comme un lion, si preux qu'on l'appelait le second Charles Maygne, et
                  sachant se tenir tellement qu'il devait mettre à subjection moultz de gens; et quand il se fut montré, tous se rangèrent
                  autour de sa personne, criant à l'envi, Vive notre redouté Seigneur!" says the old
                  chronicler of this hero, whose history is so mingled with poesy and legend that it
                  quite loses itself in those hazy regions, while those of his no greater, only more
                  successful rival, Rodolph of Habsburg, is familiar to every school-boy.
               As we approached the chateau, Madame Bouvreuil and I talked over these historical
                  associations, which hang around beautiful nature as one finds in Europe; we have
                  huge forests, immense inland seas, flood-like rivers, great water-falls, and
                  mountains whose white snows, violet vapors, and graceful outlines are as lovely as
                  the most celebrated European ranges. But in Europe every road and every old
                  castle, and almost every stone is as a page of history. The American scholar can
                  scarcely feel the reality and life of all that he studies of olden times until he
                  visits Europe; then the tales of old chronicler and bard take form and shape to
                  him and possess a living memory.
               Only one tower and side building of the chateau had been repaired and kept in
                  habitable order; the other tower and side were quite in ruins, and its
                  architectural beauty made of it, as of the fine old Peilz church and old wall and
                  fosse, favorite studies for the lovers of the picturesque. The habitable parts
                  were the tower and side extending on the terrace overhanging the lake, near the
                  little port of Peilz. The entrance was by a large gate, near the habitable tower.
                  One part of the court-yard wall had formed also the wall of the castle chapel; the
                  chapel had disappeared, but a window remained in the wall, whose ogive top gave it
                  its date; this formed a picturesque frame to a bit of blue sky, and it was
                  decorated with hanging festoons of lichen and ivy, and other graceful pendants of
                  the scarlet bindweeds that crept over the old walls, combining with the velvety
                  moss and delicate maiden-hair fern to make a beautiful foliage over this fine
                  ruin.
               Michel, a gardener, with his family, occupied the lower part of the chateau
                  building, and rented the grounds attached, consisting of a little mounting hill
                  outside the chateau walls, which was laid off in a neat terraced vegetable garden,
                  with rows of well-kept dwarf fruit-trees. This hill sloped off beneath my windows
                  and from them I could look down on a pretty winding walk that mounted up over it.
                  The hill had been tunneled, to make a passage to the lower part of the garden, and
                  this mounting walk, with the tunnel arch beneath, made a very picturesque sight;
                  there was a broken column and a bit of ruined stone wall, and from the garden
                  beyond rose an old ivy-covered Marron d'Inde, whose long branches threw a friendly
                  shade over the tunneled walk and extended its leafy arms quite over to my balcony,
                  as if to seek the acquaintance of a graceful young acacia that grew quite near my
                  balcony posts.
               The house which the Bouvreuils occupied had been part of an old convent, and near
                  my window rose a circular tower which had been its staircase and belfry. The
                  picturesque walk and part of Michel's vegetable garden, probably all of it, must
                  have belonged to the community; and I often amused myself with conjuring up
                  pictures of the past, such as some lovely lonely Chatelaine of Peilz—whose
                  knightly husband was far away emulating the prowess, and infidelities may be, of
                  the legendary Paladins—passing out of her courtyard gate and mounting the shady,
                  hill walk to seek counsel from the Mother Abbess, or to find spiritual consolation
                  in the performance of her meek matronly devotions before some precious shrine in
                  the convent chapel, or followed by her maidens, carrying some gracious offering to
                  the community.
               The courtyard of the chateau was always neatly kept. A large fountain in the
                  center poured out a generous stream of sparkling water from an old Savoisien
                  lion's mouth into large stone basin, rudely sculptured in the form of a huge
                  scallop shell with river-god supporters, once very grand, but now sadly
                  dilapidated. Two or three trees, some walnuts and elms, stood there; probably planted in more
                  peaceful times, when that large courtyard was no longer needed for military
                  retainers. Around these trees Michel had made little flower rings, and against the
                  side of the old wall—near the house, under the old chapel window—lay spread out a
                  fine large flower-bed filled with beautiful geraniums and roses. A yellow rose
                  vine and white jessamine clambered up the wall and mingled with the ivy and
                  bindweeds. There were the China asters, petunias, and verbenas of midsummer, and a
                  few rich dahlias of autumn, partly opened, and a border of superb fuschias; Michel
                  was very proud of them and of his fine geraniums which stood inside the fuschia,
                  the scarlet ones as brilliant in hue as those of Southern Italy. Some delicious
                  tea roses and réséda threw out a lovely odor; a few late blooming yellow roses
                  peeped here and there on the rose vine, and also some of the starry white blossoms
                  of the Jessamine. I stood for a few moments looking up at the beautiful old ruined
                  wall, covered with such various shades of green, and at the waving tree-tops and
                  the little bit of blue sky peeping in between the leaves at the old chapel window;
                  then I turned toward the ruined tower, whose turreted top set cuttingly clear
                  against the blue sky.
               "Is not the old tower a fine ruin?" asked Marie.
               I started; my new friend stood close beside me; she had seen us from an upper
                  window, and had run down to greet us.
               "You are a real Fenella!" I answered, "for you spring up beside one so
                  unexpectedly. I suppose you never go up and down stairs like common folk; but,
                  like Scott's uncanny creation, you leap and spring from landing to landing on the
                  old staircase in the most reckless and terrifying manner."
               "Come into the house and I will instantly prove to you how properly I can go up
                  stairs; and do not be afraid to leave this fine old tower, there is a view from
                  the salon windows and tower room that will quite repay you for the trouble."
               A large hall swept through the house from the court-yard door to the door which
                  opened on the terrace overhanging the lake. On one side of this hall were the
                  Michel apartments; on the other the cuisine of
                  the Merles, and the broad stone staircase which led to their principal apartments
                  on the second floor. But next to this stairway, and fronting on the lake terrace,
                  was one of those large old rooms always found in these chateaux, and which had
                  probably been the assembling hall of the officers of the little army of the
                  Savoisien duke; here he had doubtless held his miniature court. The
                  banqueting-room must have been above this, on the second floor, but it had been
                  altered by being divided into a salon and bedroom. This large hall or room on the
                  first floor had also been divided for modern uses; one corner, with a fine old
                  window, Mr. Merle had partitioned off for his library; the rest was used as a
                  dining-room.
               The western tower, which stood at the end of the chapel wall and close to the lake
                  shore, had in the second story a room which opened on to the salon. This west
                  tower stood a little in front of the main building, so that on entering the salon
                  from the upper entry almost the first thing that arrested the sight was a view
                  into this tower room. It was lighted by a fine Gothic window filled with stained
                  glass of great age and value; but the principal charm of this tower room to me was
                  a beautiful plaster cast of two figures, which stood on a revolving pedestal in
                  the center of the little room. The rich lights which fell on it from the
                  gorgeously-colored window produced an admirable effect. It was one of those happy
                  combinations of conception, arrangement, and surrounding which cause a feeling of
                  perfect satisfaction to the beholder. The cast was of a group by a celebrated
                  Neapolitan sculptor, Tito Angelini, one of his most poetical creations,—Francesca
                  di Rimini and Paolo,—expressing that exquisite passage in Dante, commencing at the
                  line,‐
               
                  
                     
                        "Noi leggevamo un giorno per diletto."
                     
                     "One day we read how Launcelot gazed his fill
                     At her he loved, and what his lady said;
                     We were alone, thinking of nothing ill.
                  
                  
                  
                     "Oft were our eyes suspended as we read,
                     And in our cheeks the color went and came—
                     Yet one passage struck resistance dead:
                  
                  
                     "Twas where the lover, mothlike in his flame,
                     Drawn by her sweet smile, kissed it. Oh, then, he
                     Whose lot and mine are now for aye the same,
                  
                  
                     "All in a tremble, on the mouth kissed me.
                     The book did all. Our hearts within us burned
                     Through that alone. That day no more read we."*
                     
                  
               
               
                  *Leigh Hunt's translation.
               A very halo of beauty hung around the group. I looked up at the window from which
                  streamed down the glorious golden and purple and crimson lights, then on this
                  representation of the poet's lines, in which Angelini has proved himself Dante's
                  peer, and felt as if floating in the atmosphere of beauty it created. Francesca
                  and her lover are at the very moment when the poet's line reveals their love to
                  each other, that one passage which "struck resistance dead." Her eyes seem
                  swimming with rapture, though cast down as if conscious that in her cheeks "the
                  color went and came." The droop of her graceful form, the very fall of her
                  beautiful hand on the book, shows how heavily steeped her senses are in the
                  perilous magnetic fluid of love, while the lover's whole being seems palpitating
                  and throbbing; one hand and arm are extended over her shoulder, the other draws
                  her little hand close to his heart; and his face, formed in that beautiful Italian
                  type, is expressive of the delicious enjoyment of the bliss just in reach,—that
                  precious, costly kiss; that fatal embrace for which they were condemned to float
                  through Dante's Inferno in endless misery.
               "Ah, Dante, surely love's faiblesses and sins
                  were more severely judged in your heaven and hell than in our world of to-day!"
                  said Madame Bouvreuil.
               "Then we have improved in charity, dear madam?" I asked.
               "Probably in indifference," said Tante Cecile, softly.
               "Oh, stop speculating!" cried Marie, impatiently. "As Tante Octavie would say, 'Do
                  not get into deep water, with your crude, feminine philosophizing.' I want
                  Mademoiselle Fauvette to have her first impressions both agreeably and indelibly
                  traced. Be so good, mademoiselle, as to sit down on one of these little canapés,
                  this one opposite the window, and study the group, while I play for you the music
                  which, according to my fancy, belongs to it.
               "So, you saucy girl," said Madame Bouvreuil, playfully, "with your usual conceit
                  you wish to have all the deep water to yourself! Eh
                     bien, go off to your piano, you shall have Mademoiselle Fauvette all
                  to yourself; for Tante Cecile and I have a variety of talk to get through with on
                  subjects much more practical, and probably more useful than your divine high
                  art."
               And the two elder ladies left the room, laughing at Marie's mock horror at the
                  shadow of heresy contained in Madame Bouvreuil's reply.
               Marie's full grand Erard piano, which stood in the center of the large salon,
                  fronted the little tower chamber; she seated herself at it, and commenced the
                     Adagio in Chopin's second concerto. The
                  passage was indeed well fitted to illustrate the poet's and the sculptor's
                  creation.
               "The accessory designs in it belong to the best manner of this great musical
                  artist, and the principal phrase is of admirable breadth. It alternates with a
                  recitative which establishes the minor tone, and of which it is an antistrophe.
                  The whole passage possesses an ideal beauty; its sentiment is by turns radiant,
                  then pitying and sorrowful. It makes one think of a magnificent landscape
                  inundated with glorious golden lights; of some fortunate Vale of Tempe that had
                  been selected as the place for reciting some sad history, some grievous,
                  lamentable event. One might say an irreparable regret filled the heart, even in the presence of an
                  incomparable splendor in nature—a contrast which is sustained by a fusion of
                  tones, a succession of graduated tints, as it were, which prevents any brusque shock that might cause a dissonance to arrive,
                  and which might injure the touching impression that is being produced, for while
                  the joy is clouded the grief is soothed."*
               
               
                  *"Chopin," par F. Liszt, pp. 11, 12.
               After Marie had finished playing this exquisite passage, so eloquently analyzed in
                  the above quotation, she came to me, and we examined together the sculptor's
                  beautiful work. She then told me its history. The original had been sculptured for
                  a wealthy Swiss merchant living at Naples, a friend of Mr. Merle's; they had been
                  boys together. After they came to manhood their paths in life widely diverged. Mr.
                  Merle became a Swiss pastor, while his boy friend was a successful trader; but the
                  wealthy merchant had so many and pleasant associations connected with the
                  excellent intellectual companion of his youth, that their friendship had continued
                  unchanged through all the circumstances of different positions and pursuits which
                  might naturally have affected it.
               "Then," said Marie, "he admires papa's daughter; and when he heard me play, about
                  a year since, on this exquisite Erard of mine, which a kind old cousin's legacy
                  enabled me to buy, he honored me by being touched to tears—just fancy the
                  compliment!—and a few months after, on his return to Naples, he sent this lovely
                  creation to, as his note said, 'the daughter of his boyhood's companion and
                  manhood's counselor and friend.'"
               I admired the prosperous merchant's good taste, and thought surely none of his
                  numberless piastres had ever been so well spent, as in placing such a marvelous
                  conception of poetic beauty in the home of this gifted girl. We looked out of the
                  tower window down on the lake, whose mimic sea-waves dashed finely against the
                  wall of the tower; then on the rugged Savoy Alps, and the misty line of Jura,
                  which seemed to end this little inland sea, giving no promise of the sunny towns
                  spread out farther down on its picturesque borders.
               Then Marie made me observe the interior of the tower room. From the center of the
                  ceiling hung a fine bronze copy of one of the exquisite antique Pompeiian lamps,
                  another gift of the munificent friend; and this lamp was so arranged by chains
                  that it could be lowered or raised in different positions in order to throw the
                  light at will upon the group. The floor, like that of the salon, was inlaid in
                  diamond form, of brown and yellow wood, well waxed, and shining like a polished
                  table surface; two sofas were inserted in the wall on either side of the window
                  and door, covered with crimson, and in front of them lay little crimson foot-rugs
                  of tufted work,—Tante Cecile's clever hands had made them; a mirror was behind the
                  statue, and the remaining part of the wall was hung with French paper of a neutral
                  tint, bordered at the ceiling with a narrow, gilt cornice.
               We then left the tower room and went into the salon. Two grand old windows, with
                  deep embrasures, opened to the floor, and, protected on the outside by shallow
                  balconies of iron spears, lighted the apartment. The piano was the greatest
                  treasure in the room to Marie; but on the walls hung some fine engravings and
                  three curious old pictures, which, with some relics of Pierre of Savoy, were very
                  precious to Mr. Merle. The pictures drew my attention first; they were three panel
                  paintings by the Zurich artist, Manuel, who lived in the fifteenth century. They
                  had golden backgrounds: one was a Blessed Virgin, another a St. Catherine, and the
                  third, John the Baptist. They were not remarkable for beauty of form or feature;
                  but they had that charm which is so often observed in all these old devotional
                  pictures—calmness, serenity, and purity of thought. They seem fitted for the places for which they were
                  designed, altars and shrines, before which the heavy hearted or anxious knelt in
                  prayer. The very sight of one of these peaceful old pictures of the Virgin or
                  saints quiets down all unrest. The Virgin may be angular and the saints may be wry
                  necked, but there is around them an atmosphere of perfect peace. They were created
                  at an era when Faith was settled, before the birth of the hydra Doubt; every
                  picture had a symbolic meaning; was a representation of some Divine mysterious
                  legend; hope, faith, and sinless love, expressed in a tranquil, pious spirit,
                  constitute their attraction. The artists felt and believed, and for that reason
                  their creations, though faulty in drawing and full of defects, to a cultivated
                  eye, possess a power greater than any modern production—that of raising the heart
                  and thoughts into the purer region of the spiritual world, where all is perfect
                  peace.
               The evening shades darkened the room and prevented me from examining the other
                  curious contents of the salon, and Marie and I leaned over the balcony and looked
                  out into the waters of the lake dancing coquettishly under the moonbeams, while I
                  described to her other pictures I had seen of that epoch, the peaceful dawn of art
                  which was heralded in by such angelic, spirits as Il Beato Fiesole. While deep in
                  our pre-Raphaelitism, we were summoned to tea, and I was presented to Marie's
                  father. Mr. Merle was a tall, spare man very like his sister in appearance and
                  disposition—the same genial tone, the same quiet playfulness and simplicity. A
                  sincere and pious Christian, a generous and charitable man, and a scholar, Mr.
                  Merle was as modest as a girl; he always made me think of that condition which was
                  the stumbling-block to Nicodemus, "Unless ye be born again, and become as little
                  children, ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven," for he had the innocent,
                  guileless spirit of one of those little children of whom the blessed Christ said:
                  "Suffer them to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of
                  heaven."
            
            
               CHAPTER VIII.
               TANTE OCTAVIE.
               A FEW weeks went by pleasantly, and one sweet day in the latter part of September,
                  Hélène Bouvreuil and Octave returned with their aunt, Madame Eperveil. Institution
                  Eperveil looked inhabited again, and its grounds, at noonday or sunset, were
                  filled with a crowd of youths engaged with their tutors in a variety of terrific
                  gymnastic exercises, which made me expect to see some violent death whenever I
                  passed by there. The professor and Kinnaird Graham resumed their class duties, and
                  were busily occupied morning and afternoon. Octave stayed only a few days at home,
                  as he found it necessary to take a journey to Paris, under the pretense of
                  purchasing books and instruments for the Institution, which could just as well
                  have been ordered.
               Hélène Bouvreuil, with whom I soon grew intimate, and Marie Merle and I,
                  cultivated cordially the pleasant young friendship which had sprang up between us.
                  Hélène was as perfect a contrast to Marie as Kinnaird was to Octave, though in a
                  different way; for while Kinnaird was the type of a large class of mankind,
                  Octave, it is to be hoped, was sui generis. But
                  Hélène and Marie were types of two classes of women, both excellent, complete, and
                  useful, according to their development and position in this state of being. Hélène
                  was, by nature and disposition, calculated to perform the difficult but tender
                  duties of wife and mother. She was a Rachel and Rebekah of the old law; Marie was
                  a Miriam, a Jephtha's daughter; an artist-soul fluttered its wings within her, but
                  luckily it was not voiceless. Many
                  artist-women are dumb in this state of existence; the divine thoughts struggle to
                  take form and shape in vain; they remain vague shadows of thoughts.
               
                  
                     "The yearning to a beautiful, denied you,
                     Shall strain your powers;
                     Ideal sweetnesses shall overglide you,
                     Resumed from ours!"*
                     
                  
               
               
                  *Mrs. Browning's "Drama of Exile."
               Sometimes, from necessity or ignorance of their inability, they take up the labor
                  of their sisters; then comes the struggle, the attempt at and recoiling before the
                  almost impossible duty of their woman-life; a spirit lies wailing within them
                  while they go about doing ineffectually the work not made for their hands. All
                  this is a mystery that will be resolved in another state of being; there the
                  Mary-mother women may love without sadness and inquietude, and the Miriam
                  artist-women be complete and joyful.
               Hélène was like her mother, active and capable; she loved home duties and a quiet
                  domestic life. She was not so self dependent, as I have before said, as her
                  mother; she was more clinging and demonstrative, but this added a greater charm to
                  her. One of the prettiest sights was to see her and her mother together in the
                  garden beneath my windows at sunset, with their arms about each other's waists,
                  walking up and down the little bill, or leaning against the old column and, stone
                  wall, talking about house affairs, making their little confidences to each
                  other,—the one receiving sweet counsel, and the other taking her mother-reward of
                  complete companionship and content. Often I have shrunk back behind my curtain,
                  after I had been looking down unseen on them, with my cheeks wet with tears and my
                  heart wailing out hopelessly the never-ending cry, "Lost is lost, and gone is
                  gone." There is no mortal love so beautiful and complete as mother and daughter
                  love.
               Hélène and Kinnaird were very quiet, contented lovers. I do not know that I should
                  have guessed their position toward each other without Madame Bouvreuil's
                  information; they had lived together from childhood, and were more like brother
                  and sister, or very dear friends, than the usual accepted notion of lovers. Octave
                  and Marie resembled much more the favorite novel type. But do such make happy
                  married people? The calmer, quieter loves are better for human nature's daily
                  food, I fancy.
               I had not seen Octave much with Marie until after his return from Paris, which was
                  about the latter part of September. I watched them closely; I could not help it;
                  Octave dazzled me, and I was beginning to love Marie very deeply. I liked to talk
                  to Octave; we had many subjects in common; we had both traveled a great deal, both
                  seen noted people, and had both read the same books with pleasure. He did not, nor
                  did Marie, object to allowing me to make a third in their tête-à-têtes. He was
                  very fitful in his attentions to his lady love; but when he condescended to be
                  devoted, he was irresistibly attractive, he showed so much gallantry and grace. I
                  never knew much of the detail of their love affairs, nor did any one; we could
                  only judge by the appearance of things. I say we, for soon after the
                  commencement of our acquaintance, Tante Cecile and I became very good friends, and
                  it was not long before she communicated to me her hopes and fears on the subject.
                  She could not bear to think of her darling being thrown away on such a brilliant
                     vaurien as Octave, and rejoiced over each
                  misunderstanding between them, which was frequent enough.
               Marie, though so frank and open on every subject with me, never spoke with me
                  directly about Octave. After we grew to be very dear friends there was a sort of
                  tacit understanding between us about it, and many allusions she would make,
                  apparently to other things, were often intended, as we both knew, to apply to this
                     sujét défendu. And yet she did not hesitate
                  to talk freely of Hélène and Kinnaird, and I was wicked enough Many times to be amused with her
                  sharp, witty remarks upon the quiet tenor of their loves. Marie considered
                  Kinnaird "lamentably slow;" like many others of her sex, she admired just the sort
                  of men that would make her miserable, and I am ashamed to confess that I did not
                  at first value Kinnaird Graham as much as he merited; he was cold and reserved,
                  and did not enter into the rather reckless merriment between Octave, Marie, and
                  me.
               There was one very prominent member of the Bouvreuil family I had not yet met
                  with, although I had been an inmate of their house for several months, and this
                  was Madame Eperveil. Since her return from Berlin she had been busily occupied in
                  ordering and directing her establishment; moreover, she never visited; indeed,
                  never went anywhere but to church. Had I been a Protestant, I should have met her
                  there; but on Sundays I generally walked to a neighboring town, to a little
                  Catholic chapel, and thus missed the only chance I had of being presented to her
                  without calling on her. I was not so foolish as to expect that one so much my
                  senior as Madame Eperveil should lay aside her usual custom and make a call upon
                  me; but although I received general and courteous invitations to visit her,
                  through the family, some indefinable repugnance kept me from going. Marie Merle
                  had often talked to me of Madame Eperveil, and, without desiring to produce a
                  wrong or harsh impression, had given me the idea of her being a repulsive and
                  overbearing woman. Indeed, everything I heard and saw convinced me that she was
                  the petty tyrant of not only the Bouvreuil family, but nearly all Peilz; she had
                  one of those dictatorial dispositions and imperious natures that value obedience
                  and submission more than friendship and love. So I put off going to see her from
                  time to time, until one day, on receiving an invitation to the first of a series
                  of concerts and dramatic readings, to be given during the winter at Institution
                  Eperveil, according to an old-established custom, I felt a little awkward and
                  surprised, and wished I had performed the disagreeable duty of calling on her
                  before. The card of invitation was accompanied by so gracious a verbal one,
                  through Madame Bouvreuil, that I could not refuse to accept it. As the concert was
                  to be on the following evening, I had not even time to make amends for my
                  negligence, and could only write a formal acceptance of the invitation, which
                  Madame Bouvreuil assured me was all that was necessary.
               At eight o'clock the next evening we were all en
                     route for Institution Eperveil, for Madame Bouvreuil had said at
                     goûter, "Let us be early, girls, for Tante
                  Octavie is so annoyed at late arrivals;" and this made me very prompt in my
                  toilet, which, I am sorry to say, I should not otherwise have been, as I had that
                  sad fault of procrastinating inherent in my nature, and which was very apt to keep
                  me from being punctual. Mr. Graham and Hélène, then Octave and I, and after us
                  Professor and Madame Bouvreuil, formed the family procession. We entered the salon
                  first before going to the exhibition room, because it had been announced
                  diplomatically that Madame Eperveil wished to have me presented to her with some
                  extra ceremony, by way of making up for my neglect of calling on her, I supposed.
                  And at last I was to see this petty empress, this Elizabeth or Catharine of the
                  little Suisse village of Peilz.
               We found her in the salon, with a few friends around her—a miniature court. I was
                  presented in due form, and she received me with charming affability and grace.
                  Tante Octavie must have been about fifty when I first saw her. Though of a French
                  Suisse family by blood, she looked more like an English woman or a German, being a
                  pure blonde. She was tall and finely proportioned, but though feminine in its
                  development, her figure was very hard and iron looking, and her large well-formed
                  white hand had a grasp like that of a man. Her skin was fair, her eyes a clear
                  bright blue, but her great pride was in her fine forehead and superb hair; this
                  forehead swept up high and grand like a man's, and her hair was indeed beautiful,
                  of that tint called cendre, and very luxuriant; she always dressed it well: a
                  rich, heavy plaited knot on the back of the head and full bandeaux over her noble
                  forehead. Yes, I had to admit that Tante Octavie was a fine, grand-looking woman.
                  She was not at all attractive, however, to my fancy; there was such a hardness
                  about her, and then her countenance was so imperious and obstinate in its
                  expression. Her features were all good, her eyes finely set, her nose straight and
                  well outlined, and her hard, firm lips had the same chiseled look, but it was that
                  very chiseled look which repulsed me. She looked as if made out of white iron—if
                  one could imagine such a substance—not painted iron, but some substance harder and
                  sharper than marble in its points. We looked so little beside her, or at least the
                  rest did; I do not remember feeling little myself, although I was the smallest of
                  the party; I only remember remarking how pétite
                  the other women looked, even the graceful, tall Hélène.
               The introduction over, she resumed her seat on a small canapé, only large enough in these days of ample skirts for two
                  persons. She motioned with her head to the rest to be seated, and taking me
                  graciously by the hand, begged me to sit beside her. I did so, and we entered into
                  a conversation about Suisse in general and Suisse scenery in particular. Tante
                  Octavie talked well, but there was no warm sympathetic tone in her voice, as in
                  Madame Bouvreuil's and Tante Cecile's. Her words were all on the surface; not of
                  the subject—for she always understood well what she talked of—but on the surface
                  of feeling. I have heard of the fairy who spoke pearls: Tante Octavie's words
                  dropped hard and clear and polished like little pebbles of marble on a glittering
                  icy surface. We were singularly gracious to each other, however; Marie Merle said
                  saucily, "it was too good a beginning to last."
               It was not in the nature of things for two such opposite characters to draw well
                  together. I was little in stature, and frail and delicate in health, with a
                  nervous temperament; disposed, from various circumstances, at times to be morbid
                  and irritable; and, like all such little people, I had a will as large as Tante
                  Octavie's. The world is so apt to think the little and frail are always gentle and
                  yielding; this is a great mistake; they are a very troublesome set if taken hold
                  of in that way, and are apt, like little bees, to show a pretty fierce sting.
                  Tante Octavie no more understood me, nor indeed any other human character, than
                  she understood Syrio-Arabic; and yet it might be that she understood that; for, as
                  I before said, she had been a pupil of the great Neander, and that high white
                  forehead of her's held a great deal of cunning knowledge. But Tante Octavie, like
                  the great Anglo-Saxon men she resembled,—though she could manage and control a
                  crowd of people,—was totally and entirely ignorant of the "open
                     sesame" to those human hearts who were constrained by circumstances to
                  follow her lead and bidding. If I had been her daughter, she would have governed
                  me too, for such nervous enthusiastic natures as mine are capable of deep admiring
                  love for characters like Tante Octavie's, when duty and the ties of blood connect
                  them together, and I often felt how merciful it was that I had not been bound by
                  natural ties to such a disposition. She would have broken me in regularly, and
                  what a miserable unhappy being I should have been! I should have loved her deeply
                  and feared her painfully; she would have been a living torture to my heart, soul,
                  and body, for I could never have been natural, never myself. The effect of her
                  influence over such a character as mine would have been to produce that saddest of
                  all creations by human influence, a species of cracked, trembling inefficiency,
                  which might have ended in hopelessness or despair. But meeting Tante Octavie on
                  equal ground, she aroused all the antagonism of my nature; a sort of instinctive
                  dread of the danger of her influence, I suppose, made my whole being brace itself
                  erect against her at all points. She had good strong health; she could swim, row a
                  boat, walk over a mountain, manage a
                  large institution of young men, keep house, cook a dinner, talk every living
                  tongue, do anything; she was a grand, strong, capable woman, and a superb tyrant.
                  I was just the reverse of all this; and when she found I was not humiliated and
                  mortified, but even admitted my inefficiency, she was as surprised as enraged. She
                  had but one standard to judge people by, and when those with whom she was
                  connected by blood or business did not or could not reach that standard, she
                  treated the deficiency either as a personal insult to herself or a contemptible
                  weakness in them; she made no allowances for differences of temperament or
                  constitution, and she had no charity for physical inability. If she could have
                  made the world, she would have had no feeble-minded or sick people in it; she had
                  sublime patience with a broken leg or a crushed head, when caused by accident, but
                  for delicate constitutions, or nervous temperaments, she not only felt no
                  sympathy, but she felt and showed contempt. Then she worshiped utility and
                  constant doing, acting and achieving. I was content with mere living. I had great
                  faith in that line of Milton,—
               
                  
                     "Those also serve who only stand and wait."
                  
               
               There was always delicious, exquisite repose for my spirit in the idea of those
                  angels on either side of the throne of heaven who float with hands folded meekly
                  over their breasts, adoring in silence for evermore. She thought the heart a
                  useless appendage; duty was her great word; caresses and sweet affectionate words
                  between mother and child she just barely endured, but between friend and friend
                  was too much for her patience, or rather impatience, to support; "affectation" and
                  "nonsense" were her favorite terms for such "exhibitions," as she called them.
                  Such natures as Marie's and mine could not live without showing; the feelings and
                  emotions of our hearts; we were demonstrative to those we loved, cold as death to
                  those we did not; kindness, and tenderness, and sweet loving words, were to us as
                  breath and sunshine to the plant. God made the strong eagle to face the sun
                  unwinkingly, to live up in the high dreary clouds; but he made also the beautiful
                  flower-world, and the happy floating butterfly, and the sweet warm atmosphere of
                  the brilliant garden part of the globe. How many times I tried Tante Octavie's
                  patience by not talking these views—for I have never had courage or
                  self-possession enough to argue with any one—but for acting them! I aided the
                  rebellious and helped to fortify the weak subjects in her little kingdom. I think
                  at one time she positively hated me; I was her Mordecai, sitting at the gates of
                  the palace content; I have no doubt she often wished to be an autocrat, just to
                  punish me. And yet I could do Tante Octavie justice. I appreciated and honored all
                  that was great and excellent in her. I will give here a little sketch of her
                  history, that all may have the same reason to appreciate her as I had, and I can
                  do it while the company is assembling in the lecture-room and Tante Octavie and I
                  are talking platitudes over Suisse scenery.
               She was married young to a man she loved fondly—for she had loved once in her
                  life, to be sure, in her way. Her husband was a professor in an institution
                  something like her own. Their income was a modest one, but ample for their wants,
                  for Madame Eperveil was a woman of the simplest tastes. A few months after their
                  marriage a difficulty arose between her husband and his chief, and he lost his
                  place. Thus they were without anything in the world to live on. Mr. Eperveil was
                  an industrious man, but he needed work to be prepared for him; he luckily had a
                  wife who loved just that sort of business.
               "Let us go to Peilz and set up an institution of our own," she said, the first
                  night after he lost his professorship; and they sat looking at each other and
                  talking over their position. Her husband stared at her; he must have thought his
                  wife daft, so impossible seemed such a proceeding; but he had too
                  much respect for his own peace and quiet, as well as his wife's capability and
                  judgment, to say anything. She proceeded
                  to state how it could be done, and ended by convincing him of the possibility of
                  her plan. Of course she did, for Tante Octavie had always a way of morally
                     "necking" people and forcing them to be convinced. They first
                  rented a small house—on nothing; issued circulars, and opened school on the same
                  intangible substance; but pupils came—first little boys, then larger ones. After a
                  decade of years, they found themselves sufficiently prosperous to purchase a wood
                  and a vineyard adjoining the house they had first rented, and which they by this
                  time owned. This land they turned into the beautiful grounds of Institution
                  Eperveil. Gradually rose the fine center building, with lecture and recitation
                  rooms, and dormitories for the unmarried tutor and elder students; then the
                  surrounding houses for the professors and their families; and at last their own
                  commodious house. Her gift for command, her great power in managing, made the
                  thing go like clock-work.
               After the institution was fairly established, Mr. Eperveil died. He was no great
                  loss in a business way to his wife, as she never allowed him to be anything more
                  than head master. However, I have no doubt she felt as sorry for his death as her
                  well-occupied time would permit, for he had always been to her a faithful, meek,
                  and obedient husband. But she had her hands too full to think or feel for mere
                  sentimental troubles; as she would have said, "She had her living to earn and
                  other people to look out for; she had no time to indulge herself in useless
                  laments over events that must occur in the ordinary course of nature;" and to do
                  her justice, she did a great deal for "other people" that was of infinite service.
                  She helped her husband's father to educate and establish the younger children of
                  his family, each one of which, however, detested her most cordially, and resented
                  her assistance instead of being grateful. She had not a gracious way of bestowing
                  her favors, and was apt to destroy gratitude by ungenerously exacting it. She
                  never had a child of her own, poor woman! That was the great defect of her
                  condition. To have borne and brought forth a little child would have touched her
                  cold heart and caused a well-spring to gush up and overflow her whole being with
                  the beneficent tide of tenderness and love. Once, when very much incensed against
                  her for some cruel speech she had made about my acute nervous sufferings, I
                  said,—
               "Poor Madame Eperveil! God has left her imperfect—motherless; this is the reason
                  why she is so unfeeling."
               She overheard me, and it caused a suspension of hostilities between us for some
                  time and I am sure she must have felt the truth of my retort. Yes, Madame Octavie
                  Eperveil was a remarkable woman; it was a great pity she had not been born empress
                  or queen, that she might have had full scope for her governing abilities, and God
                  was very good when he placed me, timid, trembling, fierce little Fanny Pauvette,
                  quite out of her kingdom. I believe I have said all the good and bad that I know
                  of Tante Octavie. Oh, no I I have forgotten one thing; she had a weakness; yes, an
                  actual weakness, and it was for the brilliant good-for-nothing Octave Bouvreuil.
                  He was her idol, her object in life. Being her god-child and bearing her name, she
                  had early begun to regard him as her own child. He was too insouciant and selfish
                  to care for her iron rule. But she never attempted to rule him; he might have
                  governed her, had he not been too indolent to control any one. It is very odd, to
                  be sure, that just such people as Tante Octavie, when they do have a weakness, are
                  apt to have a worse one than all the faiblesses
                  put together of the other part of mankind whom they despise and for this weakness
                  they will sacrifice blindly so much.
               But the company have assembled in the lecture-room, and it is time for Madame
                  Eperveil and her cortege to go also, that the performance may commence.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER IX.
               THE CONCERT.
               THE lecture-hall was a fine large oblong room, plainly furnished; the walls and
                  ceilings were painted a neutral shade, with the simple decoration of panel
                  outlines and cornice in gold. The long windows were shaded by folding blind
                  shutters on the inside, and the semicircular tops filled with crimson moreen
                  plaited into a gold crescent, which gave a little cheerfulness in its effect on
                  the cold hue of the walls. Neatly painted benches filled the greater part of the
                  hall, but toward the upper part were comfortable chairs and sofas covered with
                  crimson, which were intended for Madame Eperveil's guests and the professors and
                  their wives. An elevated platform extended across the upper part of the room,
                  which had broad steps leading up to it. Part of this platform was cut off by a
                  heavy crimson curtain falling from the ceiling, which concealed behind it the
                  arrangements of a little theater; for sometimes the students played French
                  dramas—not entire, but scenes which required only male actors. Two pianos and some
                  musical instruments occupied each side of the platform on the outside of the
                  curtain; a movable desk ordinarily stood in front, for the use of the professors
                  who lectured there daily to the students; this was removed and some music stands
                  stood in its place. I was surprised to see a row of foot-lights extending around
                  the outer edge of the platform, and on expressing my astonishment to Marie and
                  being overheard by Madame Eperveil, she turned graciously to me as if very well
                  pleased to have a subject for conversation with me.
               "Whenever I have young artists to play for me," she said, "like those of to-night,
                  who intend to appear in public, I always give them the benefit of foot-lights; it
                  accustoms them early to this often embarrassing accessory of the stage; also when
                  our young gentlemen give us dramatic representations, it produces a better
                  effect."
               "Oh, they certainly add to the illusion intended to be created," I replied,
                  scarcely knowing what to say.
               "I do not like too much stage illusion," she answered rather quickly. "I think
                  with Girardin, that theatrical illusion and emotion are two different things, so I
                  have our stage as simple as possible. The art of decoration and mise en scène, as we call it, has been developed to
                  excess in our day. We ought to have dramatic emotions a hundred times more lively
                  and strong than our ancestors, who had such coarse and imperfect stage
                  accessories. But, au contraire, although the
                  illusion produced is perfect, the emotion is nothing, and the taste and desire for
                  the drama are very weak when compared with those which reigned an age or so
                  back."
               "But," I replied with some exertion, for she paused and looked as if she expected
                  an answer of agreement or dissent, "an age or so back, you forget that on your own
                  stage you had Molières, and Racines, and Corneilles. No wonder there existed then
                  a taste for the drama, when one could go nightly and see such chefs-d'œuvre as their works."
               "We have Molières now," she said in a positive tone, "if the public will demand
                  them; moreover, Scribe has in him twice the cleverness of a Molière, because he
                  produces an effect on a blazé public."
               "The public taste has turned toward the opera," I remarked; the people prefer new
                  operas from favorite composers to the drama."
               "Yes, and for such amusements," she replied in a tone which was intended to show
                  what an indifferent opinion she entertained for the opera; "for such amusements
                     decoration is necessary, as music is
                  only an amusement, not a study, like the drama, capable of elevating the mind; and
                  how well they understand all that sort of thing in Paris! My nephew, who has
                  lately returned from there, was telling me yesterday of the preparations he saw
                  being made for the bringing out of Halévy's Magicienne. The ballet is to occupy a large place in it. The painters
                  and scene decorators are at work night and day, and he tells me it would be
                  difficult to imagine anything more superb than it will be."
               I wanted to combat her unjust opinion of music, but the curtain rose, showing a
                  simply furnished salon occupied by a middle-aged man with two young girls, his
                  daughters, standing by a center-table, sorting over some music. The father
                  advanced to the foot-lights with the girls and bowed, then seated himself at one
                  of the pianos, while one girl with a violoncello and the other with a violin took
                  their position near the music stands. They were very young; the eldest, the
                  violoncellist, being apparently about fourteen, the violinist a year or two
                  younger. They were dressed simply in rose-colored and white-checked silks, made
                  close up to the throat and tight to the wrists. Their waving hair was cut short,
                  and lay in little soft curls around the temples and back of the neck. The figure
                  of the eldest showed the effect produced by close practice on her heavy
                  instrument; already one shoulder was partially elevated and her chin was thrown
                  forward, giving a pained expression to her countenance. She had good firm
                  features, but a serious expression of the eye told she already felt the weight of
                  the future on her, and which said, like Shylock, "sufferance is the badge of all
                  our tribe." This is, alas! the truth, so far as the mediocre are concerned who
                  choose the stage for their livelihood. The younger one looked well fitted for her
                  profession; there was no suffering or sufferance about her business to her. She
                  took her stand with the most perfect aplomb; her
                  whole little figure was erect and well poised. She was prettier than her sister,
                  had brilliant black eyes, finely arched brows, and a beautiful mouth, and chin.
                  There was the same froideur that characterized
                  her sister's face, but in her it amounted to almost positive scorn, and the cool
                  manner in which she looked at her audience was amusing. Afterwards I discovered
                  that she was near-sighted, and was spared that one great trial of her
                  profession—the clear perception of "the sea of heads and waves of eyes" beneath
                  her.
               Their opening piece was an arrangement from Lucia, very cleverly
                  selected and not too long. The fine finale of
                  the second act, always popular, formed the first movement, and it closed with the
                  touching finale of the opera. The little violinist displayed as much feeling as
                  talent, and when she repeated some of the phrases à mi
                     voix, the effect was delicious; it had the mysterious silvery sound
                  of the nightingale song, as heard by moonlight in an orange-grove, a sort of
                     crêpucscule vocal. The piece put the whole
                  audience into a good humor, and the artists were applauded and complimented to
                  their full contentment, and the curtain fell as they retired bowing, with lowered
                  eyes. I had observed during the piece a person fluttering uneasily about, crying
                     "Brava" and "Bene," officiously; and when the audience testified their
                  approbation, although one of the audience himself, he seemed to take the applause
                  as a personal compliment.
               "Who is that man?" I asked of Marie, after the curtain fell and Tante Octavie left
                  me to go to the rest of her guests.
               "Who?"
               "That fussy person talking now to Octave, evidently boring him to death. What a
                  shrill voice he has!"
               "That! Oh, he is our village Thalberg, Tante Octavie's professeur de musique, Mr. Wolfmaister."
               "A German?"
               "Yes; that is, of a German family from Berne, and educated by good masters; he was
                  a pupil for two years of Chopin."
               
               I looked at the man with more respect. "He is a clever musician, then?" I
                  inquired.
               "Passablement. But how pert and presumptuous I
                  am! Yes, he is indeed a very fine executant and well skilled in the theory of
                  music; he can explain to you in the most profound and difficult style all about
                  the Septime Chord and the Diminished Septime Chord, and every triad to be
                  mentioned, Diminished, Dominant, Major, and Minor Tiriads. He has been the only
                  master I have ever had, and I ought to speak more respectfully of him; but, to
                  tell the truth, we are beginning to disagree in music; he does not like my
                  'sprouting wings,' as he calls my independent opinions as to expression, etc.
               "What, the color or the shape?" I asked laughingly.
               "Indeed, I fancy he does not like me to have wings at all," she said, shrugging
                  her shoulders; "he treats me and all my musical fancies pretty much as Tiennet did
                  poor Joset's performance on the cornemuse in Maitres
                     Sonneurs."
               "Ah, you have read that far, have you?"
               Just then Octave approached and presented Wolfmaister, more from the desire to rid
                  himself of a bore than to give pleasure to any one of us. Wolfmaister was a tall,
                  slender man, with small, sharp gray eyes, and straight, dark hair, which he wore
                     à la Liszt; he had a shrill high voice, and a
                  manner of expressing himself that denoted settled opinions and a great desire to
                  be considered perfectly rational and free from nonsense. We talked of the
                  interesting young artists we had just heard; they were friends of his. The father
                  was preparing them both for public exhibition.
               "The eldest looks already as if she suffered from too close application," I
                  said.
               "Yes," he replied, "her father spoke of it to me to-night; he intends resting her
                  as much as possible, which she can scarcely spare the time to do, as she is not
                  half so quick as her sister, although very clever."
               "Pity her father should make a violoncellist of her. Does she like her
                  profession?"
               "Not very much; but you see it looks better; it will produce a finer effect, the
                  two sisters playing together."
               "Poor child! has she a mother?"
               "No, their mother died many years ago."
               The curtain just then rose, and the little violinist played for a solo a passage
                  from Euryanthe, and made her violin sound like a woman's voice, full of deep
                  feeling, at once passionate and chaste. Her management of the harmonics gave a
                  delicious sound, crystalline and fairy-like, carrying my imagination off into that
                  supernatural world of which Weber is the high-priest and ruler. The elder one sat
                  near the piano, a little in the back ground and while her sister drew out her
                  beautiful music, she sat listening with a sad, wearied, hopeless look. How my
                  heart yearned toward her, and I longed to take the poor child in my arms and be a
                  mother to her!—she needed tender nursing and loving care.
               Some four or five years after I heard this same young violinist, Michela Casini,
                  at the San Carlo, in Naples. The whole musical world were in ecstasies with her
                  great genius and her fine execution on this instrument, so rarely seen in the
                  hands of a woman. I looked in vain for the poor suffering sister; a celebrated
                  violoncellist supplied her place, and was proud to accompany Michela. I met her
                  afterwards at a soirée at Mercadante's, and made her acquaintance. After I was
                  sufficiently intimate I inquired about the elder sister, and heard that she had
                  died about two years after I had first listened to them at Institution Eperveil;
                  the disease of the spine just showing itself then had increased, and God had
                  mercifully relieved her of her painful life-burden. Michela Casini has led a
                  spotless life in her dangerous position of successful and flattered woman-artist.
                  I often think, fancifully perhaps, that her sister's spirit has been allowed to
                  float around and protect her from the temptations surrounding her; for the memory
                  of this sister is a treasured thought to
                  her, and her calm resigned sorrow for her death gives depth and feeling to her
                  music.
               But I have wandered far away from the concert at Institution Eperveil. After this
                  exquisite solo of Michela, we had an animated conversation on a variety of
                  subjects. Octave condescended to be amusing and kept our little circle in
                  convulsions of laughter. He told us a droll story of Berlioz. Some one had said
                  that the author of the Symphony of Harold would not dare to attack
                     realism in music, for in that symphony he had imitated the boiling
                  of lentils or haricots in a porridge pot. Instead of getting angry at such an
                  absurd charge, as many sensitive artists would, he very coolly replied,—
               "My musical critic has made a great mistake, but I have a soul sufficiently large
                  to pardon him, as I know it is necessary to be a musician by profession to
                  understand such beauties as are so flagrantly misunderstood by him. My critical
                  amateur's ear should have more experience before he presumes upon describing such
                  delicate expressions. The sound alluded to in the Symphony of Harold is not the
                  boiling of lentils or haricots, but the boiling of a porridge pot of—beans! My
                  critic has mistaken the vegetable entirely, and it is a grave mistake. Just think
                  for an instant. Beans! The doctrine of Pythagoras! See the concatenation of
                  suggestions. Words fail me to express all that can be conjured up by the classical
                  imagination. I have put him on the scent now by this disclosure. I have opened up
                  a world of ideas to him. I do not ask for gratitude, but leave my brother
                  amateur-critic to his meditations."
               It would be in vain to attempt to describe Octave's inimitable manner of giving
                  this story. Every gesture, every inflection of the voice was filled with that
                  delicate bitter humor of the Parisian, which is like some pungent scent, as biting
                  as it is volatile. Some of the elder students who were his protégés gathered eagerly around us, and a small minority, not of
                  the elect, tried not to listen in the background; but he received a fall share of
                  applause, which was very grateful to him, for he had that morbid desire for
                  approbation which Jefferson calls "a canine love of praise." While we
                  were enjoying his good humor, word came that the elder Casini, had been taken very
                  ill, and that the trio they had intended to play would have to be given up.
               "Casini wanted Michela to play another solo, but she refused with a show of temper
                  I should not like to see a daughter of mine display," said Wolfmaister, shrugging
                  his shoulders. "Strange, that elder one is mortally afraid of her father, while
                  this little termagant rules him like a tyrant."
               "I am glad to hear it," I replied. "That selfish, calculating-looking man needs
                  something like that to keep him in order. He will kill that eldest girl!"
               "Oh," said Wolfmaister, "you are allowing your prejudices to exaggerate the
                  matter. Casini is only a thrifty father, with a commendable deal of forethought
                  for his children. He wishes to give her a lucrative profession; it is not his
                  fault that she is sickly. How many are there who would leave her to earn her
                  living as she best could at seamstress work or the like."
               "And I have no doubt he would," I answered, "if he could make as much fame and
                  fortune by it."
               Wolfmaister shrugged his shoulders and walked off, while Marie gave me an
                  approving nod. Soon after he ascended the platform and played a solo on the piano
                  in the place of the Trio manqué. It was a sonate
                  of Hummel, as clear and liquid as a mountain spring; but it suggested no thought,
                  no idea for the imagination to dwell on or develop; indeed it was nothing but fine
                  musical versification. After he left the piano and joined us, I complimented him
                  on his touch, rapidity, and clearness of execution.
               "Your trill is exquisite, it has all the battement du
                     gozier of a bird's warble."
               He looked immensely gratified, and twisted the gummed ends of his black mustache with an amusing air of
                  gratified self-conceit as he said,—
               "Hummel I place among the first masters of the piano. If I have any merit as an
                  executant, I owe it to my close study of his works. There is a limpidity, a
                  clearness of tone obtained by saying Hummel, which no other master gives."
               Marie yawned impatiently, and looked entreatingly at me to answer him.
               "You mean," I said, "that his works are useful for study of execution, not for any
                  benefit that one can obtain in the way of expressing musical thought, certainly.
                  To be sure, I am not an instrumentalist; the little I do in the way of music is
                  with my voice, and therefore I should not depend on my fancy and liking as correct
                  instrumental taste, yet I must confess Hummel's works do not satisfy me."
               "Oh," replied Wolfmaister, in that civil overbearing tone so many men use when
                  discussing with a woman, "that is because you are not sufficiently acquainted with
                  his works. His rondo in La, par example, and
                  indeed the majority of his musical compositions, are of the purest and highest
                  style."
               Wolfmaister looked profound and learned as he enunciated this settled opinion as a
                  fixed fact, and I remained silent, as I always do when put down by a noun of the
                  masculine gender. Had he been an intelligent woman I should have given my reasons
                  for my differences of opinion, certain of being allowed to express myself calmly
                  and clearly without any assumption of superior knowledge on her part to silence
                  me; and even if we continued to differ, we would do so with mutual courtesy and
                  respect for each other's right to have a different opinion. But with very few men
                  can women argue; the man grows imperious, the woman resentful, and the
                  conversation is apt to end a little too volcanic in its temperature for
                  peace-loving dispositions.
               A little while after Marie came to me and said, "I am going to play."
               "What?" I asked.
               "I shall not tell you. I shall leave you to be my Brulette."
               The permission to read some of Madame Sand's works had been given by her
                  liberal-minded, indulgent father, with the responsibility placed on me of
                  selecting them for her, a responsibility I was quite willing to take; and the
                  first ones I had given her were "Maîtres Sonneurs" and "Lettres d'un Voyageur,"
                  which two had made a strong impression on her; she was constantly repeating some
                  striking artistic description or some concise artistic definition. From her last
                  words I supposed she was about to play one of her own compositions or
                  arrangements, which she was just in that transition state to throw out freely; she
                  had mastered the difficulties of form,—the mysteries of counterpoint, which are
                  like feet, accent, and grammatical rhythm to the poet,—and her fresh young
                  imagination, thus untrammeled, was eager to use its wings. The characteristics of
                  Marie's compositions at that time were a very lively feeling for certain beauties;
                  an accent of grandeur and melancholy ran like a burning lava stream through all
                  her chords and resolutions; there might have been observed a little too free a use
                  of difficult moduluations, strange combinations of distant intervals, which arose
                  from a natural exultation she felt at the power she had obtained by mastering so
                  difficult a study as harmony; but her taste, if it was not always free from the
                  exaggeration of mere technical difficulties, was never common; and in her
                  arrangements of the themes from other authors she displayed a skill which was very
                  clever, of taking to herself the motifs that she
                  was developing, marking them with her own personal seal, as it were, giving them
                  an originality and making of them veritable creations.
               This étude or sketch which she played was full of grandeur; but the thought was
                  imperfectly developed and the execution inexact. The idea she desired to express
                  was evidently beyond her powers; it was an ébauche of some vision of her spirit; as she advanced in it I
                  fancied that it was the memory of some
                  of those dreams we have at certain seasons, when it seems as if the spirit had
                  been emancipated by sleep from its mortal part and able to soar off into a purer
                  element. But in sketching from memory, in endeavoring to give her recollection to
                  mortal ears, it was evident that her own mental and mortal nature had interfered.
                  One felt as if, at the period of composition, her whole being had been influenced
                  by the preoccupation of some sad thought, like a remembrance or anticipation of
                  trouble. The impression it produced on me was déchirante, though the whole piece was vague and disjointed; it
                  affected me deeply because I was beginning to understand the girl's character, and
                  learning to love as well as admire her. But the composition naturally fell
                  lifeless on the ears of her audience; with the sensitiveness of a true artist she
                  felt this, and rose from the piano wearied and dispirited, looking as gray as a
                  moth in her ashen paleness.
               "See if I deserve the name of your Brulette," I asked, taking her little cold hand
                  affectionately. "Your piece was un rêve, was it
                  not? With visions and fancies far beyond rude, dull mortal comprehensions."
               Her eyes grew bright, and the pupils of them dilated in a manner peculiar to her
                  when she felt deeply touched.
               "Yes, you are my Brulette; God bless you!" she said, pressing my hand. "You are
                  right; it is un rêve suggested by that passage
                  in 'Lettres d'un Voyageur,' where Madame Sand speaks of being visited in her
                  dreams by unknown friends who, while she is seated on a sandy shore, alone and
                  sad, come to her in a gay bark and invite her to join them, saying, 'Why have you
                  tarried? we have waited so long for you.' She goes with them, and they float off
                  to an unknown land, a land of enchantment, where all is brilliant and gay—the
                  flowers unfading, the odors ever fresh, fountains whose perfumed sparkling waters
                  fall into silver basins; blue roses bloom in rare China vases; from the long
                  vistas of trees open enchanting perspectives; the ground is covered with a
                  moss-like like velvet, on which they dance unshod; the men and women are young and
                  beautiful, crowned with flowers, their rich hair floating; they hold in their
                  hands goblets and harps of strange forms; their songs and their voices are not of
                  this world; their emotions are holy, pure loves; and they feel a happiness also
                  unknown to poor mortals."
               While she was repeating this to me in an earnest, low tone, Wolfmaister came up to
                  take leave and to present his wife, a sweet, gentle little Suisse woman, whose
                  unaffected, naïve manners pleased me
                  exceedingly.
               "Ah, Marie," he said, "the composer of your rêve, whose name you will not tell me, is one of those incomprehensible
                  æsthetical composers so plenty now-a-days, who take unformed, crude, vague
                  imaginings for thought, and exaggerations of sotto
                     voce for an expression of deep feeling. You had better keep clear of
                  all such eccentric productions, and get your style and taste firmly based on solid
                  models. Study Hummel more, mon élève."
               Marie winced, but said nothing. After he left, she burst out with "Wolfmaister is
                  right; it is a crude, vague thing: I know it as well as any one can tell me," and
                  a hot tear of bitter mortification rolled down her cheek. "I do not satisfy
                  myself," she continued. "Oh, Fanny Fauvette! it is in me, and surely the power of
                  expression will be given me some day."
               I laughed at her for taking his rough criticisms so much to heart, and encouraged
                  her by telling her all the pleasant thoughts I felt about her and her genius.
               "Hush!" she said, kissing me on either cheek affectionately; "you must not flatter
                  me so, or I shall never do anything but grow conceited."
               "I do not believe that," I answered; "the good opinion of those we love is an
                  incitement. We have enough disparagement from the envious or indifferent; enough
                  discouragement and misgivings in our own hearts to depress us; we have nothing to
                  hold us up and spur us on but the ambition tion to attain to not only our own standard, but to
                  that which the faith of those who love us indulgently has made for us."
               We were interrupted, and I went to bid adieu to Madame Eperveil and thank her in
                  the prettiest words I could find for the pleasure of the evening. She gave me
                  earnest and gracious invitations to visit her frequently and sociably, and after a
                  multitude of courtesies—as Octave said with playful malice, like two ladies of
                  olden times preparing to dance a minuet à la
                     cour—we parted; I joined the Bouvreuils and Merles, and we left
                  Institution Eperveil.
            
            
               CHAPTER X.
               LES CRETES.
               The autumn weather had opened so finely that it tempted me out almost daily. My
                  gipsy way of enjoying open-air life caused some surprise and amusement to my Peilz
                  friends. They were accustomed to making long excursions, taking long mountain
                  walks for some particular purpose, such as to see a fine extended view, or to
                  visit some remarkable waterfall or little mountain lake; expeditions where the
                  fatigue always counterbalanced the pleasure, to one who had so little physical
                  strength as I had to spare. But they had not the pleasant habit of taking baskets
                  of books and work and spending the whole day in some woody nook, where they could
                  read, and talk, and sew, to the sweet accompaniment of the wind, rushing through
                  the trees, and the rush and plash of the waters of mountain streams.
               Tante Octavie said it might do well enough for people who had plenty of time, and
                  a dozen coaches and valets to transport their luggage and wait on them, while they
                  did nothing but lounge about in picturesque costumes; but so far as the
                  performance of any real work or study was concerned, the four walls of a house
                  made the best place for its accomplishment. I do not know whether it was the
                  announcing of this opinion of the family oracle which influenced Madame Bouvreuil
                  and Helene, or whether it was that they really did not like such excursions; for
                  while they good-humoredly endeavored to understand the pleasure it gave me, they
                  never joined me, except once in awhile, when they would come in the after part of
                  the day to meet me and accompany me on my walk home, and confined their sympathy to the preparation of nice dinner
                  baskets—a sympathy, however, which was not without its value, and which I fully
                  appreciated when at midday my appetite would be finely sharpened by fresh air; but
                  at the same time I should have liked also to have had their society. Marie and
                  Tante Cecile, however, took to these "days in the woods" immediately, especially
                  the latter, who, whenever she could arrange the home department in a manner to
                  work well without her, joined me, and always urged Marie to do so when she could
                  not.
               "I remember with so much pleasure," she said one evening, "some years of my
                  girlhood which were spent with an uncle who lived in the North of Germany. He
                  owned a handsome estate in the country, on which were all the agreeable
                  accessories of a forest, with moss-covered walks, and banks, waterfalls, hills,
                  and dales, and even a pretty little glassy lake. There was a large family of
                  cousins, a bright intelligent set, all dead now, and the old lady sighed gently.
                  "Well, these days in the woods remind me of those pleasant times of my youth.
                  During all the favorable months of the year my uncle and his family lived in the
                  open air—that is, all the waking hours of the day. We sang, danced, read, talked,
                  and even took our meals in this charming silvan place. My uncle and his children
                  were all passionate lovers of the drama, especially of the works of the great
                  English dramatist Shakspeare, and they often acted those of his plays which suited
                  their forest glades. We used to act 'Midsummer Night's Dream,' 'As you like it,'
                  Two Gentlemen of Verona,' and 'Love's Labor Lost,' with great glee, under the old
                  trees."
               "Your way of visiting the woods, however," I replied, "was in the way Madame
                  Eperveil condescends to approve of, 'with plenty of valets,' etc.; but I am
                  content to enjoy the woods more humbly and without so much luxury."
               "And enjoy it quite as much," she rejoined, "and probably more than if you had a
                  half dozen liveried valets, for with great wealth are apt to come
                  conventionalisms, and they mar all natural pleasures. No, I think you and Marie
                  enjoy your woodland sojournings, and will recall there in after years with as much
                  pleasure as I do the more luxurious memory of my youth. I have no doubt,
                  conventionalisms often spoiled the enjoyment of my uncle and cousins; but I was
                  too young to recognize such artificial constraints, and at that happy age when one
                  sees only the brightest and easiest side of a pleasure."
               I had gone around to the chateau to tell them of a sweet day I had spent at Les
                  Crêtes alone, the day before, and also to urge them to go with me the following
                  day to the same place. While we were talking, Octave and a student from the
                  institution, a young Englishman named Gardner, who played on the violoncello
                  tolerably well, came in. They had brought their instruments, and wished to
                  practice with Marie some trios. They took up the grand trio of Fesca, that
                  brilliant production of that remarkable, wayward genius, and I sat listening, with
                  my heart full of memories, which this trio summoned up as if by magical power.
                  Octave played the violin very well; his tone was clear and just, not tender, but
                  full of diablerie, which characteristic told
                  well in the Fesca music; he gave it just that cutting, sarcastic expression it
                  needed. A wild, merry, careless imp seemed to sit astride the bridge when his bow
                  played across the strings, and sang out with fearless, mad glee the reckless
                  melody of the composer, whose works seemed to repeat his own life-faith, which was
                  like that of Marshal Saxe: "La vie est un songe, le mien a
                     été court, mais il a été beau."
               After hearing them play twice over this beautiful trio, I asked Octave to sing,
                  and he selected Don Giovanni, out of which, with Gardner's help, who had a pretty
                  good basso voice, we sang the exquisite trio, Ah taci
                     ingiusto core. Then Octave sang La ci darem
                     la mano with me, and then alone Il mio
                     tesoro. His voice was a delicious baritone, very mellow and flexible.
                  He sang with a great deal of
                  expression, and sometimes it even sounded like deep feeling. After the singing, we
                  got into a long talk over the music of Don Giovanni, or rather Octave did the
                  talking and we the listening. It arose from my saying that when Beethoven was
                  asked which one of Mozart's operas he preferred, without hesitation he pronounced
                     Il Flauto Magico his chef-d'œuvre.
               "I should suppose," said Octave, sneeringly, "that would have been the opinion of
                  a man who wrote a symphony, put words to it, and then wished to have it called an
                  opera."
               "Not a word against Fidelio, heretic!" cried Marie.
               "Not unless you persist in calling it an opera, which it is not. However, do not
                  let us get on that never-ending Beethoven argument. Don Giovanni, Mademoiselle
                  Fauvette, is the greatest opera, indeed the only opera of that epoch."
               We did not pretend to dispute with him, for we all loved to listen to him in his
                  eloquent moods, and the music had just excited him enough to make him superb. He
                  walked up and down the chateau salon, and discoursed on the Mozart theme until
                  near midnight, his graceful form shown to every advantage by his animated motions,
                  the eloquent action of his beautiful hand, and the expression of his sparkling,
                  handsome face, with the brilliant eyes and luxuriant dark hair floating
                  picturesquely over his temples. I could not pretend to give even a slight idea of
                  his eloquence, for it was like that of the improvisatore, as evanescent as the
                  rainbow on the fast, rushing ocean wave.
               He illustrated his subject by singing different passages of the opera to Marie's
                  fine accompaniment, and threw in every variety of expression as it was needed;
                  there was the lubberly Masetto, and the roguish Leporello; the sighing, sad Don
                  Ottavio, and the elegant rascal Don Giovanni. Then he made Marie and Gardner help
                  him in the scene in the cemetery, where Don Giovanni gives the defiant invitation
                  to the statue of the Commendatore. First, he brought up before us by rapid, vivid
                  word-sketchings, the appearance of the graveyard, the dark gusty night, and the
                  remorseful wind moaning through the trees. When he sang the bold bravado of the
                  murderer to the stone effigy placed over the grave of his victim,— 
                     
                        "Parlate! se potete: Verete a cena? Verete a cena?"
                     
                   and the reply of the Commendatore, "Si!" came out in the solemn note of the
                  piano,—that strange mi major, which makes just in that passage such a peculiarly
                  ghastly sound,—it made us all shudder; and the powerful effect produced was
                  heightened by Octave hissing out, in snake-like tones, the mad, reckless, even
                  devilish rejoinder,—
               
                  
                     "Bizarra è in ver la scena, verra il buon vecchio a cena,
                     A preparar la andiamo, partiamo via di qua."
                  
               
               At last we bade good night, and separated; Marie agreeing to go with me next day
                  to Les Crêtes, Tante Cecile, with real sorrow, regretting her inability to
                  accompany us.
               According to agreement, Dora, Beau, and I were ready de
                     bonne heure. Marie did not keep us long waiting, and before eight
                  o'clock we were en route for Les Crêtes. It was
                  a delicious autumn day. The grapes were hanging in rich golden clusters on the
                  vines, the hay lay in fragrant heaps on the little fields, the nuts and fruit were
                  weighing the tree branches down to the grassy earth, and everywhere the ground was
                  covered with the delicate lilac-colored autumn crocus. The ivy and moss crept over
                  every old wall and chestnut trunk, and their various shades of vivid green mingled
                  harmoniously with the purple flowers and young red leaves of the bindweeds, while
                  tufts of delicate fern peeped out here and there.
               While Dora was arranging our books and shawls behind the little western hill of
                  Les Crêtes, where we might sit sheltered effectually from the sight of other
                  pedestrian visitors to this lovely spot, Marie and I clambered up and down the banks, stood on the edge of the woody
                  hill overhanging the terraced vineyards which led down to the lake road, and
                  admired for the thousandth, time the beautiful shore of our lovely Lake of the
                  Desert. There lay Clarens and Vernet, basking in the morning sun; and Veytaux and
                  Montreux, nestling behind the mountains, seemed scarcely awakened. Numberless
                  little boats stood perched on the glassy bosom of the lake, looking just ready to
                  flap their sail wings and soar aloft, like some huge Grêebe, into the clouds. The surface of the lake was like a polished
                  steel mirror, showing different shades of light, but not one ripple that could
                  give a sign of its being water. A steamer passed, cutting swiftly through the blue
                  glassy mass; it made a path for itself, and threw up, instead of spray or feathery
                  foam, hard sparkling balls, which fell on the surface of the lake like hailstones,
                  shivering into numberless, smaller balls, which rebounded off and disappeared as
                  if touching some hard icy substance; and behind the steamer the path seemed to
                  close instantly, leaving only a line of a little lighter shade to mark the track
                  of the boat; it looked tempting and made one long to walk on it.
               "Now Kinnaird Graham," said Marie, "would give us scientific, philosophical
                  reasons for that appearance of the lake,—atmospheric pressure, and all that,—but I
                  like to forget all sensible reasons for it, and would rather imagine it to be some
                  strange mysterious power that weighs over it at early morn, noonday, and
                  sunset."
               "You would have a morning, noonday, and evening demon then, Marie?" I asked, with
                  a laugh.
               "As many as you please, Fanny, if you will only take some of the material out of
                  life and give it a little more fancy. Do you remember what Töpffer said, when he
                  visited the Intermittent Fountain, on his Promenade au
                     Grande Chartreuse?"
               I did not, and Marie repeated this fine passage:—
               "It belongs to the learned to seek out and tell the cause of this phenomenon; for
                  my part, I do not wish to know it; with the ignorant who visit this spring, or,
                  still better, with the poets who contemplate it, I love better to drink of its
                  bright waters than sound them. It is still a question to be decided, if science
                  and poesy are two sisters who can live in good friendship under the same roof—the
                  one dreamy, with distaff in her hand; the other, restless, active, and incessantly
                  occupied with weighing, pounding, and filtering; or if they are to be two
                  irreconcilable enemies, one striving to stifle the other, or at least chase her
                  from the dwelling. So long as science remained as she was in antiquity,—religious,
                  conjectural, and contemplative,—she was poesy itself; and instead of the two
                  sisters who now-a-days have so much difficulty in agreeing, there were then nine
                  who lived peaceably united under the shades of Helicon, where they related to each
                  other a fine verse, as well as the marvels of the firmament the enchanting
                  loveliness of the earth, the eloquence of passion, and the secrets of human
                  destiny. But now-a-days, science, distrustful of belief, hostile to everything
                  which cannot be verified by sensation, sets herself up as a supreme dictator; she
                  has become the study of mere matter. Despoiled as much as possible of her
                  sumptuous appearance, of her numberless graces, all the beneficent attributes with
                  which the Creator ornamented her, each step of her progress causes a stone to fall
                  in the crumbling edifice of poesy, and each one of her lights destroys, it is
                  true, on all sides, every mystery; but it is a fire which, while it illuminates,
                  devours!"
               Then we talked of music; and, naturally, of Octave's playing, and singing, and
                  eloquent talking.
               "What a bewitching, captivating diablerie he
                  threw into that allegro of Fesca!" I said; "and how his superb eyes glowed! Then,
                  when he sang La ci darem la mano with me, I
                  thought, very charitably, of the naughty little Zerlina's dubious flirting, as I
                  listened to his seductive voice. He was the veritable Don Giovanni for the
                  nonce."
               Marie stood half leaning, half swinging against an old chestnut-tree, which, growing very crooked, hung
                  over the upper vineyard; and she seemed lost in deep reverie as she looked down on
                  the brilliant mirror of the lake. I almost doubted if she heard my praises of
                  Octave.
               "It is very sad!" she said slowly; then paused.
               "What is sad?" I asked.
               She looked up sharply at me, as if suddenly becoming conscious of my presence, and
                  her large brown eyes dilated as do those of a bird. She continued:—
               "Music, you must admit, Fanny, is to a great extent a matter of sense. I grow more
                  and more convinced daily that the execution of this art, which seems to have so
                  much that is divine in it, is not elevating in its influence over every one."
               I wanted to combat her opinion, but I felt sure she was only thinking aloud, like
                  the professor, and working the subject around in her mind in order to arrive at a
                  satisfactory conclusion. After little silence, she resumed:—
               "You find that great composers are always better in their lives than great
                  executants; these last have to give mortal sound to the voluptuous expression, the
                  tender rise and fall of the sweet sighing sounds, or the bursts of passion which
                  the composer imagines. I may be wrong,mon amie,
                  I have so little knowledge of the outdoor world; but indeed it seems to me that
                  the artist-executant, to give to the vibrating throbbing tone-feeling, mortal
                  life, must be filled with sensuousness."
               "Thank you for that word," I said, with a laugh and a long breath of relieved mock
                  anxiety, "and for no worse one. I have been waiting to see what you would arrive
                  at. Pray go on, for you are not quite clear yet."
               "Oh!" she answered quickly, "you could not have thought I meant sensuality, for
                  that would chill and vulgarize all expression; but the artist-executant must have
                  his feelings correspond with the music he wishes to express; the mysterious
                  throbbing that beats in Chopin, par exemple, or
                  the tumultuous ocean of feeling we find in Beethoven, where the poor human bark
                  toils along, struggling against a head-wind and a fierce, contrary surging
                  current; or the hot lava-tide of love, passion, and mortal appetite, coursing
                  through Fesca. And this is sad, this curse of mortality resting on music-utterance
                  in this life, for the artist-executant is but mortal; and being in this dangerous
                  state that only an angel could bear, he may sway and fall."
               I did not contend directly with her, as I would have done with another situated
                  differently, for I knew she was thinking of Octave, and of the various temptations
                  that she tried to fancy his many gifts of mind and person exposed him to. I wanted
                  to cite numberless instances where as rare gifts had been allied to purity of
                  character,—artist-executants I had known whose lives were as spotless as their
                  genius was sparkling,—and to tell her that what was faulty in Octave did not arise
                  from that which was beautiful in him, but from that which was unlovely: from his
                  selfishness, his indolence, and his "canine love" of that which gave him
                  unlicensed gratification in every desire. I could not tell her all this. I felt
                  that her mind must work it out itself. I had faith in her. I knew that love might
                  blind her for awhile, but that the true knowledge was in her and would clear away
                  all mists of infatuation.
               I turned the conversation on the different styles of execution of various,
                  pianists we had heard in public, and the effect or influence they had produced on
                  us; this led her to say:—
               "I heard during two different visits to Vienna those great artists, T. and L. One,
                  you know, is said to be material and calculating, the other just the reverse. Let
                  me tell you the effect produced on me by each. I heard T. first. After hearing
                  him, I returned home cold, dry, and hard, but very industrious. I attacked Bach
                  for the first time effectually. T.'s playing is the perfection of one kind of
                  expression; not of feeling, however. It is, as De Lanz says: 'The playing of a man of the world; it is this which
                  excludes all idea of poesy attaching itself to his music.' I felt that something
                  was wanting; it sounded like ice-rain on a plate of steel. He seemed resolute and
                  business-like in his art, as if he made of it what other men make of their buying
                  and selling—a trade. He did me this good, however: I studied hard for months; no
                  fire, no poet heat, to be sure, but at the same time no poet languor. My touch
                  grew exact, and my tone clear and crisp, for I was always thinking of that
                  ice-rain. Again I went to Vienna, and heard L. Oh, Fanny, what an awakening to my
                  whole nature did his music cause! it was the ice-rain still, but the steel plate
                  was burning, seething hot. Do not laugh at me when I tell you that every piece was
                  delicious agony. He seemed the poet of the instrument, an inspired rhapsodist; and
                  everything he played appeared as if it sprang from his brain and the instrument,
                  created in its perfect loveliness at one and the same moment. One night he played
                  one of his own Hungarian marches. What fire, what archangel life! And at the
                  close, when the applause was deafening, he returned to the platform and resumed
                  his seat at the piano. The room was silent in an instant; he sat as if unconscious
                  of the presence of the audience, and gazed for a moment or so up, just as he looks
                  in that picture there of the 'Matinée at L.'s;' the same inspired, youthful
                  expression; then there came pouring out that largo of Beethoven, in the senate Re
                  minor, Opus., 29. What unearthly strength he displayed! it roared like the dash of
                  the waves of our beautiful lake in a storm, when the waters seem to rush madly up
                  as if to avoid the cold Rhone torrent; the recitative passage made a solemn pause,
                  to tell all its woes; in vain, the stern necessity rolled on and it was like the
                  cold, icy flood penetrating to the quivering heart-core of the poor lake, while
                  there thundered out the rushing turmoil of nature, the roar of the wind, the
                  tossing of the forest tree-tops, the muffled tramp of a distant avalanche hurrying
                  down a ravine, all sweeping on in the renewed combinations of chords! I leaned my
                  head on my hands, and wept. That night I could not sleep; I tossed to and fro in
                  troubled, inexplicable pain. I returned home a few days after. No Bach, no study
                  for me after that revelation; or, at least, not what Wolfmaister would call study.
                  I just rambled over the keys of the piano in a reverie, sometimes exquisite,
                  sometimes painful. About that time Chopin's music first fell into my hands, and it
                  was like a new world to me—a world lighted with rays more brilliant and more
                  divine than any earthly light. I lived and breathed only in his compositions, and
                  for the first time I felt born within me the desire to be a poet. For, O, Fanny
                  Fauvette, it is sad to be only the artist-executant, not the composer, the
                  creator!"
               Dora came just then to tell us that our little woody nook was ready for us, and we
                  established ourselves there for the rest of the day. On one side we could look
                  down the bank, and through the branches see a little bit of the lake, and on the
                  other side gaze out through the leaves of the old chestnut-trees on Dent de Jaman,
                  whose tower-like peak lay gray and clear against the blue sky. We had brought with
                  us books and sewing, and by turns read to each other; then talked pleasant
                  nonsense and compared our embroidery, or leaned back lazily against the trees and
                  watched the clouds winding around the mountains, and listened to the fall of the
                  nuts, and repeated snatches of poetry. One little poem of Bryant, the "Death of
                  the Flowers," pleased us both so much that we repeated again and again together
                  this verse, as we would have lingered over a fresh little idyl that breathed of
                  forests and mountain rills:—
               
                  
                     "And now, when comes the calm mild day, as still such days will
                     come,
                     To call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter home;
                     When the sound of dropping nuts is heard, though all the trees are
                     still,
                     And twinkle in the smoky light the waters of the rill,
                     The south wind searches for the flowers whose fragrance late he
                     bore,
                     And sighs to find them in the wood and by the stream no more."
                  
               
               
               Near sunset our two quiet lovers and Octave made their appearance on the bank
                  above us. Beau and Octave had a fine romp, while Hélène and Kinnaird talked to us;
                  then they strayed around the hill out on the bank, to watch the sunset and be
                  alone. Beau and Octave by this time were weary, and the dog came panting to rest
                  beside me, while Octave threw himself on the ground in a graceful position.
               "Well, woodland nymphs," he said, "what have you been at to-day? Marie Merle, you
                  and Mademoiselle Fauvette are playing pretend that you are like ladies of
                  old—Angelinas, without your Rolands. But it will not do; you are too artificial,
                  with all your make-believe love for romance and nature; your tableaux vivants en plein air are always Watteauish.
                  Now look at that shawl! Mademoiselle just hitched it up there on purpose, because
                  she knew it would look picturesque."
               And he pointed up, with a malicious laugh, to an old red French cashmere shawl
                  which always accompanied us in our rambles, to be used as a bed for Beau or a
                  temporary screen from sun or air, just as the need required, and which Dora had
                  hung up on the branches of the tree to keep the sun off. I looked up and saw that
                  the shawl did really produce a capital effect, and that, unconsciously, the whole
                  grouping of our arrangements made a beautiful little picture; so I admitted his
                  charge, saying that we must have succeeded, as the effect had struck him so
                  forcibly.
               "You are very cunning, Mademoiselle Fauvette," he said, with saucy
                  playfulness.
               "The only weapon of the weak, Mr. Octave."
               He yawned, criticised the grouping of our tableau, then dragged out the dinner
                  basket, (to Beau's excessive delight,) in order to discover what gourmandes we had been, and made a great rejoicing
                  over the wine bottle.
               "Empty, by Jove!" he cried. "Pardon, Mademoiselle," he added, with mock
                  courtesy.
               After exhausting his raillery on that point, he examined our embroidery.
               "Mademoiselle," he said, "has worked laboriously over one little leaf; it would
                  take a microscope to see the stitches, and there is no beauty in it, after all her
                  labor. Marie has galloped—or "basted," I believe you ladies call
                  it—one whole corner of her handkerchief, making all sorts of tipsy roses and
                  dropsical buds; and, by the gods! here are books; and music, too, as I live! 'Don
                  Giovanni,' 'Festin de Pierre,' 'Memoires de Lorenzo da Ponte,' 'Oubilischeff,'
                  etc., etc. Upon my word, ladies, your inquiries to-day have been not only
                  profound, but on a decidedly fast subject; as rapid, mademoiselle, as your
                  American trotting gait. Rather deep water for you women. Ha, ha! funny to be sure,
                  to see such gentle innocents peeping curiously into what you cannot understand;
                  better let it alone."
               Marie Merle grew pettish and biting; he rallied on, and the two quarreled, half in
                  play half in earnest.
               "I should like to know," he said, after remaining silent awhile over Molière's
                  "Festin de Pierre," "I should like to know," he repeated, as if scarcely knowing
                  what he was saying. He stopped, and continued reading.
               "Eh bien,, Octave," asked Marie, impatiently,
                  "what is it you would like to know?"
               "Patience, mocking bird!" he answered indifferently, without stopping his reading;
                  then, after a short silence, he looked up quizzically, and said: "Now just tell me
                  candidly, what do you two feminines, you babes in the woods, make out of that sad
                  fellow, Don Giovanni? Beg pardon, mademoiselle, I am sure you do not mind my
                  nonsensical familiarity in calling you, as well as my old friend Marie, such
                  pretty names."
               "Not at all," I answered, but I felt like a fool.
               Here was this clever man of the world, younger than I by some years, but very much
                  older in all sorts of Satan knowledge, thrusting himself into our little temple of
                  opinions, and fine feminine philosophy, and delicate poetry of feeling; and such
                  was the influence of his sarcasm, the atmosphere of sparkling, biting wit which hung around him, that
                  it crushed our little temple into nothingness. Yes, all the gracious pillars and
                  delicate adornments faded and crumbled away in the meanest and most cowardly
                  manner. I knew that all our opinions about Don Juan would sound fâde, insipid, and crude to his ears, and instead of
                  combating him as a courageous, bright-witted woman would have done, I just
                  defended myself with the weapons of the weak.
               "Come, mademoiselle," he continued, mercilessly, "you commence. What is your
                  opinion of this terrible fellow, Don Juan?"
               "As Shakspeare says of the devil, Mr. Octave," I answered, "Molière has certainly
                  made him a gentleman."
               I gained my point, and disarmed my opponent of his sneering raillery, by turning
                  his attention from us.
               "You are right," he said, and turning the leaves of the book quickly, he read
                  aloud the last scenes in act third of Molière's "Festin de Pierre" with great
                  grace and excellent expression; those scenes so filled with chivalric courage, and
                  which always make the reader of the play feel sad and deeply interested in the
                  worthless hero. Octave's voice was very impressive, and when he reached that part
                  in scene five, where the elder brother of Don Carlos enters and proves him to be
                  Don Juan, and the detested seducer of their sister for whom they are searching, he
                  threw such a full expression of manly courage into the reply—"Yes, I am Don Juan;
                  and the advantage of number on my own side does not oblige me any longer to hide
                  my name"—that it made our eyes kindle and cheeks flush as if the elegant rascal
                  merited praise for mere animal courage, forgetting how sadly deficient he was in
                  manly honor and truth.
               "By heavens!" cried Octave, after finishing the passage and throwing down the book
                  so violently that he scared Beau into a fierce barking fit, "you are right,
                  mademoiselle; Don Juan was a gentleman!"
               We then talked of the different renderings of this old story of Don Juan; and that
                  curious but interesting book, "Memoires de Lorenzo da Ponte," lying beside me, led
                  to a talk on the life of this eccentric genius. I happened to know something of
                  this poet, who connected eras so far apart together—Metastasio, Mozart, and almost
                  the present day—and interested Octave for a short while by recounting to him all
                  my little ana. This Da Ponte succeeded Metastasio as court poet
                  to the Emperor of Austria. It was in 1785 that Mozart first met him at Vienna; and
                  the poet, under anything but pure or elevating influences, wrote for the great
                  maestro the libretto of Don Giovanni, which is nearer in character to the English
                  poet's material conception of Don Juan than the Frenchman's. Molière's Don Juan is
                  a reckless, bad fellow, to be sure; but his occasional misgivings show that there
                  is a feeling of something better left in him: "One must think of repentance some
                  time, Sganarelle." But Da Ponte's is a heartless, unbelieving, scoffing demon, for
                  whom there can be no hope; he never thinks or talks of repentance.
               I did not tell all this to Octave. Oh, no! If I had, I should have provoked and
                  lighted up all his fire of sarcasm and ridicule of my feminine inexperience. I
                  confined myself to anecdotes of Da Ponte; accounts of how his rival, the poet
                  Casti, after the death of Joseph II., succeeded in having Da Ponte exiled from
                  Vienna, in 1792; but that, although he ousted him, he did not receive the
                  laureatship; it was given to Bertalli. Da Ponte emigrated to the United States in
                  1803, and lived many years in New York, leading a true poet's life of penury and
                  obscurity. I made Octave laugh heartily over a story I had heard from an old
                  friend who had been present when it occurred.
               In 1825, when Garcia visited New York with his daughter Malibran, Da Ponte went to
                  see him. He introduced himself by taking Garcia's hand, and saying, with
                  pardonable pomposity, "I am Lorenzo da Ponte, the author of the libretto of Don
                  Giovanni, and the friend of Mozart."
               
               Garcia made one bound, and, embracing the old poet, sang out in a loud, ringing
                  voice,—
               
                  
                     "Fin ch'han dal vino
                     Calda la testa,
                     Una gran festa
                     Fa preparar."
                  
               
               Da Ponte was so affected that he shed real tears of joy, and of sorrow too, it
                  might be, poor old man! Times were sadly changed with him since the merry days
                  when, as an emperor's favorite, a petted court poet, he had written that famous
                  bacchanal, the very words of which seem dripping with the rich, golden
                  grape-juice. Octave picked up the Mémoires, and
                  dropping the book in one of the deep pockets of his paletot, said,—
               "By your leave, mademoiselle," and sprang down the bank, singing 
                     
                        "Fin ch'han dal vino"
                     
                   so clear and loud, that long after we had lost sight of his fine form, his
                  rich voice came rising up on our ears, brilliant as the beaded bubbles on a fresh
                  filled champagne goblet.
               The crimson sunset colored the Vaudois mountains with a golden violet hue, and the
                  cloud-like mantle around Dent de Jaman was rich as the robes of a king in state.
                  Marie had her arms clasped over a pendant branch of the old chestnut-tree, and was
                  silently swaying to and fro. The red folds of the shawl fell gracefully around
                  her, its richly colored palms giving an oriental effect as they lay gathered
                  together under her arms; the atmosphere seemed dissolving around her; and as I lay
                  leaning against a tree, with half-closed eyes, looking up at her as at some fine
                  picture, the golden and violet particles in the air seemed to mingle in the
                  tresses of her rich brown hair and in the warm hue of her cheeks and the thin red
                  line of her trembling lips, which were just then bearing their most scornful
                  expression sion. Her large brown eyes were looking far, far off—farther even than
                  those brilliant clouds; her soul was growing, almost visibly, and surmounting its
                  weaknesses. Had I been a younger and more inexperienced woman, I should have
                  sought and obtained her confidence, for only the modest timidity of girlhood kept
                  her from telling me all her struggles with her love. And had I possessed faith in
                  that love, even one atom of hope that Octave would make her happy or that her own
                  love could continue for him, I might have encouraged her confidence, little as I
                  approve of confidences of such a sacred feeling; but I had no faith in him nor in
                  the love on either side; I saw Marie growing above and beyond him daily. He and
                  his like might sneer at such spiritual growth, but still it was none the less
                  true; so I sat in silence, apparently admiring the brilliant cloud changes, but in
                  truth admiring and studying the development of the girl into the woman—the
                  struggles of the young poet spirit to throw off all unworthy bonds, and feeling
                  strong faith in the complete victory that would be gained after such a quiet but
                  stern combat with Pandemian love.
               Hélène and her lover joined us, and we walked quietly home together, Marie
                  carrying little tired Beau in her arms. Poor child! her heart filled with sad
                  longings for earthly love, to which her spirit said sternly, No! and insensibly
                  turning to the lowly little dog and pouring out her love yearnings on it. I could
                  not help repeating aloud Mrs. Browning's sonnet to "Flush or Faunus;" and Marie
                  gathered little Beau closer in her arms, as she murmured in a low voice,—
               
                  
                     "thanking the true PAN,
                     Who, by low creatures, leads to heights of love."
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XI.
               CONGÉ AT INSTITUTION EPERVEIL.
               IT was a brilliant autumn. October was as golden as the luscious grapes on the
                  vines. It is the custom in most of the Swiss institutions of education to allow
                  detachments of students to make pedestrian excursions in the mountains, during the
                  summer and autumn months. Töpffer's delightful "Voyages en Zigzag" give a graphic
                  account of these promenades. Several excursions
                  had been made by the students and tutors of Institution Eperveil during the
                  vacation; but the autumn had opened, and continued so fine, that the boys grew
                  quite restless from their desire to have one more course in the Alps before the
                  winter set in. Accordingly, one fine sunny Saturday in the first part of October,
                  a petition, signed by all the students, was presented to Madame Eperveil, asking
                  for a few days congé. She graciously consented,
                  and gave them all the following week, only stipulating that Monday should be the
                  day of preparation, and that they should return on the last day of the week, in
                  order to have the following Sunday as a day of rest.
               Institution Eperveil became a scene of commotion. The following day the students
                  could scarcely endure the restraints imposed upon them by Madame Eperveil's
                  prohibition against employing the Sunday for any of the preparations. Routes,
                  however, were discussed, parties made up, and favorite tutors squabbled over,
                  disturbing effectually the Sabbath peace and quiet. To Kinnaird Graham's lot had
                  fallen a pleasant party of young men, about ten or a dozen. On Sunday he was
                  talking about his good fortune in having been allowed by Madame Eperveil to head
                  this little band. "Generally," he said, laughingly, "I have the most troublesome
                     garçons given me, and the anxiety I feel
                  causes me much more fatigue than pleasure, I assure you. There is but one element
                  wanting to make this perfect," he added, with a playful gallantry rarely indulged
                  in by him.
               "And that?" asked Madame Bouvreuil.
               "Two or three ladies," he answered, looking at Hélène.
               "Where do you go?" I inquired.
               "To Chamouni; and the route is so beautiful and easily accomplished that I am sure
                  you would enjoy it."
               "I could not wish anything more pleasant," I cried; "and, indeed, I think you are
                  very kind to ask me."
               "What can you possibly see at Chamouni, Graham, in three or four days?" said
                  Octave, who was lounging listlessly over my balcony railings, and had been talking
                  in a low voice to Marie on some subject which did not seem very agreeable to
                  either of them. She had been dissatisfied about 
                     someting
                     something
                  , relative to Octave, for several days past, but I had no chance of
                  talking with Tante Cecile for more than a week, or I should have learned through
                  her the cause of trouble; therefore, I was ignorant of it.
               Kinnaird explained his route, which was to make the pass of Tête Noire; spend part
                  of a day, and sleep at Chamouni; while at Chamouni, perform any one of the
                  numberless exploits the ladies wished; then return by Col de Balme. Octave drew a
                  long breath.
               "By Hercules! but you have energy, Kinnaird!" he cried, "to undertake three such
                  difficult things: the care of a lot of hobbledehoys; two ladies—for, of course,
                  Marie will not go—to whom you give, imprudently, a broad margin of whatever they
                  please, and then cram a week's work into three or four days! I do not envy you
                  your post of honor."
               "If you held it," said Marie, petulantly, "you would never have thought of inviting us—certainly not, if
                  it had added to your labors."
               "Most assuredly not," he answered, coolly, yawning, and speaking in a fatigued,
                  bored tone, which he always employed whenever he wished to be particularly
                  disagreeable. It was evident that their previous conversation had not ended
                  satisfactorily, for he was in as ill a humor as he ever allowed himself to be. "I
                  do not like to see ladies on such excursions," he continued; "they are in the way.
                  Then, another powerful reason, it makes them look ugly; the wind tosses their
                  hair, and the sun browns their skins; any woman who expects to captivate and
                  attract a man should studiously avoid all such exposures. I am sure I should grow
                     dégoûté with Venus herself, if I happened to
                  see her strapped on to a mule tramping over one of these mountain passes."
               "How absurdly you are talking, Octave!" said his mother.
               He bowed, with mock courtesy. Kinnaird and Hélène looked and acted as if they had
                  not heard a word of Octave's saucy speech, and occupied themselves with explaining
                  to me the route and manner of accomplishing it, and what we should prepare for the
                  journey. I could not help stealing a glance at Marie, who stood leaning against
                  one of the pillars of my balcony, looking earnestly down into the misty Rhone
                  valley, as if seeking there for counsel. Her fine Sappho head and brow looked
                  grand in the moonlight, but her thin lips were very stern and scornful. She made
                  no reply to Octave; presently she turned toward us, and asked, "When do you start,
                  Kinnaird?"
               "Tuesday morning, in the seven o'clock boat, for Villeneuve."
               "And what must we prepare for the expedition?" she said, coming to the window in
                  which we were seated; and, taking a little tabouret, she placed it at my feet, and sat down upon it; then,
                  clasping her hands over my lap, leaned her head on them like a poor, tired,
                  discouraged child. I smoothed her silky, brown bandeaux, and united with Hélène and Kinnaird in telling her our
                  arrangements.
               "Mademoiselle Fauvette should be proud of her power," said Octave, sneeringly;
                  "she is making quite a courageous amazon of Marie."
               "But, Octave," said Hélène, in a mild but remonstrating tone, "Marie has always
                  gone with us in our mountain excursions heretofore, except sometimes, when she has
                  generously stayed at home to please you."
               "Not much generosity in anything you young girls do; you generally seek your own
                  pleasure, both in your attentions to and neglect of men," he answered, mockingly;
                  and it sounded so absurdly pettish that we could not help bursting out into a
                  laugh, and I injudiciously added to his temper by crying out,—
               "Why, Mr. Octave, you are positively Byronic to-night!"
               We annoyed him excessively, but he tried to control his anger, and contented
                  himself with saying, in a very polite manner, that Mademoiselle Fauvette was so
                  refined that even her intended sarcasms were elegant compliments, and then left
                  the balcony. Soon after we heard him enter his own room, which was beneath my
                  salon; after awhile, a heavy clang of the front door informed us that he had left
                  the house; but no remark was made by any of us, either as to his silly pettishness
                  or absence.
               The next day was occupied in preparations; and we had much merriment in trying on
                  our mountain costumes: short, gray woolen dresses, knit woolen Montreux jackets,
                  round, felt hats, stout leather boots with flexible soles, and thick gloves with
                  gauntlet tops. On Tuesday morning, by seven o'clock we were down at the V. port in
                  time to take the "Hirondelle" steamer. We were a merry party, and quite large and
                  noisy enough to disconcert some elegant tourists on board the steamer. At
                  Villeneuve we left the boat, and took the railway for Bex, that "spot for
                  landscape painters," as Töpffer says. There Kinnaird engaged a carriage for us, and he accompanied us, leaving the
                  young men to proceed by diligence, agreeing to meet them at the Hotel de Cygne, at
                  Martigny. The road from Bex to Martigny is beautiful. We took the left side of the
                  Rhone until we reached the Bridge of St. Maurice, which is a bold arch, spanning
                  the rapid, mountain river, resting one end on the base of Dent de Morcles, and the
                  other on Dents du Midi, which mountains advance their bases so far forward as to
                  crowd the river into a narrow space of about seventy feet.
               This Bridge of St. Maurice took us from Canton Vaud into Canton Valais. On the
                  other side of the Rhone we passed the beautiful little waterfall of the Bas
                  Valais; its leap down the mountain's side is broken by an intervening bit of rock,
                  which causes the water to dash, as it were, into atoms, forming a spray more
                  brilliant than gems, as the rays of the mid-day sun fell on it. We reached
                  Martigny before the young gentlemen, and had a savory dinner ordered for them by
                  the time they arrived. During our noisy, merry dinner, Kinnaird engaged mules and
                  guides for the journey. The mounting of mules, and the getting under way of our
                  cavalcade, created as great a sensation among the people as happiness to us, and
                  we trotted off to the merry measure of the mule bells, laughs, songs, and huzzas
                  of the excited students.
               The ascent of Tête Noire is very bold and grand. At the commencement of the ascent
                  we had a beautiful view of the Rhone valley and the course of the Rhone through
                  it, from Col de Forclaz. The path after that gave fine views of the valley of the
                  Triente, sometimes skirting precipices, sometimes running through riante pasturages. We reached the inn near the summit
                  about sunset; this was our resting-place for the night. We found it to be a rude
                  but a comfortable and clean place. While supper was preparing, and Kinnaird and
                  Hélène were busied in examining into the accommodations of the house and making
                  arrangements for the night, Marie and I sauntered out on the road. Behind the inn
                  is a deep gorge, through which the Eau Noire rushes; mountains rise upon the
                  opposite side, covered with pasturages, châlets, and patches of tilled ground; the
                  cattle grazing, their bells ringing, and the noise of rushing waters, gave Marie a
                  host of ideas for mountain idyls. From a steep height came tumbling down a
                  mountain rapid, called by the peasants cordon or
                     ruban blanc; it looked like a white ribbon
                  streamer, woven with a silver weft, flung to and fro from one steep to another,
                  and so far distant that we could not see its liquid flow or spray, only its
                  dazzling light as it caught some golden violet rays from the setting sun, or a
                  soft, silver beam from the nearly full moon. Beyond the inn was the dark forest of
                  Triente and the brow of Tête Noire. While we were admiring these ravishing sights.
                  and sounds, Kinnaird came, with the troop of students, to summon us to goûter; and, romantic and etherial as we had felt
                  while enjoying the enchanting outdoor view, we did full justice to the landlady's
                  good supper. Golden honey and delicious little biscuit, fragrant coffee, made
                  yellow-white by the boiling, creamy milk, and piles of the little Alpine
                  strawberries,—surely all these were tempting enough to have seduced an anchorite
                  as well as romantic women. We grew gloriously merry over the feast, and quite
                  forgot the grand scene of mountain, torrent, and moonlight, outside the house.
               After supper, all the party were too fatigued to enjoy the outdoor beauties, and
                  retired almost instantly, in order to be fresh for the early morning journey. When
                  they were all quiet in their rooms, and Hélène had fallen off into a calm, sweet
                  sleep, Marie and I stole down the staircase and wandered up and down the road
                  until after midnight, talking of everything but—Octave. Poor Marie! To some women
                  love is like silly Eve's apple of knowledge, once tasted, all trust and faith are
                  gone forever. The night was glorious "with sights and sounds divine;" and the
                  wild, mountain melody, caused by the rushing noise of the Triente forcing its way into the Eau Noire, gave to the
                  scene a sublimity almost supernatural.
               The next morning by five o'clock we had made a good breakfast, and were mounting
                  our mules. We entered the dark forests of Triente and those which cover the
                  mountain's brow and give it its name, "Tête Noire;" as we left them, the valley of
                  the Triente opened before us in the midst of precipices and steep mountains.
                  Formerly the passage of Tête Noire was very dangerous; now the road winds
                  skillfully around the mountain's side, avoiding the old zigzag and terrific
                     mal pas. A rock is tunneled in one place, and
                  Marie and I arrested our mules at the entrance, to watch the part of our band
                  emerging from this superb road suspended in mid air. Then came a succession of
                  gorges and mountain torrents, and at last, we arrived at Argentière, where we saw
                  our first glacier, the Glacier d'Argentière, which comes streaming its icy mass
                  down into the vale between Aiguilles d'Argentière and De la Tour. We arrived in
                  Chamouni at mid-day. We gazed around this wild, desolate-looking village with
                  dissatisfaction; we could not endure the grand, incongruous hotels and crowds of
                  stylish dressy travelers, which give it a watering-place look, quite at variance
                  with the landscape, like a vulgar discord caused by an ignorant hand striking the
                  keys or strings of an instrument in the midst of wild, weird music; nor could we
                  any better endure the clouds and fog that vailed the summit of Mont Blanc.
               While we dined, we discussed the afternoon plans; and, after taking the votes, the
                  gentlemen gallantly allowing each one of our votes to count for two of theirs, the
                  decision was found to be for Mer de Glace. We mounted our mules, crossed the Arve,
                  and the meadows in this wild valley, to the foot of the Montanvert, then ascended
                  the steep, picturesque road. Sometimes we crossed wild, desolate-looking paths
                  that seemed as if some avenging angel of destruction had swept his blighting wing
                  over them; they were the paths of winter avalanches, and were more dreary looking
                  than the black lines of a lava stream. Over the lava the fern and grass will grow;
                  but where once the ice has touched, all vegetation ceases; even if it recedes or
                  sways aside, and takes another course, the spot on which it but rested for a
                  period is blasted forever. And it seems as if the Italian Dante must have known
                  this, although he never saw these fearful ice regions; for the throne of his
                  Inferno is the region of eternal ice. The pines were hung with beautiful, long,
                  hairy moss, that streamed, like the torn locks of ravished virgins, in the
                  wind.
               When we reached the summit, we dismounted and hurried down to the shore of Mer de
                  Glace. The fog hung heavily, covering all the numberless pinnacles of the
                  wilderness of mountains that surround the vale, which forms the couch for this
                  marvelous ice sea. It is over seven thousand feet above the level of the sea, and
                  above and around it rise up those precipitous summits some of which are so steep
                  that the snow cannot even cling to or rest on their sides. The sea is two miles
                  wide, and it occupied nearly two hours in crossing it. We had excellent guides;
                  mine was a son of the Payod immortalized by Dumas in his clever, sparkling Impressions du Voyage en Suisse, and cousin to Töpffer's
                  Jean Payod. He, my guide—Jean Marie Payod—had just returned from London, where he
                  had been employed by Albert Smith in his exhibition of Mont Blanc. When he heard
                  from Marie that I was an American, his admiration was without bounds, and he was
                  prodigal of care and attention.
               "Our paysans are very enthusiastic about
                  America, Fanny," said Hélène, in English; "they look upon it as a land of promise,
                  a mother republic."
               "Yes," said Kinnaird, whose English prejudices prompted him to let off a little
                  raillery against Hélène and me; "'our paysans'
                  believe firmly that every man, so soon as he lands in the States, owns a large
                  farm; and 'Government,' that wealthy individual, has immense tracts of luxuriant
                  fields, all fenced in, ready to give gratis, with polite pleasure, to any Swiss who can scrape, enough francs
                  together to pay his passage across the Atlantic."
               Hélène and Marie attacked him womanfully in defence of their paysan brethren, and I joined with him against them
                  for awhile. But the wonders of the ice sea soon made us forget everything
                  else.
               Marie and I let Kinnaird and Hélène pass on with the leaping, bounding boys, and
                  we stood on the center of the sea alone; our guides, seeing we wished to talk
                  together, drew off at a little distance. The surface near the shores is covered
                  with dust and stones, and does not give a satisfactory impression of the color and
                  solidity of the ice. The waves, near the center of the sea, rise at least three
                  feet above the surface; long crevasses cleave some of these huge frozen waves
                  asunder, and one can look down into them an unfathomable depth. We leaned over a
                  crevasse and gazed down, admiring the clear amethystine color of the cloven ice,
                  which was more intensely blue than the heavens that seemed to draw far away from
                  us above.
               "Not a 'dissolved amethyst,'" said Marie, "but a frozen one, harder than the gem,
                  stone as it is."
               Then we talked of fearful dreams we had suffered during seasons of intense
                  anxiety, when spectators, with eyes of just such as icy blue, had haunted us. The
                  fog rolled and surged, sometimes showing the snowy and icy tops of the Aiguilles
                  that surrounded us; the sun, striving to pierce through the driving clouds, gave
                  them the appearance of smoke and smoldering fire—it seemed like a world being
                  destroyed by flame and ice. The wondrous sea is calm and quiet; its cresting
                  waves, its whirlpools, and its rage, are still as the death-sleep; it is like an
                  ocean in high fury, suddenly held still by an icy hand of power. The waves rise as
                  if ready to ingulf us, the whirlpools threaten to drag us under, the crevasse
                  trough yawns—but all is transfixed, silent, and immovable. And yet it is said that
                  a silent change is always going on in this quiet sea; that these waves, so firm
                  and still, insensibly decrease and new ones arise, and that the impurities and
                  stones on its surface, the moraines of the
                  glacier, as they are called, are ejected from its mysterious, unknown depths. This
                  thought coming over me as I stood there,—far away from our mortal land, leaning
                  beside one of the apparently immovable waves, one arm thrown across its "icy
                     mane,"—caused in me an emotion like what Shelley calls "a sentiment of
                  ecstatic wonder not unallied to madness." And yet there was no fear mingled with
                  the thought.
               "How can one feel fear in the presence of mere physical danger?" said Marie, in a
                  low voice. "It is but death that comes at last, and death of this poor body has no
                  terrors."
               "Human tyranny, human injustice, frightens me," I replied. "I feel helpless to
                  contend against it, and the thought of unjust oppression crushes down my heart.
                  There are some human influences, some inflexions of the human voice, that in time
                  would, I am sure, make a hopeless idiot of me; but never God's nature, nor the
                  voices and sounds of God's great world-creation of mountain and ocean."
               "They elevate me," said Marie, her whole face glowing with the emotion which
                  caused her beautiful soft-toned voice to vibrate and thrill through me like the
                  cadence of the nightingale. "I feel light and soaring, as if I were one of the
                  little loving angels whose heads make up the heavenly background in some of the
                  old pictures. Oh, you are right! one cannot feel fear of God, even though one may
                  sometimes tremble in the presence of his poor creature man."
               Shelley's fine lines rose to my lips:—
               
                  
                     "Is this the scene
                     Where the old earthquake-demon taught her young
                     Ruin? Were these their toys? Or did a sea
                     Of fire envelop once this silent snow?
                     None can reply—all seem eternal now.
                     The wilderness has a mysterious tongue
                     Which reaches awful doubt, or faith so mild,
                     So solemn, so serene, that man may be,
                     But for such faith, with nature reconciled.
                     
                     Thou hast a voice, great mountain, to repeal
                     Large codes of fraud and woe: not understood
                     By all, but which the wise, and great, and good
                     Interpret, or make felt, or deeply feel."
                  
               
               "I feel no doubt, but more and more reliant on God," said Marie, with sweet,
                  solemn reverence.
               "Yes," I replied, "more certain of a hereafter, more disposed to be patient and
                  forbearing under life's bitter disappointments and contradictions, and humanity's
                  injustice and shortcomings. This life and its trials seem here, under such
                  influences, so petty—the future and its developments so infinite."
               We stepped forward and joined our guides, and continued the passage over the sea
                  in silence. A grand, solemn "word" we learned there on the center of that frozen
                  ocean, as we stood "looking up from nature to nature's God."
               The end of the passage is very difficult. There is a part called the Mauvais Pas, which is quite dangerous; it is a path
                  cut in the face of a rock, nearly perpendicular, on the east side of the glacier;
                  a precipice lined with ice and sharp-pointed rock lies beneath; the path is
                  narrow, and slippery from the constant drip of the snow. This path is but just
                  barely wide enough for one person, and for support there is only a rope on one
                  side, fastened to the rock by iron rings. The guides advanced in front of us,
                  placed their sure and steady feet in the places where we were to tread after them,
                  and grasped us at the same time firmly by the wrists. After we had passed over, we
                  stood for a few moments to take breath, and looked at each other and the perilous
                  passage in a sort of bewilderment.
               "Persons subject to dizziness should not attempt this pas," cried Marie, with a gasp.
               "Non, en vérité, mademoiselle!" replied Payod, earnestly. "Day before yesterday,
                  Jean and I had an English gentleman and his lady to take across. When she reached
                  this place, she leaned over to look into the precipice, and was seized with such a
                  vertigo that we were forced to bind her eyes and carry her across."
               "But that was more dangerous than if you had returned to Montanvert," said
                  Marie.
               "Je crois que oui!" cried Payod, shrugging his
                  shoulders; "but madame determined to finish the journey. Mesdemoiselles are
                  stronger headed than most ladies, however."
               "In more senses than one, probably," said Kinnaird, in English, as he ran down the
                  bank of Le Chapeau to meet us. "How do you feel?"
               "Tired enough. Where is Hélène?"
               "Resting at Le Chapeau."
               And I was glad enough to reach there to rest also, for I felt very bruised and
                  weary. Just before reaching the Mauvais Pas I
                  had slipped on a base of one of the frozen waves, and my foot plunged deep into
                  one of the cold blue crevasses, touching a fluid as icy cold as the chill damps of
                  death. My guide's strong arm dragged me up, and a muttered ejaculation showed his
                  terror; a wet ankle and cut boot, however, was all the harm done beyond the
                  fright.
               We had to wait at Le Chapeau a little while for the mules, which had gone around
                  from Montanvert to meet us in the ravine beneath. We sat and looked down at the
                  curious pinnacles and obelisks of ice, into which the glacier was broken in its
                  descent into the valley. While looking, we saw the mules below, and we descended
                  the muddy path leading from this hill, which is called Le Chapeau, to its foot,
                  where the mules were waiting for us. We found the descent very rapid and steep,
                  and, as it was nightfall, quite difficult. Our journey to Chamouni, after we
                  entered the vale, was one of quiet, peaceful beauty. The fog floated off, the
                  bright October moon rode out majestically into the heavens, greeting with a flood
                  of silvery light the soft, white-bonneted head of the "Monarch of Mountains." The
                  sky was pure and blue; and to the left of one of the Aiguilles, which form a sort of body-guard to his mountain
                  majesty, shone a little crimson point in the heavens—a tiny, flaming star.
               "Voyez, mademoiselle," said Payod, lifting his
                  cap reverentially, "c'est l'étoile des
                  Bergers."
               The scene was calm and peaceful; and I, bruised and tired, leaned with my two arms
                  over the neck of the patient mule, which Payod led along and carefully held me on
                  at the same time. I gazed up at the high heavens, the snowy mountains, the flaming
                  star-point, and the round, full autumn moon, and drank in rest for both body and
                  soul. "Tired and weary way-worn travelers" were we, when we dismounted from our
                  mules at the Hotel de Londres.
               "What glorious visions you two girls should have, in the midst of all these
                  strange weird noises!" said Hélène, as she stood by the window of our bedroom,
                  sipping her tea, and looking out at the glaciers and rushing torrents. Her
                     leste fine form showed less fatigue than
                  ours.
               We smiled grimly; we were too tired to be sublime. Some time after midnight I was
                  awakened by a loud, booming noise, which made me sit straight up in bed.
               "Marie," I said, in a low voice, and stretched out my hand to awaken her. "Marie,
                  there goes Mer de Glace!"
               We both sprang lightly out on the floor, and, wrapping blanket shawls around us,
                  ran, with a smothered laugh, to the window as quietly as possible, in order not to
                  disturb Hélène, who was enjoying one of her usual good-girl sleeps, that
               
                  
                     "Sound child-sleeping,
                     Which the thunder cannot break."
                  
               
               We looked out on the Glacier du Bois, which is the termination of the Mer de
                  Glace; there it lay, spread out white and bleak looking in the fading moonlight;
                  and the source of the Arve came pouring down as steadily and beautifully as when
                  we bade it good night at ten o'clock. But how glorious was the scene, both for
                  sight and hearing! There was the sound of rushing torrent and dashing waterfall,
                  and the sight of high mountains towering around. "Nature was the poet, whose
                  harmony held our spirits more breathless than that of the divinest earthly
                  one."
               We sat for some time, in silence, by the window. At last I found myself nodding,
                  with sleepy familiarity, to the opposite glacier, and I crept off shivering to
                  bed, saying, as I wrapped my blanket shawl more comfortably around me and nestled
                  cosily under the duvet, "No grand convulsion of
                  nature is going to commemorate our visit, Marie Merle, I will vouch for it; so
                  come to sleep, my friend."
               But Marie was horribly sure we should hear in the morning some terrible account of
                  an avalanche, and a village or two destroyed. What Neros travelers become! But no
                  such agreeable horror was granted to us for our breakfast. The noise which had
                  awakened us was only the booming of a little cannon, announcing the return of a
                  company of gentlemen, who had ascended Mont Blanc a day or two before.
               After breakfast, commenced the journey of the day. At Argentiére we began the
                  ascent of the Col de Balme. The path up the mountain is a regular zigzag, and
                  recalled Töpffer's piquant and graphic descriptions to us. I could not help
                  expecting to meet at every turn the good fat femme, whose child had the coquelouche, or the two goître
                     cretins, guiding a cow, which—having the most sense of the three—was
                  the veritable guide.
               Mont Blanc, sans cloud, shone resplendent in the midst of his superb court of
                  Aiguilles, Dents, and Cols. His soft, round, white bead looked like a gracious
                  monarch. The other mountains shot up, cleaving the heavens with their sharp,
                  cutting, icy-peaked crowns; but the monarch of them all could dispense with a
                  peak, and his soft snows blended with the melting blue of the sky like a wavy,
                  changing cloud. From summit to base he stood before us; and then there was the beautiful wild vale beneath,
                  with the roaring Arve coursing through it, bordered with steep mountains, and the
                  still, cold, white, creeping glaciers, which unfolded themselves with desolate
                  grandeur down into its poor bosom.
               As we neared the summit we passed large herds of cattle on the different mountain
                  pastures. Near Châlet de Balme we saw over two hundred cows, some ruminating, some
                  drinking peacefully at the numberless mountain torrents that streamed over our
                  road. As we passed across one of the rude bridges, spanning a little torrent,
                  Marie drew her mule near mine, and said,—
               "When the storms rage, is there not here the finest music And the currents of
                  water which rush into the ravines, and go leaping out over one tree root after
                  another, bearing along pebbles and leaving their foam on the stems of the fern, do
                  they not also sing wild songs, which bring us pretty dreams when we sleep in isles
                  that in one single night they can form around us?"*
               
                  *Maîtres Sonneurs
               It was some fête day, and the inhabitants of the different villages were out in
                  their pretty holiday costumes, every group making a picture, à la Girardet. The air was filled with pastoral
                  sounds: the cow bells, the horns of the herdsmen, the village chapel bells, and
                  the roar of torrents and little waterfalls. We dined on the summit of the Col;
                  after dinner we dispersed in various directions, in order to enjoy for an hour or
                  so, and in perfect freedom, the glorious view from this summit. Tired with
                  rambling, Marie and I sat down on some broad stones, and gazed down into the vale
                  of Chamouni entirely through its length and breadth, from Col de Rosa to Col de
                  Balme.
               We found the descent of Col de Balme fatiguing, but filled with savage beauty.
                  After awhile we struck into the route over the Forclaz, which we had made in
                  ascending the Tête Noire, and again enjoyed the beautiful view of the Rhone
                  valley. At Martigny we discharged the mules and guides, and pushed onto Bex, in
                  carriages, in order to sleep there that night, and arrived in Peilz the following
                  day, with fatigued bodies, but filled with impressions of beauty which remained
                  unfading in our memories for years.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XII.
               A DAY AT BLONAY.
               AFTER our return from Chamouni we found Octave absent. He had left for a journey,
                  one scarcely knew whither, but he expected to be at Vienna during the winter to
                  meet Lord S., a young English nobleman, and remain with him as a sort of tutor or
                  companion. This Lord S. was a nephew, by marriage, of a grand, wealthy friend of
                  Madame Eperveil, a Mr. Landsnecht, an Englishman, who had made a fabulous fortune
                  in trade; and, by means of this fortune, had been able to marry the penniless aunt
                  of this young lordling. In course of time the merchant became, to his great
                  satisfaction, guardian to his wife's nephew. A month or so before, he had applied
                  to Madame Eperveil to provide him with a traveling companion or tutor to this
                  young gentleman, who had just left the university, and wished to travel on the
                  continent, and Madame Eperveil had recommended Octave.
               "I am glad he is gone," said Tante Cecile to me, one sweet twilight, as we were
                  lingering in Michel's garden, and admiring together his fine fall pears and plums.
                  "But his caprices do not worry and distress Marie as they used to. Formerly she
                  fretted, when, after a quarrel, he would leave in this cavalier style. I think,
                  however, she is outgrowing her love for him, for she scarcely noticed his absence;
                  and the first morning after your return from Chamouni, she went to work as hard as
                  ever at her music. This time last year she would have looked gloomy for a week,
                  and not opened the piano."
               Madame Michel, just at this moment, joined us. She was a tall, slender,
                  old-maidish-looking woman, who held herself absurdly erect; the expression of her
                  countenance was very droll; it was the personification of primness; she had
                  little, sparkling, black eyes, a nice brown complexion, black hair, streaked with
                  gray, and she wore a white cap with fluted border, the universal head-dress of the
                  Vaudois paysannes. She was a character, this
                  same Madame Michel, in her humble way, and afforded infinite amusement to us; but
                  we respected her, for she was an excellent woman, and our laughs against her were
                  not malicious. She had been an old maid, the daughter of the old gardener of the
                  chateau; and, after his death, had married her father's assistant, Michel, a
                  widower, with one child; and a pretty good girl was this daughter, Elise Michel.
                  Madame Michel had never expected to marry. I do not suppose it had ever entered
                  into her head to take such a step; not that she was ugly or disagreeable, but she
                  had always been a stiff, prim, old-maidish person from her earliest youth and had
                  "never fancied the garçons", as she said. After
                  her father's death, Michel had wisely concluded she would just suit him,
                  especially as she held a sort of right in the garden, and if he did not marry her,
                  he would have to pay her a small sum annually. He was a shrewd, calculating
                  fellow; and, without being cruel or positively and openly a rascal, was more cold
                  and selfish than many who were less trusted in. He was industrious however, and
                  generally temperate; although, at certain seasons, he would take a frolic, as
                  will, unfortunately, very many of the Vaudois paysans. They are a liberty-loving, wine-drinking set, these Vaudois
                     paysans; and sometimes Michel would have a
                  fresh accès of paysan patriotism, which he would show by a three or four days'
                  visit to the neighboring cabaret, where he let it off by playing disque, drinking
                  the new beady wine of the Canton, and howling, in barbarous, inharmonious shrieks,
                  patriotic songs out of the Zöfingue: "Au bord du
                     Lac," "Sur nos champs," and, above
                  all, "Remplissons nos verres;" which last song
                  always raised him and his companions to a seventh heaven of Swiss republican publican bliss. But his wife ignored
                  all this, and talked incessantly of the great prize she had drawn in the
                  matrimonial lottery.
               "Si vous saviez, mademoiselle," she would say, with the true Vaudois strength of
                  emphasis; "si vous saviez comme il est bon; c'est d'une bonté inexprimable; il est
                  perfection; il est un ange!"
               Now, it was difficult for us to unite our idea of an angel with Michel, who was a
                  peculiarly insignificant-looking and ugly man, with whitish-yellow hair and beard,
                  and very sournois in his manners. But, of
                  course, Marie and I were wicked enough to encourage her in this innocent and
                  laudable weakness; so, when she interrupted us on the afternoon in question, I
                  commenced praising her husband's fine fruit and industry, concluding with,—"Ah,
                  Madame Michel, it is not every one that is so lucky as you are!"
               "N'est-ce pas, mademoiselle—n'est-ce pas?" she burst out, exultingly, drawing up
                  her prim chin in a self-satisfied manner, which was so inexpressibly funny that
                  Tante Cecile had to turn aside to hide her smiles,—"n'est-ce pas! eh, c'est d'une
                  bonté inexprimable. Et moi, mademoiselle, vous voyez;" and she spread out her
                  hands as if to give generously a full view of her whole person; "je ne suis plus
                  jeune, et il est si joli garçon, si aimable, si tendre, comme nous sommes seuls.
                  Il est froid, mademoiselle, devant le monde; mais il est pour moi un ange, un
                  perfection; eh, quelle bonté—c'est d'une bonté mais d'une bonté, mademoiselle!"
                  And she folded her thin, long-fingered hands, and threw up her sharp little eyes
                  in an attempt at a rapturous expression, leaving the sentence unfinished, as if
                  words could not express this "bonté
                  inexprimable."
               I could not help laughing; and, to cover it over, I said, reproachfully: "Ah,
                  madam! you make vielles demoiselles like me
                  envious."
               She never dreamed of being absurd—who does, especially when the most so?—but
                  commenced saying consoling things to me, in a confidential tone, about my
                  matrimonial hopes in the future. "But where is your pretty niece Emilie?" I asked.
                  "I want to see her bright face again; and Dora needs the assistance of her clever
                  hands in renovating our winter clothing. She must not leave Peilz without giving
                  us a week. I promised my Dora to engage her this afternoon."
               Madame Michel's pale face grew red, and she stammered out that Emilie had left
                  Peilz that morning; that she had been called suddenly home to Sallenches, and
                  would not return probably all winter.
               "She left this morning, then?" said Tante Cecile, eagerly; "and you are sure she
                  returns to the Valais?"
               "Oh, yes, mademoiselle," replied the woman, seriously; "Michel had business at G.,
                  and he took her himself."
               "I am very glad to hear it," said Tante Cecile; "and she had better remain in the
                  Valais; she is much too pretty and inexperienced to go out into the world to earn
                  her living. I hope soon to hear, madam, that she is married suitably; that would
                  be the best thing for her."
               "Yes; and married as satisfactorily as madame," I added, with a laugh and shake of
                  the head; and we bade Madame Michel good evening, while she was just about
                  recommencing her enunciation of Michel's "bonté
                     inexprimable."
               "You do not know, then, about Emilie?" asked Tante Cecile, as we walked off down
                  on the lake shore.
               "What about her?"
               "Why, poor Emilie is the cause of the quarrel between Marie and Octave. He has
                  always shown a disposition to flirt with her; but it went so far this autumn as to
                  give us all great anxiety. Elise, it appears, has been very uneasy for some time
                  at Emilie's altered manner, and her fits of weeping at night; but when Emilie told
                  her she thought she would go to Paris to work at her trade, where she could make
                  more money, she grew alarmed, and told her mother. Madame Michel remonstrated with the girl, but she
                  answered her aunt pertly; and, on throwing out some conceited hints of expecting
                  to be a lady some time, Madame Michel asked my advice, and I counseled her to send
                  her home to her grandmother, at Sallenches."
               "How wicked!" I cried, "for Octave to play upon the vanity of that silly
                  girl!"
               "Marie thought she had better remonstrate with him," said Tante Cecile; "but be
                  did not receive her remonstrances amiably; he expressed himself very much
                  surprised at what he called her 'unmaidenly interference in an affair that ought
                  to be quite out of the knowledge of a delicate, refined woman.'"
               "She must have felt awkwardly enough when he chose to put such an unjust
                  construction on it."
               "No; I do not believe she did," answered Tante Cecile, shaking her head; "although
                  I am sure I should. But it showed his good-for-nothing impertinence, to endeavor
                  to abash her so. I asked Marie what answer she made him, and she said, 'I told him
                  I did not think it unmaidenly to endeavor to save a weak young girl from the
                  thoughtless, unmeaning attentions of an attractive young man, who was only amusing
                  himself; that I had hoped, by appealing to his good sense and honor, he would see
                  the impropriety of his conduct; that I was much more surprised at his ungenerous
                  way of trying to make me feel ashamed of what was a creditable act—indeed, a
                  duty;' and then she said she refused to talk any more about it."
               Here Marie and her father joined us; and we made arrangements to spend the
                  following day "under the forest trees."
               "You have never visited Blonay yet, have you?" asked Mr. Merle.
               "No; is it not too far?"
               "By no means, for such pedestrians as you are; moreover over, you can take the
                  donkey along to relieve you when you feel tired in the ascent. It is only
                  three-quarters of a league from here; that is, about three miles, as you would
                  call it, on the Pleiades, and you take the same road that passes through your
                  favorite Hauteville. It is a grand, old chateau; it was built in the tenth
                  century, by Otho Grandson; and, at this very day, belongs to a descendant of this
                  same old Otho. In the middle ages, the family were so powerful that it held
                  dominion over twenty-five villages. At the time of the Reformation, the family
                  being divided in religion, divided their property; the Catholic branch established
                  themselves in the Chablais, where they possessed an estate above Evian; the
                  Protestant remained at Blonay. Oh, you must go, by all means, to Blonay, if for
                  nothing else, to see the fine view from the balcony of the salle à manger, on the second floor."
               So, to Blonay it was decided we should go the following day. The morning was very
                  clear and bright, and though we started early, at seven o'clock, we found the
                     paysans, three hours in advance of us, at
                  work in their vineyards. The autumn was singularly long; the vintage had begun
                  some weeks before, and the récolte was very
                  fine; the vineyards were filled with crowds of people: men, women, and children,
                  gathering the grappes de raisins. Large wagons,
                  with heavy cuves, stood in the roads, and men,
                  bending under the brandes—wooden vessels, strapped on to their backs—came swaying
                  to and fro, from the motion of the golden grape-juice, as they descended with care
                  the steps leading from the terraced vineyards to the road, and there deposited, in
                  the hogsheads or cuves, the juice and pressed mass of the grape.
               They all gave us good-natured greetings, and gifts of huge grapes were forced
                  generously upon us with all the warm-hearted kindness of the Vaudois. We reached
                  Blonay about ten o'clock. Tante Cecile, Marie, and I, with Dora and Beau, made up the party. Mr. Merle had agreed to
                  dine with the professor that day; and Tante Cecile had given her two maidens
                  permission to go grape-gathering in the vignobles of some relatives, which is a
                  great amusement for the young girls and garçons
                  at vintage-time. Madame Bouvreuil and Hélène were to join us in the after part of
                  the day, as Kinnaird, who had no lessons on that afternoon, was to drive them out
                  in a little wagon. We did not visit the chateau first, for we were tired; so we
                  sought out a warm sunny place in the woods to rest, where we talked or read aloud
                  alternately.
               "Beau is the most sensible one of the party," said Tante Cecile, going to the
                  donkey, and taking off the panier of provisions, while we arranged the books,
                  shawls, rugs, and camp-stools. "He has been courteously inviting us to take some
                  refreshment, after our long walk, ever since we arrived."
               Beau sat looking very sternly at the provision basket; he did not notice our
                  laughs, or anything but the place and position of the darling panier. As we were
                  all hungry, we opened it, to his great satisfaction, and soon he had the pleasure
                  of crunching chop-bones on the velvety moss, which formed a tufted carpet under
                  the old chestnut and walnut trees.
               After our collation, we leaned back against the old tree-trunks, and enjoyed,
                  luxuriously, our rest, and listened to Marie, whose memory was stored with legends
                  of all these old chateaux. How I wish I could transport my readers to the
                  delicious spot and its surroundings! From an opening in the wood we could look
                  through and see the fine, old chateau tower above us; and, beneath us, long
                  terraced roads, descending, like tripping maidens, through the magnificent
                  chestnut forest. Tante Cecile and I sat embroidering, Dora crocheting, Beau,
                  serious as a judge, dozed solemn slumbers beside the provision panier, and the
                  donkey fed peacefully, near at hand, in the meadows of the chateau, while Marie
                  sat on a cushion, on the soft mossy ground, and told her wild legends in the
                  quaintest old French, that sounded like some one of those lark songs
               
                  
                     "that glorious Chaucer sung
                     Away in England's morn."
                  
               
               In the afternoon, Madame Bouvreuil, Hélène, and Kinnaird joined us; then we
                  rambled over the old chateau, and grew antiquarian wise over old bahuts and buffets,
                  some covered with inlaid armorial bearings, and some sculptured with
                  "annunciations" and rich garlands and clusters of the symbolical pomegranates and
                  grape, which told of their old use in chapels in ages long gone by. We stood in
                  the large balcony window of the salon on the second floor, and gazed peacefully
                  over the gracious landscape spread out beneath and beyond us; then turned
                  lingeringly away to commence our walk homeward. We found in the vineyards a
                  merrier scene than the early morning presented. Most of the courting among the
                  Vaudois paysans is done during the vintage-time.
                  After the gathering of the day is over, it is the work of the garçons to go and examine the different parts allotted
                  to the young girls, to see if they have culled the grappes well, and every young paysanne who may, by chance, have left a bunch, is subject to the
                  punishment of a kiss, to be given to her by the lucky garçon who finds it. From many a vineyard rose merry shouts,
                  announcing the rustic gallantry of the young men; and old fathers and mothers, who
                  stood by the reeking and dripping cuves in the
                  road, laughed heartily; for many an old couple remembered their own frolicsome
                  young days.
               Light had faded; every golden-tinted cloud had grown gray, and bright stars
                  glimmered and sparkled out in the sky, and peeped out between the waving folding
                  clouds, as we came down the road that led to the old Peilz church. A long line of
                  wagons, with wine cuves and peasants, passed under the church arch with us, and
                  entered the Peilz street, suggesting to the professor and Mr. Merle, who came up
                  the road to meet us, the comparison to an ancient procession in honor of Bacchus;
                  but the merry shouts of the peasants proved that their labor had wearied them less
                  than our pleasure had us; for we were forced to admit that we were very tired, and
                  quite willing to woo "sweet sleep, nature's kind restorer," under the friendly
                  warmth of our silk duvets.
            
            
               CHAPTER XIII.
               THE WINTER.
               THE cold weather soon after set in. One morning, on awakening, I found the tops of
                  the opposite Savoy Alps covered with snow, looking like the mountains that
                  surround Chamouni. There had been a long rain of several days, which rain-storm
                  had been snow on the mountains. How dreary it looked to me! and I shivered and
                  drew closer to the porcelain stove, and wrapped my fur tippet close about me
                  whenever I crossed the brick-paved halls and stone staircases, on my way to the
                     salle à manger or salon. Marie, and especially Hélène, laughed at me, and told me I
                  must learn to enjoy their Swiss winters as well as the summers, for the winters
                  had their sports also. Snow fell on our roads, and the ice hardened on the ponds
                  and inlets at the head of the lake; sleigh horses jingled their merry bells, and
                  the students of Institution Eperveil sallied forth with their skates.
               Madame Eperveil gave congé every Saturday during
                  the skating season, and the boys were always off early to a favorite skating spot,
                  a little inlet of the lake, above Zillium. One morning I wrapped myself up
                  carefully, and accompanied Hélène to the scene of action—for, being as good a
                  skater as the boys, she rarely missed a Saturday's skating. It was a merry sight:
                  the surrounding mountains were gray and grim enough, and the air biting cold; but
                  though nature seemed inhospitable, everybody was bent upon making amends for her
                  rugged humor, and disposed to find amusement even from it.
               
               Booths were scattered about, in which were sold to the boys and other people
                  attracted to the place, coffee, cakes, and even sausages, which were kept hot over
                  little chafing dishes and boilers. The women who guarded these booths were mostly
                  puffy, pincushiony-looking dames, in short, brown and blue stuff petticoats, 
                     Montrueux
                     Montreux
                   jackets of tricotted worsted, and 
                     Montrueux
                     Montreux
                   caps and hats, which last are remarkable pieces of toilette; the cap is
                  made of black silk, shaped like the old mob cap, and has a broad border of stiff,
                  black lace, which stands out around the face in all its fluted grandeur; the hat
                  is as often hung on the arm as perched on the top of this cap, and is a
                  yellowish-white coarse straw, with a crown shaped à la
                     bouteille—the narrow neck of the bottle forming the top or center of
                  the crown.
               There were stronger drinks than coffee at these booths: various fermented liquids,
                  and the pungent, fresh wine of the country,—of which the paysans are unfortunately so fond,—and, pure grape-juice as it is,
                  it causes as disgusting drunkenness, duty neglecting, and wife beating, as our own
                  more homely rum and apple-jack.
               The students were mostly fine skaters; but none were better than Kinnaird, whose
                  large, athletic form was shown to great advantage in this manly amusement. But my
                  greatest pleasure was in looking at Hélène. I had never seen a woman skate before,
                  and had hardly expected to think it so graceful an exercise. Her costume was very
                  pretty: a short skirt and basque of dark, garnet-colored merino, edged with a
                  narrow border of black fur; a collar and wristbands also of fur, and pantaloons of
                  the same material as the dress, slightly fulled into the band, which encircled the
                  ankle at the top of the high-laced morocco boots; a brown felt hat and feather
                  completed this very becoming dress. Her cheeks grew brilliant, her eyes danced,
                  and a prettier woman than Hélène Bouvreuil could hardly be found; and so her lover
                  thought, evidently, as I noticed that he stole many a quiet, admiring glance at
                  her, when he fancied no one saw him indulging in such a weakness. I stayed some
                  time, enjoying the wonderful performances of the best skaters, who cut my name on
                  the ice, and did a variety of remarkable feats; then I drove back to Peilz, with
                  Madame Bouvreuil, long before Hélène or the students and tutors had any idea of
                  returning.
               The extreme cold weather, even during that slight exposure, affected me seriously;
                  and for many weeks after that gay Saturday, I was too much of an invalid to enjoy
                  any outdoor amusement; and even during the whole season, I did little beyond
                  visiting at the chateau and Institution Eperveil. The concerts, lectures, and
                  dramatic readings continued weekly there, and generally, when I felt well enough,
                  I went to them; but my closer acquaintance with Madame Eperveil did not make us
                  like each other even as well as we promised to at first. I was not strong enough
                  in health to be very patient with her dictatorial manners, and our opinions were
                  so diametrically opposite on every subject, that it was difficult to avoid
                  discussion. My state of health caused her great annoyance; of course, she sneered
                  at it behind my back, considering it imaginary; and to my face, she threw out
                  hints against my mode of life; late hours, long days in the open air during the
                  autumnal fogs, and want of regular occupation, formed her usual themes of
                  conversation; which preaching grew so wearisome, that I rarely condescended to
                  reply to her, and listened so indifferently that I even provoked the good
                  professor to take up the cudgels in my defence. It was amusing to hear him
                  represent to her, that as to late hours he indulged in them himself, and that no
                  one could dispute his actual possession of good health; that outdoor life was
                  excellent for the spirits, and that Mademoiselle Fauvette was the most industrious
                  person he had ever seen. When it arrived at this personal crisis I generally
                  withdrew, for I did not admit the right which Madame Eperveil wished to exercise
                  over me,—as over every one else,—of
                  sitting in judgment on me and my pursuits.
               Madame Bouvreuil and Hélène were so tender and kind that it was a pleasure to be
                  nursed by them; and Tante Cecile and Marie united with them in loving care and
                  sympathy. They made me spend several days at a time with them at the chateau; and,
                  as the guest-chamber opened on the salon, I could lie on the bed in it and enjoy
                  from the open door all Marie's music. One day, I had suffered so much from
                  languor, succeeding an attack of severe pain, that I was forced to remain in bed.
                  Marie played for me, and Tante Cecile read her favorite Emile Souvestre aloud, and
                  talked her soft, soothing words. At twilight, Tante Cecile tied on me a pretty
                  lace cap, her skillful fingers had been fashioning for me; and we were admiring
                  its becomingness, when the salon door opened, and we heard the voices of strange
                  gentlemen talking to Mr. Merle and Wolfmaister.
               "Heinrich Henzler!" cried Marie joyfully, and she ran into the salon, followed by
                  Tante Cecile.
               I had so often heard them speak of this German friend, that I could well
                  understand their delight at his visit. He had been a student of Institution
                  Eperveil, but his decided genius for music had induced his father to allow him to
                  devote himself to it as a profession. Tante Octavie had pronounced it a piece of
                  madness, and had prophesied beggary, and worse than that, for the young lad; but
                  his success had been as remarkable as his ability. He had shown great capability
                  in orchestral direction, and at the time first met him he was chief of one of the
                  finest public orchestras in Vienna. His concerts were crowded, his waltzes and
                  orchestral arrangements all the rage; and Heinrich Henzler was considered the
                  principal German composer of that very attractive and popular genre of music.
               His troupe had also a great reputation, and his management was highly commended.
                  They were all young, unmarried married men, and he required they should all
                  possess a certain amount of education on joining his troupe; and he made them
                  enter into solemn engagements also against all habits or indulgences that could
                  lead to dissipation. But their chief was their friend as well as their director;
                  he associated with them, and took great pride in arranging the hours of study and
                  practice, both alone and in concert. They had traveled in America, and all over
                  Europe, giving famous concerts. Although his dancing and military music was so
                  popular, he also prided himself on the style in which his troupe executed Mozart
                  and Beethoven. Certain days were given to the study of these great masters, and
                  his classical concerts were no less celebrated than the gayer miscellaneous ones.
                  Presently Marie came back to me, saying,—
               "Oh, I am so sorry you are not able to be out in the salon, for Heinrich can only
                  stay this evening with us. He is en route to
                  Paris, where he and his troupe are going to be
                  present at the inauguration of the Beethoven Salon; and he says he has stopped
                  just to have a practicing with me. However, you can listen to us from this room,
                  and you shall hear that grand trio in Mi bémol, of Beethoven and Mozart's Swan
                  Song."
               "And the Ghost Trio?"
               "Oh, yes, the Ghost Trio by all means, for he knows that there is a ghostly lady
                  to listen to him here in the guest-room."
               "Surely, if Heinrich could only see Fanny in her bewitching little cap," said
                  Tante Cecile, laughing, "he would feel doubly inspired. I think, my child, we must
                  arrange you on the lounge, near the door of the salon; such a picturesque effect
                  must not be lost on our merry young artist Heinrich, who loves a bit of funny
                  romance amazingly."
               The dear old lady playfully insisted upon carrying her point, and summoned Louise,
                  the stout, sturdy maid, who gathered me up as if I had been no heavier than her
                  empty water brande; and I was snugly placed on
                  the canapé, with shawls and cushions, near the salon door—only just
                  light enough thrown on me to show "the bewitching little cap to advantage," as
                  Tante Cecile said. The gentlemen had gone down to goûter while these arrangements were being made, and I was so
                  exhausted after they were over that I laid back on the cushions, and feared that I
                  should not be able to enjoy the music. Tante Cecile's delicious cream-cakes and
                  fragrant tea could not tempt me even to eat, and I closed my eyes, begging them
                  not to mind me, to let me lie there in silence, and probably with the music the
                  strength would come.
               Marie returned to the salon, and soon the music commenced. Henzler's principal
                  violoncellist was with him, and Wolfmaister took the viola, while Marie played the
                  piano. They executed first, as a quartette, the allegro in Mozart's Symphony,
                  called the "Swan Song," but I was too exhausted to appreciate it as I wished; it
                  was grand and noble; and as thoughts of death came with reviving strength into my
                  mind, I felt how much the agony of one's last moments might be softened by such
                  sounds. They then played the grand trio in Mi bémol, of Beethoven. Marie and I had
                  just been reading together that admirable book, Trois Styles
                     de Beethoven, by De Lanz; and his fine description of this glorious
                  trio was remembered with satisfaction, as I listened to the music. The masses of
                  sounds poured out like grand chorals. Then followed tearful, sorrowing minors; and
                  after these the melody came floating out airily and lightly, like hope in the
                  midst of apprehension. But in the finale, the suggestions crowded one upon
                  another; there was the delicious repose of bubbling fountains, the whirl of
                  feeling while looking at a wild mountain course, and the sublime elevation caused
                  by rolling storm-clouds and a raging sea, with fierce, driving waves slashed by
                  the wind; then the tumult of harmonies mounted up higher and higher, as each
                  instrument vied with the other. I covered my face with my hands, for my mind
                  seemed bewildered with the thick, thronging fancies crowding up before it.
               After this was over they had a great deal of merry, sparkling talk, and then they
                  tried over some new music Henzler had brought with him. One trio—a serenade by
                  Chopin's friend, Hiller—struck me forcibly, especially the passage called
                  "Ghazel," toward the close. The violin and violoncello rang out the solemn
                     fatum relentlessly but pityingly, in answer
                  to the childlike complaint of the piano, which resents, in rebellious but sweet
                  modulations—sometimes as if in dumb pain—the undeserved sorrow. The last,
                  despairing remonstrance, poured sobbingly out in broken sounds of octaves,
                  replying to the base; and then there came the mute interrogation of the heart,
                  when despairing humanity dares to turn its glazed eye to heaven, feeling, but not
                  asking, "Why this fearful pain, this unmerited judgment?"
               I began to fear that I should not hear my favorite trio of Beethoven, in Re major,
                  Opus 70, called the Ghost Trio; but after a little delay, the simple, singing
                  theme of the opening of this beautiful trio commenced. Hoffman's admirable
                  analysis of it seemed more true and just than ever I had thought it before.
               "In this artistic construction," he says, "the most wonderful pictures vie and mix
                  with one another, and in them are portrayed gladness, grief, and gentle happiness.
                  Strange forms begin a merry dance, and then vanish in a point of light—then
                  return, and, gleaming and flashing, dart to and fro; and for an instant the
                  enchanted soul seems to be in a spirit-kingdom, where she hears and understands
                  the unknown tongue, and comprehends all secret warning's and thoughts."
               The largo of this trio is very peculiar, as De Lanz remarks. The violin and
                  violoncello perform the principal theme, and Marie's fine piano and excellent
                  execution produced duced an effect that
                  even made Wolfmaister, so chary in his praises, cry "Brava" and "Bene." She put both
                  pedals down, then poured off, as it were, the glittering, liquid stream of
                  accompaniment lightly, almost murmuringly, producing an effect like a soft
                  atmosphere thrown over a delicious picture; or an opaline haze, such as one sees
                  bathing the landscapes on the Mediterranean shores; or, still more like the rich
                  autumnal golden, purple mists, hanging at sunset over our beautiful Swiss
                  mountains. The violin and violoncello talk together, as the human being might
                  question its spirit, at a moment when all human counsel is helpless; the guardian
                  demon remonstrates and reasons with its mortal charge; and after the dialogue, the
                  flood-like, descending scale of the piano, throws a brilliant flash of light over
                  the solemn converse of the two—mortal and spirit. The trio then mounts up grandly;
                  it is as if the ghostly counselor had left the mortal, filled with glorious and
                  beautiful presentiments, high and holy hopes, which make it glad and joyful; it
                  turns away freely from this shrunken world, in which, only a little while before,
                  all its hopes and wishes had been centered, and looks hopefully and yearningly
                  toward an unknown land—the warm, delicious life-breath of which seems already
                  stealing over it, while the pure instrumentation of the close gives the grandest
                  expression to this poetical thought.
               Henzler and Wolfmaister discussed Beethoven enthusiastically; and yet Wolfmaister
                  was one who, if he had lived in the days of Beethoven, would have condemned his
                  music as eccentric and exaggerated. Marie sat looking gray and dull, as if her
                  soul had gone out with the music. Presently her face lighted up, and I saw Henzler
                  lean over the piano to talk with her. While they talked, Mr. Merle and the other
                  gentlemen left the room, to go down and smoke awhile in the library; but Henzler
                  remained with Marie. They talked long and earnestly, and part of the conversation
                  was a generous expression of admiration on his part of Marie's execution and
                  expression; then he told her, as freely as a brother might, all his musical
                  schemes and plans. After some time he rose up, as if to take leave; and, to my
                  surprise, both approached the bedroom door. Tante Cecile advanced toward them,
                  and, after a few pleasant compliments, Henzler said, in a tone of playful but
                  courteous freedom,—
               "Tante Cecile, I want you to present me to Marie's mysterious unknown, whose
                  delicious little lace cap, flitting to and fro in the indistinct light of this
                  room, gave me so much inspiration this evening."
               I bent forward and half rose up, with as much strength as I possessed, and,
                  extending my hand to him, told him that we needed no introduction; that his music,
                  if not his well-known name, made me feel already as a friend to him. He leaned his
                  tall, slender figure against the door, and received with jesting gracefulness our
                  compliments and praises; after that a little pleasant conversation, then a hearty
                  grasp of the hand, a merry, ringing laugh, and Heinrich Henzler was gone.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XIV.
               DE LANZ AND CHOPIN.
               SORROW and suffering reach an end, like everything else in this world; and
                     "the yesterdays to come" arrive at last, and make us forget that
                     "spirit of the day deceased," which so often walks solemnly beside
                  us, clouding the present pleasure. With the approach of spring my physical pains
                  began to disappear, and I was again free to enjoy God's blessed sunlight, out on
                  the glorious hills. March opened pleasantly; snow still lay on some of the
                  sheltered vineyards and by-roads; but on the mountain sides the spring sun poured
                  down its rays, and melted off the winter drapery, which joined, with the thawing
                  snow from the mountain-tops, to swell the streams that came coursing down into the
                  lake, and made of them roaring torrents. Our mild-spoken Oignon, which had
                  wandered so graciously through Hauteville, and played its cascade so peacefully
                  that the professor teazingly questioned its existence, now became a fierce,
                  impetuous flood; its rushing noise could be heard at a great distance; and the
                  Hauteville cascade became a waterfall of the most approved grandeur and style,
                  threatening to carry away all the picturesque obstacles of rocks and old
                  tree-trunks, that stood between the upper and lower waterfall. The vineyards grew
                  noisy, and inhabited with the industrious paysan
                  world, who were hard at work, digging around and tying up their vines neatly with
                  straw to the supporting sticks.
               The winter was over, and with spring came new plans for every one. Our whole
                  little village world was busy; and this epidemic of new projects and plans
                  attacked even the well-poised principal of the long-established Institution
                  Eperveil. She had her capable hands and strong head also full of momentous
                  affairs, and, as usual, acted as if all other arrangements should be subservient
                  to her own. Her distinguished acquaintances, the Landsnechts, had written to her
                  to engage a cottage ornée for them, near Peilz,
                  as they intended making this part of the country their headquarters during the
                  summer; and they also wished to have a day governess for the young daughters. The
                  family were in Vienna, where they had been wintering, and were expected to arrive
                  in May, with Octave and Lord S. Madame Eperveil announced to her niece, that she
                  should have the enviable position of governess to the Misses Landsnecht, and
                  Wolfmaister was commissioned to find an extensive cottage for the wealthy family.
                  Accordingly, a grand Swiss châlet, on the road to Clarens, was procured, with
                  every orthodox ornament that a châlet should possess, of wood-carved eaves, and
                  outside staircases and decorations.
               Madame Eperveil had, however, a cause of annoyance, to make a shadow to all this
                  brilliant sunshine of importance. Mr. Serin, who had been her head master ever
                  since the death of her husband, had dared to announce, that at the approaching
                  vacation he should like to retire from his honorable post. Madame 
                     Everveil
                     Eperveil
                   could scarcely credit her eyes and ears, when she read aloud the good
                  old gentleman's note, bearing this information—for he had not possessed sufficient
                  courage to tell her by word of mouth. His reasons were good: a son, brought up and
                  educated at the institution, and who had only left a few years before, had
                  commenced an institution of his own, in North Germany, and offered his father a
                  quiet home, wishing to have the assistance of the old gentleman's counsel, and
                  also the benefit of his presence and name—which, in the eyes of his patrons, would
                  be of great consequence.
               
               One should have supposed, to have heard Tante Octavie talk and believed her view
                  of the case, that Mr. Serin and his son were monster's of ingratitude, in talking
                  this step. "A boy, educated under her own roof! A man, employed by her; who had
                  ate of her bread for thirty years! She believed it to be a plan they had meanly
                  and secretly nourished for years;" always winding up her reasonable anger with her
                  favorite expression, "C'etait impayable." She
                  never reflected that she had been paid the full sum for the board and tuition of
                  Serin, Jr., and had received honest, steady service from Serin, Sr., for the
                  thirty years' salary she had paid him. So skillfully did she represent her
                  imaginary injury, that both father and son were silenced, and felt, at the first
                  dash of her egotistical resentment, as if probably they might be in the wrong. She
                  coldly told them that the thing was impossible—at least, for some time yet; that
                  she must consult with her nephew, Mr. Octave Bouvreuil. The position of head
                  master he intended to take, after his engagement with Lord S. should be at an end;
                  that engagement was an indefinite one; it might last some two or three years yet;
                  and until he decided upon the affair, she certainly must decline making any new
                  arrangements; and she said all this in such a masterful, grand manner, that the
                  Messrs. Serin, struck aghast, were quite amazed at their involuntary, unintended
                  show of ingratitude.
               Serin, Jr., however, was not so perfectly convinced of this as was his father, and
                  he returned to Germany a little grumbling; resolved—as he mustered up enough
                  courage to whisper in confidence to Tante Cecile, Marie, and me, just before he
                  left—to keep the thing in view; that he did not see why his father should dance
                  attendance on the capricious decisions of Mr. Octave, who was about as fit to be
                  head master of an institution for education, as he was to be an archangel. Then,
                  startled at his temerity, he bound us to strict secrecy, and left, muttering
                  unutterable things, in order to convince himself that he was not selfish or
                  ungrateful, in wishing to have his own father assist him in his honest endeavors
                  in establishing a school by which he wished to earn his living.
               In April, part of the Landsnecht cortege made their appearance, in the persons of
                  some stylish-looking little girls and boys, headed by a nursery governess and
                  tutor, with an army of bonnes and valets. Hélène was installed into her new office of
                  day governess, by Madame Eperveil, who acted on the occasion as an empress might,
                  after conferring a great title, with lands attached thereto, on a young and
                  obscure relative. This threw me more on Marie and Tante Cecile for society, as
                  Hélène's new occupations not only filled up all her time, but gave fresh duties to
                  Madame Bouvreuil.
               The spring fever for work had shown itself in Marie, by the commencement of a very
                  close study of Mozart's and Beethoven's sonates, arranged for four hands, which
                  she played with Wolfmaister. On the evenings of their practicings together, I
                  always took my embroidery, and went to the chateau to listen to them. One evening,
                  when I arrived, I found her in high argument about our musical high-priest Chopin,
                  with Wolfmaister. The master was striding up and down the salon, with his long
                  elf-locks tossed wildly off of his forehead.
               "Mon Dieu!" he cried, in his shrill high-pitched voice; "I should know something
                  about the matter surely, Marie. I knew Chopin personally. I was his pupil for six
                  months. This very waltz I studied with him, when it was composed; and I pride
                  myself upon playing it 'close to the letter of the tradition,' as you would
                  say.
               "I cannot help it if you did," answered Marie. "All I can say is, if you willfully
                  misunderstood your great advantages, it is not my fault. You certainly did, or you
                  would not insist so obstinately upon a faulty expression and accent, which is so
                  widely different in effect from the very evident meaning,—the poetical thought
                  contained in the composition."
               
               I was appealed to, and found that the cause of dispute was that exquisite waltz of
                  Chopin, in Re bémol, major. Wolfmaister played it, to prove to me his idea of the
                  style in which it should be executed; but, by his regular beat and measured
                  accentuation, the waltz did, indeed, lose one-half of its beauty. Then Marie
                  played it, and the difference was marvelously striking. Under Wolfmaister's
                  fingers it had sounded like a piece of crotchets and quavers, beats and measures.
                  Marie made of it a poem. There was an irresistible hurrying up of the time during
                  the first eight measures, with a run up to Si bémol, ending with a click on this
                  note, as keen as a heart-clutch, at the first moment of the certainty of mortal
                  sorrow; then a slight relapsing, with rainbow lights and transparent shadows, for
                  four measures; the motif then commenced
                  restlessly again, bringing back the old torture,—"the old wound, ever aching." On
                  it rushed recklessly, with mad swiftness, sprinkling the way with tears precious
                  as pearls, faster and faster, until it reached a resolution that seemed like some
                  desperate resolve, at which hope appeared to beam out; a gleam of peace shone over
                  the heart; the lovely, rocking rubato melody,
                  consoling it with sweet promises and gentle sobs of relieved anguish, fell from
                  the broken measures. But suddenly, dissonances were heard; the tocsin of Fate
                  struck out in the preparatory trill, as if to remind one of the stern dictum of
                  destiny,—that the heart cannot have rest; the melody, as a type of human feeling,
                  relapsed again into sorrow, and then came the finale,—the whirlpool of passion,
                  which seemed to ingulf all human hope.
               "Can this be played slowly?" cried the enthusiastic girl. "Can one bind one's
                  self, in such an inspiration as this, to cold rules of time? You might as well ask
                  the wind to blow to the measured beat of the metronome, as attempt to curb this
                  desperate measure."
               Wolfmaister was touched with the earnestness of Marie. With any other pupil he
                  would have been irritable and dictatorial, as he was very often with her; but at
                  times her genius overpowered him, and although he could not understand her, nor
                  hear in music all that she heard,—and even sometimes presumed to doubt the truth
                  of this tone-tongue,—there were moments when her strong faith impressed him, and
                  this was one of those moments. He shrugged his shoulders, with the true Parisian
                  impertinent shrug, which says so much more than any saucy anglo-Saxon word can
                  express, saying: it was preposterous ever to reason with a woman, as she
                  invariably made it a matter of feeling; then, all argument was at an end, and in
                  this way men were always terribly imposed upon, as they had to give up, even
                  unconvinced. He said all this with such a droll air of injured innocence, that we
                  could not help laughing.
               We then talked of Chopin, and his six months' knowledge of him; and he told us
                  many charming stories. Among them was one De Lanz also tells.
               "De Lanz and I were pupils of Chopin about the same time," he said. "Meyerbeer,
                  who was then working at his 'Prophet,' interrupted De Lanz one day, while taking
                  his lesson. At Paris, the persons one wishes most to see are met with the least,
                  therefore Chopin was delighted with the visit of the celebrated maestro. 'Since I
                  find you there,' said Meyerbeer, pointing to the piano, 'remain there for love of
                  me.' Chopin did so, and played some mazurkas. The one in Ut, Opus 33, No. 2, gave
                  rise to some lively discussions between the two artists; Meyerbeer pretending that
                  it was in 2-4 time, instead of 3. Chopin did all that he could to combat this
                  opinion, for Moscheles had already told him that Meyerbeer had said this. He
                  played and replayed the mazurka: it was the only time I ever saw his pale face
                  kindle; a hectic flush lighted up his cheers and eyes. Meyerbeer persisted. 'Give
                  me your mazurka,' he said at last; 'I will make a ballet of it and put it in my
                  opera; you will then see that it is in 2-4 time.' And," added Wolfmaister, pedantically, "adhuc sub judice lis est."
               I made Wolfmaister tell me all he could remember of his intercourse with this
                  poet-artist, "who consecrated his great talents to the glorification of noble
                  sentiments in works of art."
               "After our lessons," said Wolfmaister, "Chopin always played for us whatever music
                  we had brought with us, of the great masters. I remember one day, De Lanz had with
                  him Beethoven's sonate, in Ut dieze mineur, the
                  one generally called 'The Moonlight Sonate.' The allegretto of this sonate, Liszt
                  had been playing for De Lanz, and he asked Chopin to play it, in order to see the
                  difference between the two. There is a suite of chords in it which Liszt bound
                  together by his own peculiar style of fingering; when Chopin played it, he
                  produced this tying together by the shades and softness of his own peculiar touch.
                  De Lanz played it over after him, using Liszt's fingering. 'This fingering is not
                  yours?' asked Chopin, in his little, agreeable voice. 'No, it is Liszt's,'
                  answered De Lanz. 'Ah!' cried Chopin; 'vous
                     voyez. Liszt has ideas no one else would ever think of;' and he sat
                  down to the piano, trying over the fingering, saying again and again, with the
                  generous frankness of a true genius, 'This fingering of Liszt is perfect; I shall
                  make use of it.'"
               "Tell Fanny about little Filtsch," said Marie.
               I had heard of him before, and read of him in De Lanz; but I was very well pleased
                  to hear Wolfmaister's reminiscences, so I said nothing, but listened with
                  interest.
               "Little Filtsch was a young Hungarian," said Wolfmaister, "who had the most
                  marvelous musical talent one can imagine. When he was ten years of age, he was
                  sent to Paris by some rich patrons, to have his musical studies directed by Liszt
                  and Chopin. They both grew very fond of him, and he made such rapid progress, as
                  to excite the attention of the circle surrounding him. De Lanz and I were
                  sometimes allowed to be present during the lessons he gave to young Filtsch. One
                  day we were there, when the child, accompanied by Chopin on a second piano, played
                  his concerto, in Mi mineur. Chopin's eyes
                  glittered with actual tears. The day was a glorious one for little Filtsch. After
                  he finished the concerto, Madame Sand caught him up in her arms, and embraced him
                  with rapture. Chopin said nothing of the gratification he felt, but simply invited
                  them all to accompany him to Schlesinger's music-store. Chopin, you know, spoke
                  very little; words seemed too heavy and inexpressive for his use, I suppose you
                  æsthetical ladies would say; nor was he sociable, or apt to give invitations of
                  this sort—therefore this one was quite an event. They all accompanied him
                  mechanically, not knowing what to understand by it. Few words were exchanged,
                  during the way up to the Rue Richelieu. When they reached Schlesinger's, Chopin
                  asked for the partition of Fidelio, for the piano, and putting it
                  into the hands of little Filtsch, said, with his sweet-toned voice, 'Take this, my
                  child, as a souvenir of me; thou hast well merited it to-day.' The boy, who had
                  not expected anything, and who had modestly thought himself already forgotten, was
                  so surprised and pleased that he burst into tears."
               "Poor child!" I said. "How soon after that did he die, Mr. Wolfmaister?"
               "Not long, he was about fourteen when he died, poor little fellow! If he had
                  lived, he would have been a most marvelous artist. Even Liszt said of him, one
                  evening while listening to him, at a soirée of the Comtesse d'Agout,—as he played
                  the 'Morceau' of the 'Lucia,'—'When that child travels, I shall shut up shop.'
                  Chopin also interested himself particularly in him, and entertained the most
                  sanguine hopes of his future."
               "But Chopin interested himself in each one of his pupils," said Marie. "Just
                  think, Fanny, what an invaluable master he must have been; he concerned himself as
                  much about the pursuits, occupations,
                  and mental habits of a favorite élève, as about
                  his music."
               "Oh, yes," interrupted Wolfmaister, "he constantly bored me about my reading,
                  which annoyed me excessively, for I never cared much for books. Then he would get
                  very much irritated at me, because I did nothing but practice, and say, in his
                  little, broken voice, 'It is quite useless, mon
                     ami, to cultivate the fingers, when the mind lies barren.'"
               Marie and Wolfmaister then recommenced their practicing. They played Mozart's
                  sonate in Ut; and, after that, a romance of this composer, in Mi bémol, to which
                  Marie directed my attention, as being the one De Lanz called "the ancestress of
                  all the 'songs without words'" of the present day, "the grandmother
                  of all possible and impossible nocturnes." Then they played the Symphonie
                  Heroïque, of Beethoven. After the last solemn chords of the "Marche Funèbre" died
                  out, Marie said,—
               "I do not like the story some writers tell of this symphony. They say that the
                  'Marche Funèbre' was added to it by Beethoven, resentfully, after he heard that
                  Napoleon had made himself Emperor of the French; that he regarded his republican
                  hero as having gone down to the tomb, and therefore sang his requiem instead of
                  his hymn of glory. I know Schindler says that the Symphonie was commenced in 1802,
                  and not completed until 1804; but he also says it was finished and ready, even
                  with the dedication, to be sent to Paris, when Beethoven heard the news; so,
                  according to that, the Marche was already in it. Two years ago, when I was at
                  Vienna,—where, you know, Henzler's orchestra plays these symphonies superbly,—I
                  heard this Symphonie Heroïque, with all the grand orchestral effect, several
                  times; and every time I listened, my own musical reason rebelled against such an
                  erroneous idea. Both Schindler and De Lanz argue rightly. The Marche Funèbre is an
                  integral part of the whole symphony, necessary to make it complete; indeed,
                  intended from the beginning; for a composition like this must be one great
                  thought, not a piece of inlaid work, or mosaic. See, how grand and calm is the
                  first movement! the thought of death shows itself even there; and the great
                  tone-poet has given this poetical shadow to the entire composition; the knowledge
                  of the inevitable law of humanity possesses it. There is in it the solemn
                  mournfulness of tragic beauty, which is the loftiest point of art; the
                  consciousness of the fatum of all human grandeur
                  breathes through the whole symphony; and when we arrive at the Marche Funèbre, it
                  is not a 'chant de deuil,' but a grand martial
                  hymn, bearing the hero, with pomp, to his mausoleum. The Symphonie Heroïque,
                  without the Marche Funèbre, would, to my fancy, be imperfect—it would lose its
                  high poetical merit."
               I loved to listen to Marie, when she was in a raptus, like the present; but Wolfmaister sneered, and found
                  technical faults, such as men are apt to find with a woman when she talks
                  enthusiastically, and said she was rhapsodizing.
               "Yes," I cried out, laughing, "now, Mr. Wolfmaister, you are like Madame Eperveil.
                  I overheard her say, the other day, that 'Marie Merle rhapsodizes, and
                  Mademoiselle Fauvette is her audience; and a pretty couple of fools they are, with
                  their divine philosophy. It's all music and high art with them; just as if music
                  and high art ever built a house, or kept it after it was built."
               Wolfmaister and Marie joined in my laugh, and asked me if I had not been tempted
                  to go into the salon, and give the old lady an æsthetical lecture.
               "I had not the courage," I answered; "she puts me down effectually, with her cold,
                  material words. I sat silent, and listened patiently to her attacks on us and our
                  pursuits, feeling very sure she could not have done the same thing. She would have
                  bounced in on any one, in a fury, had she overheard herself thus judged unjustly;
                  so I comforted myself with talking at her, and said to my invisible
                  opponent, Newman Noggs fashion, 'Yes, Tante Octavie, "music and high art," as you contemptuously say, not
                  only beautify existence but purify the disciple; the soul draws nourishment from
                  them, and the intelligence develops.' Poor Tante Octavie! she fancies herself far
                  beyond us, and yet she does not know the first word of real life philosophy."
               "I must confess," said Wolfmaister, who felt this attack not a little,—for he
                  often united with Madame Eperveil in ridiculing us; "I must confess, however,
                  ladies,—much as I I have studied music, and love it,—your æsthetical flights go
                  quite beyond my comprehension; and many compositions that you elaborate over with
                  your fine talking, seem very confused and muddled to me."
               I felt tempted to frighten the saucy master out of his assumed courage, and pluck
                  out Tante Octavie's feathers of sarcasm, which he was wearing so pertly,
                  pretending to be angry; but I was prevented by Marie saying,—
               "Yes, there is a divine language in some, musical passages entirely
                  untranslatable; it is the spirit, not the word, that speaks to the imagination.
                  Directly one attempts to analyze these feelings, the words sound exaggerated to
                  the uninitiated, and inefficient to the one who comprehends all that is conveyed
                  by the sounds of this marvelous tone-language. Par
                     exemple, there are many passages in Hoffmann, De Lanz, Berlioz, and
                  many other writers on musical criticism,—even Beethoven's own conversations,—that
                  sound what you would call incomprehensible. How often has Tante Octavie, and you
                  also, Mr. Wolfmaister, exclaimed, 'What stuff!' over a passage in which the
                  author, in the most conscientious and serious manner imaginable, was kindly
                  endeavoring to convey to the mind of the reader, and the ear of the listener, an
                  idea of the musical composition; and I could not attempt to defend the
                  composition. Indeed, it seems there is no way of avoiding hyperbole, when one
                  attempts to translate emotions, some expressions of music, into words."
               I felt disposed to punish Wolfmaister, and determined he should hear what I had to
                  say also, so I continued: "Words are powerless in such explanations; and this
                  shows that music is the only true language fit to express some emotions of the
                  soul. Such is the inferiority of our mortal nature, that our words never express
                  to others, nor to ourselves, that which we are feeling deeply. Let the warm tide
                  of some noble feeling, some generous appreciation, some tender sympathy well up in
                  our hearts, and we are speechless; or, if we attempt to speak, we utter only the
                  same words and expressions we should use hourly, in the most insignificant
                  conversations; the hot tears rush to our eyes, our pulses throb, our whole being
                  palpitates; but we rest dumb. We can produce the physical cries of the animal, but
                  we cannot—when experiencing some keen emotion of grief, or joy, or admiration of
                  beauty, as seen in works of nature or art—attain, by words, the delicate, poetical
                  feeling we wish to express. We cannot give the cry of the soul. A grand, generous
                  emotion does not ask to be materially represented by words; these are too
                  realistic, and give either an insignificant or false impression of that which is
                  stirring within us. Only in music do we find the expression interpreted
                  intelligibly."
               Wolfmaister pursed up his lips, and elevated his eyebrows. Marie noticed it; and
                  turning full on him, with mock solemnity, shook her pretty little forefinger
                  playfully in his face, and said,—
               "Renegade student of the great high-priest Chopin, remember the words of one of
                  the worthy disciples of your great master: 'One arrives at art only by roads
                  barred to the vulgar: by the road of prayer, of purity of heart; by confidence in
                  the wisdom of the Eternal and even in that which is incomprehensible.'"
               Wolfmaister drew a long breath. "Phew!" he half whistled, in a low tone.
                  "Incomprehensible!" and, turning to the piano, he played one of De Meyer's
                  compositions, with admirable crispness and delicacy of touch; such scales, such
                  fiorituri! so clear, that the sunlight danced
                  brightly through every part, saying, as he played: "Now, this is what I call
                  music; there is no need here of any of your æsthetical, incomprehensible words, to
                  explain it, 'making confusion worse confounded.'"
               "Yes," said Marie to me, in a low voice, "that is simple enough, Heaven knows;
                  that music can be put down in plain nouns and verbs, moods and tenses; that is all
                  grammar rule, horlogerie; no need of any
                  exercise of faith there."
               "That's right, ladies," said Wolfmaister, good naturedly, while he modulated into
                  an exquisitely graceful waltz, of his own composition; delicious to listen to, but
                  giving no subject for thought; suggesting not one poetical idea, or spiritual
                  experience. "Keep all your high flights to yourselves; for I assure you, just so
                  soon as you get up into that fine æsthetical talking, it is incomprehensible to
                  me—and I am glad it is. I think, with Madame Eperveil, that music and high art
                  never built a house; and such music as you admire never makes the money to buy
                  one. I am very glad I never was afflicted with such reveries; if I had been, I
                  should have turned out another old Wehrstaedt. I should never have built my pretty
                  little cottage, or had Clarens lots to sell to rich Russians and English, out of
                  my music lessons at four Swiss francs an hour."
               The man was right, so far as he was concerned; his reasoning was good, for him and
                  his like; and we wasted no more of what he called our "æsthetics" on him.
            
            
               CHAPTER XV.
               NEW ARRIVALS.
               MAY came, and with it Tante Octavie's great friends, the Landsnechts. Octave and
                  Lord S. did not accompany them, as they had spent the latter part of the winter in
                  Paris, but were to arrive in June. Octave was anxiously expected, for many
                  reasons: Mr. Serin hoped he would conclude upon taking the head mastership; so did
                  his family, especially his mother, who thought, if he would once settle himself at
                  the institution, he would be out of temptation; and, to the temptations that
                  surrounded him out in the gay world, she attributed all his faults. Clear sighted
                  as she was about other things, her mother-feeling made her blind on this subject;
                  she could not see that he was selfish and heartless; she believed him to be only
                  thoughtless and indolent, and looked to a regular quiet life, and a marriage with
                  Marie Merle, to make him all he should be.
               The Merles wished to see Octave to ask him about poor, pretty Emilie Michel, who
                  had left her home, in the Bas Valais, during the winter, saying she had received a
                  fine offer from a grand modiste in Paris, which
                  would make her fortune; and, despite the entreaties of her friends, had gone to
                  Paris. Rumor, that noisy demon, said that she had been seen, by some Sallenches
                  people visiting Paris, dressed very gayly, in a fine carriage, in the Bois de
                  Bologne, with some dashing-looking men and women; that they had spoken to her, but
                  that she had pretended not to know them, although she had colored very red, and
                  showed much confusion. The poor misguided girl had not many near relatives: an
                     old grandmother, and a maiden aunt,
                  with whom she lived, and Michel, the "incomparable
                     mari," who was her uncle, were all. Michel, of course, gave himself
                  no trouble about her; but poor Elise Michel! she remembered Emilie as her playmate
                  in childhood; to her this story caused great sorrow and bitter tears. Madame
                  Michel was also distressed; but her gentle little step-daughter's affliction
                  grieved her more than Emilie's misconduct. For Emilie she felt great contempt and
                  anger; and when away from Elise, she expressed herself with much bitterness; she
                  did not like to wound her daughter by saying before her what she said to us: "that
                  she believed the worst of the worthless little minx." What wrath she displayed!
                  She was like Rose Maylie's chaste maids; she evidently thought as they did, "that
                  it's no use being proper in this world;" and when speaking of the probability of
                  the story, she seemed to dwell on the report of Emilie's fine clothes and gay
                  doings with a sort of resentful feeling, and indulged in short sayings as
                  expressive as the one used by the Dianas above alluded to, "that brass can do
                  better than the gold that has stood the fire." She had not passed through her
                  forty years of spinsterhood to stand by and see such an outrage on feminine virtue
                  and morality pass unscathed; and when we represented to her that poor pretty
                  Emilie was as much to be pitied as condemned, she looked as horror-stricken as if
                  we had also gone over to the immoral enemy. We could only appease her by telling
                  her that if the story were true, Emilie's future was sure to be as wretched, and
                  her punishment as severe, as the most grievous sin could merit; then she showed
                  the greatest satisfaction, and looked as if she wished she could see that
                  punishment meted out in its severest and fullest measure.
               Our indignation was poured out on Octave, for we did believe that he had enticed
                  the pretty, silly girl to Paris. Marie never spoke of it to me; but Tante Cecile
                  and I indulged in as violent denunciations against him as did poor Madame Michel
                  against Emilie.
               The first part of June he came accompanied by Lord S.; and, on the first
                  opportunity Marie could get, she asked him frankly about Emilie. They parted in
                  high anger; for Octave wounded Marie to the quick, by such sneers and impertinent
                  assumptions of ignorance and astonishment, as only a man like Octave could employ
                  to a frank, enthusiastic, guileless woman. Had Marie consulted me, I should have
                  counseled her not to appeal to Octave; but she acted in accordance with the
                  promptings of her innocent nature; she knew nothing of the cold, heartless,
                  licentious feelings that filled his breast; she appealed to him as she would have
                  done when a little girl, to coax, a bird's nest from him, or to save a poor dog
                  from cruel punishment, or an inoffending cat from drowning. And even when they
                  parted in anger, only the tenth part of his real character beamed on her; she
                  could not fully comprehend his hollow, polished wickedness.
               Tante Cecile told me some of the details of the interview. Octave, she said, had
                  striven to evade the charge by expressing a sneering surprise at a delicate,
                  modest young woman's having anything to do with such matters, and still more at
                  her selecting it as a subject of conversation with a gentleman. A woman more
                  experienced than Marie would have been baffled and humiliated; but she was not;
                  she told him there was but one manly, honest course for him to take: to say
                  whether he had or had not anything to do with Emilie's going to Paris; and,
                  whether he had or not, to assist them in reclaiming her. Then when, with a mocking
                  laugh, he said he hoped he should not be made responsible for the peccadillos of
                  all the pretty little milliner girls who chose to go up to Paris to seek their
                  fortunes, and that he had fancied that she had more self-esteem than to feel
                  jealous of such persons, she sternly bade him to cease talking in that style
                  before her; and added, that until he could clear himself satisfactorily of the
                  charge, she could not regard him as a friend, and hoped he would cease visiting at
                  their house. Octave, bowing coolly, left the chateau, and commenced menced forthwith the most devoted attentions to
                  Miss Landsnecht, who, in default of any other more available cavalier, was very
                  willing to accept his devotion. He rode, drove, walked, played, and sang with her,
                  took her boating—in fact, gave his whole time to her.
               Miss Landsnecht was a tall, dressy young lady, in her second season. She was what
                  is called in society a stylish distinguée-looking woman. She dressed in the height of the mode; her
                     crinolines and flounces expanded in the most
                  approved style; her bonnet was of the smallest possible size, and her head, by the
                  aid of rolls, and bandeaux, and cushions, was of the largest possible dimensions.
                  She had been educated for society, and lived for it; she was accomplished and
                  elegant; was a linguist, an artist, a musician,—in short, was everything that
                  society might require of a rich but plébeian
                  Miss Landsnecht, who coveted a high-born titled man for a husband from society, in
                  return for all the exertions and sacrifices she made. But as we had nothing to do
                  with Miss Landsnecht, nor she with us, there is no need of wasting more words on
                  her.
               Before we leave poor Emilie, however, I may as well tell here all I know of her
                  history, that the sad, disagreeable subject may be dismissed. We rarely heard of
                  her with any certainty. Once in awhile reports would reach us of her reputed life
                  in Paris, where she was said to be leading one of the fastest and most dissipated.
                  It was told that she drove handsome horses, and could be seen at the opera and
                  play as gay in jewels and costly laces as a duchess. Persons were employed to seek
                  her out, but in vain; she eluded all inquiries, and none of us knew any direct way
                  of approaching her. Then, in after years, came another story, of a poor miserable
                  wretch, worn down with illness and poverty, being found dead in some den in Paris;
                  and we had reason to believe that this poor creature was Emilie Michel; and when
                  we heard it, we all solemnly prayed, with tears and fervent earnestness, that
                  Octave Bouvreuil might not have been held answerable for the wretched girl's ruin.
                  She has no more to do with this recital; so good-by to pretty Emilie Michel.
               Mr. Serin, like every one else, was disappointed in Mr. Octave. Madame Eperveil
                  did not deign to allude to the subject of the head mastership; but it was
                  announced that Octave would, with Lord S., accompany the Landsnechts to the Baths
                  of Lucca, in August, and that the two gentlemen purposed spending the following
                  winter in Naples; this, of course, proved that he had no intention of becoming
                  head master of Institution Eperveil, for this year at least. So meek old Mr. Serin
                  submitted to the disappointment with as good and patient a grace as possible.
               Before the closing of the Institution in June, for the summer congé, Madame Eperveil always gave a grand soiréee,
                  which came off about three weeks before examination day, when the distribution of
                  honors and grades to the students took place. This soirée was an announcement of
                  the closing of the gayeties of the institution for the season, and was generally a
                  very brilliant affair. After this soirée, the students "turned in," as Brown, an
                  American boy, said, "and polled hard" for the examination, which
                  never was a gay affair, but one of strict business. On the present occasion, Tante
                  Octavie's measure of glory was to be filled to the brim, thrice pressed down, and
                  running over; her first of June soirée was to be honored by not only the
                  Landsnechts and Lord S., but a Baron and Baronne de W., who inhabited a
                  neighboring chateau, which they had rented for the season. They were old Berlin
                  acquaintances of Madame Eperveil, and the Barronne had known the Bouvreuils in
                  their more prosperous days. The de W.'s had with them a great guest; and this
                  guest was no less a personage than a real live prince, the Prince de P., who had
                  graciously signified his intention of honoring the soirée. with his presence. To
                  be sure, the prince was a valet-made, not a God-made man; and looked like one of
                  those simpering wax-heads heads in a
                  barber's window; still, he was a prince, and Tante Octavie knew very well the
                  effect that would be produced by his appearance.
               And now, the old lady condescended to express a desire that Mademoiselle Fauvette
                  might be induced to sing at the soirée. Early in the winter, I had refused to sing
                  at the musicales held in the hall, and had given
                  so much offence to Madame Eperveil, by the refusal, that she would never listen to
                  me when I sang at our more private réunions; and
                  when I "took coffee" at her house, as the little family-parties were called, she
                  steadily persisted in never asking me to sing. She considered my refusal the
                  result of a silly affectation, and she made no secret of her opinion to others;
                  while to me, her manner was plain enough, without words, to prove to me what she
                  thought.
               The afternoon of the soirée I met Mr. Wolfmaister at Marie's, and after they had
                  finished their rehearsal of the pieces to be played in the evening, he mentioned
                  Madame Eperveil's wish, and urged it by saying, how much singing would add to the
                  interest of the soirée, as we so rarely had any.
               "I cannot, indeed," I replied; "it is not pique, I assure you, neither is it an
                  affectation of timidity. Singing is such a pure affair of feeling to me that I
                  cannot sing in a crowd. I could as soon rise up before the assembled company and
                  tell them my whole life-history, or fall on my knees and say my prayers before
                  them."
               "Ah," said Wolfmaister, shrugging his shoulders; "music is a terrible agony to you
                  and Marie, with your sublime, poetical notions, or æsthetical, I
                  believe you like to have them called. Your 'thirst after the infinite,' your
                  'inner revealings' and 'spiritual elevations' are quite awful. Thank God, I do not
                  understand such refined miseries! my feeling for music is more practical and
                  positive."
               "That it is," cried Marie; "like bread and cheese, sauerkraut and lagerbier. Any
                  one might know that, by the way you play. Musicians like you, make me think of the
                  line in holy writ, 'Many are called, but few are chosen.' But you know the maxim,
                     mon maître, 'In art the great is not for all,
                  and all are not for the great.'"
               "Now, there is the presumption of the thing," he answered, with a good-natured
                  laugh; "however, I will let you have it so. That being great in art is beggarly
                  business, after all; if it is any comfort to you to have such greatness, pray take
                  it—I want none of it. You should have known old Wehrstaedt, of Geneva—he was a
                  musician of your great sort. What a droll fellow he was, to be
                  sure!"
               "Yes," interrupted Marie; "God bless his memory! I wish I had him here in your
                  place. Fanny, Wehrstaedt was one of those who verily gave up all and followed his
                  divine music."
               "With his old hat on, à la quakre," said
                  Wolfmaister, laughing, immoderately. "I took lessons for several years of the
                  crazy old fellow, and I never once saw him, night or day, without that shocking
                  old hat, nailed tight to his head."
               "Oh!" I exclaimed; "is it the odd genius De Lanz speaks of?"
               "The very one," said Marie; "just think, this heathen had the priceless blessing
                  of his lessons, and dares to laugh at him."
               "And is all true De Lanz says of him?"
               "True as gospel," replied Marie.
               "I give you my word," said Wolfmaister, his voice hoarse with the laughter which
                  the recollection of the quaint old maestro had caused, and tears of merriment
                  actually rolling down his checks, "he knew only five things: three Exercises of
                  Cramer, a Sonate of Weber, and the last Variation in the Grand Sonate of
                  Beethoven. Whenever I would find him alone, he would be sitting at his old piano,
                  his wretched hat nailed tight to his head, and he, gazing into vacancy with his
                  pale-blue eyes, playing this,"—and Wolfmaister maister played over the last Variation in the Grand
                  Sonate in La bémol.
               "Mr. Wolfmaister," I asked, "have you ever read De Lanz's account of this
                  eccentric artist?"
               "He!—no!" cried Marie, impetuously; "did you ever know a man, who talks as he
                  does, ever read anything beyond the business part of a newspaper? If I could know
                  of his reading a book on musical criticism or musical history, I should have some
                  hope of meeting him hereafter in my musical heaven, where Wehrstaedt, I am sure,
                  will be found as one of those meek spirits
               
                  
                     'Who inherit, instead of motive powers,
                     Impulsions God supplied;
                     Instead of vital spirit,
                     A clear informing beauty;
                     Instead of creature duty,
                     Submission calm as rest.'"
                  
               
               "Oh, oh, oh!" cried Wolfmaister, with well-affected agony, snatching up his music
                  and hat; "you are getting decidedly too transcendental for me. I sincerely hope,
                  Marie, you will descend from your aerial heights in time for our opening duo this
                  evening." And he rushed out of the room, muttering, in a voice of feigned
                  suffering: "Mon Dieu! just think of quoting poetry about old Wehrstaedt, and
                  making an angel and all that out of him! Ciel! and this is the insanity to which
                  their æsthetics bring them! Gare! gare! au secours!"
               We laughed heartily at his flight, and also at the punishment we had inflicted on
                  him, for playing off on us Tante Octavie's harsh, rude opinions; for although we
                  firmly believed and felt all we said about music, but for his pert repetitions of
                  her unamiable speeches, we should not have expressed ourselves so
                  enthusiastically.
               I sat for a little while with Marie, listening to her reading over some music
                  Hofer had sent that day for her to examine; then we both went into the little
                  tower room, and watched from the window the beautiful sunset; and leaned over the
                  "Francesca di Rimini and Paolo," across which were passing soft, golden lights,
                  thrown down from the armorial bearings which the lunette of the window held, and
                  flecks of brilliant color faded, and brightened and faded again. Poor Marie!
                  though she talked cheerfully, she looked worn and unhappy. Her late difference
                  with Octave had grieved her very much; his conduct showed such true meanness of
                  character. So strange it is, that we may know people for almost a lifetime, giving
                  them credit for points of character which some sudden flash of light near the end
                  shows us were not inherent, but only the effect of an outward coating of good
                  breeding, or the still more powerful influence of custom or social opinion. Marie
                  had always considered Octave unreliable and weak, when exposed to temptation; but
                  that he should be so really heartless and wickedly selfish, in the indulgence of
                  his passions, as to ruin a young, ignorant girl, was a sad revelation to her.
                  Then, when she showed her disgust and sorrow at such conduct, to have him treat as
                  low, vulgar jealousy what was a high-toned feeling of wounded love and generous
                  sorrow for the disgrace of one who, though beneath her in the social scale, still
                  was a sister woman, and thereby entitled to her aid and sympathy,—all this made
                  him fall lower and more hopelessly in her opinion. She never noticed his
                  attentions to Miss Landsnecht; and when, by chance, we met them in society or our
                  walks, not a look betrayed whatever she might be suffering; she said nothing of
                  the affair to Tante Cecile nor me; but there was a sharpness in the tone of her
                  voice, sometimes an irritability and impatience, and restless, quick movements in
                  domestic life, which proved that she did suffer.
               Tante Cecile called us to goûter, and, after
                  drinking a cup of her fragrant black tea, whose odor was as fresh as réséda, and
                  eating enormously of a magnificent gâteau, of the usual immense Peilz size, and
                  listening to Mr. Merle reading bits out of yesterday's Journal des Débats, I rose to go home to dress for the great soirée.
                  Marie walked through the court-yard with me. Michel and his wife were there,
                  arranging the lettuce and fine vegetables for the next morning market at V.; the
                  garden fruit looked very pretty, grouped together with the good natural taste of
                  Madame Michel and her "incomparable mari." It
                  would have made a beautiful subject for a Flemish artist; the high court-yard
                  walls, with the ruined chapel window, draped 
                     
                        with many a gay festoon
                        And fragrant chaplet, recompensing well
                        The strength they borrow with the grace they lend."
                     
                   Then the court-yard and old fountain, and the paysan, with his tall, slim wife, in her scrupulously neat dress,
                  and snowy, fluted bordered cap—the simplest and prettiest head-dress of all the
                  European paysannes; she, occupied in washing the
                  fine heads of lettuce, and he, arranging them with taste and care in the long,
                  shallow baskets, thinking undoubtedly with pride of the good effect they would
                  produce the following morning in the justly celebrated market of V. Then the
                  surrounding accessions of flower-beds, filled with gay, flaunting tulips and
                  hyacinths, and the stands of pot plants scattered about, made of the place as
                  pretty a subject of that genre as an artist might wish. Madame Michel told us that
                  Tante Octavie had ordered some fine bouquets for her supper table, and invited us
                  into the house to see them. Elise was hard at work over a brilliant basketful.
               "Why, what is the reason of this?" I asked. "I thought Madame Eperveil had enough
                  flowers of her own."
               "Voila, mademoiselle! Henri, her gardener, wishes to have the conservatories
                  lighted for the evening, and some of the tallest plants are to be put in flat
                  pyramidal stands in the large windows of the grand salle; so Madame Eperveil, by
                  that arrangement, needed at least a dozen more bouquets. Henri came to Michel for
                  them, and we have had to cut all our flowers and Légère's, too, at 
                     Montrueux
                     Montreux
                  . Poor Michel is tired out with his hunt after them; and coming on market
                  eve makes it so much harder for him, pauvre
                     enfant! he is so kind, he does not mind trouble for others; c'est
                  impossible de dire, mademoiselle, toute la bonté de cet homme!"
               "How fine Tante Octavie's rooms are going to be!" said Marie, laughing.
               Just at that moment the outer door opened, and a smart footman entered, and asked
                  for the bouquet Mr. Octave Bouvreuil had ordered for Miss Landsnecht. A superb
                  one, filled with the choicest flowers, was handed to him, and he left.
               "Maman!" said the pretty, kind Elise, "in that
                  basket by you are the bouquets for Mesdemoiselles Marie, Fauvette, and Bouvreuil.
                  I made them first, mesdemoiselles, and they have in them the very prettiest
                  flowers."
               The good girl had undoubtedly felt incensed at Octave's neglect of us, and
                  particularly of Marie, whom she dearly loved, and had showed it in this naïve, kind way. We thanked her heartily for her
                  courtesy; and I hurried off with my two bouquets, and some gay flowers for my
                  hair, having stayed already too long for the good of my evening toilette. I found
                  Hélène and her mother quite ready, sitting with Kinnaird under the Marron d'Inde,
                  on the bridge walk; Hélène, beautiful as an angel, 
                     
                        "In her virginal white vesture gathered closely to her throat."
                     
                  
               
               I hastened up to my room, and found Dora in a fidget of uneasiness, with all my
                     "fineries" spread out on the table and bed. As we had all agreed
                  to go in simple, white gowns, and my hair needed no fresh dressing, except to
                  arrange in it Elise Michel's starry, white jessamine and brilliant scarlet sage,
                  my Creole robe was quickly adjusted to Dora's perfect satisfaction, and we were
                     en route in ample time.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVI.
               SOIRÉE AT TANTE OCTAVIE'S.
               WE reached the gate of Institution Eperveil just as Marie Merle, with Tante Cecile
                  and Mr. Merle, came up. Kinnaird and Professor Bouvreuil were our cavaliers, as
                  Octave was with the Landsnechts, where he and Lord S. had been dining. Tante
                  Cecile walked with me through the ball and conservatories, admiring the
                  arrangements, for we were an hour too soon. We talked, very naturally, about
                  Octave.
               "Madame Bouvreuil has been remonstrating with Madame Eperveil, about Octave's
                  going to Italy," I said. "She told me yesterday she intended to."
               "Yes," replied Tante Cecile, "I was in the garden at the time; we were taking a
                  cup of coffee together, and I heard the most of the conversation. I fancy I
                  understood more of Tante Octavie's reply than Madame Bouvreuil did, and I should
                  not be surprised if she meant it for Marie and me. Octave had, undoubtedly, given
                  his aunt his own version of poor Emilie's story."
               "What did Madame Eperveil say?"
               "Madame Bouvreuil begged Tante Octavie to use her authority, or at least
                  influence, to induce Octave to take Mr. Serin's position, and remain settled at
                  home, saving that she feared the roving life he led would injure his habits.
                  Madame Eperveil replied, very coolly, that she and Octave perfectly understood
                  each other. The kind of life he led was agreeable to them both; she did not care
                  about his settling tling at Eperveil just now; when he should be thirty-five,
                  would be time enough. As to his habits, they were those of a gentleman; she had
                  perfect confidence in him. There might be some little freedoms about him, such as
                  all young gentlemen once in awhile indulged in; but she thought a modest, delicate
                  silence would be more proper about them; that they would be of no consequence, if
                  not made so by scandalmongers. No young man's life, out in the world, could bear
                  the magnifying glass of stiff, starched prudes."
               "Well," I said, indignantly, "if Octave ever goes to the bears, as the naughty
                  children did who cried 'bald head' after Elisha, I shall not care one fig for all
                  that Tante Octavie may suffer."
               "I think only of the suffering he has already caused," replied the dear old lady,
                  as she drew a long sigh; "one disappointment, such as Marie has had in him, shakes
                  faith in humanity terribly. It is sad to see a young heart so early filled with
                  bitter hopelessness and suspicion."
               I looked into her sweet, gentle face, and wondered what old romance of her youth
                  had been revived by her niece's trouble. An hour passed; and all the other guests
                  were assembled, before Tante Octavie and the grand quality friends descended to
                  the ball. I have already mentioned, that Madame Eperveil liked to receive those
                  guests to whom she wished to show favor, in her own salon; I had been honored in
                  that way,—only once, however. Accordingly, on this occasion, the Prince de P.,
                  Baron and Baronne de W., and the Landsnechts, were waited for in solemn, solitary
                  state, by our Peilz empress. They kept her waiting until ten o'clock, although the
                  invitation cards had the usual request,—
               "Madame Eperveil begs her guests not to be later than eight o'clock, as at that
                  hour the music will commence."
               How often we had heard Tante Octavie talk severely about the want of breeding
                  shown, by being only ten minutes too late in an engagement, or at a soirée!
               
               "Better send a regret at once," she would say, "than be guilty of the gross
                  vulgarity of keeping a company waiting for you."
               "But 'circumstances alter cases,' and rank alters the rules of good breeding, I
                  suppose," said Marie, while we were commenting rather freely on the tardy
                  guests.
               Wolfmaister looked grave; he was a thorough aristocrat, and Marie's Swiss
                  republican notions always shocked his ideas of propriety and good taste. He
                  affected not to hear her, pulled down his white vest,—which, from its accès of amidon, seemed disposed to have an
                  individuality,—and then flew to the music-stand, and busied himself in sorting
                  over the already well-arranged music. Marie, Wolfmaister, and I were on the
                  platform; Professor, Madame, and Hélène Bouvreuil were receiving and entertaining
                  the guests, which they always did in the absence of Madame Eperveil; and Tante
                  Cecile, Mr. Merle, and Kinnaird were assisting them.
               The hall was arranged beautifully; the windows were filled with Henri's finest,
                  tallest plants; the benches had been removed, and sofas and chairs were grouped
                  together in different parts of the large hall, around tables, on which were
                  baskets, or bouquets of flowers,—giving the place the appearance of a grand
                  reception or drawing room. By doing this, Tante Octavie had avoided the necessity
                  of giving her grandee friends reserved places, which would have been very
                  repugnant to the republican feelings of her other guests.
               "What excellent taste Tante Octavie has shown!" I said to Marie, on noticing
                  this.
               "Has she not?" replied Marie; "and how well the hall looks! no stiffness, and but
                  for this arrangement, the presence of these strangers would have thrown a little
                     gêne over the people. The conservatories
                  being lighted up is another happy idea; it gives the company a chance to move
                  about and feel independent. Tante Octavie's friends will be doubly obliged to her
                  for this pleasant evening; she has given them a chance to stare at great people,
                  which, republicans as we are, we like immensely, and at the same time be able to
                  meet; them on an equal footing." The institution clock struck ten. "It is really
                  too provoking!" continued Marie, "for them to be so late; we shall have to leave
                  out some of our pieces, or keep up the soirée until the early hours."
               A bustle and a buzz were heard; the large doors of the hall were thrown open for
                  the accommodation of the distinguished guests, who entered, with Tante Octavie at
                  their head, leaning on the arm of the Prince de P. She seated her friends; then,
                  after presenting her brother and his family, and Mr. Merle and Tante Cecile, with
                  some others who stood near, she left them, and—taking her nephew's arm—went
                  graciously around to welcome her other guests. How handsomely the old lady looked!
                  She was dressed in perfect taste. She wore a rich, dark-blue silk robe, with
                  costly black thread flounces, and berthe; her
                  arms and neck, which were still very fine, were only shaded by a superb lace
                  scarf, of the same web and pattern as the dress lace. Her beautiful, rich blonde
                  hair had its heavy bandeaux and braids ornamented (not hidden) by a black thread
                  lace barbe, without ribbons or flowers, and
                  fastened only by two diamond star pins. She moved about in a gracious, stately
                  way, and looked like an empress, receiving her court. Much as I fancied, I
                  disliked Tante Octavie; and surely I had every reason to; there was a nameless
                  fascination in her appearance that always attracted me. I loved to look at her
                  when she was en grande toilette,, she made such
                  a superb Rubens picture. The first sound of her voice, however, always dispelled
                  this fascination; its dictatorial tone and overbearing insolence were
                  insupportable to me, and I grew rude and unnatural on the instant. She made both
                  Marie and me brusque and contradictory, as
                  Madame Bouvreuil said; we were never ourselves in Tante Octavie's presence.
               Octave, after a few words from his aunt, left her, and walked, with graceful nonchalance, up the hall to the platform or stage; and young Lord S.
                  left the Landsnecht party and joined him. As Octave walked toward us, I could not
                  help observing how very distinguished looking he was; like his aunt, he was
                  perfectly satisfied with himself and all his surroundings; the world went well
                  with him, and he was content; every selfish feeling was gratified; and he also
                  knew that he was making a woman, who loved him fondly, miserable—which pleased and
                  tickled his vanity amazingly. I think I never drew the distinction between egotism
                  and selfishness, until I knew Octave Bouvreuil and his aunt. He was cold, and too
                  indifferent to disturb his personal comfort in order to gratify any one; then, if
                  he committed an injustice toward another, he never acknowledged it, and never felt
                  regret, but dismissed it from his thoughts as a disagreeable subject; and even
                  disliked the one he had wronged, if the affair caused him any annoyance. Such
                  characters are surely hopeless. But his aunt—though unlovely and unamiable—had
                  more in her; her egotism arose from her imperious, overbearing disposition; and
                  when her injustice caused her to wrong another, though her pride forbade an
                  acknowledgment of the injury, you always felt sure she suffered even more than the
                  one she oppressed, for her nature was naturally grand and noble. There was a warm
                  life-pulse beating under her husk of egotism; but nothing ever showed the
                  existence of even a spark, in the dry ashes of her nephew's selfish heart.
               They ascended the platform steps, and Lord S. was presented, in a cool, wholesale
                  manner, to the "artists," by Octave. This Lord S., was a pale, washed-out-looking
                  young man, and seemed as if his name should be "Lord Verisopht." He wore an
                  eye-glass, stuck in his right eye, and the exertions he made to keep it there gave
                  a rigidity to his face as absurd as it was painful to look at. He seemed to be
                  about two-and-twenty, was making desperate attempts at raising an excessively
                  blonde mustache and favoris, and the only things
                  in the world he seemed to think of, were his eye-glass, shirt collar, and cravat.
                  The presence of a real, royal prince appeared to stagger him a little; and I
                  rather think it was this stunning thing which drove him among the "artists." I do
                  not remember his saying a word during the whole evening, except some gasping "Oh!"
                  or "Aw!" when he would snatch convulsively his tumbling, refractory eye-glass, or
                  settle his head and neck carefully around in his precious collar. Once or twice he
                  frightened me half out of my wits, for I thought he was strangling; and more than
                  once Marie suggested the propriety of our helping him out of his toilet
                  difficulties.
               "Madame Eperveil thinks," said Octave, talking to all of us, and thus coolly
                  avoiding the necessity of addressing Marie, "that we had better begin with the
                  Beethoven trio, and leave out the opening duo and quartette altogether."
               Marie quietly removed her music from the piano. Wolfmaister looked a little
                  dashed; but his reverence for authority, and his happiness at having the chance of
                  playing some time during the evening, before such distinguished individuals,
                  reconciled him in some measure to giving up the duo. Marie moved away from the
                  north piano, and beckoned to Wolfmaister to take her place.
               "This piano," she said, "is better for the trio accompaniment than the other; it
                  is more singing, and the action more easy."
               "But shall you not play the piano part of this trio?" asked Wolfmaister, almost
                  bursting in his attempt at generosity.
               "Certainly not," answered Marie quietly; "do you not see, by this new arrangement,
                  that my fantasie and sonate comes next, and our other duo just after? I should be
                  too fatigued."
               Octave bit his lip with vexation, for he was to play the violin part, and be
                  detested Wolfmaister's piano accompaniments. Formerly, Marie would have remembered
                  this; but she was growing hard and
                  indifferent to his likes or dislikes. I felt glad to see it until the thought
                  flashed across me—as I saw his mouth settle into a gratified smile, and his
                  beautiful head toss with a saucy jerk—that his vanity was attributing her
                  indifference to pique, and a contemptible desire to vex and annoy him. How I
                  wished to be a fairy, that I might transform myself into a little bee, and give
                  him a sharp, stinging bite! for physical punishments are the only kind such
                  selfish, obtuse natures can feel.
               The trio was the beautiful Ghost Trio I had heard Heinrich Henzler play, the past
                  winter; but how differently it sounded! Octave's part was executed well, for
                  sometimes he played more like an artist than an amateur; but he was not capable of
                  understanding the poem which the composition contained, therefore he could not
                  give it its true expression. Then Gardner—who, like Lord S., was stunned with the
                  presence of royalty—jerked his violoncello part, making it sound, at times, as if
                  "all the breath had," as he expressed it, "clean gone out of the
                  instrument;" and Wolfmaister played in his usual cold, orthodox
                  style—"traditional," as Marie said. Octave knew that it had not gone off well; he
                  was thoroughly vexed; and as soon as it was finished, he left the platform,
                  without deigning to give a word to any of us.
               Then Marie placed herself at the piano, and played Mozart's Fantasie and Sonate, in Do. The adagio of this sonate is expressive of
                  the quiet, dignified sorrow of a heart suffering from neglect, but never fearing
                  desertion; indeed, the whole passage expresses, dramatically, deep grief,—but not
                  passionately; for hope lives, even through the solemn wailing. But when it reaches
                  the allegro, then the despair first breaks forth. This allegro is in 3-4 time, Do
                     mineur, and is fall of dramatic points; it
                  lasts but three or four minutes, and is like the heart-break attendant on a lost
                  hope,—the expression of a first, bitter instant, when the unworthiness of, and
                  eternal separation from, one dearly loved and trusted in, first breaks on the
                  mind. This passage just suited Marie's declamatory moods, and she always reminded
                  me of some great lyric actress, giving a scene from high tragedy.
               "She plays that adagio entirely too fast," grumbled out Wolfmaister, as deafening
                  applause rang through the hall. "Mon Dieu! just think of three hundred and odd
                  measures fired off in about three minutes!"
               "No one but you," said Marie, with brusque
                  irritation, "would think of timing such a passage as that. I cannot play it
                  slower; the working up of the composition brings me to it; I need just such a
                  fierce rapidity to make the expression complete."
               A flutter and bustle around the other piano announced the preparation being made
                  for a new executante. Miss Landsnecht came up
                  the platform steps, leaning on Octave's arm; looking, in her exaggerated crinolines and flounces, like an inverted pen-wiper,
                  or allumette holder. She murmured out, in execrable French, and voice 
                     
                        "Low with fashion, not with feeling freighted,"
                     
                   the timidity she felt at playing before such "immensely clever artists;" but
                  nothing about her showed that she felt any such becoming modesty; and after she
                  had ungloved, and, unringed, and unbraceleted,—making more preparations than a
                  Clara Schumann would have needed for the execution of one of her gifted husband's
                  most difficult compositions,—she broke out into a noisy, boisterous piece, "all
                  sound and fury, signifying nothing;" a chaos of chords and scales, pelting rains
                  of octaves, stormy chromatics, but not one attempt at chiaroscuro, or expression;
                  it was a sort of tight-rope, or circus riding performance, with bangs in the base,
                  and twitters in the treble, and a furious pursuit of octaves, without one single
                  thought or feeling suggested. Marie and I had withdrawn from the scene of action
                  during the heroine's preparation for combat, and we had joined Madame Bouvreuil reuil, who was sitting with Tante
                  Cecile, at one of the tables, near our end of the platform.
               "Now Wolfmaister will praise that girl's execrable noise; see if he does not,"
                  said Marie.
               "And all the world will say you and Fanny are envious," answered Madame Bouvreuil,
                  with a laugh. "Pray go to her, and try to say something civil."
               I declined doing so, saying it would be presumptuous in me, as I was not an
                  artist; and Marie exclaimed,—
               "Never! Music is to me what faith was to the old martyrs—I cannot lie about it.
                  Now, pray look at Wolfmaister. Oh, mon maitre, mon maitre! Indeed, he makes me
                  nervous. Just see how he bustles around her, and rubs his long-fingered hands
                  together, and throws up his eyes, as if he really believed all the fibs he is
                  telling!"
               Miss Landsnecht had finished her grand thundering piece; and while she was going
                  through the ceremony of regloving, etc., she was receiving Wolfmaister's praise,
                  Tante Octavie's gracious thanks, and Octave's most winning whispers, with a bold
                  attempt at shyness and humility.
               The next piece on the programme was Mozart's sonate, in Do, for four hands, which
                  was executed by Marie and Wolfmaister. The andante is cold and classic, and has
                  been compared to a piece of antique sculpture; so the two went on well enough
                  together; but when they reached the joyous, laughing rondo, they did not do so
                  well, for Wolfmaister never worked it up enough to please Marie. After it was
                  over, she rose from the piano with tingling cheeks.
               "He is so stupid, so dull!" she whispered to me. "I only wish I could have got the
                  pedal in time, I would have made him move faster; but he was cunning; he had his
                  long foot on it before I thought of securing it. How it is that musicians can have
                  heads and hands, and no souls, is a mystery to me. Wolfmaister never uses his
                  judgment, but binds himself to written rules; just as if music can be put upon
                  paper in such a way as to express all that one means. The executant must read with
                  his heart, with his imagination, as well as with his eyes."
               "See," I said, a few moments after, "the Prince de P. is honoring Miss Landsnecht,
                  and Mr. Octave's occupation's gore—he is coming to us."
               Marie turned to the piano, and commenced preluding softly, in order to be occupied
                  when Octave approached the piano. He addressed himself to me. A few platitudes
                  passed between us, about the beauty of the flowers, the fine arrangement of the
                  hail, how well the soirée was passing off, etc. etc.
               "Klavier Werke, von Mozart," repeated Octave,
                  mechanically, as he turned the leaves of Wolfmaister's precious Haslinger edition.
                  When he reached the sonate, in Si bémol, he said, with that cool self-possession
                  he could so well command, "Marie, let us shock Wolfmaister, and mystify these
                  people, by making a baritone solo of this andantino, as we did last summer."
               He placed the book before her, and, finding his key-note himself,—without waiting
                  for the accompaniment to begin,—his rich baritone voice poured out this melody, so
                  closely associated with the loving memories of their past; and it sounded as
                  smooth as the note of a horn on the lake by moonlight. But Wolfmaister was not
                  shocked, as he used to be, for Tante Octavie and the grand guests were pleased;
                  and when the Prince de P. condescended to cry "Brava" and "Bene," and even
                  applaud almost hard enough to burst his gloves, the accommodating music master
                  shuffled about, in his animated rapture, and, pitching his voice in its sharpest
                  full-dress key, declared, "It was really very pretty; Mr. Octave was so very
                  clever."
               Miss Landsnecht came up to the piano, leaning on the Prince de P.'s arm, swaying
                  to and fro, to thank Mr. Octave for that "delishoes morsow," saying,
                  "She was sure she had heard Mario sing it the last season in London. Pray, what
                  was it?"
               
               "An andantino, from the finale of Il Sonati," answered Marie, looking Miss Landsnecht full
                  in the face.
               We, who knew what the passage was, were struck dumb with Marie's saucy aplomb.
               "Ah!" continued Miss Landsnecht, affectedly humming something she intended to
                  sound like it. "I knew I was right. I really have the most marvelous memory and
                  ear; they never deceive me."
               The prince wagged his head up and down, like a Chinese mandarin, and simpered out
                  some flat compliment.
               "Oh Mr. Octave!" said Miss Landsnecht, "you should hear that love of a Mario sing
                  it; he is divine!" and she threw up her large blue eyes, with an expression that
                  she evidently thought might resemble a St. Cecilia.
               "Probably you sing something from the same opera?" asked Marie, in a cool, saucy
                  tone.
               This was almost too much for my self-control to bear; and while Miss Landsnecht
                  was fluttering every flounce, and flower, and steel spring about her, at the bare
                  proposition of bringing before such a crowd, and the prince was disturbing the
                  expression of his face in his gasping attempts at persuasion, I leaned over Marie,
                  as if to fasten up the shell and coral caul which held her thick knot of brown
                  hair, and whispered, "Marie, you wicked child! veux tu te
                     taire? For Heaven's sake, play something. Suppose the girl should
                  sing, we should disgrace ourselves by laughing, and gain Tante Octavie's
                  everlasting enmity."
               Marie's little hands fell sharply on the piano, and struck some brilliant chords,
                  breaking right in the midst of some flat speech of Miss Landsnecht to Octave, and
                  startled the poor prince to such a degree, that he was nearly knocked off his
                  feet; then she rolled away grandly into Liszt's magnificent "Marche Hongroise,"
                  No. 1, in which can be heard the tramping of horses, the ringing of sabers in
                  their scabbards, and the rich coloring of the music suggests superbly caparisoned
                  steeds, and jeweled sword hilts, and the gorgeous Sclavic costumes of the
                  cavaliers.
               The company, soon after, bade adieu to Madame Eperveil, who was so filled with
                  satisfaction at the success of her soirée, and the excellent good opinion she felt
                  of herself and all belonging to her, that she received us, when we came to say
                  good-by to her, with the most winning suavity. She even insisted upon our taking
                  some supper with her; for although supper had been served during the evening at
                  various times, we, like Madame Eperveil, had been too much occupied to take any.
                  Tante Octavie was very hospitable at all times, but particularly gracious this
                  evening, and we all seemed to forget our old causes of discontent against each
                  other; she even offered me her arm, and made me accompany her into the
                  supper-room, where we all enjoyed, with cheerfulness, the very elegant
                  entertainment spread out before us. It was, indeed, what, Marie called the "early
                  hours," when we bade Tante Octavie a hearty good night, for the hands of the old
                  clock of Peilz pointed to three, as the beams of the morning moon shone on its
                  dial-plate. We parted with merry good nights, and with snatches of song, and
                  playful bursts of laughter; but many, many times in the coming year, did we recall
                  that first of June soirée at Tante Octavie's.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVII.
               THE DISMISSAL.
               AFTER a few weeks, the elder members of the Landsnecht family, with Lord S. and
                  Octave, left Peilz for their summer's gay journeying; intending to visit various
                  famous baths during the season. Before they left, Mr. and Mrs. Landsnecht
                  expressed their great pleasure and satisfaction with Hélène's management of the
                  children, and made her an offer of a large salary if she would go to England with
                  them in the autumn as governess. To Madame Eperveil's surprise, the offer was
                  refused, without an instant's hesitation, by both parents and daughter. She said
                  but little at the time; but during the summer, she returned to the subject so
                  often, and with such management, that we all observed that both Madame Bouvreuil
                  and Hélène regarded the proposition more favorably. They both looked very sad, and
                  clung to each other with redoubled tenderness.
               Madame Eperveil represented to them that she and Octave had been forced to have
                  various heavy expenses for outside purposes of the institution; that Octave did
                  not scruple to fulfill the duties of tutor, in order to earn a good salary; she
                  thought it was a pity Hélène should not feel the same interest in the family
                  welfare. All this she threw out in various forms during the summer. No one replied
                  that as Octave and Madame Eperveil were the ones who would be likely to reap the
                  most benefit from the institution, they were the ones who should do the most for
                  it; no one asked what outside expenses Octave had; the whole ground was left open
                  for Madame Eperveil to expatiate plausibly on the above text.
               The first of September, the Landsnechts returned, and urged more earnestly on
                  Hélène their proposition, and she requested to have a little time to consider,
                  before giving a positive refusal. This surprised me; and I expressed my
                  astonishment one evening to Tante Cecile, as we were walking together alone on the
                  road from Hauteville. Marie had left us to accompany Dora on a hunt after the
                  seed-tuft of the wild clematis, the feathery beauty which tempted them to clamber
                  up quite a rugged vineyard bank.
               "Well, Octave spends a great deal of money," said Tante Cecile; "and Madame
                  Eperveil's style of living has been very costly the past year or so—this naturally
                  hampers them very much."
               "But that is no reason why Hélène should go away from home," I answered; "and,
                  moreover, why should Octave spend so much money if it interferes with the comfort
                  of his family?"
               "Oh, Madame Eperveil says his expenses are necessarily large, in order to give a
                  reputation to the institution; that he is making himself extensively known, and
                  thus improving the future of the school."
               "How absurd!" I replied; "surely Madame Eperveil has too much good sense to
                  believe all this."
               "Of course," answered Tante Cecile; "but do you not see? She says all this to hide
                  the truth. If she were to acknowledge Octave's extravagances, or throw a shadow of
                  blame on him, she has sense enough to know that it would reflect on her. He has
                  played on her weakness for show and ostentation, for the society of the rich and
                  titled, and I fancy she is beginning to see this; but she will not admit her
                  error; and, moreover, she is so blindly fond of Octave, that she dreads looking
                  upon the truth in regard to him."
               Madame Eperveil did indeed show, by her testy manners and careworn face, that she
                  was annoyed about something. In this
                  volcanic state of the domestic atmosphere, Mr. Serin very injudiciously made a
                  proposition to her, which threw her into a furious rage, and altered the whole
                  family arrangements. He again proposed leaving her; suggesting, very modestly,
                  that Mr. Kinnaird Graham should take his place until Mr. Octave should be ready.
                  Now, I always fancied that Madame Eperveil regarded Kinnaird as a sort of rival of
                  Octave; she was never gracious to him, and never treated him as anything beyond a
                  common tutor, although his acquirements, his abilities, and calm, dignified
                  manners, gave him a high position in the school. He had, moreover, written some
                     feuilletons, on scientific subjects, for the
                  Parisian journals, which had excited favorable attention, and procured for him
                  valuable acquaintances, of much more worth than all Octave's titled friends.
                  Madame Eperveil knew this, and every step Kinnaird made in advance seemed, to this
                  unjust and unreasonable woman, an attack upon Octave. To have him, then, proposed
                  as head master of Eperveil, was a rude shock to her.
               On the same evening, while she was full of gall and bitterness, Madame Bouvreuil
                  and I being out walking, concluded to call in and take coffee with her;
                  unfortunately, Tante Cecile and Marie were also there. Madame Eperveil was talking
                  of Mr. Serin's proposition, in a cold, sneering tone, as if it were something very
                  ridiculous and absurd. To our surprise, Madame Bouvreuil replied, quietly, that
                  she saw nothing absurd in it; Kinnaird was quite as well fitted as Octave for such
                  a place.
               "I have heard my father say," said Marie, "that Kinnaird's reputation is a very
                  enviable one for so a young a man; his articles in the Journal des Débats command a great deal of attention; and already they
                  have procured for him, as we know, the friendship of the celebrated L., whose
                  works on Egypt we admire so much."
               They were as injudicious as Mr. Serin; but her gross injustice, and their liking
                  for Kinnaird, made them forget their usual prudence and tact. Madame Eperveil sat,
                  stupefied with rage. At last she rose, and rang the bell for her maid; after
                  giving some trifling directions, she said, in a quiet voice of suppressed rage, as
                  she returned to her seat,—
               "I am very glad to hear all this which you have been telling me about Mr. Graham,
                  as it renders it easier for me to do what I have been wishing to do for some time.
                  Mr. Graham is a most useless person to me, and always has been. I have only
                  retained him out of regard to his friendless position, or at least what I thought
                  friendless. As he has such powerful friends and excellent abilities, he had better
                  be employed by the one, and make use of the other. In Institution Eperveil he is
                  not needed; and I shall see that he is speedily placed, so that he can employ, to
                  his own advantage, these influential acquaintances and shining talents."
               Nothing more was said on the subject, and soon after we all rose to take our
                  leave. A hanging, porcelain lamp, which swayed to and fro in the door leading from
                  the salon into a little adjoining conservatory, was the only light in the room;
                  but it was a moonlight night, and the silver rays streamed in between the vines of
                  the balcony, and fell placidly down, on the inlaid floor, at Madame Eperveil's
                  feet. She only half rose to say good night; and, as I leaned down to take her
                  hand, I saw that her face was deadly pale, and the touch of the tips of her
                  fingers, which was all she deigned to give me, threw a chill over me, they were so
                  very cold.
               Naughty, imperious Tante Octavie! She was in such a state of white heat, that I
                  could not help feeling an indefinable dread of some ugly thing she would do by way
                  of venting her spite; and it came in this shape: Kinnaird Graham was dismissed
                  without any warning. One morning, soon after the little ill-advised scene with
                  Tante Octavie, when Kinnaird went to the college, as usual, to meet his English
                  class, he found no scholars waiting for him, and, on his desk, a cold note from Madame Eperveil, telling
                  him that his services were not needed any longer in the institution.
               Marie Merle and I, with Dora and Beau, had started off early that morning to spend
                  the day in the Hauteville woods; Hélène was to join us in the afternoon. I
                  remember the day well; it was a sweet, soft day, in the early part of September.
                  An ocean of golden light seemed to fill the heavens; the mountain-sides were
                  green; the vines hanging heavy with luscious fruit; the woods rich in foliage, and
                  the Jura horizon misty and wavy, where one could lose sight at times of the
                  mountain outline, in a vague, dreamy indistinctness; all objects united to make a
                  harmony full of calm and grandeur, and my soul felt deeply the influence.
               After rambling about all the morning, down to the deserted farm, along the shady
                  borders of the quiet, solitary stream, that breaks away from the mountains, to
                  dwell for a little while in this lovely spot, at noon we clambered up to the group
                  of rustic seats on our favorite hill, and ate, with good appetite and pleasant
                  talk, the nice cold dinner Dora had brought in the basket for us. Ham sandwiches
                  and cold chicken, a bottle of red wine, some delicious 
                     Montrueux
                     Montreux
                   strawberries, and a few bunches of early-ripened grapes, made quite an
                  attractive feast for us. We were very happy, though each one of us had one
                  solitary chamber in our hearts, in which lay the skeleton, and over which we had
                  quietly drawn the solemn, black drapery of silence. Yes; even my loving, faithful
                  Darmstadt girl, with her good bright laugh and merry ways, had her secret of
                  sorrow. Indeed, I think some of us never learn to laugh generously until after we
                  have sorrowed sorely.
               During dinner, Dora told us of a beautiful view she had seen in some part of the
                  estate where we had never been; and Marie, after dinner, insisted upon going
                  there, very certain we could not show her any new place; and yet, she could not
                  recognize it from Dora's description, which, it must be confessed, was not very
                  graphic, and would have done as well for one pretty point of a landscape as
                  another. I felt languid, and not at all in an exploring mood; so I made Dora give
                  me my writing-box from the basket, and concluded to "write letters." This "writing
                  of letters" was my usual excuse when I wanted to work upon my novel; and it had
                  grown so common a one as to make Hélène and Kinnaird smile quietly, and provoke
                  Marie's raillery, whenever I used it; for, like all amateur authors, I was
                  excessively shy about my poor novel.
               After they left me, a little time was spent in making Beau comfortable; for he
                  would not go with them, a sudden accès of
                  affection for me having seized him, which I was fool enough to believe in, as
                  usual, until I discovered, after they left, that he had stayed to keep guard over
                  a piece of chicken in the basket; so I gave it to him, after making him look as
                  serious as an owl at it for some time, and do a variety of cunning tricks. Then I
                  unlocked my MS. book, unscrewed my inkstand, shifted my pen-holder, leaned back
                  against the tree, looked down from the hill on to the lake, counted the boats, the
                  shadows of whose little, white latteen sails, reflected on the water-mirror,
                  seemed like two butterflies kissing each other; then I watched the graceful
                  floating clouds and their shadows thrown on the lake and hillsides, that moved so
                  mysteriously along like dim specters; then I looked on the opposite mountains,
                  whose white summits had melted at last before summer's hot smiles, and were
                  showing their grim, rugged tops. I did everything, in short, but work at my poor
                  story.
               Beau, not liking the cool ground, jumped upon one of the tree seats, over which
                  hung his faithful old friend, the red shawl; this he snuffed at and scratched most
                  furiously, to make himself a bed, but with poor success, for he caught his foot in
                  the fringe, and tumbled backward on the ground, coming well-nigh rolling down the
                  hill; this misadventure discomposed his little dog-ship to such a degree, that I
                  pushed my Margaret of Austria unceremoniously aside and took him up in my lap, to soothe his offended
                  dignity, and soon he was sound asleep. Then I remembered I had left at home the
                  memorandum of costume necessary for a description, in the twenty-seventh chapter
                  of my second volume, which was sufficient excuse to my conscience for not working;
                  so I clasped my book, shut my pen and inkstand, and leaned back comfortably
                  against the tree, to enjoy the ravishing, living picture before me. It was one of
                  those scenes the painter artist would despair over; for there were those varying
                  shadows, those numberless and nameless nuances
                  of color flitting over the sky, and a hazy atmosphere that subdued and softened
                  the whole. Music can suggest such a landscape, but the composition must have
                  sentiment, and that which gives a charm to poetry—a dreamy, undefined character.
                  It can only give suggestions to the imagination, not attempt vulgar, tangible
                  descriptions; and this it can do, for it has a language of its own, and a
                  coloring. The tone tongue, the tone palette, are widely different from the word
                  language the poet uses, or the tangible colors of the painter; and the true artist
                  and executant in music suggests, not describes, to the cultured or gifted
                  imagination and taste, by an adroit and poetical use of this beautiful, and, to
                  some, mysterious knowledge.
               Mingled with the beautiful landscape on that, to us, memorable autumn afternoon,
                  were rural sounds; some cows were grazing in a pasture beneath me, on the sloping
                  hillside, and their bells rang so slowly and soothingly, that I was soon as sound
                  asleep as my dog. I do not know how long I had been sleeping, when I was awakened
                  by Beau's bark. He sprang from my lap, raced down the bank, and gave a sign of
                  recognition to some one; not receiving the notice he thought he merited, he came
                  back with a pooh-pooh sort of air of "Oh! it was nobody after all!" and, jumping
                  up into my lap, coiled himself cosily down, and resumed his nap. I leaned over,
                  and looked down through the branches, and saw sitting on the bench of the terrace
                  beneath me, Hélène and Kinnaird Graham.
               "Where did Beau go to?" asked Hélène of Kinnaird.
               "He followed Marie and Mademoiselle Fauvette down the stream," answered
                  Kinnaird.
               "No, he did not," I said, in a sleepy voice, "he is up here with me." But they
                  were too much occupied with each other to hear me. It was some time before I
                  understood their conversation,—being in a half dreamy state,—but a strange tone in
                  Kinnaird's naturally sweet, quiet voice, startled me; he was angry; and angry,
                  too, at his lady love.
               "It is preposterous!" he said, "this manner you all have, of yielding to your
                  aunt. Absurd!"
               "Remember, Kinnaird," urged Hélène, mildly, "how much we owe to her."
               "Pshaw!" said the young man, springing up, angrily, and walking rapidly to and fro
                  on the little terrace.
               "Heyday!" I thought; "young man, this is odd love-making, to be sure!"
               "Gratitude, generous acknowledgment of favors generously bestowed, is one thing,"
                  he continued; "but that is quite different from this childish slavery of obedience
                  you all observe toward her; then the disgusting consciousness of this imaginary
                  generosity, that Madame Eperveil shows, takes all credit from her, and makes your
                  gratitude meanness and cowardice."
               Hélène remained silent, as she always did, when others lost their temper. Kinnaird
                  stopped in his rapid walk.
               "Listen!" he said, standing in front of her;—and how handsomely he looked: his
                  fine, manly face lit up with the mingled tide of anger and emotion rushing through
                  him! "Listen! I do not believe, Hélène Bouvreuil, much as you love me, that you
                  would ever dare to marry me. First, you would need to have Madame Eperveil's
                  gracious consent, and there is not one member of your family that would dare to ask it; then—even supposing it
                  should be asked—if refused, I would be whistled off without any hesitation."
               "Hélène looked up, with a pretty, winning air of sly merriment, and said, half
                  playfully, half pleadingly, "But, Kinnaird, why make our present worse than it
                  need be, by anticipating trouble? We are not ready to face any such difficulty
                  yet."
               "And if we were?" asked the young man, in a deep, earnest tone, which must have
                  thrilled through his mistress's whole being,—for it made my little heart feel
                  oddly, even though I had no right to have any feeling about it. He stooped down in
                  front of her, and, taking both those beautiful hands, looked straight into his
                  mistress's blushing face, with his keen eyes.
               "Madame Eperveil calls him a polished stick," I said to myself; "I wish she could
                  see him now."
               "Hélène," he continued, taking from his pocket two letters, "here are two
                  proposals; before we leave this place you are to decide which one I shall accept.
                  One is an assistant professorship at B. The salary is the same your father
                  receives; on it we can marry. The other is an offer from my friend L., who has
                  received his appointment and appropriation for his Egyptian researches, and he
                  wishes me to accompany him to Egypt, as secretary."
               "Oh, Kinnaird, I must not decide—I cannot!" said Hélène, in a trembling voice.
               Kinnaird stood erect, wounded to the quick. Hélène buried her face in her hands,
                  and wept bitterly.
               "What am I to understand by this?" he asked, in that cold, steel-like tone, his
                  voice could so well express in some moods.
               Hélène seemed to shrink into herself, and continued weeping silently, but made no
                  answer.
               "I cannot understand you, Hélène," he said.
               "Oh, it is so cruel!" she sobbed.
               "What is cruel?" he exclaimed, fiercely. "To be offered honorable marriage by a
                  man you say you love? I see no cruelty in this."
               "No, no, Kinnaird," answered the girl, striving hard to control herself; "but my
                  position is so cruel. I am just so placed, that for a year I cannot say yes or no
                  to you."
               "And why?" asked the exasperated young man.
               "Patience, Kinnaird, and listen to me."
               "God knows it requires the patience of a saint," he muttered.
               "I have this morning accepted," said Hélène, with forced calmness, "the position
                  of governess in Mr. Landsnecht's family. I heard of your dismissal, from mother;
                  and, thinking we were to be separated in any case, I concluded to no, longer
                  refuse so good a salary. I go to England with them next week, for all is concluded
                  between us."
               "But," said Kinnaird, looking like ice and fire mingling, "you can, if you please,
                  break this engagement, by announcing your approaching marriage with me."
               "Next year, Kinnaird," urged the young girl, nervously.
               "No, not next year—nor ever! No, Hélène Bouvreuil; you have not enough decision of
                  character to act for yourself; nor have you sufficient love for me to give you
                  courage to face a disagreeable trouble. Good-by; God bless you!" and he rushed
                  down the bank rapidly.
               "Kinnaird!" cried the girl, convulsively. "Kinnaird, do not leave me. I have not
                  told you all. Oh, Kinnaird, come back!"
               But it was too late—Kinnaird was gone. I could no longer endure the agony of the
                  poor child, so I put the lazy Beau on one side, and ran down to her. "Darling!" I
                  said, "I have been a listener to this scene, but it was unintentional; I could not
                  well help it."
               "Oh is that you, Fanny Fauvette?" she cried. "I am so glad you are here. Is it not
                  dreadful? What can I do?"
               I put my arms around her; she laid her head on my shoulder, and cried as though her heart would
                  break. Beau was not going to let anything like that go on, so he came busily
                  tripping down the bank, to dispute her place in my arms, this diverted her
                  thoughts a little, and the violent sobbing passing off, she told me that which she
                  had wished to tell Kinnaird. They had received a letter from Octave that
                  morning—that is, the mother had—and he had applied to her for 2000f. He was in
                  debt, and did not wish to ask his aunt, as he had very lately applied to her for
                  money, and they did not dare to ask Tante Octavie themselves, after the hesitation
                  shown about the Landsnecht offer. Just then, Mr. and Mrs. Landsnecht called,
                  offering an increase of salary, raising the first sum of ¥100 to ¥150. Hélène
                  accepted it at once, on condition of having the first half year's salary paid in
                  advance. Mr. Landsnecht immediately drew a check for the amount, which was
                  inclosed to Octave the instant Mr. and Mrs. Landsnecht left; therefore, Hélène
                  could not break her engagement with them, in order to accept the unexpected offer
                  of her lover.
               Natural sisterly delicacy had prevented her from telling Kinnaird at first what
                  she knew he would call her brother's selfish extravagance; but when her misery
                  made her overcome this feeling, his angry impetuosity had prevented her from doing
                  so.
               "Oh, never mind!" I said, consolingly; "to-night, when we take our walk down on
                  the Point du Pays, after goûter, you can tell
                  him all; and next year we shall have a merry wedding."
               We then talked about her winter in England; her dread of the cold, proud family;
                  her hard work,—for she was to give the youngest boy lessons in Latin, prepare the
                  lessons of the two other boys for their tutor, and assist in the duet practicings
                  of Miss Landsnecht, besides taking entire charge of the whole range of studies of
                  the three girls. These "extras," as we Yankees say, had been added
                  when they proposed the increase of salary.
               The sun was near setting, when Marie Merle and Dora made their appearance, laden
                  with branches of the feathery seed-tuft of the wild clematis and blood-red and
                  yellow acacia leaves.
               "Do not tell Marie about Octave," Hélène said, as we saw Marie in the distance.
                  "Heaven knows, she has reason to think badly enough of him already; and the only
                  hope mother and I have in the future for Octave, rests on the little bit of love
                  left for him in Marie's heart."
               I made no reply; but I thought, obstinately, "If that is all the hope you have, it
                  is slight enough; and whatever I can throw into the scale against it, shall be
                  given. Marie Merle shall never be sacrificed to Octave Bouvreuil's, or any other
                  man's selfishness; he may sacrifice mother and sister, if they please,—and father
                  and aunt into the bargain, for tally weight,—but not my artist darling."
               By this time Hélène had grown calm, and the traces of her weeping were accounted
                  for, by my announcement of her approaching departure for England, as governess in
                  the Landsnecht family. Marie protested loudly against it; and Dora looked ready to
                  burst out crying; but Hélène shook her head in sad silence, and we walked home
                  very sorrowful. At the Peilz church we found Mr. Merle, looking up at the
                  beautiful old tower, draped with ivy and the trumpet vine, whose leaves were
                  tinged blood red. Hélène and I stood a few moments, admiring it with him, and
                  listening to his gentle, dreamy raptures, over the festoons hanging around the
                  ogive windows of the tower; then, bidding Marie and her father good night, we
                  hurried on home. Madame Bouvreuil met us at the door; she looked very sad and
                  tired. Goûter was ready waiting, so we went into
                  the salle à manger, with our mantles and hats on
                  our arms, in order to be all ready for the peace-making walk on the Point du Pays.
                  Professor Bouvreuil had not returned from his lessons at the Landsnechts; thus
                  Madame, Hélène, and I were the only ones at table. Hélène watched the door, with
                     nervous anxiety, for Kinnaird's
                  entrance. At last, not being able to endure the suspense any longer, I asked,—
               "What makes Mr. Graham so late to-night?"
               "Hélène has not told you, then?" replied Madame Bouvreuil.
               Hélène looked up inquiringly at her mother. Madame continued: "Mr. Graham has left
                  us."
               "Yes, I know he is no longer at Institution Eperveil," I said.
               "Oh, not only that," answered Madame Bouvreuil, "but he has left Peilz."
               "Left Peilz!" I cried. "Impossible!"
               Hélène rose up silently, and went out of the room, without stopping to hear
                  another word.
               "I thought she knew it," said Madame Bouvreuil, as the door closed after her
                  daughter. "He told me he had bidden her good-by, and asked me to say adieu to you
                  and Marie, for him. He has received a fine offer from his friend L., to be his
                  private secretary; they are going on that business he spoke of, to Egypt. He left,
                     en route for Paris, an hour ago."
               I then told Madame Bouvreuil all that had taken place at Hauteville; and, after
                  grieving a little while together over the trouble, we separated—Madame Bouvreuil
                  to join Hélène, and I to go to Dora and Beau for consolation. I walked up and down
                  the gallery, in the soft light of the autumn moon, hugging my dear little dog to
                  my lonely heart; I was like poor Siebenkäs; I felt so inwardly sorrowing and
                  discouraged, that I longed to caress some outward thing; and I listened to Marie's
                  music, which came in rich wafts on the evening breeze, from the chateau. My own
                  past, and its sad memories, rose up before me, as I dwelt on the trouble of the
                  family; and my heart seemed overflowing with a tide of bitter resentment at the
                  injustice meted out in this world to the unoffending, and it blinded me to the
                  blessed harvest to be reaped from such mortal wrong. Dora leaned on the balcony
                  railing, looking up through the branches of the acacia-tree at the moon, in that
                  state of sweet, vague German dreaminess, so peculiar to her nation. I put my hand
                  on her shoulder: "What are you dreaming about, little woman?" I asked.
               "My mother can see that same moon, mademoiselle," answered the girl, in a clear,
                  firm tone, that bespoke most perfect faith and trust.
               An old nursery song of my mother's swept up before my memory, almost as if an
                  angel had sung it in my ears:—
               
                  
                     "The moon looks
                     On many brooks—
                     It shines upon both great and small;
                     And God's love
                     Beams from above:
                     It guards around, and leads us all."
                  
               
               I smothered my inward cries of anguish, and tried to look up at the heavens with
                  the same childlike, hoping faith of my handmaiden. But the memories of that happy
                  childhood recalled by the old nursery rhyme; of that mother-voice, soothing my
                  childish griefs tenderly to sleep; then of the lonely hours of unsoothed sorrow,
                  after death had hushed her gently to her long rest,—all these memories grew closer
                  and tighter in their gripe around my heart. The lake waves dashed against the
                  chateau walls; Marie's music rode out in full, solemn grandeur; she was playing
                  that mysterious Warum, of R. Schumann, whose
                  persisting doubts and obstinate questionings seemed to make the same demand my
                  rebellious heart was making. I leaned, shivering, against the pillar of the
                  gallery, with hot, dry eyes; but my heart would weep over the "Living
                     Lost," and the life-desolation left by "the dead gone
                     before."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XVIII.
               DEPARTURE.
               NOW, if I had been Hélène Bouvreuil, with such a charming lover as Kinnaird
                  Graham, I should have written immediately to him, and explained the whole
                  misunderstanding; but Madame Bouvreuil did not like that Octave's disgraceful
                  conduct should be disclosed.
               "In a year, Kinnaird will return," she said; "then all can be explained, with less
                  injury to your brother. You are both young, and can wait, especially in such a
                  case; moreover, one's own personal happiness or justification is not what one
                  should seek in this life. Sacrifices for others are far better than a just
                  gratification of our own rights. Even when these sacrifices seem unjust, le bon Dieu rights the wrong; the gain in the end is
                  to our immortal spirits; and if not, if no gain results, a generous mind feels
                  easier."
               I had to listen patiently to dear Madame Bouvreuil's, gentle sermonizing, for I
                  knew she not only preached, but practiced. Her whole married life had been passed
                  under the harrow of Madame Eperveil's power, and harrow it was truly;
                  for the old lady had, from girlhood, so encouraged the disposition of depending
                  haughtily on her own judgments, and trampling indifferently if not rudely on the
                  rights of every one within her reach, that domestic life, when associated with
                  her, was anything but a blessing. And yet, how she could talk of personal
                  independence! and into what eloquent rages she would burst out, upon some cowed
                  tutor whose daily bread depended on his position in her employ, if he dared to
                  have or exercise an opinion about the management ment of the business intrusted to
                  him! She called it always "taking a liberty with her;" and one of her expressions
                  on such occasions of wrath used to amuse us all excessively, though, of course, we
                  never uttered a word in her presence. It was the same speech that Haydon, in his
                  autobiography, puts into the mouth of the Duke of Wellington: "The reason why I
                  have a right never to have a liberty taken with me is, because I never take a
                  liberty with any one." This was Tante Octavie's pet finale; and just so soon as she would get fairly out of hearing,
                  Marie or I would exclaim, "No fear of having liberties taken with one, if one does
                  not meddle with others. Generally, when people talk with such temper about
                  liberties, and all that, they are consciously or unconsciously interfering with
                  the rights of those around them."
               And this was true; no person could be more interfering and overbearing than Tante
                  Octavie, and her intense egotism stood in the way of her seeing the immense
                  injustice she committed constantly, not only toward others, but to her own
                  naturally noble character; for much as I inwardly chafed and fretted against
                  Madame Eperveil, I could not but see that she had superb qualities of mind and
                  indefinable magnetic attractions, which would have made her irresistibly charming
                  but for this unfortunate disposition. She did one good, however—she taught
                  patience to others; she might irritate and fret young people; but, in the end, she
                  gave them a philosophy, in regard to the petty details of social life, they never
                  could have attained but for her spiritual microscopic exaggeration of trifles. The
                  families of the different professors lived in a state of resigned tranquillity;
                  the men found so much turmoil and exigeance in
                  the atmosphere surrounding Tante Octavie, they were happy to find peace in their
                  own interiors. How patiently the wives bore the shortcomings of their servants,
                  because the husbands never noticed unjustly the naturally resulting shortcomings
                  of wives! That great secret of the mystery of social life, so little understood,—the necessity of yielding to
                  and bearing with sweet, loving charity, unmingled with contempt, not only the
                  individual characteristics, but also the constitutional weaknesses and physical
                  incapabilities of others, acknowledging generously the rights of even children and
                  inferiors, every one in Peilz comprehended and practiced but Tante Octavie—and yet
                  she taught it to them. But while she helped them, they injured her. A passage in
                  the life of Currer Bell, relative to the peculiar trials of an only boy in a
                  family of girls, altered a little, will explain this. By her family she had been
                  regarded, from her capability, as one who could and would act a part in life; she
                  was to do, while they were only to be; and the necessity
                  of their giving way to her in some things, was exaggerated into their giving way
                  to her in all, and thus rendering her utterly and blindly selfish.
               Hélène was so hurried in her preparations for leaving with the Landsnechts, and so
                  sad at parting with her mother, that she had little time for dwelling on her love
                  troubles; it was not that she was wanting in warmth of heart. People are very apt
                  to imagine that such abnegation proceeds from feebleness of feeling; and it is
                  only when a terrible heart break, when some sad scene of acute physical suffering
                  ensues once in awhile, that all the effect of the accumulated torture, borne in
                  silence for years, proves the existence of this depth of feeling. Poor Hélène! her
                  love for Kinnaird seemed to be too great a happiness to indulge herself freely in.
                  She had been educated by her mother in such a strict idea of self-sacrifice, that
                  she would have felt it almost easier to have cut off her right hand, for the
                  trifling benefit of another, than to have occupied that same beautiful right hand
                  in any work of pleasure for her own enjoyment. Emile Souvestre makes Leon say to
                  his wife Marcelline, "You women love, not only to wear the crown of thorns, but
                  even to plunge the points in your bleeding temples." So it was sometimes with
                  Hélène, her conscience science was quiet when sacrificing self, uneasy when
                  enjoying innocent pleasures, and, but for her naturally happy disposition, healthy
                  organization, and sweet life with her mother, she would have grown morbid and
                  melancholy. Then the mother's and daughter's anxiety for Octave, and their feeling
                  of imaginary dependence on Madame Eperveil, made them sensitive. Marie and I, when
                  alone, fretted over this indefinable influence of Madame Eperveil, and called her
                  hard names, and vowed we would not submit to such tyranny—not we! But my
                  declarations on this point were growing faster; I was beginning to understand how
                  a strong, capable character, like Tante Octavie's, could bear down everything
                  before her, so I avoided her more and more.
               One evening, at sunset, we all met at Point du Pays; it was the evening after the
                  departure of dear Hélène. Marie and I had taken Madame Bouvreuil there, to
                  brighten her up. Tante Cecile remained at home to read the Journal des Débats aloud to her brother—Mr. Merle's greatest luxury of
                  the day. The intercourse existing between this old brother and sister was
                  exquisitely touching; no husband and wife could be more devoted than they were to
                  each other. While we were enjoying our quiet ramble, and watching the passage of
                  the "Rhone Numero 1," the last steamboat of the day, on its way up to Villeneuve,
                  and noticing, as if we had never noticed it before, the dancing of the little
                  row-boats as they fell in the wake of the steamer, Madame Eperveil came up with
                  old Mr. Serin. Marie and I bowed stiffly to her, and then tried, in the most
                  absurd manner, to ignore the old lady's presence, showing by that how much we felt
                  it. We entered into a high argument about the clouds, of which a bize just springing up, and a glorious sunset,
                  combined to make quite a grand affair; they were floating and rolling about
                  beautifully; one rich gold and purple one was enveloping Dent du Jaman like a
                  lordly mantle, and the Rhone valley was being filled with a succession of vapory
                  forms, folding and gathering together in the sublimest groups. Marie was just at that time quite enthusiastic about
                  Ruskin's works; his magnificent word-pictures had so fascinated her that she could
                  not endure the shadow of a difference from his testy dictum. This is a spirit that
                  the first reading of that clever but opinionative writer always begets. I had it
                  myself years before, and had survived it; so, of course, it was a fair opportunity
                  for a lively discussion between us. Very likely our conversation sounded, to a
                  woman as superior as Madame Eperveil really was, a little absurd and crude; I have
                  no doubt it did; the very spirit which influenced us made us unnatural, and seem
                  forced and affected. Then she needed not to listen to us, as we were not
                  addressing her. But, oh no! she must meddle; of course, it was in her nature so to
                  do.
               "Veux tu bien te taire, Marie Merle!" she burst out; "do stop this affectation and
                  exhibition. You are talking of what you know nothing about, just to show yourself
                  off. I cannot conceive of a greater piece of absurdity than for an ordinary-minded
                  young woman like you, to go off in such an addle-brained manner as you do, on
                  these subjects you are pleased to call æsthetical. Descend from your
                  Icarus wax-wing flights, child, and be natural! then simple matter-of-fact folk
                  like us will be able to understand you."
               We were two irritated, angry women, and she was the cause of our anger; therefore,
                  her words were as kindling to the fuel, and a very disagreeable, painful scene
                  ensued. Madame Bouvreuil took Mr. Serin's arm at the commencement of it, and
                  walked off out of hearing, so we were left uncurbed, even by the gentle restraint
                  of her presence. We said some very rude things to the old lady. I remember that we
                  both told her we were tired of her dictation, and implied that she might tyrannize
                  over her family if they were weak enough to permit it, but not over us. She
                  deserved all we said, it is true; but we put ourselves in the wrong; by shifting
                  the issue, and in doing so, we gave her a chance to go off in flying colors,
                  which, of course, she had wit enough to avail herself of. Heavens! how the old
                  empress kindled up!
               "She was sick of this sort of thing," she said. "Who did she tyrannize over? Her
                  family affairs were her own business. What right had we to interfere in them? We
                  had been taking, for some time past, great liberties with what was none of our
                  business. She had discharged a useless, inefficient, do-nothing tutor, and
                  provided her own niece with a situation where she received an elegant salary—and
                  here two intrusive young women, perfectly unconnected by blood with her or hers,
                  one a stranger and a foreigner even, were presuming to sit in judgment on her
                  doings; c'était impayable!"
               "Bravo, Tante Octavie!" I thought to myself; "you have gained the advantage over
                  us now." So I just did what we should have done at first, held my peace, until the
                  tempest-wrath of the old dome had passed over. When she reached the end of her
                  speech, she looked as if exasperated with her own arguments, which success quite
                  put her out of breath. I took advantage of this breathing spell, and, in a low,
                  quiet tone, begged her pardon for interfering with her or her family matters,
                  saying,—
               "You are quite right, madam; I have nothing in common with you at least. However,
                  you must admit that this disagreeable temper might have been avoided, Madame
                  Eperveil, if you had not seen fit to intrude yourself, rather officiously, into a
                  conversation with which you had nothing to do; so I think we can draw off on even
                  ground, as both sides have been in the wrong. Our wrong we acknowledge frankly,
                  and ask pardon for it; of course, as you are our senior, we do not expect you to
                  do the same; but I sincerely trust you will silently see your error, and do us
                  justice in your own mind. So good evening, Madame Eperveil!" And, taking Marie's
                  arm, I walked away, trembling from head to foot, toward the Chateau de
                  Leignitz.
               "Great Heaven!" exclaimed Marie Merle, as we stood on the broad top of the breakwater wall belonging to
                  this chateau. "If I were Tante Octavie's niece I should just lay myself down some
                  night in the waters of this lake, and ask God, trustingly, to forgive me for going
                  to sleep before he called me. I should feel so discouraged with life, that I would
                  rather face my Heavenly Father, after the disobedience of suicide, than live in
                  the world under her control."
               We sat down on the grand flight of steps leading to the upper terrace of the
                  Leignitz grounds, waiting for Madame Bouvreuil, whom we saw in the distance,
                  coming toward us, and had a good, comforting cry together. She came down the
                  steps, looking distressed and fatigued; and to see her thus annoyed, of course,
                  added to our vexation.
               "A pretty way, to be sure," I cried, "of fulfilling our promise to Hélène; we were
                  to keep her mother as happy as possible."
               Madame Bouvreuil tried to smile, and begged us not to think any longer about the
                  disagreeable affair; then, after loitering around long enough to give our "enraged
                  lioness time to reach her menagerie," as Marie saucily said, we walked sadly and
                  silently to our lonely home.
               Oh, how we missed Hélène! Her pretty little expletives rang in my ears for weeks
                  after she left us. Her sweet intonation of "Je vous en
                     prie," when I would rebel against some trifling but sweet act of self
                  yielding for my comfort; her peculiar pronunciation of various words, such as the
                  musical lengthening of the first syllable of beaucoup, sounded in my memory like one recalls a favorite melody,
                  associated with the dear, sad past. Then her merry laugh; her quick, light step;
                  her constant presence about the house, making herself useful to every one,
                  unobtrusively,—all this we missed. As Dora said, "it was like the sunshine gone."
                  I was very lonely, for Marie Merle did not take so much pleasure in being with me
                  as formerly. She was working very hard, it is true, over some new music, just come
                  from Paris and Vienna, and that was her excuse; but I could divine readily the
                  real reason; she had doubtless heard of Octave's misdoings, and she could not bear
                  to think of him before me, knowing the contempt I must feel for him. Not that she
                  was weakly mourning over him; on the contrary, she was fast floating off from him;
                  but still, she had loved him, with all the force of her warm, artist
                  nature; she had mistrusted, but hoped and prayed for him so many years; and now,
                  though all was over between them, though they never could be aught to each other
                  in the future, she could not endure to be in the presence of any one, who she felt
                  had not the same reason of having once loved him, for excusing his misdoings.
                  There are times when the society of our best and dearest friends is a burden and a
                  weight to us, and this is one of those seasons, when their condemnation of another
                  we know to be just,—indeed, for them to think otherwise would be unjust to us,—and
                  yet it wounds and frets us. It is the feeling Bryant so well delineates, in his
                  tender, touching little poem of the "Living Lost:"—
               
                  
                     "But ye who for the living lost,
                     That agony in secret bear,
                     Who shall with soothing words accost
                     The strength of your despair?
                     Grief for your sake, is scorn for them
                     Whom ye lament and all condemn,
                     And o'er the world of spirits lies
                     A gloom from which ye turn your eyes."
                  
               
               Instead of seeking me as she used to, after breakfast, and making me come to her
                  for the day,—or joining me, with Dora and Beau, in our mountain rambles,—I would
                  receive from her, as excuses for her absence, little notes full of musical talk,
                  throbbing with feeling; although she thought they were analytical, poor child! One
                  morning she would write, "I cannot go to Les Crêtes, or anywhere with you, for
                  some days yet. I am getting up my new music for you, and somehow I can study
                  better just now, alone. Am I becoming a
                  better student? I am sure I hope so." Just as if I did not know that such rambling
                  musical reading was not study. No, it was her poor heart that needed to be alone;
                  for if solitude does not give strength, still it does not wound. Another day her
                  written greeting said, "Some day, soon, I shall come for you to hear my new
                  musical acquaintances; and some of them must be your friends, through my
                  introduction. I have five new compositions of your American composer, Gottschalk.
                  The one I love best is the Ricordate, a ballad,
                  written upon those lines from Dante's Inferno,— 
                     
                        'Nessun maggior dolore
                        Che ricordarsi del tempo felice
                        Nella miseria,'—
                     
                   in Re bémol, with a sweet measure; distant, and almost like death in some
                  thoughts; bringing back regret and remembrance. Then another, Reflets du Passé, from a passage in a poem of Victor
                  Hugo, full of openly-expressed tenderness. But one darling thing of his is a
                  little, dimpled, coquettish Hebe of a Valse
                  Poetique, it is like what Liszt says of some of Chopin's—it is fantastic
                  and joyous, like the playful stampings of a delicious little teazing sylph." Again
                  she wrote, "I am devoted to Heller just now; to his tarantelles, and wonderful
                  waltzes, so involved in their working; they suit me, for they are so full of
                     diablerie, and no regret. It is
                  all a happy present with this joyous Heller. He sports and flaunts about in the
                  musical stream, like a flecked, dancing trout, on a summer's day. But to return to
                  Gottschalk. We must talk him over again, after you have heard these new things. Do
                  you know, I do not agree with your opinion about him? His music is not so Hebraic
                  as tropical; it suggests present and keen pleasures; it is too warm; and like all
                  the sweets and enjoyments of that region which gave birth to his genius, it is apt
                  to pall; even the sweet, luscious Ricordate
                  overwhelms one with its exuberant, fond, sensual melody; it is not pure enough for
                  the stately pomegranates and bells of the synagogue. No, Mendelssohn alone is
                  Hebraic, Fanny Fauvette. I compared the two together until after midnight, last
                  night, and could not but be struck with the difference. Both composers have rich,
                  warm coloring,—expressions of exquisite sentimentality; but in one, it is a
                  present, vivid enjoyment; in the other, a deep, melodious echo of a solemn,
                  poetical past. In Mendelssohn, 'Le passé y joue un plus grand rôle que le present;
                  qui dit passé, dit poësie; le passé n'est il pas la jeunesse de notre
                  imagination!' We must argue this out together some day, little lady.
               I comforted myself for Marie's solitary mood by long, whole-day rambles to
                  Chatelard and Blonay, and exploring mountain roads; then, on cloudy days, I set to
                  work studying German industriously, with my excellent master; and sometimes I gave
                  myself the headache over my poor historical novel, my "Margaret of Austria." If
                  Professor Bouvreuil had not been one of the nicest, kindest, tenderest men in the
                  world Hélène's absence, united to her keen anxiety about Octave, would have killed
                  the mother. But he even left his work on India, his geographical studies, and his
                  great map, to occupy himself about her. How it ever got into his wise, old
                  head,—so filled with science,—that his wife might possibly miss her children, I do
                  not know. God sent a little angel to tell him, I suppose. He used to make her come
                  into his library, with her basket of sewing, in the evenings. At first they
                  invited me, and I went, and sang ballads to amuse them, to the accompaniment of
                  the professor's little old cracked cabinet piano; but, after awhile, I thought it
                  best to leave the dear old doves alone, to console each other; so I excused myself
                  at least five evenings out of the seven, by pleading the never-failing occupation
                  of "writing letters," and left them to themselves. Many a lonely evening I passed,
                  almost like those stern, solemn first ones after my arrival in Peilz, near two
                  years before; sitting by my little
                  salon window, with Beau nestled asleep cosily in my lap, and I watching the sweet,
                  cool moonbeams peeping tenderly through the acacia branches, and the love rapture
                  of the lake's palpitating bosom, as in the distance it broke into quivering
                  ripples, under the full silvery light of the cold lady orb; while the swallows
                  whirred through the air, and wheeled around their nests in the old convent tower;
                  and once in awhile a gust of melancholy autumn wind would bring me a waft of
                  Marie's full, glorious music, dropping sometimes on my shoulder or arm a cold,
                  dead autumn leaf, which would lie, in its crimson or yellow glory, on my white
                  gown, "beautiful even in death."
            
            
               CHAPTER XIX.
               ARRIVAL OF AN OLD FRIEND.
               JUST as I was beginning to feel impatient about this awkward reserve of Marie, and
                  wondering how I should overcome it, it was broken in upon, in a very natural
                  manner, by the arrival of a friend of mine from America, and just the one of all
                  others Marie wished most to know. This friend was a German composer, Gustav
                  Ehrenherz; of whom and his sister I had often talked to Marie. One day, about a
                  month after Hélène's departure, Dora came into my little salon, her face beaming
                  with delight. I looked from my desk, and, as I noticed her radiant eyes, and
                  smiling mouth, I said: "You have a letter from your mother, my child."
               "Oh, no, mademoiselle! But who do you think has come all the way from America to
                  see us?" And then she quickly added, as she saw my startled look, and cheeks
                  paling with hopes and apprehensions, to which no definite expression could be
                  given: "Mr. Ehrenherz, mademoiselle; he is here, in the passage, waiting to come
                  in."
               In a few minutes my friend was seated beside me, and I, trembling with delight and
                  sad pleasure, listening to all the sweet information of those dear ones, between
                  whom and myself the solemn, dark wave of separation and circumstances flowed,
                  possibly forever. And his own reason for coming to Europe was such a happy
                  romance. He had been appointed musical director at L. This post, which had been
                  filled by Mendelssohn, was a position at once flattering and honorable for my
                  young maestro friend, and a pleasant reward to him after the laborious years of
                  teaching and composing spent in America.
               
               Of course, Marie was quickly informed of his arrival, and an invitation, for us
                  all to come and take one of the old-fashioned goûters with them, at the chateau, was brought immediately around by
                  dear old Mr. Merle himself. Marie and Ehrenherz grew quickly acquainted; for he,
                  though a distinguished artist and a highly-cultivated man, was modest and
                  appreciative, as true artists always are. Then, he had a cheerful, healthy mind,
                  and though he had quaffed the bitter draught from the goblet of sorrow, extended
                  to all of us born of woman, he had drank the absinthe with meek, childlike
                  patience and trust. He had laid, in an American grave, a gifted sister, who had
                  been to him more than any wife or friend could ever be. An artist herself, a
                  composer of merit, the two had led from youth their artistic career together; they
                  had united hopes, united ambitions, a generous appreciation of each other's
                  merits, and the deepest, tenderest love for one another. Just as she had reached a
                  ripened womanhood, with her genius bringing forth its richest fruit, she sickened
                  and died. I had known her, enjoyed her friendship, had loved, and mourned over
                  her. Often I had described both brother and sister to Marie Merle, and, in my
                  letters to Ehrenherz, I had dwelt on Marie and her musical gifts; thus, the two,
                  when they met, were more than half acquainted. So simple and cordial was their
                  greeting, both clasping each other's hands heartily, and calling each other by
                  name, without the ceremony of introduction, as though they had been friends for
                  years.
               After doing full justice to Tante Cecile's hospitable goûter, and eating, to shameful excess, her delicious cream-cakes,
                  we walked out on the terrace. The sun was just setting, sending up its flame-like
                  rays above the mountains. On the opposite shore, many of the peaks of the Savoy
                  Alps were white with the winter's snows, for it was late in November. Les
                  Corneilles de Bize, back of the Val du Novel, had their peaks and sides covered
                  with heavy masses of snow; also, Mont Chaumeni, which caught the golden crimson of
                  the sunset, and looked 
                     dazzingly
                     dazzlingly
                   beautiful; but Mont le Blanchard, from not being so high, kept its brown
                  and red autumn tints, producing a charming effect, when contrasted with its
                  icy-clad neighbors. A young November moon hung over the Rhone valley, and this
                  same valley was superb; from Dents du Midi to their vis à
                     vis Dent du Morcles, the vale was one mass of snow mountains; Mont
                  Velan, Tête Noire, and Mont Catogne, all wrapped up for the winter, and their
                  peaks flaming in the sunlight with brilliant radiance. Ehrenherz enjoyed the scene
                  with an artist's keen appreciation; then, as the twilight darkened, we ascended to
                  the salon. There the Francesca di Rimini group had its share of admiration; and
                  Ehrenherz sank on one of the little sofas, drawing a sweet sigh of satisfied
                  enjoyment, as Marie, at my request, played the Chopin Adagio. After that, she
                  played some of her new pieces, and I could see very well that she pleased
                  Ehrenherz amazingly. He approached the piano, saying: "So you hold to the Erard
                  pianos, Mademoiselle?"
               Marie replied, by using Chopin's own words: "When I play on a piano of Erard, I
                  find easily a sound already made."
               "Ah," answered Ehrenherz, "but that speech of Chopin has a pendant which you, with
                  true woman cleverness, leave out, because it does not suit your purpose. Chopin
                  also said, you remember, 'But when I feel myself en
                     verve sufficiently strong to find my own sound, mon propre son à moi, I must have a piano of Pleyel.'
                  But I am very fond of an Erard piano, also."
               "Ah, if I were rich!" cried Marie, "I would have one of each; one for my week-day
                  moods, and one for my gay holiday ones."
               Day followed day, and evening followed evening, with unconscious rapidity, during
                  this charming visit of Ehrenherz; the days were devoted to long walks, during
                  which Marie and I did the honors of our beautiful Vaudois country; showing off every lovely point, within walking
                  reach, to Ehrenherz. Les Crêtes, Chatelard, Hauteville, and even Blonay, were
                  displayed with all the pride of ownership. To Chatelard terrace we took him first,
                  as the place dearest to Marie and me, because from it we dated the commencement of
                  our friendship. Then, in the evenings, we would meet in the chateau salon, and
                  have music together.
               Ehrenherz had with him his precious Straduarius violin; and, with young Gardner's
                  assistance, we had, once or twice, some of the Fesca Trios, played as I had heard
                  them in those dear old times. One evening, I made Ehrenherz give us the history of
                  his rare Straduarius; how it had belonged to Paganini, and Vieux Temps had bought
                  it, and sold it to Ehrenherz. He made us notice its nice balance, graceful
                  outline, high finish, and the brilliant varnish. I held the delicious, singing
                  little thing in my hand, and thought of the hundred and fifty years that had
                  passed over its little body so graciously; for old Antonius Straduarius, of
                  Cremona, was a scholar of the most ancient Cremonese maker, Amati. While I was
                  looking at it, Mr. Merle said: "Mr. Ehrenherz, I heard once, and even held in my
                  hand, at Vienna, one of the famous Elector Steiner violins."
               "They rank with the Cremonese," answered Ehrenherz; "I once heard a Steiner, also;
                  but I was very young, and can scarcely recall its peculiar tone; however, I
                  remember it had a remarkably pure tone."
               "Oh, yes," said Mr. Merle; "it had a ringing note, like a woman's voice of the
                  mellowest sound. The shape was very elegant and graceful, highly-finished in every
                  detail, and the varnish was diaphanous, of a rich, golden hue. Girls," added the
                  old gentleman, turning to us, "the history of these Steiner violins will please
                  you. Old Jacob Steiner, who made this famous violin I speak of, lost a wife he
                  dearly loved; he mourned her so deeply that he forsook the world and retired to a
                  monastery, like good Fra Bartolomeo, after the death of his friend Savanorola.
                  While in the monastery, Steiner made sixteen violins in the most perfect manner.
                  He sent one to each of the twelve electors of the empire, and the remaining four
                  to the emperor. Of the whole sixteen, only three well-authenticated ones remain,
                  and they are known by the name of the Elector Steiners."
               "Now, Mr. Merle," I asked, "be so good as to give us a date for these famous
                  violins? When did this dear, loving, faithful old Jacob live? You know I love to
                  have facts classified clearly in my mind by associations."
               "Oh, I can give you a brave, historical association with old Steiner," replied Mr.
                  Merle; "the emperor to whom he sent the four violins was Leopold I., the same who
                  was emperor when Vienna was besieged by the Turks in 1683, and saved by the Poles
                  under John Sobiesky; and this Leopold, you know, was grandfather to Marie Thérèse,
                  and great-grandfather of the luckless Marie Antoinette."
               We gained not only historical, but a variety of other information relating to
                  violins, during that evening's talk. Ehrenherz described to us the build of a
                  violin, pointing out to us its separate parts. Each violin contains fifty-eight
                  different pieces; and when the purfling and tail-pieces are doubled, there are
                  seventy-one bits of wood in the simple, smooth-looking little instrument. Then the
                  wood must be of three sorts: Sycamore for the back, neck, sides, and circles;
                  Tyrolese soft red deal for the belly, base bar, sound-post, and interior blocks;
                  ebony for the finger-board and tail-pieces. The red deal requires the greatest
                  care and judgment in selecting; it should be cut only in December or January, and
                  only the part used which has been exposed to the sun.
               "Then Amati, Straduarius, and Guarnerius were the three great Cremonese makers?"
                  asked Mr. Merle.
               "Yes," answered Ehrenherz; "and they handed down their craft to each other.
                  Guarnerius, the last, and the pupil of Straduarius, though he made superb
                  instruments, was not so even in his make; they were often slovenly in their
                     build. His large violins were better
                  than his small ones; but they are rare. In a large concert hall they sound very
                  well; Paganini's favorite violin was a large Guarnerius; he bequeathed it, when he
                  died, to the City of Genoa. He owned two of these Straduarius, this one and
                  another, and also an Amati."
               "When I heard De Beriot," said Mr. Merle, "he played on a violin of an old Italian
                  maker also, but not a Cremonese. I forget the name. The tone, though not so soft
                  as your lovely Straduarius, was very melancholy and tender."
               "De Beriot's favorite violin," replied Ehrenherz, "was one of Magini, an Italian
                  builder, of Brescia, contemporaneous with Amati."
               "Yes, that is the name," said Mr. Merle; "Magini—I remember well its pleading,
                  mournful tone; it was as if the voice of his wife had gone into it, in order to
                  dwell ever near him."
               Ehrenherz drew his bow over his Straduarius, and soft, pleading tones poured out
                  from it, which thrilled us to the very heart; our thoughts grew tearful and sad as
                  he improvised from his own memories of the past. After awhile, Mr. Merle and Tante
                  Cecile left us, and he laid down the instrument, and, leaning his head on his
                  hand, said, half reproachfully: "Mademoiselle Merle, you have never played
                  Beethoven for me."
               "Because," answered Marie, "I have not dared to."
               "And yet, you play Chopin for me without timidity?"
               "Yes; because Chopin has not yet grown so trammeled with conceits and traditions
                  of pedants. In another twenty-five years one will feel timid in playing
                  Chopin."
               "What a wide difference there is between the music of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven,
                  Weber, Mendelssohn, and Chopin!" said Ehrenherz; "and each so beautiful in his own
                  peculiar genre, each one telling his own tale of
                  'hopes, and fears that kindle hopes!'"
               "De Lanz," I remarked, "that clever Russian writer, says, 'that Haydn's loves end
                  in hymeneals, and Mozart's in festivals.'"
               "That is a pretty idea!" cried Marie; "then Weber's end in a wedding also; but not
                  a wedding like Haydn's; it is during the age of chivalry, and the lover is a
                  princely, valorous knight, and his lady love some gentle, lovely young Chatelaine.
                  Mendelssohn's loves are also satisfactory, ending in lawful, honorable
                  marriage—but more calm and domestic."
               Ehrenherz smiled sadly, as he added his tribute to our fanciful comparisons: "But
                  Beethoven's loves," he said, "lead to no such happiness; they follow a solemn
                  harmony which seems to descend to a tomb. Sometimes they tell, indistinctly, of a
                  sad, mournful tragedy, too awful to give in detail, and over which his profound
                  chords draw a heavy vail; sometimes a glorious, funereal hymn, as if mourning for
                  a love that gave one pride to dwell upon."
               "Chopin's loves," said Marie, "lead also to the tomb, but not a hopeful tomb, like
                  Beethoven's; a wild cry of despair rings out, as if there was no hope of meeting
                  hereafter; then a sob of remorseful agony, as if the love had been for a lost
                  spirit. Never, never do his loves lead to the belief that his better nature had
                  been gratified or elevated by them. What wild cries of sorrow pour out in his
                  Nocturnes; what despair in his Scherzos, and hopelessness in his Preludes! This,
                     par example," and she played over the
                  touching, beautiful Prelude in Re bémol, through the whole of which one feels "the
                  old wound, ever aching." "What solemn tales of remorse they tell!" she continued;
                  "of a high-toned spirit, humiliated and abased at the desecration of that one
                  feeling, which should never be profaned! And then it seems as if through all the
                  wailing there rises gloriously, from time to time, a heavenly strain, breathing
                  out 'thus could my spirit have loved, had my baser nature let it soar aloft.'
                  Sometimes the melody sounds like the cry of a Francesca di Rimini mini; the accessories of the composition suggest
                  the cloudy depths of an Inferno, and, through
                  the gloomy space, sweep those two weary souls, with 'no loving prayer to stay
                  them,' solemnly chanting their lost heaven, their bitter remorse, and yet their
                  mournful happiness even in hell,—
               
                  
                     'piacer sí forte,
                     Che come vedi ancor non m'abbandona.'"
                  
               
               We both remained silent; we could not speak, for we were so touched with the
                  enthusiastic girl's tone of voice and sweet, young, solemn face, both expressing
                  deep, sincere emotion and feeling, which is woman's most powerful eloquence. Her
                  hands rambled over the keys of the piano as if searching for some thought.
                  Chopin's wild Lament came stealing out first, with its choking,
                  proud sorrow; then, after a short preluding of chords, filled with uncertainty,
                  she dashed off into one of Chopin's wildest Pyrrhic Polonaises—that Polonaise
                  Fantasie of which Lizt gives this poetic analysis:—
               "In the Polonaise Fantasie, which belongs already to
                  the last period of Chopin's works, to those which are surplombée with feverish anxiety, we find no trace of the bold,
                  bright pictures of the others; we hear no longer the joyous steps of cavalry
                  accustomed to victory; the songs which stifle and drown all forebodings of defeat;
                  the words which display the boldness that sets well on the victorious. In this an
                  elegiac sadness predominates, interrupted by startled movements, melancholy
                  smiles, unexpected shocks; even the repose is filled with watchful starts, as if
                  those who lie in wait feared a surprise, and were surrounded on all sides, without
                  any hope breaking out from the vast horizon, and to whose brains at last despair
                  mounts, like a large draught of Cyprus wine, which gives a more instinctive
                  rapidity to all their gestures, a keener point to all their words, a more burning
                  sparkle to all their emotions, and which causes the mind to arrive at a key-note
                  of irritability bordering on delirium."
            
            
               CHAPTER XX.
               MUSIC TALK.
               THE next evening, when we all assembled in the chateau salon, Ehrenherz said:
                     "Mais vraiment, Mademoiselle Merle, I wish I
                  could hear you play Beethoven."
               Marie, without further urging, commenced the allegro of the sonate, in Sol major,
                  Opus 14, No. 2. Never had it sounded so bewitching, and yet so sad; the half
                  querulous, and yet tearful remonstrance of the entreating treble to the resistant
                  base,—that base which one is sure is a very naughty person,—all this Marie
                  expressed with the most delicate tenderness, and exact comprehension of the
                  meaning of the sonate. She threw in every varying expression with great skill;
                  there was earnest gravity, then tenderness; then came the coaxing entreaties of a
                  patient love that will not be wearied out. In contrast with this, she brought out
                  firmly the determined interruptions of the base; at times, the contention raged
                  furiously. At last the "resisting principle," as Beethoven called it, grew more
                  reasonable, and the dialogue was carried on peacefully. She expressed the delicate
                  shades of gentle interrogations and lingering pauses; and at the end of the
                  sonate, when the "resisting principle" yields, she pointed the assent so well that
                  it was clearly heard in the closing measures. After the satisfactory affirmative
                  of the la, fa, and sol died out, Ehrenherz came up to the piano, and said,—
               "Be so good as to play the allegro over for me, will you?" He watched her hands
                  closely all through the passage sage;
                  as Marie finished the last measure, he asked: "Where did you get that fingering
                  from?"
               "Do you like it?" was her smiling, playful reply.
               "It is exquisite; it gives the exact expression," he said.
               "It is Chopin's," she answered. "You will find it in De Lanzi; and Wolfmaister,
                  who taught me the piano, was Chopin's pupil; I got it from him also, as well as
                  some other peculiarities of fingering, which I have found invaluable."
               "Play that again, if you please. Commence at the beginning," urged Ehrenherz; "I
                  wish to examine your management closely. How exactly you produce Mendelssohn's
                  'perfect touch, fingers shod in velvet!'" He watched her attentively, especially
                  one passage in the fourteenth measure, just before the close of the allegro; there
                  she slackened almost imperceptibly on the La dieze,
                  which note she took with the second finger of the right hand, then slipped the
                  same finger from the extremity of the black key, on the Si natural, which follows;
                  the effect of this legato is very striking, as
                  De Lanz says. "Now," said Ehrenherz, "the third finger on that Si would not be
                  wrong; but how much better is Chopin's management! Then the fourth finger on those
                  eleven staccato notes gives that velvety touch so often described to me as a
                  peculiarity of Chopin's playing."
               "You never heard Chopin, then?" I asked.
               "No unfortunately; but I have often heard Liszt; and the shades and coquetries of
                  expression obtained by his fingering are innumerable. The modern school of
                  lingering has been of great service."
               "Ah, what a weary task was that finger business to me!" I said.
               "Yes," cried Marie, "one might think so. Mr. Ehrenherz, her copy of Clementi's
                     Gradus ad Parnassum is as thickly covered with
                  lead pencil and ink figures, for the fingering, as a study of figured base."
               "Oh, how that recalls the summer I did it!" I said. "It was a pensum I set myself when I was far away in the
                  country, and had no piano to practice on—so many, many years ago. My poor master,
                  a pupil of the great Trajetta, was dying of consumption, and I knew I never could
                  have his invaluable lessons again; and by doing this I hoped to impress upon my
                  memory, as well as on my book, the principle of his excellent system of
                  fingering."
               Ehrenherz then asked me many questions of my poor master, and of old Trajetta,
                  that great Neapolitan maestro who died, unhonored and unknown, in America. This
                  led us to different systems of teaching, and I made Ehrenherz smile with the
                  pleasure of a teacher, over the descriptions I gave of the enthusiastic pride with
                  which I had received and treasured Trajetta's scribbled, blotted copies of the old
                  Neapolitan solfeggi, on which Agujari and Gabrielli had been trained; and how I
                  sang them, and the duos of Durante, with such pious zeal and earnestness;
                  submitting patiently to the severest practice, with various instruments, in order
                  to fix, exactly and firmly, the different registers of the voice according to his
                  orthodox notions of voice training. Then Marie described Wolfmaister's mode of
                  teaching, and Ehrenherz gave us his valuable experience.
               "A master should be so conscientious," he said, in his gentle, earnest manner. "To
                  be sure, few young pupils can comprehend the high end and aim of music, and its
                  elevated poesy; but we should, however, respect youth enough, to prepare the
                  virgin soil to receive, some time in the future, the grand conceptions of great
                  musical minds. For beginners, a little, very little of Hünten; then Czerny, in
                  order to arrive at the exercises of Cramer, which are like the fables of La
                  Fontaine—nothing can take their place. After these, some of the simplest
                  compositions of Haydn and Mozart will show the end to which these preparations
                  tend. By practicing constantly 'many scales,' the pupil, under the
                  direction of an intelligent master, will be able to arrive at the more elevated
                  style of Mozart; from that—par exemple, from
                     Mozart's Fantasie Sonate—he can
                  enter into the world of Beethoven. But before I allowed any of my pianists to
                  touch Beethoven, I gave them always some of Weber's early sonates; there are six
                  of his I have used a great deal, arranged for piano and violin, and also arranged
                  for four hands. Then, when I could give them an opportunity of studying or
                  practicing with other instruments, the two quartettes of Mozart, for piano,
                  violin, alto, and violoncello; and the trio, for piano, violin, and alto, brought
                  them along famously."
               "Wolfmaister gave me the 'Kinderstücke of Mendelssohn, two years ago," said Marie,
                  "when I was just beginning this higher order of compositions."
               "They are delicious," replied Ehrenherz. "Have you ever read over the
                  'Kinderscenen' of R. Schumann?"
               How Marie's full brown eyes lighted up! Now she was repaid for her quarrels with
                  Wolfmaister; for Ehrenherz appreciated, as she did, the works of this great weird
                  composer. "Yes, with delight!" she cried out. "How beautiful is the
                  'Frühlingesang,' and 'Erster Verlust,' and 'Errinnerung!'"
               "Also 'Mai, lieber Mai,'" rejoined Ehrenherz. "These, however, may be
                  'Kinderscenen' for us, but not for the ordinary pupil. Of course, Mademoiselle
                  Merle, your master has made you study Bach?"
               "I made myself study him," said Marie, pointing to her well-used copy of Bach's
                     Clavecin bien tempéré. "Wolfmaister would never
                  give a woman such strong musical food as that."
               "No study," said Ehrenherz, "so well develops the mechanism and musical
                  intelligence of a pupil as a gradual study of the preludes, and fugues of
                  Bach."
               Then, turning the pages of her volumes of Bach, he selected two or three of the
                  fugues, and played them over for her, pointing out and explaining some of the
                  difficult managements and motives.
               "I am as great a heretic about the fugue," I said, rather flippantly, "as
                  Wolfmaister is about the poetical language we read in music, and which he calls
                  'musical transcendental stuff.' The fugue seems to me not only tiresome, but
                  useless. Why need modern musicians employ it?"
               "The fugue is out of vogue, now-a-days," answered Ehrenherz, "because it is not in
                  the feelings. The dialectic style is the spirit of the fugue, and that spirit is
                  not in many composers now. The fugue is useful, nay necessary; but to carry it to
                  an extreme, as it was at one time in musical compositions, is folly; it does no
                  good; it is like the dry, close, reasoning of a logician, on a useless point,
                  which gains nothing when proved."
               "Or like many philosophers," I added, "who waste a lifetime over the study of some
                  minor point in science, of service only to the little world of savans, leaving unexamined, on either side, marvelous
                  things, from which might be gained or discovered inventions and improvements of
                  benefit to the whole human race. Therefore, let us give our musical veto on all
                  fugue passages in future musical compositions."
               "But," said Ehrenherz, smiling at my rather presumptuous tirade against the fugue,
                  "then you must banish all musical reasoning from compositions, and that would
                  leave us sorry works. Cherubini has a sentence in his 'Course on Counterpoint,'
                  which will do very well to quote to you, Mademoiselle Fauvette: 'Every
                  composition, in order, that the management of it be well understood, should have
                  the style of the fugue in it, if it has not precisely its character and form.' The
                  fugue is to music what a knowledge of the human frame is to the sculptor or
                  painter. It is the skeleton of musical form. The dry composers of the fugue, who
                  would sacrifice everything to it, are like those painters of the eclectic schools,
                  who succeeded Leonardo da Vinci, Michel Angelo, and Raphael; in their eagerness to
                  imitate the old masters, they forgot the great aim of art; they grouped figures
                  together with academic exactitude, but without regard to the natural positions the
                  subject required; they exaggerated ated
                  muscles, and indulged in needless foreshortening, merely to show their knowledge
                  of drawing,—and thus sacrificed beauty and true feeling to the mere letter."
               Ehrenherz's rebuke was so courteously given, I could not feel piqued at any one
                  but myself; so I laughed heartily over the mild but well-merited snubbing I had
                  received.
               "I think I deserve some reward for taking your civil reproof so good humoredly," I
                  said, as I turned over the leaves of a volume of Beethoven's sonates. I came to
                  the twelfth sonate, Opu 26,—the grand sonate, in La bémol. "Is it too much to ask
                  this to-night?"
               "Not in this atmosphere," answered Ehrenherz, graciously. "One can fly great
                  lengths and heights before such an audience. But," he added, as he sat at the
                  piano, and turned over the leaves of the music, "it makes me wish for the fingers
                  and poetical coloring of a Liszt."
               "Oh, Mr. Ehrenherz!" cried Marie, "have you ever read what De Lanz says of
                  Wehrstaedt, of Genève, in reference to this twelfth sonate?"
               Ehrenherz had not, and we read to him the amusing story De Lanz relates, in his
                  admirable work, Trois Styles de Beethoven. The theme
                  of the first part of this sonate was the life occupation of this eccentric but
                  simple-minded artist, Wehrstaedt, who, in 1837, was considered the best master of
                  the piano in Genève. De Lanz says,—
               "When he came to give me my lesson, at the pension of the celebrated Swiss pastor, Bouvier, Wehrstaedt seated
                  himself, after giving me a dry salutation, beside the horrible piano of the
                  pension, without saying a word, or without removing his hat from his head. I
                  opened the twelfth sonate of Beethoven, and placed it on the music-stand. He threw
                  on me a sad look. 'Why this piece?' he asked, in a mournful tone. 'Why not a
                     galop of Herz?' 'Because I like it,' I
                  answered, 'and I have played it a great deal.' 'What a pity!' he said,
                  sorrowfully. 'Why, do you know, you cannot possibly understand what this first
                  page contains?"
               "I commenced playing it, as people play who have had what are ordinarily called
                  'good masters;' masters who are like the mice, that comprehend nothing of the
                  architecture of the grange through which they scamper. 'Stop!' he said abruptly,
                  and, pushing me away from the piano, took my place. Shall I tell you how he
                  played? I am not able. His fingers seemed glued to the keys, as inseparably as the
                  Siamese twins to one another. The Beethoven theme and the piano appeared to make
                  one individual. Never have I heard a similar legato; a coherency so exactly calculated for the tones of a piano,
                  an expression so penetrating, or a rhythm so severe. After that was over, he held
                  out the encouraging hope to me that, by following his counsels, I might possibly
                  play, after a year's practice, the first eight measures of the motif 'tolerably' well. The crescendo
                  would exact a new and serious study of crescendo in general, and this one in
                  particular. As to the contre partie of the
                     motif,—here he drew a hopeless sigh, saying,
                  'I have had to give up playing this myself, on account of that diabolical trill on
                  the re. A conscientious study of twenty years,
                  young man, has not enabled me to do it properly.'
               "This trill, to which the executant can only give the third and fourth fingers of
                  the right hand, while the thumb and the first finger are occupied, is just
                  saved,—barely accomplished, as all pianists admit. Wehrstaedt had made the trill
                  of the third and fourth fingers, in these difficult positions, the study of
                     his life! But the equality of his trill, its fullness, the sharpness of
                  its termination—and the force, above all, with which the little finger attacked
                  the Mi bémol, which follows in the passage referred to—was something approaching
                  to the marvelous. During a long sojourn at Genève, Wehrstaedt, like Madame de
                  Stael, never visited Chamouni; that says enough for the musician, as it does for
                  the great authoress. To exercise this trill, to give enough lessons to the Genevese to enable him, as he said,
                     'in an appreciable time to espouse' some great unknown damsel of
                  Berne—whose charms he celebrated daily in the four exquisite sonates of Weber—such
                  was the existence of this excellent man, the most inoffensive of human
                  beings."
               Ehrenherz laughed heartily over this humorous story, then commenced the
                  captivating theme of this epic of sonates. It is one of those inspirations that
                  can come only once in the life of an artist. As I sat listening to the five
                  variations on the theme, I thought of those exquisite "Sonnets, from the
                  Portuguese," of Mrs. Browning; each variation repeated, in a ravishing style, the
                  subject of the theme, as each one of those beautiful sonnets repeat the sweet
                  confession of love. Then the last variation was calm and complete in its
                  expression; the love had arrived at its "perfect purple fullness," as in the last
                  sonnet is sung with quiet rapture, the sweet mounting up to the full completion of
                  the heart's bliss,—
               
                  
                     "I love thee with the breath,
                     Smiles, tears of all my life."
                  
               
               Then the melodic phrase at the end of the variation seemed to say,—
               
                  
                     "And, if God choose,
                     I shall but love thee better after death."
                  
               
               The scherzo, Ehrenherz rolled off grandly. The shafts of the treble responded
                  sharply to the volleys of the base, and this glorious base sounded like the
                  dashing of the waves of our beautiful lake, during a storm, against the terrace
                  walls of the chateau. The third part is the famous Marche
                     Funèbre sur la mort d'un hero. How different from Chopin's Marche Funèbre! and yet equally grand in its genre: one
                  is subjective, the other objective. In Beethoven's, one
                  sees the funeral procession passing, the troops drawn up on either side; the
                  tolling of the drums salutes with solemn reverence the lifeless remains of a man
                  who must have been the glory and pride of a nation, as, with gloomy pomp, he is
                  borne into the superb mausoleum; it is a grand military display over the burial of
                  a great warrior. But Chopin's sonate and "Marche Funèbre" are widely different.
                  The sonate seems the gloomy reverie of the mind, on the approaching death of its
                  mortal part; whether death will extend to the soul, which it has fondly hoped was
                  immortal, agonizes the thoughts. How confused and involved grows the harmony of
                  the last pages of this sonate! There is expressed the doubt, the horror of
                  nothingness, the dread of annihilation; all this presses in upon the poor,
                  shivering spirit; and dumb, despairing chords and modulations bring the reverie to
                  the solemn close of death,—to that moment when the great secret shall be
                  disclosed! Then follows the "Marche Funèbre," which seems as the resolving of all
                  this suspense and dismay, for it sounds like a solemn chant of spirits, bearing
                  the soul aloft to higher, purer realms, with soothing strains and full glorious
                  harmony, fully compensating for the terrible, gloomy, discordant doubts of the
                  sonate.
               But to return to Beethoven's. After Ehrenherz finished the "Marche Funèbre," he
                  grasped the finale of this marvelous twelfth sonate. This allegro displayed to
                  great advantage his cleverness as a pianist. The chromatic grupetti flew like arrows through the wind, and yet
                  his right hand rested calm and firm, while it threw off, with masterly dexterity,
                  the brilliant groups of double crotchets.
               "Ah, Beethoven, Beethoven!" cried Marie, her soft brown eyes swimming with
                  emotion, as Ehrenherz finished the last measure. "How true it is, that one cannot
                  be taught his music! it must be felt and understood. I cannot express my thanks to
                  you for this piece of execution. I have always felt how this sonate should be
                  played, but have never heard it before, satisfactorily. Wolfmaister always makes
                  of it what Chopin used to call 'a pigeon chase.'
               "'Finger tanz,' as Beethoven called the style of playing you mean," said Ehrenherz, laughing. "The legato is the principal thing to aim at. You have the
                  idea exactly, Mademoiselle Merle; just as you execute that sonate in Sol, Opus 14,
                  that you played for me this evening,—that is the true style. See, how you change
                  from left to right hand, in order to save break or interruption,—that is the great
                  charm of piano-forte playing. The lié style
                  alone produces a beautiful tone; the sound must be coaxed out, as it were, when
                  the executant touches the keys."
               A little more pleasant talk, and then Ehrenherz bade us good night, promising to
                  be with us early the next morning.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXI.
               EHRENHERZ'S LAST EVENING.
               IT was Ehrenherz's last day with us. He had already stayed longer in Peilz than he
                  had dreamed of, when he stopped for a few days to see me once again. But Marie's
                  wonderful talent, the musical atmosphere surrounding us—united to the pleasure of
                  being with an old friend, who could talk with him about at least one period of his
                  sweet past with his beloved sister—had proved irresistible; and he had stayed on,
                  week after week, insensibly. We had walked with him everywhere; for, luckily,
                  while he was with us the weather had been remarkably fine: no snow on the roads,
                  and only enough cold weather to make icicles on our beautiful little cascade
                  d'Hauteville, and to whiten the tops of our mountains.
               That afternoon, Ehrenherz and I had walked to Hauteville, with Dora and Beau. We
                  spent an hour or more, exploring the beautiful points of that lovely Swiss estate;
                  we descended the narrow, ivy-covered steps, leading down the woody hill to the
                  ravine beneath the second cascade, and looked at the long, pendant icicles, the
                  soaring pine trees, and the rugged rocks; then down on the Oignon, moving slowly
                  across the jagged tops of its rocky bed, over which, in spring, it would dash so
                  madly. Some two or three years after, the Parisian critics were writing learned
                  articles over a new symphony of Ehrenherz. One passage confused these modern
                  Athenians; it was called, as they expressed it, "from a caprice of the composer,
                  the Cascade." "But," said B., that cleverest of all musical æsthetical writers of the day, "if it is a waterfall, it
                  is a frozen one; rugged and wintry is the landscape, and sluggish is the flow of
                  the stream."
               Ehrenherz wrote to me at the time, "I wish you could hear my symphony. You should,
                  of all others; for it is a memory of our last visit to Hauteville, that January
                  afternoon, three years ago. Have you read B.'s clever criticism on it? Which, by
                  the way, is far superior to my humble symphony, doing me a great deal too much
                  honor; like 'Shakspeare's critics, bringing to view, more than Shakspeare ever
                  knew.' But how well he sees into my waterfall!"
               I little imagined, when we stood looking at the wild, picturesque spot, that our
                  visit would be thus grandly commemorated; and have often thought since of the
                  speculations of biographers, some generation or two after our time, over the
                  meaning of this name, given to that part of this great composition by the
                  wonderful young maestro.
               Then we slowly clambered back, and went up to the Belvidere, near the green-houses
                  of the chateau, and sat on its steps for a long while, looking down on the lake,— 
                     
                        "which, like a shield
                        Some giant long had ceased to wield,
                        Lay with its edges sunk in sand and stone;"—
                     
                   and over into the beautiful Rhone valley. Dents du Midi were enveloped in a
                  poetic sunny haze; the white, glittering snows of Mount Velan and Mount Catogne
                  shone resplendent; and the graceful outline of Dent de Morcles stood clearly out
                  against the deep blue sky, so graciously chiseled by nature's master hand. The
                  weather was bland, and warm as early spring; the sashes of the green-houses were
                  pushed aside, and the exotics sent out their balmy greeting on the air to this
                  lovely young spring day, lying with such bewitching coquetry "in the lap of old
                  winter." All the laborers, men and women, were out in the vineyards, digging
                  around and tying up the vines; the air was filled with their merry voices: first
                  the words, then the laughs, then a distant, broken song; and mingled with all
                  these rustic, pastoral sounds, was the warbling of the little birds, rejoicing
                  over Dame Nature's soft, indulgent winter. On our left stretched up the beautiful
                  Pleïades, from whose riante sides Blonay's old
                  towers stood clearly out; numberless little mountain villages peeped out here and
                  there, and Ehrenherz pointed to the soft blue vapor hanging over each one, telling
                  the hour of the evening meal—the goûter—which,
                  to his "home-loving" German tastes, added a sweeter charm to the scene.
               "How often," he said, "shall I think of this, when shut up in a dark city in the
                  close atmosphere of our winter rooms! a draught of fresh air, blowing from an open
                  window over a pot of violets or a box of réséda, will remind me of it. I will shut
                  my eves, and invoke from memory a sight of this picture, the imprint of which I
                  now commit to her faithful charge,—and it will cheer and refresh me."
               He did more, for he has commemorated that afternoon gloriously; and that is why my
                  memory brings back so vividly each detail. Often, in the crowded concert rooms, I
                  have listened to the divine pastoral sounds of his marvelous symphony; and while
                  the enthusiastic crowd have watched the beautiful unfoldings of harmony created by
                  this young modern master of instrumentation, dazzled and entranced by his gorgeous
                  orchestral coloring, I have closed my eyes, and straightway memory's magic doors
                  would fly open, showing me as complete a representation of that Swiss scene as if
                  it had been really present; not only the sounds, but the poetic, hazy sunlight,
                  and even the atmospheric fragrance and vapor.
               Hugh Miller says that metaphysicians have not yet entered some provinces of the
                  mind: "That there is a mysterious cabinet of daguerreotype pictures, of which,
                  though fast locked up on ordinary occasions, disease sometimes flings the door ajar." To this 
                     myterious
                     mysterious
                   cabinet, music also possesses the key,—the magical sesame; and the
                  pictures are not mere daguerreotypes, for not only are forms found there, but
                  sounds and odors—odors unthought of at the time, but whose fragrance remains in
                  the pure atmosphere of this sanctuary, fresh and unfading; the very tones of loved
                  ones, the dead lost and living lost, ring in our ears; those short, kind words,
                  spoken by them without thought in the past,—and only one instant, it may have
                  been, in the utterance,—but whose echoes are endless!
               
                  
                     "The world is wide—these things are small;
                     They may be nothing—but they are all!"
                  
               
               While Dora and Beau walked up and down the beautiful avenue of tilleuls, Ehrenherz
                  and I talked of the past, of the darlings "gone before," of the tarrying place,
                  the loss of loved ones made of earth.
               "A little more work," he said, "a little more patient endurance of the separation,
                  and then our eyes will be truly, opened, and we shall see them again. But life is
                  so calm and sweet to me now, so without the unrest of ambition, that I fancy her
                  spirit must be hovering ever around me, smoothing away all roughness,—'making
                  straight distorted wills,' as that beautiful poem you read last evening says. Life
                  has no rude points since she left me—or, rather, since our eyes closed on her
                  presence. At first, you know how hard it was for me to think of taking up life
                  without her; but it seemed mercifully arranged for me; even my weary lessons,
                  formerly such a leaden round, became brightened to me,—every pupil seemed imbued
                  with a portion of her presence. Then came this gratifying offer from Europe, and,
                  strange to say, that very nonette I composed during the last summer of her life,
                  and which she loved so much, had a great deal to do with the decision in my favor.
                  Oh, my friend! it surely cannot be mere fancy, this idea I have, that she is my
                  guardian spirit,—loving me as she did in life, and possessing sessing more power
                  to work good for me, after the emancipation of death."
               In a chapel of Saint Francesco de Paolo, at Naples, is a painting representing a
                  guardian spirit conducting a youth; the life path is covered with sharp thorns, on
                  which the boy treads with bare, bleeding feet; before him lies the tempter Sin,
                  holding the mirror of vanity up in front of him, to dazzle him; but the youth
                  looks steadfastly into the face of his angel guide, rests lovingly on the
                  encircling arm, and is borne safely along. So looked Ehrenherz, as he said these
                  words. I felt awe stricken; I thought I could see the violet wings, and, snowy
                  vesture of an angel; it seemed as if we were on holy ground; and most exquisitely
                  the adagio of his symphony, in that dorée violet key of Si bémol, expresses all he
                  said on that sweet day, and all I felt.
               The beautiful moon rose, and hung over the lake its pure orb, mingling its silver
                  rays with the orange and crimson light of the setting sun. The snowy tops of the
                  Savoy Alps looked as if chiseled out of pure white marble, and stood cutting and
                  clear against the sky. We walked slowly home, Beau fast asleep in Dora's arms,
                  completely tired out with his afternoon's race; and Ehrenherz and I lingered along
                  the road, turning every little while and stopping, as though we never expected to
                  see the place again, and were bidding it adieu.
               We drank tea with Marie; and Mr. Merle and Tante Cecile had a long talk with
                  Ehrenherz over his American reminiscences. Then we ascended to the salon, and
                  Marie played for him his favorites, "Lament" and "Consolation" of Chopin; her own
                  beautiful "Etudes;" and the "Wedding March," from Mendelssohn's "Songe d'une Nuit
                  d'Été." Then she poured out, like a rich golden wine, her arrangement of the
                  "Adelaïde" of Beethoven. The beautiful andante flowed from beneath her fingers as
                  a delicious idyl; and that allegro, so ineffective for the voice, from her
                  exquisite accenting and rich accessories, mounted up gloriously ously, and became all that my taste exacted of me
                  in vain, when I sang it.
               "It is so provoking," I cried out, as she finished, "for a singer to love a
                  passage as I do that allegro, and yet feel that it is so completely untranslatable
                  into the language of song!"
               But they both made me sing it to them, their ears of loving friendship giving the
                  piece all that it lost by being sung. Then Ehrenherz took the piano, and played
                  for us those exquisite improvisations on thoughts and feelings, so different from
                  improvisings on given themes. At last he remained silent for a moment; then,
                  striking a chord in Mi bémol, commenced the adagio introduction of Beethoven's
                  "Les Adieux, L'Absence, et Le Retour," Opus 81. How touchingly the first three
                  notes seemed to utter "Lebewohl!" I think I never, before or after, heard
                  Ehrenherz play that difficult but powerful sonate so well; it was an execution of
                  inspiration. In the "Adieux," the parting friends appeared to return again and
                  again, to say, tenderly, "Lebewohl;" the descending gamuts were like the lingering
                  steps of departure; and the curious effect in the finale of this first division of
                  the sonate—of the redoubled blows of the tonic and dominant—was like a bodily
                  presence of those clanging doors, invisible to the eyes, but so sensibly heard and
                  felt at certain epochs of our lives, when one phrase succeeds another, and the
                  past, and all connected with it, is shut out from us irrevocably.
               Ehrenherz's touch and accent, always so faultless, became heightened by
                  inspiration; and this passage, which ordinarily needs the orchestral effect to
                  present the poetic idea intended to be conveyed by this curious expression, was
                  made as clear to us as if we had had all the grand timbre of a full orchestra. Then followed the "andante," which
                  expresses the sorrow of absence. There was the magic circle of memory; the three
                  tone syllables, as of one loved name; the dwelling on the sweet words as it were;
                  then came that ravishing episode of the flute solo, so soft, so tender and
                  trusting,—this gentle grief of "Abwesenheit."
               The "Return" then rang out grandly a hymn of joy and gratitude; Ehrenherz's hands
                  seemed gifted with double power, and Marie's Erard was possessed with a
                  sympathizing spirit, for the glorious lights and shadows of an orchestra hung
                  around the grand picture, as his skillful fingers rapidly sketched it out.
               He struck the last notes, rose from the piano, took both our hands together,
                  kissed them, and left the room in silence. Our hands were wet, telling us that his
                  cheeks had been tear-washed as well as our own. A touching and fitting farewell
                  from our young maestro. Often in the future, as it unfolded more and more
                  gloriously for those two gifted artists, did I recall that night with happy
                  pride.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXII.
               BAD NEWS.
               THE snow fell silently and heavily; all around us towered white peaks, and the
                  ravines, stretched down to the lake, looking like frozen mountain water-courses.
                  "The hardest winter for many years," so every one said, and the dullest one Peilz
                  had known since the establishment of Institution Eperveil, thirty years before.
                  The usual weekly exhibitions of the students, in the lecture-hall, were lessened
                  to monthly; then they had dramatic scenes, sometimes a lecture on chemistry and
                  natural philosophy, with interesting experiments, but no music. Wolfmaister was
                  absent on business speculations in England, relating to his Clarens lots, and
                  making preparations for a terrible railway, which was to tear ruthlessly right
                  through the pretty green heart of our walk above Territet, but which, if it did
                  spoil the picturesque beauties of this lovely shore, would raise the prices of
                  Wolfmaister's cottage property to a mythical height.
               Madame Eperveil gave no grand soirées, no dinners, nor even any pleasant social
                  cotéries, in her own salon. The old lady lived in solemn, solitary state, having
                  but little to say to any one. After our unfortunate scene at Point du Pays, at the
                  time of Hélène's departure, we had been very cool to each other. The Professor and
                  Madame Bouvreuil dined with her, as usual, on Sundays, and I went to the Merles.
                  Always, as I returned from the V. chapel on Sunday noon, I would meet Marie and
                  Tante Cecile coming out of the old Peilz church, where Mr. Merle preached; and the
                  dear old pastor had a regular standing joke for the occasion; as he stretched out
                  his hand to give me a friendly greeting, he would say: "Now the lion and the lamb
                  will lie down peacefully together at the same repast. Brother Martin and the
                  Mother Church have ceased their battles; surely the day of millennium is at
                  hand."
               During the first part of the year, just after Ehrenherz had left, Tante Octavie
                  sent us all a special invitation to dine with her. The old lady received Marie and
                  me graciously, but coldly, and the dinner was a little stiff. We all noticed how
                  thin and haggard Tante Octavie looked; and I saw, as we stood on the balcony,
                  after dinner, to watch the sunset, that in her rich bandeaux of hair there were
                  many shining silver threads. I felt sorry for the old lady, very sorry; but her
                  stately tread, and sternly compressed lips, and slightly-knit brow, shoved that
                  she did not want any one's sorrow or sympathy.
               Octave's name was never mentioned; even when letters came from him, which was not
                  often, Madame Bouvreuil said nothing of their contents; but I noticed that she and
                  the professor always looked solemn and anxious after the reception of them. Weekly
                  we heard from Hélène, short, dull, dry letters. Poor child! she was being worked
                  too hard in her new English home. Every hour, from seven o'clock in the morning
                  until nine at night, was filled up with occupations. One of her letters to me gave
                  an account of her daily routine.
               "You ask me for a detail of my duties, Fanny," she wrote, in part of the letter;
                  "weary enough they are. I awaken at six; at seven Arthur and Edgar are ready in
                  the school-room for their lessons; at half-past eight we have family prayers and
                  breakfast—a half hour generally finishes both ceremonies. O Fanny! I often wonder,
                  while listening to the cold, dry devotions, if God listens to our formalities. At
                  nine o'clock the little girls come to me, and I teach them everything
                  until one o'clock, when they go out to ride, or walk, while I mark and look over
                  Miss Landsnecht's music, and select
                  those pieces I think may suit her style. Then follows luncheon, which
                  is the dinner for the children and governess. In the afternoon, I go to the
                  music-room, and give the music lessons to the little girls, and sometimes play
                  duos with Miss Landsnecht. An hour before the family dinner I go to the
                  sitting-room of Mrs. Landsnecht's mother, a dressy old dowager, Lord S.'s
                  grandmother, and from whom he certainly inherited his great amount of sense; to
                  her I read French novels aloud, and if Miss Landsnecht is through with her dinner
                  toilette, she listens, for the improvement of her pronunciation and ear, which
                  surely need all the culture I can possibly give them.
               "After that, I am free for about an hour, but I am so weary that I throw my poor,
                  tired body on my bed to rest. Then comes the summons that Masters Arthur and Edgar
                  are ready, and I go to look over their classical lessons, and help them prepare
                  for their tutor; this said tutor being quite too elegant a person to do anything
                  but read prayers, in a drawly tone, give careless lessons in the morning to the
                  boys, and flirt with Miss Landsnecht; he being allowed to do all this because he
                  is the son of a younger son of a poor lord somebody, and this, to my rich but
                     bourgeoise patrons, is something worth
                  regarding. At nine the bell is rung for prayers—those 'dreadful prayers!' as Marie Merle would call them, if she felt about
                  them as I do. These evening prayers are like some festivals in the church,
                  movable, being dependent on the will of the tutor; and, if he wishes to go to the
                  opera, or has any other engagement, he is apt to summon us earlier, for he need
                  not be courteous or thoughtful, as his congregation consists only of children,
                  governess, and servants.
               Sometimes I receive a courteous invitation to spend the evening in the
                  drawing-room; kind, to be sure, this invitation sounds, but I groan inwardly
                  whenever it comes, for I know they only mean that I am expected to go and grind
                  out quadrilles, mazurkas, and valses for some little company of Mrs. Landsnecht
                  and her daughter.
               "I am ashamed of my sharp, complaining letter, Fanny. Do not let maman see it, please; that is why I send it, under
                  cover, to Marie Merle. I do wonder if I shall grow used to being a governess?
                  However, one comfort, if I have to be one to the end of my life, that life, in
                  such a case, will not be very long in the world. Fanny, life is
                  solemn business, after all, as I have heard you say; and I was so happy in those
                  days, only one short year ago, that I wondered to hear you say so.
               "Good-by, dear friend; write often to me; tell me everything you can about
                     maman; how she looks, and talks, and feels.
                  Do not let her work too much; do not let her assist Fanchette in the fine ironing.
                  Remember your own mother, Fanny, and watch over mine. No one can tell how I long
                  for her; sometimes in the night I awaken, and think she is by me; then my very
                  heart stands still with agony, when, as I grow fully awake, I realize that I am so
                  far away from her."
               Poor Hélène! Tante Cecile, Marie, and I mourned a great deal over this letter; the
                  tone of it was so unlike Hélène. It seemed strange to see our merry, graceful,
                  gentle friend so transformed as to be writing and feeling bitter thoughts; there
                  was a hardness and hopelessness in her words, which proved how desolate and
                  dispiriting must be her mode of life.
               One day I was sitting with Tante Cecile, embroidering, listening to Marie, who was
                  playing in the salon, and talking, in an under-tone to the old lady; it was in the
                  spring, and the weather was sufficiently warm for us to sit in the tower room. We
                  were on each side of the beautiful stained-glass window, quite out of Marie's
                  sight and hearing, and Tante Cecile took the opportunity to tell me some sad news
                  of Octave.
               "He is behaving badly enough," said Tante Cecile, leaning ing over to me, and in reply to a remark of mine
                  about him. "Brother Leonard has been consulted by Madame Eperveil, for her
                  suspicions about him are beginning to be roused."
               "Beginning!" I repeated over, impatiently; "just as if she has not had reason
                  enough to open her eyes to his habits any time since I came to Peilz."
               "Yes, to be sure," continued Tante Cecile; "but I suppose affairs are so bad now
                  that she finds she must open her eyes to the truth. Poor Octavie Eperveil! she is
                  very anxious. She says she has sent him large sums of money, at different times,
                  during the past two years, whenever he has been absent; but that since last summer
                  his demands upon her have been enormous; she has exhausted all her resources; and
                  when she wrote, telling him this, he answered that he must have money, or he
                  should be disgraced, as it was for debts of honor!"
               Poor old lady! Now I understand the reason of the discontinuance of her winter
                  amusements; she had had to observe strict economy to meet even the regular
                  expenses of the institution. How her haggard, worn face rose up before me! I
                  wished sincerely I had never quarreled with her in the past; and I thought over
                  with remorse of the foolish subjects of difference between us, which caused such a
                  separation now, when I might be able to comfort her by pleasing, gentle
                  attentions. My heart yearned to be something to her. I forgot all her unkind
                  tyranny; I thought only of her lonely hours, her age, and her sorrow. Something
                  like this I said to Tante Cecile, who replied: "All this is very natural, my
                  child, but it would be, hard work to comfort Octavie Eperveil. Such stern natures
                  as hers have to bear trouble alone. It's the old story of the Spartan boy, with
                  such people."
               A few mornings after this conversation, while Madame Bouvreuil and Fanchette were
                  at market, the door bell rang violently. Dora answered it, and returned with a
                  telegram in her hand. I knew it could not be for me, but still my heart throbbed
                  painfully as I took it hastily from Dora's hands. So long as I live, the arrival
                  of a telegram will cause me this suffering; for one sunny June morning, I was
                  awakened from a bright dream, to read one, in which I expected to find the joyful
                  news of a birth, and read death!
               "It is not from England, Mademoiselle Fauvette," said Dora, with affectionate
                  eagerness, seeing my agitation; she knew we were anxious about Hélène's health and
                  hastened to relieve my mind on that score.
               No; it was from Naples, where Octave was with Lord S., and it was directed to
                  Professor Bouvreuil. I sent Dora with it to Institution Eperveil, telling her to
                  see Mr. Serin, if possible, first; but on her return, she said Madame Eperveil met
                  her, and told her she would attend to it, that she need not wait. A short while
                  after, Fanchette returned from market alone; she said, that as they passed
                  Eperveil, Mr. Serin had come out to meet them, and told Madame Bouvreuil that
                  Madame Eperveil wished to see her. The dinner hour arrived, but neither the
                  professor nor madame came. Fanchette slipped off, without my knowledge, to the
                  institution, and came back sobbing, ready to break her heart. She burst into my
                  room, exclaiming: "Oh, Mademoiselle Fauvette—Mademoiselle Fauvette, Monsieur
                  Octave is dead! The poor Dame Bouvreuil! The poor Mademoiselle Hélène!"
               And she sat down on the cushion at my feet, and, throwing her apron over her face,
                  sobbed bitterly, while Dora and I gazed at her, stupefied. Dead! Octave Bouvreuil
                  dead! It seemed impossible. I had dreaded some indefinable bad news, but never
                  once thought of death. Indeed, it was hard to associate death and the gay, bright
                  Octave Bouvreuil together. I tried to make the girl talk intelligibly, but the
                  poor creature was too stunned to know anything clearly; all I could gather was,
                  that Madame Bouvreuil was so occupied with Madame Eperveil and the professor that
                  she could not return home. Then out burst the girl again: "Oh, the poor Dame Bouvreuil, she bears it like a
                  Christian angel, as she is!"
               I hurried around to the chateau, not knowing in what way I could make myself of
                  service. Tante Cecile and Mr. Merle were already at the institution, and I found
                  Marie pacing the salon floor, pressing her temples with her hands; her large,
                  brown eyes were horribly dilated, and around them were deep dark rings; every
                  vestige of color had left her lips and cheeks, and every feature was pinched and
                  convulsed—but not one tear fell. When she saw me, she gazed at me wildly; then,
                  covering her face with her hands, and shivering from head to foot, she sank on a
                  seat, saying, in a hoarse, husky whisper: "Is it not fearful? And to die so
                  terribly!"
               I did not attempt to soothe her; I sat in silence beside her. What mortal sympathy
                  can soothe the grief we feel for the death of those we love? Resignation—patience!
                  What idle words! All that is human rises up resentfully under the blinding pain of
                  the blow death gives; the soul lies stunned, and the poor mortal beats helplessly
                  around.
               
                  
                     "But God gives patience; Love learns strength;
                     And Faith remembers promise."
                  
               
               Yes; and something like resignation comes at last—a quiet submission; but always,
                  always throughout life, there will be seasons when the heart will suffer over
                  again the sense of the loss as keenly as at the first moment of misery, and again
                  will come the blinding, reeling despair.
               I knew this; and I knew also how wickedly impatient all mortal soothings make the
                  truly suffering; so I sat, in silence, before her. At last, I thought I might
                  rouse her by making her talk, and I told her I knew nothing but that he was dead;
                  this made her give me, though unwillingly, what little detail they knew about the
                  sad affair. The exertion, however, was of service to her, and took away from her
                  glazed eyes the fearful, stony look which had alarmed me.
               The telegram was from Lord S., and merely contained these words: "Mr. Octave
                  Bouvreuil is dead. A pistol went off accidentally in his hands an hour ago, and
                  killed him." A few days after, there came sadder details. It appeared that Octave
                  had quarreled with some one of the friends of Lord S., who had insulted him; and
                  when Octave challenged him, the young man refused to fight him, giving, as a
                  reason, that he did not pay his gambling debts. When his second brought him back
                  this offensive answer, Octave was standing by a table, examining a pair of dueling
                  pistols. He listened to the answer without making any other reply than a sneering
                  laugh. His second stood by the table, and watched him, while he loaded the
                  pistols, without thinking of anything but of how they should arrange the
                  disagreeable affair. Octave put the pistol to his temple, saying, coolly:
                     "Eh bien, if Captain M. will not do me the
                  favor to blow out my brains, I suppose I shall have to do it myself."
               The words ended as the pistol was fired, and the unfortunate young man was a
                  horribly mangled corpse, before his startled companion fairly comprehended the
                  words. At first, the affair was represented as an accident; but, after the above
                  details were told, there was little doubt in any of our minds about the real
                  truth—horrible though it might be. We all believed that Octave, stung to the quick
                  by the double insult, and the thought of his disgraceful position rushing suddenly
                  over him, it had rendered him, for the instant, insane with anguish; in this state
                  of mind, he had rashly chosen his own selfish way of ending life and all its
                  difficulties. This sorrowful, story was mercifully kept from his family; no one
                  connected with him, except Tante Octavie, nearer than Mr. Merle, Tante Cecile, and
                  I, ever knew the sad truth; we never even told Marie.
               Poor, gay, brilliant Octave Bouvreuil! it was so hard to realize his being dead!
                  Many years have passed since that sunshiny May day of his death; and yet even now,
                  sometimes when I am listening to some passages of music, or walking in the grounds of Institution Eperveil,
                  or talking in the balcony window of my old salon at Madame Bouvreuil's, I start,
                  and think I hear his musical voice, his keen, sarcastic laugh; or in the twilight
                  I fancy I see his graceful form, moving to and fro, under the old Marron d'Inde,
                  smoking his meerschaum. Death is hard to realize when it takes place under one's
                  eyes—even when the glazed eye, and cold hand, and hushed lips of the one who never
                  failed to respond lovingly to you, lie before you; but when it takes place far
                  from you, there can be no reality in it to you; the world still contains the
                  living memory, even if the friend lie moldering in the earth.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIII.
               HÉLÈNE.
               SUCH a sad, sad week as it was, after the tragic news of that bright May day! Poor
                  Professor Bouvreuil lay as one stunned with a heavy blow, and Madame Eperveil
                  raged like a wild woman. The mother bore it better than any one,—the mother whose
                  violent outbursts could have been more readily sympathized with; and she moved
                  about calmly and seriously, encouraging and rousing her husband, and endeavoring
                  to assuage Madame Eperveil's fury, whose grief was like "one who mourned without
                  hope." Not a reproach fell from Madame Bouvreuil's lips,—not a word, reminding
                  them of her misgivings and remonstrances in the beginning; she who should have
                  been sustained, had to be a support; but Tante Cecile, Marie, and I did all we
                  could to help her. When alone with us sometimes, she would let Marie and me caress
                  her, and then give up gently to her grief; a quiet flow of tears was all; no
                  passionate, hopeless sobbing, only the mortal part of the mother mourned; her
                  calm, naturally well-poised mind soon righted itself, and enabled her soul to rest
                  on God.
               "Ah!" she said one evening, "how is Hélène ever to know this? I have tried several
                  times to write to her, but cannot summon up the courage. Poor child! I fear she is
                  very miserable in her dreary home. I do not like the tone of her letters; they
                  sound not only triste, but hard. She must come
                  home, and shall, directly this year's engagement is finished. She shall never
                  leave me again; she is the only child left to us, and we must guard her well."
               
               We were sitting in my little salon at the time. I heard a knock at the outer door;
                  Dora went out, then returned with Fanchette, who said Madame Eperveil was in
                  Madame Bouvreuil's salon, and wished to see the ladies.
               "She wishes to see Madame Bouvreuil," I said.
               "Oh no, mademoiselle!" answered Fanchette, stepping forward, "Madame Eperveil
                  inquired who was with madame, and then said particularly that she wished to see
                  all the ladies, madame and mesdemoiselles; she even called me back, and asked me
                  if I understood her."
               We stared at each other with surprise, but, without making any remark, we
                  proceeded to the salon. I had not seen Madame Eperveil since the sad news had
                  arrived. She looked very pale and gaunt,—like some great Norsewoman might, after a
                  combat. She bowed in a stately manner to us as we entered, and I noticed that she
                  had in her hand a letter, which she clutched rather than held. She was in the
                  deepest mourning; and as I saw the heavy, widow-like weeds, and the long, thick
                  crêpe vail hanging in heavy black folds around her, I remembered having heard
                  Madame Bouvreuil say that her grief for Octave's death was greater than she had
                  shown after any other trouble; and yet I knew she had buried her father, an only
                  sister, and an excellent husband, with a calmness amounting to sang froid; and these were all estimable people; while
                  to this nephew, whose whole life had been a disappointment and a mortification,
                  she was giving all the pent-up tears of her life.
               We sat down, but Madame Eperveil did not remain long seated; she paced up and down
                  the room with long strides. We looked from her to Madame Bouvreuil, who was
                  observing her sister-in-law's movements anxiously.
               "Octavie!" exclaimed Madame Bouvreuil, "what is the matter?"
               Did the mother's instincts forebode fresh trouble? Madame Bouvreuil's voice
                  startled us, it was so hot and hissing. Madame Eperveil came up to her
                  sister-in-law, and, taking, her hand with a trembling grasp, said in a hoarse,
                  choked voice, "Lolah, do not be alarmed; all will be, must be
                  well.
               "My daughter, my daughter!" shrieked the poor mother; then, starting up in the
                  middle of the room, she added, in a quick, low tone that struck to my heart,
                  "Where is she? I must go to her instantly. Oh, Octavie Eperveil! have you taken
                  both from me?" and fell senseless to the ground.
               I called Dora, and with her aid we lifted the poor afflicted mother on the
                     canapé. Madame Eperveil stood dumb; at last
                  she turned to me and said, "Mademoiselle Fauvette, Hélène has been very ill, but
                  they assure me she is better; she must be, for she is now on her way home. Here is
                  the letter I received a half hour since; be so good as to read it, for I see my
                     belle sœur is too much overcome to be able to
                  assist me with her counsel."
               There was a little struggle evidently going on, to hold fast to her old, grand
                  manner. I read the letter; it was from Mr. Landsnecht, and, like himself, cold,
                  dry, and proud; he seemed to wish to resent upon the whole family the little
                  trouble Octave had caused them, without feeling any sympathy for them as the
                  greatest sufferers.
               "Under present circumstances, madam," said the letter, after telling of Hélène's
                  illness, "Miss Hélène Bouvreuil cannot possibly remain in our family. I have
                  offered her her salary in full for the year, ending the coming September, the
                  whole of which she refuses to take; I have placed the balance, however, subject to
                  your order, at my banker's, and you can draw upon Genton & Co., in V., for it,
                  whenever you please. Of course, she is ignorant of the late disgraceful event; I
                  did not wish to have any unnecessary suffering going on under my roof, my family
                  having been sufficiently annoyed already. Miss B. will be accompanied to the
                  continent by my valet, George Wilkins. They will be at G. on the seventeenth,
                  where George will have to leave her, as he is en
                     route for Italy."
               
               "A fine specimen of manly feeling!" I thought. And these were Madame Eperveil's
                  grand, holiday friends; for whom she had sacrificed the comfort, and even
                  happiness of every one connected with her; and to be acquainted with whom she had
                  considered such an advantage. Step by step her punishments were coming thick upon
                  her; but how vainly I prayed, that her chastisements need not strike down the
                  guiltless and unoffending! By the time I had finished reading the letter, Madame
                  Bouvreuil had revived sufficiently to hear its contents; and the expectation of
                  Hélène's speedy arrival relieved somewhat the mother's anxious fears. That day was
                  the sixteenth of May, the next would be the day appointed for Hélène to be in
                  G.
               "And to-morrow night, dear Madame Bouvreuil," I said, "you will have your
                  daughter."
               But who was to go for her? It should be some one who could break the sad news to
                  her; for it would be not only cruel, but dangerous to let her arrive at that house
                  of mourning, and receive the news suddenly, in her delicate state of health.
               "Mr. Serin will go," said Madame Eperveil, "but——" and her voice faltered.
               She meant to say, that a man was not the proper person to perform such a delicate
                  office; and yet she felt too helpless to offer to go herself. She, the capable
                  woman, here in the real emergency of the family was useless.
               "Madame Eperveil," I said, "Mr. Merle, Marie, and I will go."
               "Thank you, thank you!" exclaimed Madame Eperveil, in a tone of unfeigned
                  gratitude; and so it was settled.
               The next morning, in the early boat, our excellent pastor, Marie, and I proceeded
                  on our way down the lake, to G. That glorious lake of ours! But we were both too
                  anxious, to notice our favorite points; in vain Mr. Merle tried to interest us.
                  The terraced vineyard slopes of the riante
                  Vaudois, and the rugged but picturesque sublimity of the Savoy Alps, on either
                  shore, were most beautiful to behold, as the young morning sun, in streaming down
                  out of the Rhone gorge, poured his rays full upon them; but we could not find
                  pleasure in looking at them. We even let the chance of seeing Mont Blanc go by
                  unheeded, when we passed Morges; we were too tightly reined up with indefinable
                  anxieties, to look patiently at anything. As we neared G., Marie said,—
               "Voyez vous, Fanny Fauvette, have you arranged
                  in your mind how we shall tell Hélène?"
               "No," I replied, "I always let such approaching disagreeabilities shape
                  themselves, and trust to le bon Dieu to help
                  me."
               As I spoke, I saw Mr. Landsnecht's valet on the wharf, looking out for us. Good,
                  kind, old George Wilkins! There was more of the real gentleman in his heart than
                  in a score of such as his would-be elegant master. He hurried up to, us as we
                  landed, and the mixture of extreme respect and deep sympathy which his manner
                  showed, was very touching.
               "Miss Hélène is at the Hotel de B.," he said, touching his hat. And as we walked
                  up to this hotel, which was near the landing, he added to me, "Ah, Miss Fauvette,
                  the poor young lady is very pining and weakly. She has been dangerously ill; my
                  wife, who nursed her, thought she never would raise her. She knows nothing of the
                  dreadful trouble yet, and I do not know how she can bear the hearing of it."
               My heart sank within me as we ascended the stairs to her bedroom, for George had
                  persuaded her to lie down soon after her arrival, which had been early in the
                  morning. She was lying on the bed when we entered, but sprang immediately into the
                  middle of the floor, with a sudden, quick bound. She greeted us with more haste
                  than tenderness; asked after her mother, and when the next boat would leave, all
                  in one sharp, feverish breath. She was very much altered; six or eight months in
                  an uncongenial home, leading a life of severe application, cut off from
                     affectionate companionship, and all
                  this following suddenly upon her disappointment with Kinnaird, had made sad havoc
                  in her health. Her cheeks were almost purple; and her eyes, formerly so tender in
                  their expression, looked like balls of fire; her merry laugh, her playful ways,
                  her graceful, gentle movements, were all gone. I never could have imagined Hélène
                  Bouvreuil fierce, but fierce she was now. Every nerve seemed throbbing loud enough
                  for us to hear its beat, so tightly was she strung up. Marie Merle looked at me
                  hopelessly, and while Hélène's sharp, quick words rattled out so unnaturally, she
                  leaned over me and said, "Oh, Fanny, how can we ever tell her? I am afraid
                     le bon Dieu is not going to help us.
               "I wish the boat would leave sooner!" exclaimed Hélène, fretfully, and walking
                  impatiently to the window. She, who used to be so patient and reasonable! "An
                  hour, do you say?" she continued. "Then three hours more to reach Peilz; and I am
                  so tired! No, no, no!" she answered, in a tone of extreme irritability, when we
                  urged her to rest on the bed. "No, I do not want to lie down. I just want to see
                  my mother, for I am so weary!" and she leaned her head on her hands, as if, poor
                  tired child, she wanted "to shut her leaves and be a bud again;" to go to sleep,
                  like a poor sick babe, on her mother's breast.
               We sat in silence, and I must confess that my courage was fast oozing out; I began
                  to feel that I had undertaken a duty quite beyond my ability to perform. Suddenly,
                  Hélène looked up fiercely, as she heard Marie Merle and me exchanging, in a low
                  whisper, our embarrassment as to how we should approach the subject.
               "Girls," she cried, in a shrill voice, "what is the matter? You look as if you had
                  some dreadful thing to tell me." Then, seizing me tightly by either wrist, she
                  continued, in a hoarse, thick voice, "Fanny Fauvette, you tell me; but oh, in
                  God's name, do not tell me any sad thing about my mother—that I cannot bear!"
               
                  Le bon dieu had helped us! Grievous as was the
                  sorrow, she dreaded a worse one, and that was a gracious help indeed. I do not
                  know what I said; but the words came to me, and in a little while she knew all. I
                  hoped she would weep, but she did not; she listened earnestly and quietly, her
                  brow knitting at times fiercely.
               "By the memory of your own mother, Fanny Fauvette, my mother is
                  not——" she gasped, and the veins in her forehead grew thick, like purple
                  cords.
               "Your mother, darling, is quite well; of course, she has suffered very much; but
                  she bears this severe visitation with more strength than your father or Madame
                  Eperveil; they are——"
               "Oh, never mind-them!" she interrupted me, impatiently, as if she did not care how
                  much they suffered,—nor did she; "but my mother, my mother! Oh, Fanny Fauvette,
                  take me at once to my mother!" and she leaned her hot cheek on my shoulder.
               "Poor child!" I said; but a short, thick sob broke my words, for Marie and I were
                  weeping enough for all three. Hélène lifted up her head and gazed wildly at us.
                  Fearing that our sobs had given her fresh alarm, I controlled myself, and added,
                  "In a few hours you will be with your mother, Hélène; her hopes, all her
                  expectations of future happiness in this life, are now centered in you. Last
                  evening we were talking of you, and she said almost these very words. At this
                  moment she is looking for you, and counting the instants to your arrival as
                  anxiously as you are."
               "Yes, take me to her," she said, vaguely. "My mother, my mother!" she murmured, as
                  if only half comprehending my words; and she leaned her face on my shoulder again,
                  and threw her arms heavily around me.
               All this was very hard for me to bear; so often, in hours of lonely, feverish
                  illness, I had felt that same mother-longing,—had cried out that same sad cry of
                  mother, my mother; but, alas, in vain! No living mother had been near
                  to answer swer. I drew the suffering
                  girl close to my breast, and wept bitterly. Presently she broke from me
                  impatiently, and paced up and down the room without noticing us. The servant
                  announced dinner. I went down to Mr. Merle, and told him of her reception of the
                  news of Octave's death, and her feverish, dangerous state. The old clergyman shook
                  his head.
               "Mais, mais, mais,—how I wish she was at home!
                  The boat will not leave for an hour yet." And we both looked at our watches, as if
                  by looking at them we hoped to hurry time.
               Some dinner was sent up into the bedroom, but Hélène steadily refused everything;
                  she walked up and down the room, or stood at the window, which looked toward the
                  quai de B., in silence. It was a long, weary hour. At last the boat bell rang, and
                  we hurried on board. The voyage was more silent than ours of the morning. Hélène
                  paced up and down the deck incessantly, leaning on Mr. Merle's arm, whom she had
                  received as if she had only parted from him yesterday.
               Thank God! suspense does end at last in some way. After a painful endurance of the
                  three hours, all of us looking stealthily at Hélène,—fearing the worst, and
                  uncertain what that worst might be,—the old towers of Peilz church rose up between
                  us and the northeast sky, its gray turrets and peaked roof lightened with the
                  rising moon. In a little while after, Hélène was in her mother's arms. "Now," I
                  thought, "she will surely weep." But no such blessed relief came; she hugged her
                  mother convulsively to her, held her off at arms' length, and looked at her with
                  those terrible, glaring eyes; then clutched her again, and kissed her with a
                  fierce moan, that sounded more as if it came from some wounded animal than from a
                  gentle, beautiful human being.
               "I cannot bear this," said Madame Bouvreuil at last; "the child does not know what
                  she is doing."
               Hélène did not notice her father, nor Tante Octavie; nor did she observe her
                  mother's anxiety, nor hear her words; she was just filled with one set, fixed
                  idea—the possession of her mother.
               "Hélène," said Madame Bouvreuil, taking her daughter by the hand, and looking her
                  steadily in the face, with as much calmness as she could command, "come with me
                  into my room, darling; let us bid good night to our friends; we are both tired,
                  birdie, and need rest."
               These last words were said so solemnly that they sounded in my ears like a
                  mournful presentiment, and I looked hastily toward Madame Eperveil, who was gazing
                  at Madame Bouvreuil with a mute expression of horror, which proved to me that the
                  words had found the same mournful echo in her heart that they had in mine. Hélène
                  looked at her mother for a few moments, as if she was trying to catch the meaning
                  of her words; then rose mechanically, as her mother put her arm about her slender
                  waist, and went straight out of the room, without noticing any one. A sad night
                  followed, and sadder days; the fever raged; and the poor girl, at last, grew
                  insensible even to her mother's presence. The sounds of the carriages, on the
                  street fronting the house, would set her to shrieking fiercely; she imagined they
                  were carrying her mother from her; so I proposed she should be taken into my
                  bedroom, which, being in the back part of the house, was free from all such
                  exciting noises.
               There she lay, unconscious of the change, noticing no one; not even the tender,
                  heart-broken mother, who gazed at her as if her whole soul would pour out in one
                  flood of mother-love to save her; nor the haggard, glazed-eyed Tante Octavie, who
                  would come into the room, and look at her for a few moments, then turn away with a
                  look and low moan, as if God's judgments were swift and keen. Night and day we
                  watched beside her, and examined Dr. Falcon's anxious look earnestly. At last she
                  ceased talking; she appeared tired out, and she rolled weakly to and fro, and
                  moaned sorrowfully. Toward nightfall one day, she fell into a sort of stupor, and I thought she was dying.
                  Dr. Falcon held her pulse a few moments; then, resting her hand softly on the
                  coverlid, he whispered, "If she sleeps now, she will be better."
               Madame Bouvreuil, who had been watching him eagerly, tottered; and, but for his
                  grasp, would have fallen to the ground,—she had fainted. He lifted her up in his
                  arms and carried her out of the room, and Marie Merle accompanied him. Shortly
                  after he returned, saying that she had revived, but that he and the professor had
                  persuaded her to take a little rest; accordingly he had given her a calming
                  draught, and Marie Merle was to stay with her. He then gave me the directions for
                  the night. He was forced to leave, as he had a patient who would probably need him
                  all night; but he would tell Fanchette where he was going, that I might send for
                  him if I saw any change.
               "If Hélène continues to sleep, I shall have much more hope," he whispered, "and
                  the longer that sleep is the better. I will tell Dora and Fanchette to keep
                  perfect silence in the house. I shall call in after I leave my other patient; but
                  I do not think you will need me before, for she is sleeping quietly and heavily
                  now." And the kind physician, after leaning over Hélène, and gazing earnestly at
                  her, nodded encouragingly at me, and left the room.
               Dora lighted the night lamp, for I was too trembling to do it; and her firm, neat
                  hand was always better in such little arrangements than mine. Then she went down
                  stairs, to keep the house still. If I needed anything I was to ring; but no one
                  was to enter the apartments without a summons from me, until the doctor's return.
                  The door closed noiselessly, and I was left alone with the poor sick girl, whose
                  hope of earthly life hung on a chance slighter than a thread.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXIV.
               BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH.
               THE veilleuse threw a strange, weird light over
                  the chamber; it was a porcelain lantern, and the little cup of oil, on which the
                  tiny taper floated, was inside of it; from an opening, about two inches square,
                  proceeded the faint light which touched some articles in the room with as clear
                  and strong a beam as its little strength possessed; the other rays were very
                  faint. Brave little taper! there it toiled quietly on in that sea of oil, doing
                  its very best; but that best was such a little. I looked from it on the beautiful
                  girl, swimming noiselessly on her sea, just hovering between life and death; and
                  she had done her best also; poor child! her best and strongest, which had been of
                  so little avail,—like this poor taper, apparently weak and powerless. I bent close
                  down to her; she lay so quiet, and in the vague light of the veilleuse the pallor on her face looked so like death,
                  that my heart stood still with apprehension; but a slight quiver of the soft,
                  tender lips, a faint thread of warm breath which crept from the pinched nostrils,
                  told me that life still hovered over the frail nest of the body. That beautiful
                  mouth! even all her sorrow and disappointment could not harden it; there were no
                  lines left around it by the misery she had suffered; no deep marks of the
                  spasmodic sobs wrung from her in the lonely hours of illness, when death seemed
                  too hard to bear, far away from her darling mother and all she loved. The lips
                  were not full and red, as they had been in the first, fresh flush of her beauty;
                  but still the exquisite expression hung around them, like a faint light,
                  flickering and playing within an alabaster vase; and the delicate form of the mouth, the
                  bow-shaped upper lip and soft curve of the under one, with the rounding chin,
                  showed even better than when those lips had been so rich and pouting in their
                  loveliness. Then the clear, transparent eyelids, with the tearful, tender
                  drooping, and the delicate tracery of veins in them; and the soft, velvety skin,
                  which seemed, in the quiet sleep, almost untouched by suffering; but the nose—part
                  Jewish part Italian in its form, as I have mentioned before—was the only feature
                  that showed the pain of mind and body the poor girl had suffered; the nostrils
                  looked pinched, and the bridge of the nose stood up clear and sharp. Her soft
                  chestnut hair was turned off from her temples, showing there also a faint tracery
                  of blue veins; one thick tress had crept out from the little cap, and lay in a
                  rich curl on her neck. In the tossing of her delirium, during the day, she had
                  unloosened the soft cap, and the fastenings of her night-gown, leaving part of her
                  beautiful throat bare; when she had fallen into the stupor preceding the sleep,
                  Dr. Falcon had said, as I attempted to close it, "Let her alone, mon enfant; the touch of a hand may prevent the sleep
                  on which depends so much."
               "Beautiful Hélène!" I thought; "and must such loveliness fall a sacrifice to
                  obstinate, wicked selfishness?" A slight noise in my salon, which was adjoining
                  the bedroom, startled me. The poor, anxious mother, I imagined, had awakened, and
                  had insisted upon coming to wait there the issue of the sleep. I arose softly, and
                  went to see who it was. What was my vexation to see entering the door, the hard,
                  tall figure of Tante Octavie! Of all assistants or companions, she was certainly
                  the last one I should have asked for. She held a shaded lamp in her hand, and was
                  busied in shutting softly the latch of the door; but I noticed that her strong,
                  firm hand trembled; and as she turned toward me, I saw that her chiseled face was
                  actually pinched and livid with the anxiety she felt.
               She must have noticed an expression of surprise and discontent on my face, for she
                  tried to smile affectionately; but it was a grim attempt, and she held out her
                  hand to me, in a strange, pleading manner, that went to my heart. I took it
                  quickly; it was very cold. That brave, strong woman! It hurt me to see her
                  standing there in such a position, and my first impulse was to put my arms around
                  her,—it was like embracing Mont Blanc; then, taking the lamp from her, and setting
                  it up on the brass top of the porcelain stove, I led her to the canapé, where I made her sit down. She submitted
                  willingly to my impulsive actions of tenderness, and rested her head for a few
                  moments on my shoulder, which seemed as small as that of a child, when compared
                  with her. It was so touching to see this hard, cold, stern woman not only
                  accepting, but almost asking for sympathy and kindness; and at my hands to receive
                  it,—the little, nervous Fanny Fauvette; for whose delicate health, and toward
                  whose little ways and peculiarities, she had shown so much impatience and even
                  cruel harshness.
               We remained silent for some time; and I began to feel awkward and startled at the
                  liberty I had taken, in treating her as my feelings had prompted; knowing, by sad
                  experience, how hard it was to approach such proud people, who are apt to take an
                  outburst of love sometimes as an affectation, or even, sometimes—so warped is
                  their nature—they receive it as an insult and humiliation. At last she lifted her
                  head, and, with every feature twitching with pain and sharpness, she asked in a
                  hoarse whisper, which thrilled through me, "She will not die?" She addressed me as
                  if I were a little high-priest of Providence, and knew the future. "Ah!" she
                  continued, "it is so hard to kill women; she will not surely die!"
               I raised my finger to my lips, as a caution against talking; then, speaking in a
                  faint whisper in her ear, I answered, "She is sleeping quietly; but we must not
                  make any noise, or we may disturb this sleep, on which her life depends."
               
               Tante Octavie drew me down to her; I knelt on the foot-cushion beside her, and she
                  approached her lips in the same manner to my ear, and said, "Suffer me to stay
                  here, Mademoiselle Fanny. I cannot endure to be so far from her. I will be quiet;
                  the mother has no remorse on her conscience; she can wait patiently and quietly;
                  but mine will not let me have peace. I shall go wild if I have to stay in the
                  other part of the house. Suffer me to stay here."
               This woman, accustomed from childhood to command, to order, and receive
                  unconditional obedience; who had treated me always with such chilling hauteur,
                  because I had dared to have an opinion of my own, dared to be nervous and
                  feminine, was now as submissive and imploring as a child to me! Her humiliation,
                  her acknowledgment of her remorse, almost broke my heart; it pained and grieved me
                  more than I could express; for although her obstinate determination to sacrifice
                  Hélène, and her senseless, wicked indulgence of the poor, wretched Octave, had at
                  the time made me feel bitter resentment, and wish every hard judgment possible for
                  her punishment, the suffering she had endured after the sad result was shown,— her
                  keen mortification and remorse, and the tender, softening effect it had produced
                  on her character,—melted all my anger; indeed, to see her grief, and hear her
                  self-condemning words, seemed wrong, and I hastened to show my respectful regard
                  and sympathy for this woman, whom I had almost hated some months before.
               "Certainly," I replied, almost forgetting the low, cautious tone of voice, in my
                  desire to show her all the attention my respect exacted. "Certainly; you may stay
                  here if you wish, dear Madame Eperveil. Stretch yourself out on this canapé and make yourself comfortable."
               And with affectionate constraint I made her put her feet upon the sofa, and extend
                  herself out at full length. I placed, a soft pillow under her head, and threw over
                  her long, iron-looking limbs a large shawl. She looked at me keenly, but I did not
                  now mind her look; her days of cold contempt and dictatorial lecturing were over,
                  and the tenderness and affectionate caresses of Fanny Fauvette, at which she had
                  so often sneered, were now grateful and refreshing to her. Poor Tante Octavie! As
                  I stood beside her, smoothing back from her high manly forehead the magnificent
                  tresses of her blonde hair, in which the silver threads were so thickly mingled, I
                  saw a large hot tear creep from under the sharp-cut eyelid; this was too much for
                  me to bear,—I stooped, and kissed Tante Octavie. She put her arms around me, and
                  held me for a few moments close to her breast; we said not a word to each other,
                  nor did we need to; we were good, strong friends for evermore; that tear had wiped
                  away all remains of Fanny Fauvette's resentment. Soon after I arose from beside
                  her, and went into the bedroom, to resume my watch by the sleeping girl.
               That long, long night! how it recalled a sadder night; a night of loving
                  watchfulness, that brought no mornings in this life to the watched; a night of
                  silent, heart-breaking farewell, when the mother floated off into eternity,
                  looking back longingly to her desolate child; no word, no moan; only a tight grasp
                  of the hand, a yearning gaze, which receded and receded in the distance, until the
                  poor wearied soul was released from the mortal cords of loving longing that held
                  it fast bound to earth, and was free! But, alas! the child was left desolate and
                  alone in life. Ah, Fanny Fauvette, memory is so keen! But swallow down thy agony,
                  child; take thy absinthe draught as God gives it; there has been no mother since
                  then to sit beside thee in life, and drink the bitter, leaving thee the sweet. 
                     
                        "Faisant pour toi deux parts, dans cette vie amère,
                        Toujours a bu l'absinthe, et t'a laissée le miel."
                     
                   Bury thy thin face in thy hands, rock with noiseless but keen agony to and
                  fro. Is it not hard to bear, child? Very hard! The sufferings of deep, true love,
                  are as bitter in their pain as keen remorse.
               
               Many times I would look up and see Tante Octavie resting against the door casing,
                  and looking earnestly at me; then I would remember that her remorse needed
                  soothing; for while the sorrow of love is too silent and deep for human
                  consolation, remorse is so biting, so active,—like a fierce blister on the skin,
                  it must be nursed and tended gently and carefully. So I would arise and go in to
                  the suffering woman, and persuade her to lie down again, while I soothed her with
                  soft caresses, and assured her of the well-doing of her niece. And well-doing it
                  was, for the girl was sleeping all through the night; a calm, gentle sleep; a deep
                  slumber of tired nature; the crisis was over, I felt sure.
               The brilliant mountain sunrise shot little crimson rays into the room, through the
                  crevices of the shutters, flecking fantastically the white window curtains. The
                  taper still burned patiently on,—a fit type of useful, quiet little things in this
                  life; trembling and wavering had been its light, but honestly it had toiled on.
                  Let thy light die out now little taper, thy work is over; we need thee no more,
                  for God's blessed sun has arisen.
               Hélène still slept; and Tante Octavie, worn out with keen, fierce anxiety, had,
                  toward daybreak—when entirely assured of her niece being out of danger—fallen into
                  a heavy slumber, under the magnetizing influence of my hands, smoothing down the
                  thick bands of her hair over her forehead. Outside the house, the busy swallows
                  chirped, fluttering around the old convent tower and the eaves overhanging my
                  windows. I knew that the long branches of the acacia, with its tender young
                  leaves, were waving graciously to and fro, and the lake rippling and glittering
                  under the first rays of the morning sun. I felt the sweet warm breath of spring
                  steal in encouragingly through the breaks and divisions of the shutters; life,
                  warm, loving life, flowed its precious current around me; there was the calm,
                  regular breathing of the sick girl, so sweet to listen to, and from the adjoining
                  room, even through the nearly closed door, came the sound of Tante Octavie's
                  slumber.
               A few minutes after, a low bustle was heard down stairs, and then the doctor came
                  up. He took his seat by Hélène's bedside, without saying anything to me, but
                  pressing my hand and patting me on the head. Tante Octavie crept into the arm
                  chair on the other side, and drew me to the little cushion at her feet, making me
                  put my head on her knees, while her large white hands rested on my temples and
                  cheeks with a loving ease, as if they had always practiced such gracious works of
                  tenderness; and there we sat, awaiting the girl's awaking. The mother stole in,
                  and stood at the foot of the bed, where the eyes of her daughter might first rest
                  on her, and Marie Merle stood beside her.
               At last it came, this blessed return to life and those who loved her so tenderly.
                  She opened her eyes languidly, gazed around as if bewildered; then, seeing her
                  mother's half smiling, half weeping look, she stretched out her arms feebly, and
                  burst into tears. Mother and daughter lay in each other's arms, while we all stole
                  quietly out of the room. Yes, all, even the skillful doctor.
               "They can do without any of us," said he, wiping his eyes stealthily; "nature,
                  mother-love shall do all, with God's help."
               And we turned quietly away from that bedroom, each one, drawing a long breath, as
                  if we felt that the avenging angel no longer hovered above the roof. God's swift,
                  sharp judgments were now lovingly averted, and sweet mercy, rather than stern
                  justice, reigned over us.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXV.
               THE CUP TAKEN AWAY.
               THOUGH the agony of suspense was over, and the dread of immediate danger passed,
                  still we did not feel secure. Any one who has ever watched during a dangerous
                  illness, knows so well the keen anxiety that comes after the first burst of joy,
                  when the crisis is passed. The breath of life seems so weak and faint, and the
                  feeling is that which one might have when looking at an unconscious child passing
                  over a swift, deep current, on a broken, swaying plank; or, the carrying of a
                  lighted taper in a long, dark corridor, through which a stormy night wind is
                  surging to and fro. But these anxious days passed, thank God! and then other days
                  came—days of convalescence; then came the sweet June weather, just bordering
                  enough on its blossomy forerunner, May, to retain its fragrance, and none of its
                  capriciousness. On one of these delicious days, Dora's strong arms carried our
                  darling out on to my gallery, and laid her in a brilliant-colored Mexican hammock,
                  which swayed quietly to and fro in the sweet morning breeze.
               Everything around us seemed pulsating with life. The little vegetable-garden
                  beneath us looked very promising, with its neat rows of all manner of green
                  things, which seemed to grow visibly. A small vineyard covered one slope in the
                  distance, not too far, however, to send us fragrant promises of the winy, autumn
                  fruit. The acacia waved its long, graceful blossoms through the air, and threw
                  down a snowy shower of the flower petals on the bridge walk; while the bright sun
                  crept in between its tender foliage and the thick branches of the Marron d'Inde,
                  and lay in breaks on the gravel-walk, and broken column, and old stone wall, and
                  did its best to beam very warm rays on Madame Bouvreuil's pet orange-tree, which
                  stood in a pretty stone vase, of the graceful Etruscan form, at the foot of the
                  walk. The swallows, 
                     
                        "Those busy masons of the eaves,"
                     
                   wheeled around the old convent tower, then darted off to the orchard on the
                  border of the lake, where stood a fruit-tree, the topmost branch of which was
                  formed like a cross, or at least so it appeared to me in the distance that my
                  balcony was from it. When I first came to Peilz I had noticed it; I had often
                  looked at it with gloomy forebodings, regarding it as a stern admonisher of future
                  visitations of grief. Sometimes my sorrowful fancy read it one way, sometimes
                  another. Often it waved before me in the golden violet sunset of summer, saying 
                     
                        "Thou canst not flee from thy cross."
                     
                   Then it swayed to and fro in the autumn winds, a red, flaming branch,
                  murmuring 
                     
                        "Thy cross, thy new cross, is nearly ripe: be ready."
                     
                   And, again, when I would feel more hoping and joyful, it seemed to whisper,
                  consolingly, as its red and yellow leaves fluttered down to the ground in a
                  November wind, 
                     
                        "See, I am fading with autumn; with me will fade thy last cross."
                     
                   And once, I remember, while I stood looking at it, thinking this, a pretty
                  little bird settled on it, knocking off its ruddy leaves; then he chirped a clear,
                  bright song, and soared off up into mid air. Those gloomy days were gone, I
                  trustee forever; but my "banner branch," as Marie playfully called
                  it, stood bravely up in the broad sunrays, covered with little budding leaves and some pink blossoms,
                  a bright, beautiful cross, telling me now of hope and faith, and giving me a
                  promise of gracious God-help, no matter what the burden might be. Two or three
                  little boats stood on the blue mirror of our lake, on which lay the broad masses
                  of sunlight, and they looked like 
                     
                        "Painted ships upon a painted ocean."
                     
                   The mountains of the opposite Savoy shore towered up, the snows still lay in
                  unmelting firmness on some of the peaks, and the ravines looked like long white
                  snakes, creeping and winding down to the lake. Hélène lay in a silence that seemed
                  refreshing; for the little sighs she drew once in awhile were accompanied by a
                  gentle, happy smile, as if they were luxurious sighs, indicative of sweet content.
                  Her mother sat, in my American rocking-chair, close beside her; and Marie Merle
                  and I leaned on the balcony bench, and talked of all manner of pleasant things
                  quietly together.
               "Where are you all?" cried a familiar voice from the salon; "the bird has flown,
                  and the whole aviary with her."
               "Not far, Tante Octavie," answered Marie, springing up to meet her. "We are here,
                  on Fanny Fauvette's gallery."
               "You there, too, mocking-bird?" said Tante Octavie, stepping out of the window
                  door on to the gallery. "Come here, girl," she said, "and kiss me. Marie Merle, I
                  believe I have not kissed you since you were a droll little serious-eyed
                  baby."
               Marie put her arms around Tante Octavie, without saying a word; but the hearty hug
                  and half-dozen kisses she gave her showed how deeply touched she felt by the old
                  lady's unwonted tenderness. I felt as if I wanted to do the same; but since the
                  night we had watched Hélène together, I had not dared to venture on caressing the
                  old dame; I was afraid she would think I wished to presume on her burst of
                  confidence and tenderness, wrung from her by the powerful emotion she was then
                  experiencing. I did not want to stop a good beginning of friendship between us.
                  She shook hands with us all, and kissed Hélène, affectionately.
               "Take this rocking-chair of Fanny's, will you not, Octavie?" asked Madame
                  Bouvreuil.
               "No, Lolah dear," she replied; "I am in a very good company beside this little
                  lady;" and she sat down on a chair which stood beside the low bench of the window,
                  on which I had seated myself, and she rested her hand familiarly on my
                  shoulder.
               Now, if Tante Octavie had been any one else I liked as well, I would have leaned
                  my head on her knee, which stood in tempting proximity to me; I felt a strong
                  desire to do so, but I thought "Affliction has caught her, and caged her, and
                  trimmed her nails, it is true, but she is only half tamed, may be. I will take
                  good care not to provoke the old lioness nature in her."
               It does not do to go beyond, or even be equal in tenderness to such people; it is
                  better to wait always for them to take the lead in sentimental matters; and yet,
                  day by day, I felt more and more drawn to Tante Octavie; and, as Tante Cecile
                  said, when I talked to her about it, it seemed as if she did also to me. It was
                  hard work, real self-denial, for me to keep my hands off of the hard, stern old
                  woman. I wanted to smooth her beautiful hair, to take her large hands in mine, and
                  rest my cheek on their fair, broad palms; I wanted to wait on her, and serve her,
                  and grew daily to watch for her coming, and detain her from going, when formerly,
                  the bare sound of her voice was enough to stop all pleasure for me. It is very
                  strange, how irresistible such cold, reserved natures prove, when they once let
                  themselves loose and soar up to love! Yes; I actually grew sentimental about Tante
                  Octavie, and used to find myself wishing sometimes that she might be right sick,
                  that I could have the exquisite pleasure of nursing her night and day.
               "She is a grand old woman!" I would say to Marie Merle and Tante Cecile, when I
                  would burst out in my enthusiastic
                  raptures over my new passion. "She has strong defects of character, I admit; and I
                  know I used to call her 'she dragon,' and all manner of hard names; but I shall
                  never do so any more; and it hurts me to think I ever did so, for I really and
                  truly love her. How true is the saying, 'the greater the trouble, the greater the
                  lion,' for see how grand her sorrow has made her!"
               Yes, this gaunt old Norsewoman was fast taking the mother-place in my heart, and
                  answering all its mother-want and mother-longing.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVI.
               A LETTER.
               WHO has not watched anxiously for the post hour? When one is far from dear
                  friends, with oceans and mountains between, the arrival of that messenger, of
                  grief 
                     
                        "Perhaps to thousands, and of joy to some—
                        To him indifferent, whether grief or joy,"
                     
                   is a subject of great interest. Many times since my arrival in Peilz, had I
                  felt this anxiety; with indefinable apprehensions, I had often awaited for the
                  arrival of the good man Scharff, our 
                     
                        "herald of the noisy world;"
                     
                   and then how sick at heart I would feel, when Dora would hand me the Journal des Débats, unaccompanied by any letter! A
                  thousand fears would spring up, of sorrow and may be death; then I would count
                  over the days since the date of the last letters, and reread them, with eyes full
                  of tears of loving longing, recalling the faces and forms of those who wrote them,
                  and their words of tenderness, and precious hours of the past, spent with them so
                  heedlessly; and then think, with desolate forebodings, of the distance between us,
                  the wide, impassable gulf of unavoidable separation yawning in the midst; and the
                  bridge which spanned it seemed, in the gray light of disappointment, to be the one
                  leading to another life. But when le brave homme
                  Scharff did bring a letter for me, how happy the sight of the little oblong
                  envelope made me! The direction was regarded with the same loving look that would have been given in times
                  past to the dear countenance of the one who wrote it; the handwriting grew into an
                  individual presence,—a true heart-greeting; the little cover would be impatiently
                  torn open, and I would rush rapidly through the contents, fairly choking with my
                  haste; then, after finishing it, go through it a second time, and a third; and
                  then go off quite alone in the woods, where neither friend, maid, nor dog could
                  hear me, or see my emotion, and read the dear letter out aloud,—trying to imitate
                  the voice of the darling writer, and live over in memory the sweet hours of the
                  past belonging to her.
               One morning Dora handed me the Journal des Débats,
                  and from its paper band fell three letters in my lap.
               "Fanny Fauvette," said Marie, "you are the only one among us that receives
                  letters. Once in awhile Henzler writes to me, and may be my cousin Minna, from
                  Breslau; but that happens only once in a year; and yet, you unconscionable
                  creature! if a month passes without bringing you at least two or three, you are
                  dissatisfied. Now you have three, cormorant, at one swallow; pray, do not let me
                  hear a murmur from you, if Scharff's tin box is empty, so far as you are
                  concerned, for two months to come."
               I laughed, and handed her the Journal, which I saw contained one of
                  Berlioz's excellent feuilletons, and begged her
                  to let that silence her sauciness. We were all collected in my room as usual, and
                  Hélène sat in the rocking-chair, looking very fresh, and calm, and pretty,
                  tricotting away industriously, as though she had never been ill; a sweet, gentle
                  languor in her voice and movements, was all that told of the sorrowful past;
                  nothing but the dark-hued folds of her mother's mourning garb were present, to
                  remind us of the sad visit death had paid to that house. I hastily looked at the
                  address of the three letters, before openings them, to see who they were from, and
                  as I did so, I gave a short exclamation, which was checked half uttered.
               "What is the matter?" asked Marie, dropping her Journal nal; and Hélène looked at
                  me with a gaze of sympathizing inquiry.
               "No unpleasant or disagreeable news, I trust, mon
                     enfant?" said Madame Bouvreuil, tenderly.
               "Oh no," I answered, laughing awkwardly at my bétise; and after I noticed they had ceased looking at me, I slipped
                  one of the letters, unopened, into my pocket. I read the other two, and read the
                     Journal, and then resumed my embroidery; and while Marie
                  continued her reading aloud of the last unfinished work of her favorite Emile
                  Souvestre, La Derniere Etape, I 
                     
                        "Wrought patiently into the snowy lawn,
                        ——buds, and leaves, and sprigs,
                        And curling tendrils, gracefully disposed;
                        A wreath that cannot fade, of flowers that blow
                        With most success, when all besides decay."
                     
                  
               
               But I did not touch the letter in my pocket. Strange, to be sure! As it was not
                  directed to me, however, I had no right to open it. I being the only one, as Marie
                  said, who received letters, Dora, without regarding the directions, had slipped
                  them into the band of the Journal, and handed them all to me.
               We reached the last chapter penned by the dying author, where the last words
                  seemed written as a consoling farewell to his friends, who were so unconscious of
                  their approaching great loss. Marie read, with touching emphasis, these words of
                  Monsieur Raymond to poor young Armand,— 
                     
                        "Va je te benis: que Dieu te console!"
                     
                   and closed the book, leaving the peaceful, fit conclusion, written by his
                  son-in-law, to be finished on the following day.
               We all talked over the curious management of the little thread of a romance,
                  running like a mottled purple and silver filament through the book; and the
                  mournful reconciliation tion of the
                  husband and wife; talking of them as if they were real, living beings, and
                  speculating upon their future prospects of happiness, which Madame Bouvreuil said
                  were much more to be relied on than many brilliant commencements of marriage. I
                  did not dilate on the subject, as I might have done, had not the unopened letter
                  laid restlessly in my pocket. Marie noticed that I was preoccupied; then all
                  checked the remarks rising to their lips, fearing, doubtless, that I had received
                  some perplexing information of which I was not ready to speak, much as I might
                  wish their sympathy. Marie tied on her hat, lingeringly; and as she kissed me
                  good-by, urged me to go home with her, describing a delicious afternoon of music
                  and lounging,—affectionately desiring to charm off the supposed annoyance.
                  Professor Bouvreuil's voice was heard down stairs, talking to the house dog, old
                  Turque; and Madame Bouvreuil folded up her sewing to go down, and prepare some
                  savory sauce, or nice pudding, for the dinner. After Marie left, I dispatched Dora
                  off with Beau, to take a walk in the beautiful noonday sun, around the old fosse;
                  and at last Hélène and I were alone. Then I got up from my seat, walked behind
                  Hélène's chair, and, taking the unopened letter from my pocket, dropped it in her
                  lap, kissed her lovely, soft cheek, and slipped quietly out of the room.
               Yes, the mysterious letter was for her, and had a variety of mail hieroglyphics on
                  it, making it look like one of Champollion's or Layard's Egyptian and Nineveh
                  pictures; and it came from Egypt, too, for I had caught sight of Alexandria amid
                  the other mail stamps; and it was, as I had supposed, really from Kinnaird,—dear,
                  good, true-loving Kinnaird! Of course I read the letter; and of course it was,
                  like all real love letters, delicious. He had heard of Octave's death, and,
                  forgetting his resentment, and the unkind treatment he had received, hastened to
                  offer his consolation; knowing, for his own frank, loving nature told him, how
                  acceptable and sweet such sympathy would be.
               "My darling," he wrote, "no one can blame you for reading a letter from me. I must
                  write to tell you how deeply I sorrow with you; how I yearn to be beside you, and
                  give you that comfort which no one in the world, I am sure, Hélène, can so well
                  give as I. I judge you by myself; and that is why I say this, my own pet birdie.
                  See! how the old, tender words rise up, for my heart is full of them, Hélène.
               "Poor Madame Eperveil! how keenly she must feel this blow; more than any of the
                  rest of the family, even your mother, darling; for Madame Eperveil loved Octave so
                  blindly, that it made her not only forgetful of others, but unjust. For you, and
                  for her, I feel the most sympathy; your mother has you still left to comfort her;
                  but dear Madame Eperveil, now Octave is gone, has no one. Good-by, Hélène darling;
                  remember, any time in the future you have only to write me one word to let me know
                  you wish for me, and I will come to you instantly. And if this life passes without
                  that summons, my own one, in eternity we shall meet; for when I die, beloved, if
                  it is half a century from now, my heart and my thoughts, my whole being, will be
                  as much yours, and only yours, as when we parted that sad day in the Hauteville
                  woods. Your own Kinnaird Graham."
               And this was the lover we had dared to call cold, and commonplace! "Hélène," I
                  said, "let me show this letter to Tante Octavie."
               The girl looked up at me, startled but pleased; her look was assent; so at sunset
                  I put on my hat and capuchin, and walked, with Dora and Beau, up to the grounds of
                  Institution Eperveil. I found Tante Octavie out in the garden, in close conclave
                  with Henri. "Here this thing," and "There that;" and "You had better look to this
                  bed," etc. etc.; both talking together, with that fluency and familiarity so
                  peculiar to the French superior and inferior; during which conversation neither
                  forgets his or her proper place. Beau sprang off, directly he saw Tante Octavie,
                  and ran to her, jumping around her as caressingly as he used to scold her; he remembered her late meat-offerings,
                  and kind words, the little egotist! and had forgotten his old enmities.
               "Tu es sage," said the old lady, receiving his charming little attentions
                  graciously. "Comme tu es gentil, beaucoup trop joli."
               "Yes," I thought, "you are both alike, dog and woman, in one thing: irresistibly
                  charming, when you deign to let us love you. I believe in my heart, your growling
                  ungraciousness only makes your softer moods, by contrast and from variety, more
                  attractive."
               "Well, Darmstadter," she said, laying her hand on the sturdy shoulder of my
                  laughing, happy Dora, "descendant of a great Saxon warrior, how are you
                  to-day?—and where is the little mistress?"
               Then, seeing me, she advanced toward me, and, making me take her arm, led me all
                  through the garden, showing me all the spring improvements, with Henri's
                  assistance, who was only too happy, the sly rogue, to be near my blushing Dora.
                  After that, we walked together down to the border of the lake, and watched the
                  brilliant sunset, and the fine rowing of the students, over twenty boats being on
                  the water; a real boat fleet, whose beautiful sails and streamers, with various
                  devices, and the graceful shapes of the boats, made the sight a very picturesque
                  one. After that, we went to the house, and had the sofa wheeled into the deep
                  balcony window, and her maid Victorine brought in 
                     
                        "the bubbling and loud-hissing urn,"
                     
                   from which I made for the old lady her tea; and while we sat over 
                     
                        "the cups that cheer but not inebriate,"
                     
                   we watched the deepening of the twilight, and the brightening of the stars;
                  and then, when the light meal was removed, I drew a foot-cushion to the old lady's
                  feet, and while her large, fair hands smoothed down my hair on my temples, and
                  rested in quiet caresses on my cheeks, she talked with me about America, and my
                  girlhood, and my mother; for Tante Octavie and I were growing closer and closer
                  knit together daily,—Naomi and her Ruth!
               While we were talking, we heard Mr. Merle's voice, and he, with Marie and Tante
                  Cecile, entered the room. So soon as I heard them, I hastily drew the letter from
                  my pocket, and, putting it in her hands, I said, "Madame Eperveil, there is a
                  letter Hélène received to-day, and wishes you to read."
               The next day Tante Octavie returned the letter to Hélène, in the presence of all
                  of us, when she came in to pay us a gracious morning visit, saying, as she did so,
                  "My child, when you write to Mr. Graham, give my kindest regards to him; and tell
                  him, when he is through his Egyptian wanderings, he must come back to his old
                  friends and home in Peilz."
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXVII.
               THE NEW HEAD MASTER.
               "BROTHER," said Madame Eperveil, one Sunday, after a dinner we had all been taking
                  with her, "old Mr. Serin leaves us at last. When the school closes, the end of
                  June, he will bid us all adieu, and go to his son in Germany. He has, however,
                  provided me with a very excellent person in his place."
               The professor bowed approvingly, and we all tried to look unconscious,
                  notwithstanding the memory of the past stood up vividly before us.
               This new head master comes very highly recommended to me," continued the brave old
                  lady; and the Messieurs Serin speak highly of him."
               "Is he a married man, Madame Eperveil?" asked Mr. Merle, wishing to put on a show
                  of facetiousness; "that is a subject that will interest the young ladies of
                  Peilz."
               "No, not married, but betrothed, and will be married in the autumn," answered
                  Madame Eperveil, smiling. "The head master of a school, if young, as this
                  gentleman is, must have some nice wife to keep his eyes and thoughts busy after
                  his work is done, in order to guard him from going daft about pretty
                  young girls, which would play the mischief with his usefulness to me. His intended
                  wife is said to be quite charming; and, from what I hear of her, she will be a
                  very pleasant member of our little social circle."
               "You have not told us his name yet, Tante Octavie," said Marie.
               "Nor shall I," said the old lady, hesitating a little; "I think I will try to
                  raise your curiosity; it will be something for you to speculate about."
               Then she changed the conversation, and we all hastened to talk of other things;
                  for though we had tried to be unconscious, and even affect playfulness, as well as
                  poor Tante Octavie, we all felt not only awkwardly, but a little melancholy.
               But though silent to them on the subject, she was not to her little Fanny
                  Fauvette. One sweet June evening, as I was making tea for the old lady, and she
                  was making love to Beau with sponge-cake, and he swearing eternal fidelity to her,
                  with wagging tail and cunning, winking eyes started clear out of his head with
                  selfish eagerness for the bon-bon; yes, on that
                  evening she told me all her plans, and I saw that the old lady was very happy. I
                  longed to throw my arms around the dear old iron image and ask her to let me tie
                  on her shoes for evermore; but I refrained, for I was afraid of provoking those
                  old claws of contradiction and tyranny; and yet, I was growing to love the brave
                  old dame so dearly, that I should have bowed, with all the cowardice of human
                  love, beneath those claws, as I did often to my naughty little egotistical Beau's
                  caprices.
               Weeks rolled around, taking from us the sweet, blossomy June; and the fragrant
                  grape-flower fell off, leaving the little green balls of the grappes to ripen in the warm July sun. On account of
                  the mourning of the family, there was no soirée that season. The first day of July
                  had always been the day of dismissal, and the one on which the grades of
                  scholarship were awarded. This year it had been deferred until the tenth, and on
                  that day the new head master was to be presented to the school, previous to their
                  dismissal, by Mr. Serin, when he took leave of his old pupils. On the ninth, Mr.
                  Wilkins (as we had heard was his name) was to arrive, and Madame Eperveil invited
                  us to take tea with her on that afternoon, and help her receive him. Madame Bouvreuil, Hélène, and I started early,
                  so as to enjoy the sunset from the boat-house shed belonging to the institution,
                  which was on the lake shore; and Marie and Tante Cecile were to meet us there.
                  While we were sitting quietly talking, Marie came up, saying: "Eh bien! the head
                  master has come; he is an ugly little man, with red hair and straw-colored
                  whiskers."
               "Who told you so?" asked Tante Octavie, coming, unexpectedly, around the corner of
                  the boat-house.
               "Mon Dieu, Tante Octavie!" cried Marie, starting; "how you frighten one!"
               "Who told you that Mr. Wilkins was an ugly little man, with red hair and
                  straw-colored favoris?" persisted Tante
                  Octavie.
               "Our maid Emilie, who saw him arrive," answered Marie, laughing, and coloring.
               "Emilie is a prying, gossipy maid; and you are a very undignified young lady to
                  accept information from such a source."
               She looked very gracious and smiling, although her words sounded harsh.
               "But come," she continued, putting her arm kindly around Marie's waist, "let us
                  all go up to tea, and I will introduce you, mocking-bird, to this red-headed Mr.
                  Wilkins, and his betrothed bride, who has been kind enough to accept my
                  invitation, and come to pay me a visit."
               They all stared at this piece of information, but not a word was said in reply, as
                  we followed Tante Octavie up to the grounds of the institution. Tante Octavie
                  stopped here and stopped there, and made us admire one flower-bed and then
                  another; and then insisted upon looking at the vineyard; and she made Hélène walk
                  on one side of her and me on the other; she was in no hurry to go into the house,
                  wishing to give, as she said, the young lady time to rest, and prepare herself for
                  meeting so many strangers.
               The last red rays of the sun were dancing on the lake, and tipping the edges of
                  some slight clouds floating over the blue sky, when we entered the cheerful salon.
                  A gentleman stood in the deep window, and, as he advanced to meet us, Marie Merle
                  screamed out with surprise, while Hélène leaned on her aunt's arm, trembling
                  violently.
               "Voila, mocking-bird!" said Tante Octavie; "this is the Mr. Wilkins with red hair;
                  and here," she said, putting Hélène's hand in his, "this is his betrothed, whom I
                  promised to present to you. I am very sure both Mr. and Mrs. Graham will be highly
                  valued in our social circle."
               Yes, it was Kinnaird Graham; and Tante Octavie had written to him, asking his
                  forgiveness for her injustice, and begging him to accept the head mastership,
                  during Hélène's dangerous illness. Her letter he received weeks after he had
                  written to Hélène. We were all very happy. After tea, we walked up and down the
                  balcony, and Kinnaird talked to the Professor and Mr. Serin about his Egyptian
                  travels, while Hélène and Madame Bouvreuil listened with a gentle, quiet
                  contentment, that told how exquisitely happy they felt. Mr. Merle grew playful,
                  and, coming up to Tante Octavie, he said: "It is very unjust, Madame Eperveil, for
                  you to be so partial. You find a handsome husband for Hélène, and neglect all the
                  other young spinsters; now, your favorite Fanny Fauvette, for instance, I should
                  have supposed you would have preferred her for the head master's wife."
               I answered back some merry sauciness, and then he walked, with Tante Cecile and
                  Marie, up the balcony, to look at the moon rising over the Vaudois mountains.
               "Fanny Fauvette," said Madame Eperveil, half musingly. I turned, and looked at
                  her. She was sitting on the sofa in the deep window arch, and I fancied, as the
                  moonlight stole in through the leaves of the woodbine, and played over her face
                  and rich, fair hair, that she looked a little wan and worn. The dear old lady! she
                  had endured fierce suffering and fierce struggles womanfully, and had come out of
                  the moral combat gloriously victorious. "The greater the trouble, the greater the lion!" This fine saying
                  came to my memory as I looked at her, and saw its verification in her. My whole
                  being pulsated to bow down before her, and say, "Let me be thy handmaiden,
                  mother!" "Fanny Fauvette," she repeated, and, putting her arm about me, she drew
                  me down close to her. I knelt on the foot-cushion at her feet, and looked up at
                  her; we were quite alone in the window embrasure. "No, child," she continued,
                  looking earnestly down into my face, which she held between her large, white
                  hands. "No, child; I should feel very sad and lonely if you were to marry. See, I
                  am so naturally selfish, that I cannot help, because I love you so fondly,
                  striving to monopolize you. I would keep you all for myself;" and she tried to
                  smile playfully, but her mouth quivered, and broke the smile.
               "Never fear, Tante Octavie," I answered, in a voice that trembled with the deep
                  love I felt, "I shall never marry."
               "And will you be my child?" asked the gaunt, strong old woman, trembling with
                  emotion.
               "I will, so help me God!" I replied, solemnly; and in the same instant I lay in
                  Tante Octavie's arms, and was clasped tight to her breast, feeling, at last, at
                  home, and no longer alone in life.
               She kissed me fervently again and again, and a large, round tear, a second tear,
                  rolled down her cheek, hallowing the contract; and this is how I came to be Tante
                  Octavie's daughter.
            
            
               CHAPTER XXVIII.
               MARIE'S COMPENSATION.
               HÉLèNE and Kinnaird Graham were married a few weeks after, in order that they
                  might have time to make a quiet bridal tour to the lake of the Four Cantons,
                  before the close of the vacation. At the wedding, Madame Eperveil insisted upon
                  the family's laying aside their mourning. Marie Merle and I were bridesmaids, and
                  the amiable, blushing young Gardner, and Serin, Jr., were groomsmen. It was a
                  quiet, happy wedding; the ceremony was performed early in the day; and Tante
                  Octavie gave a dinner, under the trees, to all the dependents of the Institution;
                  while the friends of the family called in the afternoon and evening, to pay their
                  respects and congratulations to the newly wedded pair. The day after the wedding,
                  they left, with Professor and Madame Bouvreuil, to make their little wedding
                  journey.
               In the autumn, after Kinnaird had taken his place as head master, Tante Octavie
                  invited Marie and me to accompany her on a visit to Paris. We spent six weeks in
                  that charming city, visiting all the places made familiar to us by books. We had
                  all visited Paris before; but Marie and I agreed never so pleasantly. Tante
                  Octavie, so filled with information, with exact and available knowledge of the
                  events and characters of history, was an admirable cicerone for two such women as Marie and me. We showed our
                  appreciation of her qualities so enthusiastically, that the old lady became
                  enchanted with her new vocation, and made a resolution of visiting Paris with us
                  every spring, until we should know all the points of interest—buildings, galleries, and
                  environs—fully; and that resolution, I am happy to say, the dear old lady has had
                  health and strength to perform.
               Marie's visit to Paris, in the autumn I speak of, had a great influence on her
                  future life as an artist. That visit laid the foundation of a fame which is now
                  European. At her first performance before the great artist-critics of Paris, their
                  approval of, and enthusiastic admiration for her execution and genius, were
                  unanimous. Henzler happened to be in Paris, with his company, at the time, and he
                  invited her to his hall, to play with them some compositions of Mozart, Beethoven,
                  Chopin and others, which she had wished so often to execute with an orchestra. We
                  went several times, and Marie played without embarrassment, for there was no
                  audience, save, once in awhile, a chance friend or two who might drop in. One
                  morning we were there, and Marie played various things, among them the "Concert
                  Stück" of Weber, and a symphony of R. Schumann, of whose music Henzler was an
                  ardent admirer. As it was the first time I had heard this symphony, it sounded
                  confused to my ears. The wild, bold thoughts of such an artist-poet as Schumann
                  are difficult to comprehend at first sight and hearing; they must be studied
                  closely; and even then, if the mind and capability of appreciation are not happily
                  corresponding in grandeur, the great poetic thoughts may remain unknown.
               Some gentlemen entered, after they had finished this symphony, and Henzler seemed
                  occupied in conversation on some business, at the other end of the room. Marie
                  remained at the piano, to look over some manuscripts Henzler had given her; some
                  new compositions of his, that he wished her to examine, and give him some
                  suggestions and criticisms upon. Tante Octavie had left us, to attend to some
                  business matters. I amused myself by listening to Marie, and turning over the
                  music and books of Henzler's fine musical and critical library, admiring the
                  arrangement of them; each great composer being arranged according to date, and
                  every critical work or romance on his works, or suggested by his life, being
                  placed in the same case with his music. These cases were beautifully designed, in
                  black walnut; bearing artistic and appropriate carvings, with the bust of each
                  composer surmounting each case. These cases were placed on each side of the hall,
                  running from the amphitheatrically-arranged orchestra, which occupied the east end
                  of the room. The Beethoven case was on a line with the piano, and I stood turning
                  over the book of sonates, hunting for the one in Ut dièze mineur, Sonate quasi Frantasia, Opus 27, dedicated to
                     Mademoiselle La Comtesse Giuletta di Guicciardi. I had just that
                  moment been reading Beethoven's love letters—if the three fragments of burning,
                  broken sentences can be called letters—written to this lady, and I wanted to look
                  again at the musical rendering of this love tragedy. These passages in the letters
                  were in my memory, as my eyes ran over the notes of the sonate.
               "My angel, my all, myself! If our hearts were still near together,
                  that would be indeed my life. Great as is thy love for me, mine for thee is still
                  greater. I can only live entirely with thee, or not at all. How I long for thee,
                  with tears, my life!"
               So wrote the great, solitary Beethoven, when completely over the threshold of
                  young manhood, to the only woman he ever loved passionately. Then, after these
                  love letters—which had burst from him like broken sobs of a feeling too deep for
                  word-utterance—he celebrated his farewell to that love, in this great sonate; for
                  the Comtesse Giuletta Guicciardi never became his wife; she married a Comte
                  Galenberg. In 1828, seventeen years after this love-dream had passed away,
                  Beethoven—then fifty years of age, and very, very deaf and poor—sent a pupil of
                  his to ask permission of the nobleman who was the director of the Théâtre
                  Impériale, at Vienna, to have his Fidelio performed. This nobleman was Comte
                  Galenberg. The messenger returned; and after giving a report of this errand—which
                  was a useless less one, as the
                  permission was refused—Beethoven asked him, in writing, if he had seen the
                  comtesse during the visit, and added, "She loved me once, more than ever she loved
                  her husband. She married the comte, then sought me, weeping; but I repulsed her,
                  for I despised her."
               Poor Giuletta Guicciardi! This aristocratic girl, brought up in an artificial
                  atmosphere which caused her to have numberless imaginary wants, and which
                  surrounded and bound her by chains of social custom and prejudices stronger than
                  fairy adamant—which is always the strongest thing, known or unknown—met Beethoven,
                  when he was about thirty and she eighteen, and loved him. Silly child! what had
                  she to do with love, or with a poor plebeian artist? But she dreamed her delicious
                  love dream, and no one knows what she may have suffered when she wedded a Comte
                  Galenberg; nor what agony she must have felt when she sought her artist lover, to
                  explain her painful position to him, and received from him a repulse that showed
                  his bitter contempt. Nothing is known of her future; whether the love of her youth
                  kept her pure in her court-life; whether the memory of that cruel contempt soared
                  and withered up all yearnings for love and tenderness in her poor, sorrowing
                  heart. We may all hope so, at least, for the honor of womanhood.
               But all the world knows the future of the obscure lover. He remained poor; he grew
                  deaf; he led a gloomy, solitary life; and died a lonely, old man; but
                  acknowledged, by all Europe, as the greatest instrumental composer the world has
                  ever known; and commemorative of this heart episode in his life, are left three
                  passionate love letters, and this sonate, called the Moonlight Sonate, because
                  Rellstab compared it to a bark visiting the savage sites of the lake of the Four
                  Cantons in Suisse, by moonlight.
               Berlioz, in his Voyage Musicale, p. 362, gives a fine description of this sonate,
                  and of Liszt's manner of playing it. In the opening passage of this description,
                  he says: "There is a work of Beethoven, known by the name of the 'Sonate in Ut
                  dièze mineur,' the adagio of which is one of those poetical conceptions that human
                  language does not know how to express. The means of action are very simple: the
                  left hand stretches out full chords, of a character solemnly sad, and the duration
                  of which permits the vibrations of the piano to extend themselves gradually over
                  each one of them. Above, the inferior fingers of the right hand play, in arpeggio,
                  a design of obstinate harmony, the form of which scarcely varies, from the first
                  measure to the last; while from the other fingers is heard a sort of lamentation,
                  the efflorescence melodique,—the melodic
                  blossoming of this somber harmony."
               No one living can play this sonate equal to Liszt. "Liszt," says Berlioz, "hurries
                  and slackens the measure, troubling thus, by passionate accents, the calm of this
                  sadness, making the thunder rumble in this cloudless heaven, darkened only by the
                  departure of the sun."
               De Lanz, in his admirable analysis of this sonate, says of this passage: "The
                  melodic design of the adagio is confided to the Sol dièze,—the octave of the Sol
                  dièze of the harmony; a group of a dotted crotchet, (Sol dièze,) followed by a
                  double crotchet, leads to what Berlioz so fitly calls the 'efflorescence melodique;' a song, penetrating as a perfume
                  proceeding by minims,—large notes, whose heads hang like flower chalices, heavy
                  with the pure fresh dew poured into them by the dreamy gray vested hours of a
                  balmy quiet night. One feels that this ineffable opening, ought to be independent
                  of arpeggios, that it ought to float freely over
                  the whole as a horn soars over a subdued, discreet accompaniment. Now, there is
                  only the little finger of the right hand to articulate this plaint, and this poor
                  finger is sorry enough to carry the burden, which is the more difficult, because
                  the other fingers of the hand are bent over the arpeggios—a circumstance which
                  takes away from the little finger much of the independence it ought to possess. It
                     happens then, at the moment when the
                  dotted note should vibrate, as it ought, to phrase the melody, the thumb points
                  from its side, as if by pure fraternal love for the little finger, to the Sol of
                  the arpêge, and doubles in the
                     medium the entrance of this principal idea, thus, as you may well
                  believe, injuring the effect of the song.
               "A means of escaping this difficulty would be to divide the three Sols dièze, and
                  the entrées of the same nature, between the
                  third and little fingers, as often as possible; but this cannot always be done;
                  and, moreover, this means presents, the danger of spreading discord in this
                  household of Sols. Stop raising the hand, spread it out like a fan on the
                  key-board of the piano, and let the little finger fall as high as it can. Liszt
                  made me observe this difficulty, in 1828. Youth is always right, so, of course, I
                  objected to his suggestion, not being able to believe that the soi-disant excellent masters of the piano would allow
                  me to do what took, in my eyes, the proportions of a gross musical sin. I thought
                  I could cheat him by neglecting, apparently, to adopt it. Liszt said nothing; but
                  at the approaching commencement of the phrase where the octave of the
                  accompaniment sounded, he seized my thumb as one would the foot of a May-bug, and
                  grasping it as in a vice, the Sol dièze sounded out free and clear on his 'Erard,'
                  like the silvery-vailed, sad note of a horn. 'There,' said Liszt, quietly and
                  resolutely, 'that is the way you ought to hold your thumb.'"
               While I was reading over this sonate, and also Berlioz and De Lanz's descriptions
                  and analyses of the various passages, Henzler came up to me. "B. is here," he
                  said, "and also quite a little knot of critics. One by one they have heard Marie,
                  without her knowing it, and by their praises of her peculiar poetical expression,
                  have roused B.'s curiosity; so he has come this morning to judge for himself. Make
                  her play a solo, as if for you alone. She is unconscious of her audience. I told
                  her just now, when I excused myself to her, that they were some persons who had
                  called to see me on business."
               I was pleased with Henzler's delicate forethought, for I know well enough if Marie
                  played with the consciousness of B.'s presence, she would be so nervous she would
                  not do herself justice. This sonate, in Ut dièze mineur, she played remarkably
                  well; she used the Liszt fingering; and her Chopin-like expression, her own poetic
                  conception of the composition made her execution of this sonate—which Berlioz says
                  he does not believe six living pianists can play properly—almost faultless, to my
                  ears; therefore, I immediately selected this as the solo for her to play before
                  the celebrated critic. I stepped up to the piano, carrying Schindler's Biography,
                  and the volume of sonates in my hands. I made her read to me from the German, the
                  passages from the love letters I have quoted, commencing with, "Mein engel, mein
                  alles, mein leben!" Then we dwelt tenderly on this episode in the life of the
                  Dante-like musician. "Play the sonate for me," I said, placing the music on the
                  stand before her.
               Her large brown eyes were already dilating with feeling, showing that the whole
                  stream of her thoughts flowed in the golden channel of poesy, which is requisite
                  for the proper expression of this sonate. She commenced without any hesitation. A
                  curtain of Tyrian dye and golden weft seemed to rise, as she opened the adagio,
                  slowly enough to show its brilliant light and solemn hues. Then was seen the tomb
                  of buried hopes, the grave of love; but as the chord of Mi major sounded, one
                  heard the rustling of flowers, and felt the fragrance of their sweet breath.
                  Though bitter tears might be shed over the tomb, though the heart might be almost
                  crushed with the weary weight of a lonely life, the grand solemn chords of the
                  base spoke of courageous self-reliance, of the strength and fortitude of a truly
                  great heart. The treble told its lamentations in passionate accents; but no human
                  consolation can be accepted, and the deep, slow base repeats this to the treble;
                  not even human sympathy; the grief must
                  be borne in silence and alone. It is a sadness without limit, without remedy; the
                  abyss of separation can never be bridged,—a raging torrent rolls between. The soul
                  clambers with patient firmness up the painful ascent, without one consoling
                  friend, and seeks the solitude of its sorrow, finding at proud content in its own
                  self-support, its own heroic courage.
               Liszt has named the second morceau of this
                  sonate "a flower between two abysses." One day De Lanz played this passage before
                  Liszt, in a light manner, as if it was only a small difficulty. "That is easy, is
                  it not?" said Liszt, coolly. De Lanz, with all the courage of eighteen, replied
                  pertly, "Yes." "How!" cried Liszt, "I say NO! It is a passage over which an artist
                  can spend his life."
               While Marie played it, B. approached the piano, and I felt bewildered as I looked
                  at the great critic; but the expression of his face; the absorbed look; the
                  surprise, lost in gratification, which I read in it, made me so happy that I
                  almost sobbed with pleasure. He leaned softly forward, and watched her closely as
                  she commenced the second part of the trio, where she used Liszt's fingering. The
                  march of the base has to be bound in the manner of two violoncellos. She took,
                  according to Liszt, the first chord, Re natural, La bémol, with the little finger
                  and first of the left hand; the second chord, Re bémol and sol, with the third
                  finger and thumb; the third chord, Ut and Sol bémol, with the little finger and
                  first; the fourth chord, Si natural and Fa, with the third finger and thumb, thus
                  binding exquisitely this collection of chords.
               The finale was like the burning waves of lava flowing from Vesuvius; the flame
                  darts up from the summit of this glorious mountain sonate; the thunderous
                  explosion sounds; then there is a halt; and then pours from the volcanic breast of
                  the poet, all the solitary moan over the bitter absinthe draught contained in his
                  dark goblet of life.
               After she had finished the last measure of the sonate, her hands rested on the
                  keys of the piano, and she sat in sweet but solemn dreaminess, looking apparently
                  at the music, but, in reality, far off into a vague and misty future, she dreaded
                  to call her own. She was recalled to a consciousness of our presence, by a burst
                  of applause from the crowd of musicians and artists who had assembled behind B.
                  Henzler immediately stepped up and presented B. to her. Her look of surprise, her
                  air of reverence and maiden modesty, was so beautiful that B. was evidently
                  touched with it. The few words of hearty praise he gave her, made Marie almost sob
                  with emotion. She sat down on the chair, trembling from head to foot.
               "My dear young friend," said B., taking her little frail hand kindly in both of
                  his, "you are an artist and a poet; you not only execute well, but you show your
                  poetic, creative powers, in the exquisite expression you give to the music."
               This was the commencement of future triumph; the Swiss pastor's daughter
                  henceforth owned the musical world for her home, and became a compeer of those
                  great women, Wieck and Pleyel, whose fame she had looked out on, as one looks up
                  at a brilliant star, without dreaming of ever possessing such a glory.
               And this was Marie's compensation. God had denied her wife and mother duty and
                  love, but he gave her the great world of the Infinite to soar in,—the command of
                  the sublime tone-tongue, and the fame of a true artist-poet.
            
            
               
               CHAPTER XXIX.
               HANGING ENDS.
               I HAVE not much more to say, even of Tante Octavie and her little daughter.
               "Born to me in my old age," she says of me, with a mixture of solemnity and
                  playfulness that is very touching in the dear old lady.
               I went to live with Tante Octavie soon after our sweet troth-plight—Dora, Beau,
                  and I, the whole little trio. Dora had to yield up to Henri a few months after,
                  but she is only the distance of the left avenue from me, where the pretty cottage
                  of the gardener stands. I can see its peaked roof from my window now. A nice, tidy
                  little cousin of Victorine took her place with me, whom Beau, for a long while,
                  ruled tyrannically, running off whenever he could to Dora's cottage, and
                  frightening the poor child half out of her wits, making her think he was lost or
                  killed. Tante Octavie gave me a comfortable suite of rooms in her fine large
                  house, saying: "Child, thy Naomi will not be too selfish. 'See, thou canst be
                  alone whenever it pleases thy independent little ladyship so to be."
               But I do not choose to be alone; I choose to wait on and live evermore with my
                  mistress-mother. Some years have rolled around. Hélène and Graham have taken the
                  entire charge of the college, and it is now seeing its brightest days. Tante
                  Octavie gives advice at times, but has resigned gracefully the control to these
                  younger and capable hands. She is beginning to look a little bent, dear old lady!
                  There she stands, as I write, talking to Henri about that flower-bed beneath my
                  window. Brave old woman! Her fine high brow is covered with silver threads, 
                     
                        "Those blossoms of the grave;"
                     
                   and, as I look at them, and repeat this line from the old ballad, my heart
                  grows very full at the thought of her passing away from us.
               Tante Octavie's age is very golden; she is gentle and gracious; all the old
                  harshness and tyranny of her nature lie buried in poor Octave's grave! She gives
                  and receives tender caresses; and loves well, at nightfall, to rest on that couch
                  in the deep window, and let me, her daughter, smooth the silver locks from off her
                  broad, high temples, and rest our loving cheeks together; while, in looking at the
                  setting sun and rising moon, we dwell charitably and lovingly on our higher hopes
                  and faith. The womanly author of "John Halifax" says, "to love" is the verb we are
                  most prone to conjugate in youth; but that we discover, after awhile, that it is
                  by no means the sole verb in the grammar of life. But many of us, like Tante
                  Octavie, do not learn to conjugate that blessed verb until late in life. We go
                  through all the inflections of "to do" and "to be" conscientiously and painfully;
                  and sometimes it is not until God teaches us the stern conjugation of "to suffer,"
                  that we learn the sweet 
                     knowlege
                     knowledge
                   of this truest and best "word."
               I have never finished my novel, and fancy I never shall. I have only arrived half
                  way in it, at the second marriage of my heroine with her lover-husband, Philibert
                  of Savoy. Two large volumes of MSS., bound in superb style, look down on me from a
                  conspicuous place in Tante Octavie's library. She values them, and I am content
                  with that fame; I wish for no other. I have no longer the sorrowful need that
                  pressed in on me when I commenced it. At the sad, struggling period of my life,
                  when I first came to Peilz, I was suffering from the bitterest kind of spiritual
                     poverty— a lonely heart; that need
                  has gone by, and I am now "passing rich" in that heart-wealth, home love.
               I hold with that wise, solemn, good man, Southey, that literature is not properly
                  the business of a woman's life; and where she is so blessed as to have her true
                  duties of home-life to occupy her, she has not only no time, but no need for the
                  constant attention it requires. Only sorrow and solitude, or necessity, should
                  make a woman depend upon her intellect for resource and occupation. Her true
                  sphere is home-life, and in the exercise and development of that part of her
                  nature which relates to her heart rather than to her intellect; and, when needy
                  circumstances or marvelously brilliant genius drive her out of this life, it is a
                  sad thing, no matter what golden meed of fame she may reap. A great and good
                  woman, whose fame, and genius, and excellence seem equal, has made this solemn
                  confession:
               
                  
                     "Oh, my God!
                     Thou hast knowledge, only Thou;
                     How dreary 'tis for woman to sit still,
                     On winter nights, by solitary fires,
                     And hear the nations praising them far off."
                  
               
               Thanks to Tante Octavie and "our sweet family," my winter nights are not, and
                  never will be solitary. And still greater thanks to God that he did not visit me
                  with the need, or bestow on me those "gracious gifts of genius" which might have
                  prompted or tempted me to seek my compensation in other pursuits than the sweet,
                  quiet ones of home. Not wife nor mother love, it is true, is mine; but friend and
                  daughter love has been poured out on my heart "in perfect purple fullness;" and,
                  in the autumn of my years, to know that I am loved, and needed by those I love,
                  will give me greater happiness than the knowledge 
                     
                        "Of nations praising me far off."
                     
                  
               
               Professor and Madame Bouvreuil are also happy, quiet, and contented; "begirt with
                  growing infancy," I whisper to myself, as I see their pretty grandchildren playing
                  around them. Mr. Merle and gentle Tante Cecile rejoice, with modest and grateful
                  pride over our dear Marie's wondrous fame, and luckily do not notice the calm
                  solemnity that creeps apace, year by year, over her, as the laurel leaves bud
                  around her beautiful Sappho brow.
               And now, I am through. I have no tragedy to relate; no horrid event to chronicle,
                  except, if I do not close my recital soon, I may have to write poor dear old
                  Beau's epitaph. Yes, Beau is old, and, like Methuselah, he has out-lived even the
                  age, not of men, but of very venerable dogs. There he lies, on his scarlet
                  cushion—Tante Octavie's last birthday present to him; poor fellow! looking down at
                  the old lady sagely, as if he could tell her, if he chose, something about those
                  flowers. And then he gazes with a solemn air over at the old Savoy Alps, behind
                  which the sun is slowly sinking, and he snuffs faintly the soft, spring west wind.
                  He is very old, and silver hairs are plentifully sprinkled in those long ears once
                  so famous for their "raven silken inches;" but, like Tante Octavie's, his old age
                  is golden and amiable. He wags his tail, and puts out his paw for a caress. Yes,
                  dog, I will stop, and come to you; so, reader, Beau and I bid you good-by.
            
            THE END.
